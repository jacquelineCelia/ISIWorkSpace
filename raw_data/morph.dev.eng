later on , munyensanga 's family found out i almost sent their son to the inkotanyis , although it was n't really me who had wanted to send him , they put a lot of pressure on me .
a military man who was from home got involved , they took me to the police station and questioned me about my involvement with the inkotanyis .
i told them i did n't know them and probably due to the fact that i was still very young , i was only 17 , they did n't keep me there for long .
i was at the police station for only 3 days with other young people who were in school in congo who had been arrested as well as many other people they had captured in gisenyi .
among them was the manager of sulfo gisenyi [ a cosmetic industry ] . i have met him , he 's still alive . he survived .
they ended up releasing me and some of my friends .
but in my mind i knew i was going to become some sort of an outcast after having been in jail .
and that 's exactly what happened , i was no longer free to move around as i wanted to .
whenever i 'd reach a roadblock - gisenyi was full of roadblocks then because things were very tensed , we were almost in 1994 - i 'd ... i decided to just remain inside the house .
i never even went back home to see dad .
i was too scared that munyensanga 's family would harass me or that i 'd even be imprisoned for wanting to help edouard flee .
she told me she wanted to go back to her home in butare as she had no hope of living anyway .
she said she could try and pretend to be a hutu as she had a hutu identity card , she thought she could say she 'd been wounded out of a mistake .
melanie said goodbye and i never saw her again .
i do n't know what happened to her after that .
helene came back and found melanie had left .
she took me to a certain lady in rugunga , not far from where i was .
the lady told me she was going to hide because helene asked her to do so , she said i was safe with her as she saw the interahamwes regularly .
there was another child hiding there , a very young child of about 7 years . it had been about 2 months since the war started ... sorry about 2 weeks .
i had n't known her for long , i met her slightly before the war started .
she was called micheveux .
i stayed at mama sania 's until the time the war was almost over .
the inkotanyis fought a lot and reached kigali city and were not far from rugunga .
the war went on , there were gun shots all over the place and we fled the place as soon as we got a way out .
at that time , there was no longer anyone asking for people 's identity cards and you could not tell who was a hutu and who was a tutsi , everyone was fleeing .
we fled but the young girl i spoke about earlier was n't able to flee as her health state was critical .
later on , the inkotanyis took us to saint @-@ andre [ a school in kigali ] where they continued to protect us .
bibi remained behind with the casualties , among them was that girl .
after the war , they told us all to go back home .
when i got back , the girl was no longer there ... she passed away .
even minani , they suffered so much .
i think about them all whenever i remember the things that happened during the war , the hardships people went through ... the ones i myself experienced .
i remember that girl and melanie more than my own siblings who passed away .
i felt so bad especially because the girl and i never got to really talk .
only you an shumbusho survived ?
had you finished studying ?
did you feel like the times she 'd ask you to leave it was because maybe you were n't of any gain to her , maybe because you were n't giving her money or ... ?
how do you relate to the people who were once your neighbours in kibuye , the people who were there when your parents and siblings were being killed and who are still there today ?
how do you feel towards them ?
about the survivors , let me start by talking about my personal experience .
i am lucky to have a husband who gives me anything i want but there 's still nothing that gives me satisfaction here on earth .
nothing !
be it the car i drive , the house in which i live ... at some point , my husband took me abroad in all the beautiful countries i had dreamt of visiting one day as a child .
but it all turned out to be meaningless .
i felt like i could have remained the way i had always been , i could have remained poor but with my siblings being with me .
have you ever had things and you have no one to share them with ?
i am sharing my own experience .
on the other hand , there are some who do not have a comfortable life , there are even others who are suffering from aids and who do not have any source of revenue .
so i really wonder in what state the person who sleeps hungry is .
i have a comfortable life , i never sleep hungry , i can eat anything i want and go anywhere i want whenever i want but i am never happy .
i never go for more than a week without locking myself into the room to cry , asking god why my people died , why he allowed my dad to die without seeing my children ... and in my case , i am at ease , so i wonder how things are for those who do not have anything to eat at times .
they are rotten , i do n't event think that they truly survived , they are still going through the sufferings , the pain .
it 's all still present in their lives .
would say you survived if you were a parent without any child to keep you company ?
when you get sick and there 's no one to take care of you , no one to bring for you food and yet you had children ?
and the other thing that hurts me so much is that there are some people who believe that one only survived because they killed . but less people think that way today .
others say that if they did n't kill , they would n't have survived .
they are killing us again and again whenever they say so ... it 's like driving the knife in the wound all over again ... because when people ask you how you survived , saying that the fact that you survived shows that you ... that you also killed .
they do not know god .
you can not kill a people god created and wipe it out .
so i am constantly sad , i am a very sorrowful person .
sometimes i am driving and ... there 's a time it happened to me but thanks god i was n't the one driving .
i was in a cab and i remembered my people , i remember home , i remembered the way we were living despite the fact that we were poor , i felt like ... it was as though i lost conscience , i was lost ... when we reached the round about , i asked the taxi driver where he was taking me , i asked him where he was taking me since i had told him i was going to the gare ... everyone was looking at me as if i was a mad woman , then i came back to my senses and realized we were at the round about .
i believe i could have done something really bad if i was the one driving and maybe gotten myself into a terrible accident !
i always thank god that it did n't happen while i was driving .
what about the other men that you told us who raped you ? did n't you recognize any of them ?
did you start to live with avega straight away or you returned where you used to live before ?
there is another question which i wanted to ask you and it might not be easy too .
you see , you were raped , you are sick , you lost your relatives ... allow me to tell you that it 's not many people who will accept and receive and keep them in their heart .
i do n't know what you mean when you say that you have accepted living with no relative at all , being sick as results of the genocide ... i do n't know ... though you say that you have accepted it ... even when it 's not easy , how do you cope with not having any relative nearby plus the only relative you had died in crash .
do you really cope with all this to the extent of having a normal life ?
besides the fact that they killed your relatives and also infect you with aids , if any of them came and asked for forgiveness , do you think you would be able to forgive them ?
if it happened by any miracle that you saw them coming to you to ask for forgiveness , how would you react ?
especially since they can n't resurrect your relatives and also give you your life back as it used to be and after all of that ask you for forgiveness .
so does this association have some kind of life ?
do you feel that being in the association is helpful you at all .
does that mean that if there was a possibility for those supporters to help avega , the lives of those people would be much better .
thank you .
he was a self employed mechanic and i was a mother at home with the children even though i had other things to do because we had a small shop .
on the 4th of october 1990 they had spent the night shooting in the air and they said that we were the ones that were shooting kigali .
we were a praying family , so i was a firm believer that no matter what happens god knows and is in control , so i comforted them and told them that even if their father does not return they will live , telling them that i will do all my best and work hard and provide for all their needs .
so when they checked they said that he was n't on the list with everyone else may be he died , they said .
he went back to work and went on with life as usual and then everything else happened as you know in 1994 .
as we were still arguing we heard a knock at the back door , so i woke up and went to open the door where i met with soldiers .
are n't the cockroaches that shot it down your relatives ? are n't they here ? show us where your husband is ? i took them to the room where he was sleeping .
the men had not yet thought about fleeing , so we stayed there and at around one in the afternoon we saw a lot of people .
so that i can prepare tea for my children , after i had borrowed the saucepan i was told that a car full of interahamwe was on its way .
there were policemen and other peasants , one of them got a spear and was ready to throw it at me and the man told him that if he throws it at me he will shoot him , they let us go .
interahamwe came , first a man called mbonampeka who used to be the minister of justice came and said to the priests of the seminary , why do n't you let these people go back home ? do n't you have cockroaches among them ?
we stayed there on the 9th , on the 10th the interahamwe kept coming to see how we were praying , we knew that it was over for us .
and then they tried to rape my daughters , pastor told me this since he survived .
but trying to lift my head i could n't , my head was wide open and my teeth outside , soaked in blood all over . i tried to stand up and then i fell on the ground again , the interahamwe came back .
they have said that they are coming in a short while to kill me go and hide in that garden with fruits , he said .
so i went in the student 's toilets , i looked for the filthiest and went in it .
on the hand , people that worked in the seminary hid him in their kitchen and covered him with some supplies but the people who came to loot took them .
so i asked them , where is she ? some would say kabuga , others would say goma , i did n't really know what to make of it .
i never got to a point where i felt discouraged and did n't want to live without a child . i was mature and able to look for what i needed to eat .
i am among the first people that were eager to bury , saying that i am burying my children and the remains of my relatives , but i later found out that they were not the ones we had buried .
so we got them from a sixteen meter pit latrine with other people that were thrown in with them .
i asked him why he did and it almost turned us into enemies but then i said to myself that there was no point .
now in gacaca whenever they go to defend themselves that 's when they say it and those who saw them accuse them .
and we have mass and pray , the memorial is just in front of the praying room .
the boy who told us said that they were hacked , my second son , the one they called dede his name was jean bosco .
they also say that they were hacked by a man called sebahire who is also dead , there is noone who killed them who i alive but its clear that the people who are alive know who killed them .
our car is the one that always took all the women at the hospital , he was always careful to take the poor pregnant women at the hospital .
to love his love because personally i can n't , so which means that if someone comes and tells that they did me wrong , an example is the boy .
but not forgiveness out of hypocrisy like they do in gacaca , someone coming and saying that i am asking forgiveness from every rwandan , i do n't have that forgiveness .
he enables me , you asked me if i have hope . my hope is that i am alive ; i was not supposed to be alive .
there are some who i do n't know their origin , i do n't know their father or mother or where they were born from , some are family including my mother i never knew her because i got lost when i was a little child .
but i have to be careful because there is no way a cobra can turn into a cock and you eat it .
for example disease , what would you say to them ? i do n't know how to say it .
the medicine helps those who are still alive , the cdp project that supports us and the first lady through pacfa .
but things can be got back , a house , food , clothes , medicine .
things have changed for example if a child survived the genocide when he was in secondary and now he is in university , he 'll also help others .
when his widow stays in the house of those who killed him , when she is wearing rugs when her husband would have dressed her up well , we can n't say that we are going te remeber that man .
so that there ar ealways taken care of no matter what , i do n't know what you would comment about it ?
it can watch over the memorial sites in their village and see if there 's any work needed to be done , if grass needs to be cut they make sure its cut and if there 's anything else they plan for it and follow it up .
so i believe that we parents should teach our children to love each other , the youth needs to fellowship and be together .
we left the priest 's place .
two days later i remember it was on 14th [ june 1994 ] , that day was the worst day of my life . they took around 70 young men ; we counted them after everyone started to talk about those we knew among them .
this time they came really serious , and searching each and every corner .
the thing is when it is not your turn to die , then nothing happens to you .
none of them did guess where we , i , anselme and dominique , used to hide .
from where he hid , we continued to watch them what they were doing .
they were tiring two by two using a shirt .
i remember one of them ; this young man wrote on his high school diploma these words "@ i forgive my killers . @"
he gave it to his mother , his mother lives now in a place called kabasengerezi and she has it . he wrote on his diploma those words before he left .
that time they took a large number of young men among which , muyoboke bosco , another one called hategekimana also known as nyarisaza , including gasindi , another one called twaha and another one called mutarambirwa .
among those seventy people was included an old man called murasadonyi who was one of the few old people that were taken .
they were taken to be killed inside a man called yaremye 's big building located in kiyovu residence .
they were buried inside that building .
it was on 14th , the same day kameya got killed .
he was brought from kinyamateka to be killed .
you find that they have already forgotten our people .
they say that the genocide came to an end but you find it is still there , so we do n't understand .
among our leaders there are some who committed crimes during genocide .
i think we have enough intellectuals ; they should remove those bad people and promote others who were not involved in the killings , the innocent ones .
it is sad when you know that someone used to killed people , i was always hurt whenever i could see munyakazi getting promoted in army ranks when he never stopped to come and take people from saint paul and ste famille .
okay it 's good now he was sent to prison but there are other people like him .
they should stop them to work because as they get the kind of jobs they try to hide necessary information .
let 's say if i was a colonel , i would just go and tell someone to leave me alone and to not say anything .
they intimidate officials like the ones in the court and they give them respect because of who they are .
those courts respect them for who they are and they can not step forward and arrest them but even though it was an ordinary citizen ... they will get killed as well .
they should also take them as ordinary citizen and get arrested .
the funny thing is that in court they call them "@ your honor @" during the time of judgment , how can you judge a man you have already respected that way .
thank you again ; i do n't know why i did not talk about gacaca justice .
i always follow most of gacaca justice in our area but there is one thing that hurts me . the gacaca justice started well , people were learning how it is done and after , it became corrupted .
people started to get bribes in order to drop charges .
there is a rule that states @: "@ when a decision does not satisfy the congress of inyangamugayo [ honest people ] , they have to vote and the majority wins . @"
when it 's a case of releasing a person , even the minority has to sign too for that release .
it is remarkable especially in our area , there is a trial that has to be repeated because one man was claimed by ten survivors and nothing was done .
we were really sure about the crime this man committed but still he was sent free .
the survivors sworn to never claim anyone else because their testimonies are useless .
what about your father ?
all i remember ... the first memory of genocide that hurts me most is the night of 13th ... [ he cries ] something that hurts me whenever i recall it ... in fact that 's the reason i had was unable to talk .
on the 13th of april 1994 , the day they came to kill my family members .
mum found me where i was hiding ; she brought me ... i was very hungry and she knew i was because , by then nobody could cook .
and , there was nothing left in the house ; the stock was empty . they would bribe the hungry interahamwe with food , so that they do n't kill them for sometime .
only beans were left at home .
but , because she knew i did not like beans , she brought me some vegetables and passion fruits .
then she said to me ; "@ i failed to find anything for you to eat but ... @" [ he again cries ] .
she said , "@ i could n't find anything to bring you .
the people i told you about , the ones who do n't like us took everything from me .
now i am failing to get something to give my child . @"
then she added , "@ try and eat this , it will be okay .
and , be strong . @"
today , passion fruits constitute a reminder of the last meal my mum gave me .
the other thing i remember is that , before she died , she told me that my sister and i should be very strong if we happen to survive , she told me to be a man !
those are the two things that are still on my heart till this day .
the one thing i keep remembering is the way they 'd get people from their hiding places and run after them with dogs .
i remember a certain man called canisius , he had many dogs that were used in hunting people from the bushes where they were hiding .
once they caught them , you 'd hear screams that meant they had been killed .
they run after them as though they were animals , tutsis were no longer human beings then .
i remember how tutsis were denied their rights as human beings .
they had become like animals and they started killing tutsis as they believed they were not human beings .
they believed they were killing something else , not human beings .
i remember that thing so well and it hurts me .
what do you want to do in the future ?
would you like to have a family one day ?
rosette can you tell me about your family before the genocide ?
who was there in your family ?
out parents ... they used to give us everything we needed while they were still with us .
they used to love us so much and give us everything they could .
i remember how we would always have new clothes and people in the neighbourhood would say that we wear cloths from goma .
our mother liked it when we looked smart . she used to say so .
she gave us everything we needed . relatives from both her family and from dad 's side were friendly .
sometimes they would take us to their homes for holidays .
they [ our parents ] would let us go , they did n't have any problem with it .
the thing is we only started getting problems after they died .
they were wonderful parents throughout their life .
they were good parents to us , whenever we were together , they would help us .
they would advise us and teach us how to be responsible ... they would assure us that we were adults but in reality we were still young by then .
they would tell us what we were supposed to do and today , we believe that the discipline we have is from them .
patience , sociability , learning how to be responsible as a mature person , that 's the training they gave us most of the time .
can you tell me ... eh rosette , what your most difficult memory of genocide is ?
do you know how your sisters died ?
how old were you during that time ?
how old were you during the genocide ?
is it possible to forgive ?
before the genocide we were a family of five , we also had other members from the extended family , we lived with our grandmother and a cousin of my mother .
after shooting her in the ribs ; i thought that my mother was dying and she was going to breath and her intestines would come out , it 's one of the things that hurt me most in the genocide , i will never forget it ; later when it was sunset ; it was night , about eight o'clock , after some time people organized themselves and said they were going to busesero , others said they could not make it there with such a number ; many people had remained in the stadium , some who had been shot , those who could not come out because they were wounded , my mother and i left the stadium ; we left the stadium and headed for the gatwaro forest , on our way i lost my mother , i cried very much but the people with me ordered me to keep quiet .
after a short while , the interahamwe let us go but just before that they separated the men and boys from the rest and took them away . we then continued to move with my elder brother and the other small boy because he was a visitor in kibuye and was quite young , i do n't know why they were n't taken with the men and other boys , they came to us and we left together . my mother said she there was a family friend called visa , let 's go to his home , let 's see if they can shelter us because the congolese were n't able , they had already left for their country .
my ribs hurt very badly and pus oozed out but the infection on the legs was even worse , i was yellow because i had lost a lot of blood ; i had a little blood left in my body , she got scared , she said , what shall i do if she dies in my house ?
she then decided to tell her husband about me , it had been a long time , i am not sure but i think it was the very first time , all i know is that he came to see me and found i was swollen all over , he told me he would take me to see a doctor the following day , i was in so much pain , i was unable to sleep ; i was unable to sit up , i was in so much pain ,
after some time of waiting , there was this lady with a sick child , her name was mama patrick , i have n't seen her since the genocide ended , and we asked about her but received no information .
she gave the interahamwe one thousand francs , i remember she put rosaries around our necks and prayed for us , she told us not to worry , nothing would happen to us and even if we were killed , we would go to heaven , there was nothing else to do , we agreed ; the interahamwe took the one thousand at that time and left promising to return and kill us the following day ; we continued staying in the hospital ; some people came to mock us , they said do n't bother killing her , her infections will , that is the life we were living in the hospital when the french soldiers came and stayed , after sometime they started taking people , the interahamwe started to flee while they looted the hospital
killing squads would attack from here and there ... as you know some came from gikongoro , from ... it 's just that we stayed together with those people until the last minute .
when the interahamwe attacked us in that church of ntarama , they ... they entered into the church and started to kill people , they hacked my father , my mother and my brothers and lost their lives in there .
i was there for about two months ; the red cross shifted us from mangeti orphanage to an orphanage in gisenyi .
i lived thereeeeeee .
i was hospitalized till i recovered .
later on in 1996 , i got ill consequences due to the other wounds i had , i suffered for a terrible headache for a while . there came a time the blood started to flow out of the head .
i was bleeding so much ; the blood was flowing out of the nose and ears .
i lived with that illness for a period of nine months .
in 1997 , i was hospitalized again and i got well . i started to live on ; i went to school to study .
i lived in the orphanage , there were people who used to come and visit us . they brought to us different things among which clothes and other things , there were from an ngo called cicr .
there came a man and said @: ‘ i would like to take the other kid who is always lonely , i want her to stay with my children ’ .
it was me that he was talking about because i used to like staying in a quiet place due to the headache i suffered . it was safe for me when i am out of noise .
whenever he came , he could see me lonely . so they allowed him to go with me if he feels that he is able . he was told @: ‘ if you want a child in here , first come and introduce yourself and say how you will care about her and once the orphanage is satisfied , can let you go with the child ’ .
hum ...
i will stop there for now , i returned in 1972 finding problems which we will talk about and which we know about the war .
i went to burundi and congo .
in 1994 after the war had ended here is when i returned , and now i am here , i have said this in a few words , that is how i am i think that is enough so that i can be in position for what lies ahead , for the answers i might have to the questions you will ask me
there is a book they wrote especially one written by a lady calley marie claude van grunderbeek , the explorer wrote a book called the first iron rwanda therefore has good things but i will only talk about one .
they found that the clay which the pots were made out of had cow dung , after , that dung was taken and carbon dated .
in the way of life that was discussed , we started with what he called fossils because of the second question we are going to ask him , we are now going to ask him a question in relation to the time rwanda started to be known as rwanda , when it started to have rulers who had their way of ruling , while ruling their people .
father , can you tell us the history of rwanda starting from the time of king gihanga ?
as you can see this book which is called ‘ les clans of rwanda ’ was written by a white man called marcel bertefert .
what is good about this book is that he did research in every prefecture in the country and he found they were similar to names of clans , the word tribe in french is clans , 19 clans .
in those clans therefore there is what we called tribes which is false , there are the hutu , tutsi and twa in every tribe .
let me give you an example on queens starting from there , at the beginning i said that the first keeper of rayal secrets was from the musinga clan , it therefore resulted in the queens sharing the throne with the would be banyiginya clan .
the first ten queens were from the basinga clan who included nyamususa the wife of gihanga ngoma ijana .
they were succeded by the bega clan because something happened that seemed to be a mistake , which was called rukumbi first rescued ... and therefore in order to punish her , they removed their queens from the throne .
they would share with them and put in place appropriate ministries which were organized . i can not say how of course , let 's say they put in place a ministry for army basing on how it is in the whole kingdom .
the rwandans used to teach how to fight , i think even now it is still in our blood , they used to breed livestock , they really knew how to breed cows in that up to now some still do , maybe things to do with cultivating were few but they had it too
there remained the one that was kigeli 's last first name , those were the ones who especially kigeli the second nyamuheshera , nyamuheshera is the one who went far up to rwacanzige but the other is ruganzu , ruganzu ndoli is the one had many things and reached as far as congo .
that it the hamites who made it up , and the rest followed suit and they used that ideology to divide us into tribes , books that were written especially on rwanda are many .
another was one written by rochanoine de l' axge , you will hear about it , they might also used it as reference .
whoever wrote this book said that rwanda has 3 tribes that 's how they started .
they wrote that a person was either hutu , tutsi or twa , you could find that a tutsi with ten cows was tutsi but one with less than ten was made a hutu and those with non were twa .
those then became tribes , and it run in ones blood , let me say .
so what was just an activity became a tribe , that is how it came about , then the leadership became like that .
they became our leaders and that is when things changed , they gave power to some yet in the past we all used to share power , it is written and i can show you the book right now .
it 's possible that there is a time that they told him to do this and that and he did not understand how that would help the rwandans that he governed .
can you explain to clearly the differences musinga had with the white men to the extent that they sent him into exile
but they made up all these things so as to not grant independence , you will ask me that question in a while , instead you can ask me another question on the colonialists . there is another common question concerning the priest you categorize amongst the colonialists and things like that .
there is another question concerning the catholic church
often , so as to not grant idependance to africans , the white man used fellow africans and that they were good and promised to help them if they fought those dogs that were trying to wrong them .
they formed political parties to help the colonialists saying that they did not need independance , saying that since africans eat and are fed , what is the use of independence ?
this is when the white man tried to find away of dividing them , blacks who wanted independence and who fought against it .
in 1959 , they jokingly put things doing what they were donig , you know what was done , they killed people , burnt and chased people away ... most of these things were done by the colonialists .
kayibanda was put in place by the colonialists , i will not waste time telling you who started the parties , i will talk about the priests because they are the ones who taught about political parties .
it reached a point where runar members and even the tutsi , if someone tries to make sense out of it they seemed to dislike the church , the white people , the colonialists and the communist church .
there was a time when it was said that priests were part of it and some of them were mentioned but peraudin is not everyone and i can n't say that he the one who incited them .
but they some who really played a role in that probably .
when they talk about the catholic church in general , i think someone can think of it in two ways , it 's better .
when we talk about the catholic church , you all know ; the catholic church is a community of those who are baptized and bileive in jesus christ and follow tha gospel , and they headed by the pope who replaced peter and other apostles who came after the 12 disciples of jesus .
after that period of riots we talked about in 1959 , it resulted into many things .
one of the results were republics , we know the first and second republics .
those two republics existed from 1961 to 1994 .
we want you to tell us about those republics not like people who read about it in history but saw it with their eyes .
well , they are two things , saying that he is not rwandans , i will answer it but saying that he made it up i think i 've just talked about it , we heard where saying that they is not rwandans came from , he is not the one who started it .
kayibanda did n't start it , he also found it like that and he accepted it , that the tutsi are not human beings .
kayibanda , if am not mistaken , his father was nkangura who came from bukavu and he even came with his brother ; basically there were two men one called nkangura and his brother the father to rwagasana .
they came this side during the time of king musinga and they became servants and even nkangura , the dad of kayibanda became a servant of a man called birasabyakanyemera , chief birasa was still a young man .
he became his servant and he served him , he served him when he was in nyanza school .
after birasa took his portion in kamonyi , he came with nkangura over there .
i think that 's when kayibanda was born .
honestly , the leaders of here felt that it was a big crime to keep refugees out . there is no other way , those who are in the country will be eliminated but then they could n't even eliminate them properly saying that they leave them to consume their property and maybe they should n't have any part in power and so they pursued them . if they shared with them a little and let them eat their part they would n't have been refugees . so when they heated up , like a threat to those leaders of mrnd and the political parties that used to help them , and again because they were segregationists , that generated multiple political parties .
just recently when the genocide of 1994 , happened people thought that maybe they can run to places where they ran to the other time thinking they could be rescued from there but that 's not what happened , maybe the example i can give would be like places where you find churches , am talking about christians of those churches cause people ran to them because they even used to pray from there then instead sometimes they would decide to kill them and people would die from there , what can you say about this ?
bad people the bad has to be punished that 's why i hear that gacaca to punish is really necessary so the fact that it does n't have it has to punish ... to kill ... not killing people ... basically to remove death penalty then they come to remove it and it 's removed completely is it really removed in the senate ?
that 's exactly what i 'm talking about it 's being removed ..... it 's not yet over but it 's on it 's way of being removed completely ... rwandese who died are more than one million so if they undertake that idea of saying that people can revenge the law that says that if one 's family is killed then that person kills too in revenges .... more than two or three millions .
... there is a time when i also ... genocide had occurred and survivors ... people got problems like you said , we are going to talk about these things ...
come from ... by speaking it kept spreading that which they had put in people 's heads
no one would like to be part of any killing like that
it 's to love each other , there is no other message i can give
in the area where we lived , we never used to attack homes in the same area .
instead local attackers would be deployed in an area where many people had gathered . what does this mean ... ?
the tutsi whom we were neighbours , left there homes and went to ntarama plus many other people who had come from different sectors that make up nyamata district .
they all gathered up in ntarama .
therefore in order to attack them , we had to first make a sufficient team . and verify if we were strong enough to attack .
as a result , there were few attacks in my area .
however , there was another attack that i followed it 's stories and i know how it started although i never joined it .
that was in a place called bironda in rusekera cell .
that is the only other attack that took place in this sector .
the rest of the attackers would gather from ntarama with an aim of killing people in ntarama .
during that time of year 1994 , there were many political parties but some were more powerful than others were . for example mrnd and cdr .
cdr was like a branch of mrnd .
those were the most power parties in the country and they had imposed others in the country .
among those people , do n't you know some who are leaders nowor those who are not at the same level with the locals ? for example people like you who were locals say that ...
may be you were not first taught or forced in order to admit what you did . you did it willingly .
and by doing that , your punishment was reduced .
do you think that the punishment you were given should be given to the other person who might have done the same crime but denies what he did ?
and that means ... how old are you now ?
did you catch that enemy on that patrol ?
which one is it among the ones that are there ?
how did you kill them and where did they find you ?
he was a counselor of which area ?
what assured you that he was tutsi ?
so would you recognize him if you met ?
do you mean that you killed because you were afraid that you would be killed in case you did n't ?
things are more complicated than they seem to be . the person you killed had family and those who are still alive today are very sad and angry .
they do not know me and i do not know them , but they know the killers are in prison .
so how do you expect to live with them and reconcile with them when you do n't know them ? who are you going to apologize to when you do not know the families of the people you killed ?
in other words , you did n't do anything to him ; you neither tied him up with the ropes they were tying him nor did you help them to drown him ... ?
where did you find him and which river is that ?
you have just told us the crimes you committed ; were you the only one or are there some members of your family who also participated in the genocide ?
and how did you used to loot at them [ tutsi ] ?
therefore you did n't see any training taking place .
so what did they stop ?
there is something i would like to ask you ... you very well know about the killings that took place here . you even participated in the killings in other villages .
could you tell us the most horrible memory ... maybe a dream ... memories of the time of killing that come to your mind .
what did you see ?
find a way of describing it to us .
do you sometimes have nightmares about it ?
how do you think justice would unite people ?
apart from that woman who forgave you , do you think it will be easy for other genocide survivors to forgive the genocidaires ?
well as a rwandan , how do you find your fellow rwandans ?
based on what happened ?
well , put yourself in the survivors ' shoes and to be more specific let us consider the one whose son you killed .
suppose he was the one who killed your own child , do you think it would be easy for you to forgive him ?
i am asking you to describe your life for me , after that time .
did you flee to congo like others ... if you fled , how did you go ... ? tell us in brief .
for example you may say , "@ after the war i went here or there , i did this or that until such and such day when i was arrested . @"
just tell us general .
did you do anything about it ?
for example like apologizing to them ... ?
was anyone there to help you to hide ?
was he still a counselor by the time he arrested you ?
no , it 's not to do with arresting him , which is your desire ; i 'm talking about his leadership .
now that you are here in murambi , you can remember that night when you came for the killings ... is it your first time to come to murambi ?
what if no one accused you , would you have confessed ?
until now you had never seen these corpses here ?
do you know anything about that event of exhuming and reburying them ?
the first time they buried them after they had been killed .
those who were living there were the interahamwe , the tutsi were the ones passing the other way out .
i would go out to my back yard then i could come back and wash clothes and put it there , i whistled and they ran in .
i started putting padlocks on both doors , and we stayed that way for a month , more came and when i figured out that there place was being over crowded i would take them out somewhere else .
i remember some names but really they were like 54 but others were more
they could see that i was umukiga .
the other disappeared , they went but can you be there with no life you do n't have a house and you say that they should give you a reward , the government and god will
long ago ?
so now i ask you , after the tragedy that fell on rwanda what can you tell the young children and others to ?
you are talking about people who killed each other ?
interahamwe ?
or how it came about ?
i want to ask you about the unity and reconciliation . what do you think can be done to achieve it ?
let us talk about the gacaca if those who killed were still alive .
what should be done for the truth to be told ?
that is to say that there are great people who are not in ?
his name ?
muhamudu ?
among those you hid , did any of them die ?
did you encounter any problem ?
can you tell us some of their names and what they do ?
i will support democracy
those in charge of ....... could visitors please raise their hands
who were killed in the cell they lived at , those killed outside the cell
what happened especially where they lived
you should have the right to speak out
some of our children or friends or even our enemies
in an communal meeting the first rule is
to embarrass or to scare someone
up to a year and is charged with holding of information
and does not show up without any explanation
he will give an account of what happened
to explain the article the talks about handing yourself over
the crime to which they are confessing and the person they trespassed against .
i am called mucyo jean de dieu i was born in 1961
and there was another young man who died , he lived in the other part opposite someone who was called oscar
but there is also what i heard but there some people i see here who can supplement
i want you to understand that what happened here in gikondo can not be said to have started in 1994
further from there we had discussed about this with honourable safari
but things looked bad and safari agreed
i stayed watching through the window
i wanted to say that before 1994 here in gikondo there were things that were leading to killing
they felt there was no security
...... and i said it is him yet it was me
he called because he knew many people at that time and i did not know many people
that time they had n't yet started shooting and i called seguma
we saw people coming up
we heard shots , many shots and safari also jumped over
that let us look for a place to hide because she could not jump over .
if we remain in this house they will kill us
my workers were also there ...... after a while i saw the children jumping over and coming back
he went ahead and kept checking for us and sloped to mukuza 's
and went to mille collines but that boy with whom we lived
at a hole like thing at side of the methodist 's
that when people told me that our house where we lived was attacked
when they finished they went to the swamp where i worked
and threw in a grenade
the house was not mine it was for serushyana francois , we rented it
my father was called buhirane thomas , my mother was nyirantziryayo verena
and they will burn in it . they burnt the house and we were in a small house in the compound
he is around , but i do n't know where
we went an old lady called zaninka
i went up to bukavu because we went along with the old lady zaninka to her home in butare
at your place if you remember anything you can tell us
and they jumped together the time with safari that time
i was with oscar
he was his youngest son i do not remember him very well
and we decided that we were not going to stay there
they had remained at etienne 's
then i got my eldest daughter her siblings and my sister
that 's where there is more security than my place
as mucyo said there was the death of ruzagiriza that we never understood i would like his brother to come back and give us an explanation , thank you
it became bad after they killed kayije 's family
the interahamwe were passing downwards there were some in lorries and there were trucks carrying dead bodies
and he told , "@ do you trust where you are going @"
i udahemuka sirivani swear that what i am going to say is the truth
up to when he left being transported and went to mukuza 's i remained with that man prosper with whom we were together
i would like you elaborate properly with maybe what he said or what others said and then see what you can add on
.... close by there were people who could harm us
that 's when i told my friend with whom we were together in that small boys quarters
he wanted to shift the old lady and her family but he said he could not leave us behind
that i also had them talk about a black man with whom they lived
we never saw him again
i 'm going to talk about the time of bucyana only because that is where my comrade mucyo started
we solicited for help from unamir and they arrived in white cars . they are the ones who took them away after both of them [ twagiramungu and agatha ] had given short speeches
they organised revenge of what happened then . they had a list of people who they 'd planned to kill during the killing .
also include the fact that the military tribunal decided their cases with partiality
safari they were there at gatabazi 's saying that they are going to kill me at 11:00 and he stood up
safari , can you clarify to us whether you are testifying or you give your testimony next time
do you know his other name ?
they attacked people who did not share the same ideology with cdr fighting those
she was from the family of a friend of mine mukarucogoza and she said wanted to say bye and i asked why
but he controlled himself and did not cry after they told him that his sister 's and his in law 's bodies were sprayed there
because they are hunting for him a lot and that it would be good .... they should not find out or else they will kill you along with them
what i wanted to explain is that that white man and i were not acquainted , it was god who sent me there
but i did not go there . @"
there are some men of integrity who have questions
now it 's similar to what they told honourable mucyo
in order to lean on this and restore the rwandan society ,
rugenge was one of the sectors of the district .
our testimonies or one of major general munyakazi laurent
so that we may build our nation with truth as a foundation .
we will be listening to testimonies . this aims at allowing a person who may have heard of something
i would like to ask my colleague to read for you today 's programme
once gacaca court discovers him @/@ her he @/@ she will be sentenced to three up to six months in prison .
in admitting that what he said was true and had proofs for it
words , and behavior that reflect intimidation toward the court panel in such a way that it is clear that in case it does not respect them
they had guns . they arrested some people and killed others .
before he starts talking , we remind that he talk of three things @: what he did himself ,
what you are about to undertake is giving a testimony
yes bugerera ! the district is kinihira . i think you have known me now .
the sector is bugerera
from the tenth to the sixteenth , i was sent
one i had written to him , asking me to come today for my testimony
i joined gommu chaired by the general bita from tanzania
on august 30th 1993
the testimony i want to give you concerns
by the successive governments of rwanda .
was made of mrnd , mdr , pl , pcd , and pdc .
tutsis were killed during thirty @-@ five years @:
in 1986 , the government of rwanda asked uganda to take back to uganda refugees that had settled in mutara and nansho . this was in line with the politics of exclusion .
since they knew that those refugees were going to come back by force , they started blacklisting tutsis so to exterminate them .
the government of rwanda invented a story according to which inyenzi alongside their accomplices had left uganda to invade kigali during the night the 4th and the 6th october 1990 .
kigali formation commander was major general nturagabo ; technician commander was colonel biganiro whereas the commander general was captain ndayisaba ; traffic security commander was nzabonimpa and i , major munyakazi , was the central chief record @-@ keeper .
a clearing commission chaired by the prosecutor general nkubito discovered that there were neither guns nor bullets found in tutsis ' houses in the whole country .
the commission found out that there was no model iv of the identity card discovered in tutsis .
it also found out that there were no graves dug in houses and fields of tutsis , which graves , as said , tutsis would bury hutus in .
the government of rwanda still refused the agreements and kept the war logic and the extermination of tutsis .
on february 9th 1993 , rpf was about 30 km from kigali .
other countries ordered rpf to stop the war intended to stop genocide that was taking place in rwanda and the very countries started suggesting to rpf to withdraw .
there was a very bad atmosphere among politicians in rwanda from july 1993 to april 6th 1994 .
there was a misunderstanding in mdr and pl .
mrnd , cdr , and pl power wanted the war so to beat rpf and tutsis whom treated as accomplices in rwanda .
from this date , militias of those political parties in all sectors of kigali and all communes of rwanda received guns and bullets they used during genocide which started on april 6th 1994 .
tutsis were wrongfully accused of being accomplices of inyenzi to be killed like any other enemy , of keeping guns and bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets .
as i have already showed above , the government of rwanda invented a story whereby inyenzi had invaded . i have already explained that the government accepted the publication and teaching of the ten commandments of hutus to the population .
this method was used till july 4th .
that is the reason why people who escaped there were attacked many times . interahamwe were set to exterminate them and killed many tutsis in those houses , churches and schools .
we also found out that the transmitters and receivers said to be taken from inyenzi were too worn and could not work .
the soldiers we met at gikondo told us that the transmitters and receivers had been brought by gd soldiers which gd was commanded by the lieutenant @-@ colonel .
i handed in those reports to gendarmerie chief staff and the minister of defense .
the same reports were submitted to the prosecutor general lorge .
that is what i am going to talk about .
right !
in saint @-@ michel cathedral ... you know ... though i see people laughing at me !
i protected all those orphans and old people from nyamirambo till july 4th when gendarmes exiled .
they had not hurt anyone though . gisimba himself can confirm that .
i went to him and said that i did not know at father vermerie 's .
he suggested going together so that he might lead me . i was in a pick @-@ up vehicle . we went to take priests and nuns who were there .
i took all of them to saint @-@ michel cathedral .
among the priests , there was hakizimana celestin who was in charge of saint @-@ paul center , mwumvaneza anaclet , galican ndayisaba , sfi , tubane and other people with him .
i carried them in the pickup to saint @-@ michel cathedral . i was with father uwimana . i did it two times
i ordered captain ntirugiribambe
then as the commander of muhima military camp , i ordered the territory company that was there , to settle at hotel de mille collines , sainte @-@ famille church , saint @-@ paul center , and lycee notre dame de citeaux in order to protect the population .
personally i did not have any connection with the interahamwe .
yes , it is .
who was in charge of them ?
you said you were going to save people the priest had recommended . and who else ?
we have understood that .
let 's go back to saint @-@ michel 's issue . you told us no single individual died there whereas there is one called semuhungu and his family . as the commander of the area , did n't you know that ?
the population said that they thank lieutenant @-@ colonel who came to them in difficult situations . they recommended delivering the message to me . i had the message that i had saved people . i can not understand the reason for of this trick of bringing fake accusations against me during the last days . where does it come from ?
it carried someone else . i used to travel in a white pickup . you can see that people mentioned the name of munyakazi whereas it was not him .
i used to travel in a white bus , with which i carried priests and nuns from sainte @-@ famille church .
so the person who did those things wrongfully attributed to colonel munyakazi .... that is not true ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel . i did n't travel in that car at all .
you had already been asked the question . as you do not know him , however , it is okay . you may explain
yes you told me that you thank me for that !
however , i do not want someone to come and wrongfully accuse me of having travelled in the red pickup , of having headed attacks somewhere whereas i was in another area .
that is why i have to provide explanations to show you that the accusations presented to you are false though you are trying to talk to me in a diplomatic way that this is not a trial . i have to defend myself .
let 's first listen to these people . hold on ! you will first introduce yourself , later ...
kabarondo
i want to give you my testimony first .
you joined us in sainte @-@ famille during the war . you were with your men . they were so many . meanwhile , before the war started ... you yourself and the republican guard at kimihurura triggered off the war .
when you were at kimicanga , you ordered that all tutsis be taken uphill . you added that you would kill even a hutu who refused to bring them uphill .
thank you mister president and you ladies and gentlemen ! we are just at the information collection stage . i will only say few . i would also like to ask you to speed the proceedings because we have many accusations against him .
sainte @-@ famille sheltered people who were displaced in the time of bucyana 's case . i will also tell you tutsis who died on the altar .
munyakazi was also there if he remembers well .
i am now going to tell you the interahamwe from my area rugenge . if it does please to him , he will also let us know those from muhima and gikondo because he was their commander .
those from rugenge included .
they expect us to follow up their death because if we had known where that shit is , we would have buried it . they should tell us where our shit is then we shall bury it because it is just shit ! i do not want to be too long . we will be together in tribunals . the last thing , mister president , is about our personal security . you have just seen the way he is talking here ! the general might kill someone i swear ! thank you .
i live in rwampara cell , biryogo sector , nyarugenge district
wait ! wait ! tell us where you come from
tell us then !
they did not see me because i was very small and they were rushing . they told them to follow the way ; i mean the very few who were not yet killed . they went to kill them outside .
some few days after , munyakazi came back in the evening . he was with munyeshyaka . they told us to carry the bodies . they went to hide them in the garage of the steward general 's office so that minuar might not see them .
when were you born ?
tell us first your mother 's names by the way !
butare province ?
why is he saying he did not use to arrive at sainte @-@ famille ?
i will remind him . after having taken those people ... he was always at sainte @-@ famille . when he came to munyeshaka 's , he was like in his own property .
he , with the interahamwe of his company , always took people with them .
when he was about to leave , they could put people into the pickup . though he is saying he did not , we could see it starving though .
you were with the interahamwe kimba and seseko . you came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . then ... you munyakazi ... they started picking people . among those left there was a man called enock and others .
there were still about ten people left .
1973
i will start by the information i had from james . he told me how he lost his mother in 1990 . james is employed in mimplan .
munyakazi ...
as far as i am concerned @: in the time , i lived in a different place . i lived in ubumwe cell , rugenge sector , former kabasengerezi . i was a student in senior iv at lycee notre dame de citeaux .
mudenge , can you please stop worrying and calm down so that we may ask you ? we may even wait a while for you to calm down and tell us what happened . you have just said that he arrived at cela , with renzaho , nyirabagenzi odette and angelina . what happened next ?
munyeshyaka ... actually sainte @-@ famille 's parish priest was mwumvaneza anaclet .
wensislas was his assistant .
on april 9th and 10th , anaclet was sainte @-@ famille 's parish priest . he left the church , passed through the steward general 's office and went to hide at bishop vemeshi 's
start by the first question so that we may go on .
i think you have just answered the first question by epa
all i know is that people from kibuye complied with the accusations by rugema and kabera who was the prefect as you might have learnt .
a verification commission
we want you to be brief . we need to leave this place
what did you do as far as stopping interahamwe is concerned as an authority having armed men under your command ?
did you give any report about your humanitarian action at sainte @-@ famille ?
i am accused of . i was fighting the interahamwe at hotel de mille collines . there are even proofs
munyinya cell , ruhango town .
the testimony i have come to give ...
1962
as well us to make sure their security is guaranteed during that time
because munyeshyaka was close to soldiers , we had appointed him to calling gendarmes to come to us for help
we should not say he did not help us in fact . however , he may say that at a time he could not handle the situation . unless those people would not have probably died
if one does not agree , i would ask him to tell us where the water used to cook the food he ate was from . that happened but i was not with you anymore .
we heard a lot of bullet shots and thought that interahamwe had come to kill people because it had been rumored
on 17th he arrived and left some time after .
after he left ... after he arrived we got up . coming and seeing people who were shot at by ex @-@ far
they went . as soon as they arrived ... the gendarmes who were at the main entrance ... -@ i do not know whether there are some who are still alive . but in case there are , they should apologize to you
he was n't
of course we are not . we are not soldiers .
your mother again ?
in my speech , i will focus on the date of june 19th 1994 especially about the confusion of the red and white cars .
ntaganzwa evariste
i will n't say much of munyakazi . i have come because of the red car he is denying .
they said that they were sent by munyakazi in order to take off the shit down saint @-@ paul
the car turned back . they said it was going to bring others up there . i do not those , however . so , denying the car , whereas the people said they were sent by munyakazi to cleanse , is contradictory .
when i went for treatment at rutayisire 's , i did not find him . he had been taken to the hospital because all other people of his clinic had been all killed
swear to god
on june 8th , they called upon a french who worked may be in red @-@ cross , i do not remember well
before i got into the car , i heard some people saying for example @: "@ i am hutu @"@ . they were replied @: "@ where are you going then if you are hutu ? @"
parents ?
cela .
it does not mean that i do n't know what happened at sainte @-@ famille . i just want to talk about the attack headed by this very man munyakazi at cela
they came hitting everything . there were about 1000 interahamwe i guess . they were really strong and armed with machetes ... with everything
"@ there is no kibungo 's group unfortunately ! @" we were answered .
munyakazi told us @: "@ stay here @"@ . our chief albert , degode , wilson , and children of one man who lived in kiyovu were killed there .
they took the people to cnd to kill them and we stayed standing there as my colleague has just said .
the following day , this one came and entered sainte @-@ famille church . the interahamwe also came with the list we had made in cela in order to find who might be still alive .
if he can remember where porridge was cooked , i was the cook . so , ladies and gentlemen , that is what i had to talk about this man . thank you
martin the first testimony i want to give you dates back to 1991
we committed to solving the problem . there was a woman close to minuar . she told them [ minuar ] but they did not know the intention of munyakazi and father munyeshyaka
according to an alphabetic order . the first section was brought to kabuga .
did you see this one getting in sainte @-@ famille when you were still there ?
i think , they started by cutting down the bush on priests ' fields .
because people have already talked about it , i want to be brief and ask him one thing ;
i saw him myself . i heard him myself talking to interahamwe among them maroc ,
they told me @: "@ speak any other language you like @"
whereas i watched him supplying them . that was my testimony
came to my door and started sharpening a machete .
they were laughing . one could see even people in the minitrap 's truck boot .
is murindwa alive ?
it is the matter of testimony and point of view because the gentleman cited you as a witness
with the help of a white person who worked in an american organization .
soldiers not gendarmes ! they were soldiers because they were staying in front of staff headquarters .
things did not ... we started planning to take the way of kiyovu and run away .
that what i am going to say is true
he and his gendarmes had a group of interahamwe .
munyakazi himself says that he is wrongfully accused by kabera assiel and mp donatien .
to be brief ... he worked in finance . he was a very important person .
actually on 30th , around 8 , they came there to abduct people .
some desperate mothers , i guess , went and showed themselves .
we are asking you about your relatives !
my father is onesphore . i , mwisesneza jean bosco , swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
who was a guard at rugenge sector 's office had advised me not to . we knew each other from early childhood .
i had already been warned by the gendarme . i was in saint @-@ paul center conference room .
i did not answer him because i knew that being hutu
they only said they were coming to look for people who had been at saint @-@ paul .
you should tell us the names of those you knew because this is testimony .
yes , those attacks at cela took place and were headed by interahamwe . that is true but i never headed the interamwe 's attacks .
but i never used it .
i should be asked about what happened in my area @: saint @-@ michel cathedral .
gendarmes went to bring the second group that was still at nyamirambo .
i think you only know two people from rugenge . however we can ensure you that the witnesses were not appointed by the court in order to accuse you .
this is not a debate sir . the houses in the areas were not destroyed that is true . let 's consider people who died because man is more than houses .
houses are built but man passes away once for all .
investigators have to run the enquiries but i was not among the shooters .
he has talked about them after people did . he told us that he went to saint @-@ paul . there was a priest who was in charge of the center who helped us a lot . i even thank you , general munyakazi , if the information we have been provided with is true ;
he gave orders as a military authority .
this implied fighting against the interahamwe and taking kigali formation to kacyiru . we did not want it to go there
why did you usually go there while it was not your area ?
there were no gendarmes on the barrier at all .
i was never involved in genocide or any other crime against humanity . on the contrary , i did my best to help people
on march 16th they went to report me to criminology department saying that munyakazi 's testimony showed that he was for the interahamwe , that he did not want to tell the truth .
to gms and other commissions since 1999 where i got the opportunity to fight interahamwe .
panel member we start at 8 a.m. , the agreed @-@ on time . there is another communique from biryogo sector .
tell me about your mother .
what kind of a lady was she ?
can you tell me about a particular memory you shared as a family , a wedding or a party or a holiday ?
something that you did and you remember very strongly .
who did it ?
what was the attitude of the killers ? what was their behaviour ?
how were your parents buried ?
because as days go by , one comes to see the consequences and they keep on becoming worse .
unless they gave you back , ... unless they gave you everything you desire which is not possible .
showing you the person who killed your people and condemning them , i wonder what the condemnation would be . killing them would do them some good . even if they killed them , they would kill them ‘ nicely ’ compared to the way they killed my parents .
i trust that the genocide will never happen again .
i have the conviction that the genocide will never happen again .
who is yves today ? who are you today after the genocide ? faithful ?
hopeful ? optimistic ?
sad ? what makes you who you are today ?
after the genocide , we remained three of us ; my son john murengezi and the one who was our last @-@ born celine uwineza .
it is hard for one to say what he or she remembers about their family members because there are so many things to remember ; it is one 's entire life .
it is difficult to accept that you bring up your children and see them growing , not lacking anything and one day it all goes .
it takes some strength to even acknowledge it and accept that it is actually possible .
it was something very difficult to believe .
death is normal but it 's a big issue when your family just disappear all at once .
it is difficult to even understand it .
sometimes it makes you wonder how god can allow such things to happen but he probably has his own plans that we can not fully understand as human beings .
i remember how on the morning before i left , i thought that maybe i was not going to come back since i was going on a journey .
so i left a note for my wife telling her where the money was hidden .
but later on , god helps you and finds you another wife to help you through everything .
she even helps me to bring up the children who remained , as it is difficult to bring up children on your own as a man .
but when you are lucky to have a good wife , she helps you out to bring them up and they grow up .
they are now grown ups , my first @-@ born son john is now married with kids and today i am a grandfather .
celine is now at the university .
they were both young children and i even got two more beautiful children .
i thank god for those children and for the other wife he gave me so she can be my new companion in the remaining lifetime .
what does rwanda need to do to avoid the same thing in the future ?
i remember my mother when i was about 3 years old ; we used to always be together , her friends used to come home .
she used to buy me new clothes every month .
what i remember about my mother is that she loved me .
my grandmother was an old lady who loved to pray and she raised me up from the time i was two years old , together with my mother .
i loved her very much and she was a very compassionate woman .
she used to help everyone .
no , i was here in kigali .
i did not know him much because i was still a child at the time when i was living there .
i knew his daughters though . some were in my class and others were ahead of me in school .
so , i knew him as an adult i used to see passing by on the road .
it is very difficult to go through such a war alone , when anybody who sees you wants to kill you .
it was very hard . i felt like i did not have a life .
there was no one to protect me , no one to care about me , no one to talk to me .
being alone then , and i was only fourteen years old , all by myself .
i felt so lost !
it was as though i did not know where i was or what was going on .
i was so confused .
i remember the day i saw three girls being thrown down from a tall building .
i had to be calm so that they do not notice me and catch me too .
i always remember such instances . at that time i was alone , there was nobody i could tell what i had witnessed .
even the times i went to people 's homes , i did not have time to tell about it all .
i used to see such things and i would keep silent . i would just go and sit down and keep silent . i could not tell anybody what i had seen .
i was saying that it was like being stupid or not mentally okay .
it felt as though you could not cry or even speak .
it felt like being in a place where everybody was gone .
justice ... i do n't know if there has been justice . it is there because we have gacaca .
before gacaca to me was something very small because gacaca has always been there between neighbours , for when children would fight or cows would go to eat the neighbours ' crops .
it did not exist for someone who has committed murder .
so if we set gacaca , it is because the world did not help us in making sure that justice is done .
if the international community had really been involved in what happened in rwanda , people would have been punished the way they deserve .
yes justice exists ... people are judged and freed if they win their trial ... the other thing is about the people who are judged in arusha .
once they are judged and condemned , they are taken to jail to mali or senegal . they build big houses with a tv and everything .
is that being imprisoned really ?
what about the people they killed so horribly ? do you think that is justice ?
i do n't look at it as justice because they are free anyway .
to me it is all the same and maybe they should just let them go as long as they let us leave in peace and it never happens again .
i guess lessons from the genocide are learnt on a personal level .
in general , i believe that the entire world learnt a lesson from the rwandan genocide , because ... each person learns a lesson from the genocide individually .
i learnt something , somebody else learnt his or her lesson and you did as well .
people will keep on learning slowly . today , ten years later some people have already learnt a lesson from it , others have not yet and some are just there , not having learnt anything yet .
i believe rwandans themselves have learnt lessons from the genocide and the rest of the world at large followed .
the war went on . the man who hid me chased me .
i said to myself , "@ if it is so , let me go . @" but i could n't recall the path because i had passed there only once together with my family . i simply used to guess .
i would look at a hill in front of me and guess that if i reached the place , perhaps i would be in such and such area . i was looking for a way to survive .
i would not cross roadblocks ; i would avoid them .
whenever i met somebody , i got information from him or her about the situation . when someone told me that it was dangerous then , i would go through bushes .
afterwards i decided not to reach home , because if i reached home , they would kill me the way they killed dad and maybe even my mom . i thus made up my mind to look for a job .
the first person i met was a lady and she told me that she could n't hire such a person .
she could n't give a job to a person who looked like me .
then i imagined that i would also be killed at some point .
i had heard that the inkotanyi came in our home village ; however , i did n't know where to pass .
there were some girls i had hid with , one was called grace and the other was called mugeni and they were both older than i. i thought that we would go together but they left me behind .
"@ alice , how come you are not at school ?
i told her the truth that i no longer studied . she told me that they used to see me around , i told her that she was right and that i was all over because i was not going to school .
"@ why did you quit school ? @" she asked me .
"@ do n't ask me much questions , i just quit school , " i told her .
by then even my cousins were still at home .
you know there was so much poverty then .
i told her that even others quit school besides me .
then she asked me to find her at home .
i went to her home and then she asked me to tell her exactly what was my problem .
i told her that she could neither do anything about my problems nor help me .
i am the only one who survived .
well your life continued like that until when genocide stopped ... until when the inkotanyi took you up .
after meeting the inkotanyi , can you tell us in brief the life you experienced with them until you decided to go and find your cousins ?
yes , both of them are still together .
but for sure when i came out of the orphanage , we never took an immediate decision of going there ... well , there was a certain man by the names of gahigi esile , he told us that he knew our family .
[ i had just came out of the orphanage .
] he said ; "@ i used to know your parents , in fact your father was my good friend .
do n't worry , come home i will take care of you like my own children . @"
the three of us went to his home ; i told him that if he took me alone it would n't be of any help to me , because these are the only relatives i survived with .
therefore , he took us all .
we went to his place .
at his place we lived there with no problem .
but later his wife became a problem to us .
his wife told him that , " i can not handle the kids you brought ; they are disobedient , they are ... name it . @"
during or after the war ?
on my behalf , the question of reconciliation ... well if there is a person who committed that crime , for example @: if someone came to me and told me that they killed my mom and dad and others frankly speaking , i can forgive them . in fact , i already forgave the one who killed them yet i do n't know him . if one asked me who it was , i would n't be able to tell because i did n't know him . maybe he died who knows ! but there are some of the families i see for example @: the person who killed my uncle @: the my cousins ' father , the ones we are living together . he came and called me ...
however i request the wise and older men of rwanda to find a way of preventing such wars from happening again .
it 's ok to stay in our poverty and remain orphans ; maybe god will remember us .
but as far as the war is concerned , they should find a way of convincing people to abandon those thoughts , of course it is not easy to forget what happened but still they should n't organise other wars and that thought should clear out all rwandans .
you are currently a student .
in which year are you ?
tell us something about your parents and your family ; what they used to do , how many were they ... ?
what was your grangfather 's occupation ?
any of his cows ?
when you went back , which class did you join ?
i think the war started in february 1994 .
that is when my mum 's cousin came home .
but he did not spend the night there ; he went back on the same day .
and then soldiers came home to look for him . they searched in our house but they did not find him .
in april , i remember it was at night around ... between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. if can remember .
we heard from the radio that habyarimana was dead .
then followed cries ; people crying and shootings ... soldiers shot so many bullets .
we did n't know what was taking place .
we were so frightened .
in the morning on the radio they said that no one should leave his or her house . it was declared that people should n't walk in twos .
one interahamwe came behind me and explained to me that he had lost his gun and that if he went back to the camp without it , the soldiers may kill him .
he asked me to accompany him while he was looking for it .
i told him it was okay as long as he went in front and i followed him which he agreed .
when we reached in front i heard people talking .
i quickly hid myself behind a tree trunk that was around .
it was about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. he moved forward and i heard them shooting him with many bullets ; he screamed only once and died .
i turned and took off .
because it was at dawn , when i got far back , i was able to see two other soldiers ; they were from the other group .
i continued walking with them and we passed through the inkotanyi 's camp ; we passed there while they were cooking and they just saw us running .
therefore , they got hold of their guns and ran after us .
we entered some trench that was covered by long grass and laid there .
one of the two soldiers got a grenade and said , " in case we hear them coming , i will explode this grenade and we shall all died together . @"
because they had told us that when an inkotanyi gets hold of you , he tortures you to death by cutting off your ears , your figures ... slowly until you die .
no one knew where i was then , they could not trace me .
it was in year 2000 that is when i started to speak again ; basically it was in 1999 @-@ 2000 , during the year i was in form one .
then i spent six months at home without studying and later joined apace and continued from there .
what do you think about your future ?
whenever i think about the genocide , considering the people i live with ... like presently i am in aerg [ association for students genocide survivors ] at school ; i learn much from the students we live together ... incase i get married and have children ; as soon as they are old enough i will teach them never to kill anyone .
i will tell them it is the worst thing ever !
then i would tell them all that happened and explain to them how politics contributed to all that happened .
because when you try to analyse everything , you find that not more than three people planned it .
but more than a million people participated in it .
that is the principle that my child would ever follow .
i would teach them never to believe in getting something after killing someone .
that is what i believe i would tell them ... i would tell them that , whenever they see someone inciting the genocide , they should always try to stop them .
if necessary , they should loose their lives over it instead of seeing massive deaths again .
from your personal point of view , do you find it possible to reconcile with those who killed your people ?
tell us something about your family .
did you say there is another person in your family who survived ?
could you tell there was a problem yet you were still young ?
you can imagine a villager hearing a pistol making such a [ loud ] sound [ pa , pa ... ] the noise blocked our ears . therefore we got confused and ran back .
we ascended the hill so they took advantage to kill us .
as they were coming behind us , they could knock us by the anklebone . whoever could not run fast enough and whom they were able to reach would be killed there and then .
they started with houses that were there in the valley and burnt them .
then they burnt our sector .
there was a joint up there ; it was like a pub in a town centre .
when we reached there , we stood acting tough .
then a man who was called safari hid himself beside the wall , he released one arrow and killed one interahamwe .
immediately that interahamwe fell down and when other attackers saw him die , they turned back and ran saying , "@ we are dead . @"
we rushed to that injured interahamwe and hacked him with all the anger .
the rest of the interahamwe took off and we also chased after them until they crossed the hill .
that night they [ nterahamwe ] held a meeting and called the gako barracks .
we heard buses coming and people singing , "@ we are coming to finish you and finish you completely @"@ .
we figured that they had reinforced their troops and that it was our death .
we saw one battalion that they had sent because they knew that they could not manage us .
we went down the valley , this time they confused us the way they had done before , they pretended that they feared us .
this time they could walk towards us and pretend they feared and were going back .
they did this several times and then finally came down the hill very fast .
we shouted telling them to come down the hill and meet us ; they began to trick us by shooting arrows slowly in order to come closer to us .
within no time , there appeared soldiers from nowhere .
these soldiers were near us and ready to shoot . therefore , their leader [ i am not sure if it was their leader ] shot one bullet with a pistol .
and immediately after , gun shots followed . all of us got confused and we were scattered .
that is when i realized that things had changed for the worst . in fact i came to realize that kayumba lost so many people that day .
we started running , we got scattered and mixed up .
that day people were killed in a big number and in my heart i thought @: whoever survives this day will be a real man .
they were three boys who lived in karambi near the swamp and our home was at kayumba at rukili cell .
we started staying together ; later on we turned out to be many .
people would keep on meeting , those who survived or those who hid themselves .
the first day there was no attack , the following day that is when they sent attackers to search for people .
kayumba sector turned out to be like a forest where people hunted rabbits .
they would come from other sectors to hunt us or rather to ‘ work ’ as they called it .
we could keep on running the whole day , hiding from interahamwe .
whenever they would come to attack us , they would shout saying , "@ surround them , and search for them @"@ .
they were also afraid of us because they knew they could find someone with a machete who could kill them .
we had a system , when we could hear their noise we would hide , pass behind them and go where they were coming from .
those who were found in their hiding place were chased by dogs , they would blow whistles , and horns , and whoever was caught , was killed .
we would get scattered , but after a chase we knew where we would meet , in a certain bush , which we had transformed into our house .
we would then get together and more people would join us and the number would be ten again .
in the evening , we would then meet and ask each other how things were , who died , that is how we were living at that time .
my father once worked in ririma , ririma and gashore there is a road that reaches ngenda district and continues to burundi , so i told rushoje the boy who i was with that long time when we were still living in ririma , i used to hear that the road continues to burundi .
i told him that one just has to pass through ngenda district and gako ( military academy ) i assured him that i knew the way and convinced him that we would reach there .
it was as if death was leading me .
imagine passing through a military camp .
the guy agreed and we got ready to leave .
so , at around seven o'clock in the evening , we said goodbye to our friends whom we were hiding together .
they asked us where we were going , we told them that we were going to burundi .
they also asked us where we were going to pass , we told them the way we were planning to use .
they were shocked and told us that we were going to die .
but we had already decided to die moving rather than sitting around and waiting for death .
they even sent for me but i could not go because i was lame .
they decided to come and pick me but unfortunately they found a group of attackers on the way and ran back up the hill .
but there were some other people who used to hide up the hill of our place . because it was secure up the hill . from there , one could easily see how interahamwe were attacking .
therefore , i tried and limped slowly and reached the top of the hill .
my cousin saw me , he held me and asked , "@ is it you egide ?
are you alright ? @"
i told him how i survived and what happened .
he told me that even there , it was all the same ; they used to spend the whole day running .
i assured him that i was ready for that situation .
i told him that if they killed me that will be god 's plan .
then he heard kagame 's voice on the radio . all the time we would turned on radio muhabura as long as we had a chance to listen to the radio .
then he heard kagame saying , " ladies and gentleman , do n't worry we are on our way . @"
as soon as he said that , most of us who were hiding were cheered up .
we thought it was true they were on the way , just here near nyamata .
he was holding his rifle like this then he immediately changed it to this position and said , "@ stop ! @"
the man whispered , "@ i am dead . @"
then he thought , this person who asked me to throw the spear before anything else probably wants to kill me right now .
then that man obeyed and threw the spear down .
but when he dropped it , he had a feeling that the soldier was an inkotanyi .
because we used to hear that inkotanyi soldiers wear such capes .
therefore , he was wondering , "@ is n't he an inkotanyi , with those boots ? @"
he has to be an inkotanyi but if it meant to die i will die @"@ , he decided .
i heard from people that my sister who was called uwera dative ; was cut and buried alive with other bodies in a big pit which was dug in nyamata next to the butchery .
she was among the people who had saught refuge at that commune .
after killing those people the dead bodies were dumped in that pit but because my sister was just hacked on the leg , she was still alive .
then as the bodies were dumped in the pit , she was also dumped alive .
whenever i remember all that , i feel so hurt .
especially in april i feel so nervous .
another sister of mine that i heard about was mugorewera dancille .
the person who was telling me about her told me that , the last time they saw each other was when she had a bandage on her leg after she had been hacked .
that is all i heard the rest i do n't know .
i also got other news about my elder brother called nizeyimana jean claude .
that he was hiding in a pit hole with some other boy .
but that boy told me that , he does n't know how my brother died .
that is all i heard .
q ...
my name is nshimiyimana claude .
we were living in kicuciro , in ngoma district in ngoma zone .
i was there and they started looting while i was watching .
but i was hiding in a corner of the house .
after it happened , i entered in the house and got a cloth and tied it here behind because i was terribly bleeding .
after tying it there , i got out .
and stood there at the corner .
they came and did all they did ... there are some things they did not manage to take that particular night .
they came the following morning .
when they came back that following morning , i had left .
yes , among my brothers .
in brief , your family would be accused of ...
yeah , that is when they said that , "@ let 's wait and see if we will reach morning peacefully . @"
all we could do was to flee .
i remember my dad saying , "@ it is over now . @"
they were saying we should flee to e.t.o in kicuciro because it was the only place where people could hide ; a neighbour would n't hide you , ever .
because you knew that some could actually be the ones to kill you .
people would kill in their neighbourhoods .
therefore , he went outside and tried to fight the men who were in front of the house but he did not succeed , instead he was shot and he immediately feel down .
then other militias entered in the house and ordered everybody to get out .
everyone got out ; it was a very long line of people .
what i heard at last was people making noise .
after that i saw people holding clubs and smashing other people .
they were of different types ; some were shooting and others would finish up using clubs and machetes ...
while i was still there , they jumped back the fence and got in .
i had left my shirt there ... it was even becoming dark .
they shot many bullets to the extent that some of the neighbours fled and others thought it was a contest between the inkotayi and the interahamwe .
the majority were informed about what it was the following day .
several people came to watch us ; others were looting our properties .
that was when i left the place .
after fleeing i ... meanwhile during all those days genocide was worsening .
that is what i saw in the meantime .
would you please tell us in brief how your life was , from the time you left your home to the time the inkotanyi captured the country .
what was your life like ... tell us in brief how you were living ?
well ... i did not finish school but i reached a certain level where i am able to look for a living .
but i wish to go back to school though i still have some problems .
i also know how difficult life for orphans .
but what can you do to solve some of your problems ?
something else i would like to ask you is about those who did those things [ those who killed ] .
what message do you have for them ?
that is not possible .
what matters is that you have a place where to relax or a place where you can host a visitor or a place where to throw parties and host friends because you consider the friends that survived as your family .
of course i am talking about real friends ; they are the closest relatives one is left with .
you visit each other and live in a sort of community so that you do n't feel deserted .
when people visit you , you chat and when there is an idea to analyze , you do it together and you are happy .
if you are working on a project or studying then you do it together . such things contribute to our own development .
i guess that the best thing to do .
actually , it can never ... it does n't constitute a factor of development .
some people say , mostly the survivors , "@ the hutu exterminated my family . @"
umh ?
he or she has no family left , not a single relative and he or she believes a certain ethnic group killed his or her people .
in order for such a person to forget and start thinking differently , important lessons need to be taught .
otherwise , the country will move forward and he or she will be left behind .
yes ... that is very good because before i forgive you , you first need to come to me and tell me ... "@ deep in my heart i feel guilty .
i did this or that to so and so and the best witness is my conscience . @"
if your conscience accuses you of what you did , then ask for forgiveness .
it is true that those you offended can only forgive you and it still does n't clear away the crime you committed .
but if you just admit it , it brings about some change as it lightens the burden they were carrying .
the additional information to what i said is ... i would like to thank so much all the people who are looking after the rwandan orphans .
especially rwandans who understood how needy those orphans are .
all those who give out a hundred francs of fifty or anything ... be it an advice ... i believe so many orphans go to school ; others try to look for a living .
personally this messes me .
another thing i would like to talk about is the way things are changing as time goes by .
many good things are happening , the way people interact with each other , the country 's security , which is very good .
so , we took our way towards kibuye , hoping that maybe we would meet the killers so that they kill us too .
when we reached at the road , we met the burgomaster bagirishema .
he was driving and inside the car , there were out two brothers .
when we saw them ... [ the car just passed us ] we tried to stop them but the car proceeded towards kibuye .
we already knew that all people who went to kibuye were dead , so we stayed wondering , " he knows that people in kibuye died , so where is he taking them ? @"
that is how they were taken ; the car continued and disappeared while we were watching helplessly .
he drove to the stadium and we stayed there but we just watched him taking them .
then we said , "@ epa must have died yet he was our elder brother .
there is no way he may have survived yet the whole place was burnt .
mum and dad with others went to kibuye . they are all died .
now they have taken aimable and ibi .
we are left only the two of us . @"
we did n't know what to do .
when we reached in that man 's home we rested .
and , after some time ... about two days later without anybody coming to search .
they were going around killing here and there .
then , there came a certain man in that group of attackers but i never knew him before .
he said , "@ we are informed that there gahizi 's cows here and his two children .
we must kill them and if not , we shall take the cows and eat them . @"
then he replied them , "@ these kids are not gahizi 's .
they are my in @-@ law daughters . [ the kids of the brother of my wife ] . @"
then they said , "@ it that is true ... ?
well if it is true that they are your in @-@ law daughters , it means that they are children of your wife 's brother .
then your wife too must die . @"
they directed her very well and so , she came in the other sorghum plantation . she came looking just ahead of the road , where we were sitting but she did n't find us there . then she started asking people around , "@ did you hear some two kids screaming while they were killed or you did n't ? then someone told her that , "@ alexis took her , we saw her in his home . but the other one we saw her going towards the attackers who were coming from the stadium . so , we do n't know what followed next . @" then she came at alexis ' home because knew each other . she asked and alexis ' sister said that i was there . then she said that , "@ she is mine , she was given to me . unless things change , otherwise the situation had improved . @" but in reality things had just started , it was in the initial phase of killings . therefore , we went back together . but i had separated with my sister and we had never seen each other again .
then dogs took off . they all came down the hill and they were every where .
then i said , "@ they rather bite me but will n't catch any . @" i sat down .
they were about twenty dogs ; they would come while barking wearing bells in their necks .
then they had reached close to where i was one of the killers communicated to the dogs to come back and go the other side , where they had seen other people .
therefore , all the dogs went there .
when the dogs ran , that is was when i heard how happy they were , saying that they have found someone .
then i prayed , "@ god , why did n't you make them come here ? @"
i saw how they were killing people and i would wonder .
i never imagined the kind of death i would die .
i got confused .
then i was them coming up with a certain man , who lived there in gacca with his wife .
he was called boniface , he was taken to mugano ‘ bamboo ’ [ a place that was named after the common plant in the area ] ; a place which is at the road that goes to kibuye , just below the commune 's office at a place where , there used to be a football court .
there used to be bamboo just near the market .
i saw that it was boniface with his wife that they were taking .
they took them to the bamboo and there was a roadblock .
they said , "@ we could n't find this man during the time of traitors .
now what kind of death should he die ? @"
i was watching every step in a distance .
but i would n't believe it ; those acts were beyond my imagination .
they used to have spears though they never used them to kill people .
they would use sharpened bamboo ; they would sharpen it till when it appears like a spear yet it was a stick .
they would display them on a line as if they were on sell .
everyone who would pass there , yet he or she was among a group of attackers . he would take one as he wished .
then he said , "@ the remaining cow is mine ; somebody gave it to me .
you took all properties , which they had given me , now the remaining cow i will n't give it to you . @" they said , "@ do n't worry we shall discuss about it when we come back .
therefore , they left .
it was in june and several days had passed .
though i never used to know days , i believed there had passed long time because it reached it july while we were still hiding .
and personally i was still hiding in august . i would n't walk in open .
while i was outside with other kids , i never entered in the house .
he was telling that , "@ if you enter in my house , they will demolish it . go and look for some where else to hide . @"
then i said , "@ should i go back and keep watching how they are hacking people with the spiked clubs ?
i will stay here , where they would kill me rather than torturing me and live me alive .
they shall kill me and finish up gahizi 's family so , they will be sure that none is alive in gahizi 's family . @"
and after she gave all the explanation they said , "@ it is impossible .
you are wasting your time explaining . @"
suddenly a certain man came out of the crowd and said , "@ i know this child , she is dative 's daughter .
i know all her ancestors ; their origin is in mushubati and they look unique .
i know her , look at her ; in fact you should die with her .
how could you be so brave to lie about things i am sure about ? @"
therefore , i changed .
i told her that , "@ i will never go to fetch water from there .
because people come and stare at me while others whisper some things to each other . they are capable of bringing people to kill me .
i should not fetch water from there anymore , maybe i can fetch ... @" there was another source of water beyond the hill . i asked her to be getting water from there .
i suggested that because i knew there was a sorghum plantation and that was where i used to live in peace .
therefore , i wanted to be living there and go back to her place to eat , that is if she wanted to give food to me .
but when i live in the plantation in peace .
she agreed and said , "@ truly they can kill you from there ... @" in her minds she thought we would always live together and i would keep working for her in her home .
so , she accepted .
i would take a jeri can and whenever i would see people looking at me so much , i would look into the water .
i would do that depending on the type of people who would be staring at me . for example , people who would come talking to each other in a funny way .
"@ thy are going to kill me . @"
i would think . but i would feel like ... i had started understanding that i must n't die .
i had realized that death was not the solution .
it was due to the fact that there were no more people dying .
in that place there were not many people dying , maybe they had finished them .
therefore , i would sit and after they would pass i would sit and go through my past life ; how things happened , how people died and think about the future ; "@ what will the future be like ? @"
i begun my journey to rubengera .
on my way i met about two or three people only .
people had stopped moving .
umh !
that scared me too .
"@ i have walked three kilometers and i have only met three people .
maybe people finished .
maybe even where i am going they may not be there .
where would i go ? @"
i was confused .
i continued walking alone and finished the journey .
i left the other place at around 11:00 a.m. but due to the sorrows , i would move saying , "@ what if i sit here by the roadside ?
what if i pretend as if i am looking for some place and then go to ask in a certain home maybe they would shelter me or call upon the killers to kill me in case they can not stand me . @"
i had several problems but i would find death as the easiest solution .
umh ?
it was the only solution that would get me out of there .
therefore , i kept on delaying on the way and reached there when it was already dark . i reached there at around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. on my way i met very few people like i told you .
there was no car passing in the road .
therefore , i said , "@ is over people finished .
where will i go ? @" i asked myself .
it also became a problem like the other one .
however i never thought about going back .
even if people killed me from the roadside or ... but not colonizing me in a home with the situation that i was in . i believed we would never understand each other .
yes i was still living in that family .
which means that i was till living in the house .
they were no longer searching in houses .
but for example there is some man they killed later in september ... in august .
a certain man was killed .
he screamed ; he was somewhere on the road .
there were some sorghum plants ... it was a sorghum plantation so he screamed and they found out that it was someone they had just hit a club .
he had hid himself all the time but at last in late august ... in the beginning of september ... because we were preparing to go to school .
people were walking in open , me too i would move without any problem .
when we got there we saw her .
and from there we boarded the taxi that was going to kigali and left .
yes we met . she got married of recent so we met .
she lives just here in muhima and we visit each other without any problem .
the whole village !
that village , kigabiro , was a little bit apart .
my grand mother was living there with her five sons who had built their houses there .
it was a very big family !
it was a hill standing like .... but then the killers destroyed everything without sparing anything .
but when we went back there [ after the war ] we found out that ... in fact , those people were did n't destroy anyhow , they used to remove bricks one by one then took them at their places to use them building .
in 1995 , when we went there , we found that some people had built then put the doors of our home to their houses .
andt the mselves told us , "@ so and so took some bricks from your house and as you can see , they used them to build the fence .
and he also put , obviously , the door that was on your house on his ! @"
i was just a kid but i could see that life was fine , there was nothing wrong !
we were seven kids and there was no problem at all with my father 's relatives @-@ they were five boys and four girls , all of them were married except one .
they were living in that village and it was ... i just do n't know how to say it !
it very nice , there is nothing that i would n't miss anything !
all of us @-@ seven kids @-@ were going to school and above all our parents loved us too much and they were the kind of people who always show us love and emphasize education as they were .
they were always there to make us feel good to the extent that we would feel like there is nothing wrong that could happen to us .
i just do n't know how to express it ! it was like living in paradise without any worry .
i never worried at all and i think that 's the reason why it was hard for me to live with people who treated me bad .
in fact , i never knew about it ! i was never used to that kind of life , i did n't even see that happening in the neighborhood !
i 'm positive about gacaca and i really support the idea because i belive that a perpetrator can denounce another one . i think it 's just a way to try to stop people from being afraid or just simplify the situation . but i am sure that if you get a perpetrator somewhere and ask him to tell you exactly what happened bevcause you know that something happened there , he will n't tell you anything ! i think they shoud talk and say exactly what happened and say things like "@ i was here and this is how it was ... @" then he can plead guilty or deny his participation or say that he had been influenced ...
i believe you see some with aids not because they walked in such or such ways but because she wanted something and could n't afford it .
not because they ... i do n't know how to put it ... it is just because they wanted to do what their fellows did hoping that she would be as successful as their fellow was .
but that is not the way things are .
all the time you have to ask yourself , "@ who am i ? @"
thinking about who you are ... the kind of a person you are , and then you behave according to who you are rather than imitating someone else .
the following day in the morning we all [ the three of us ] left .
we went to a certain place called runda and then to a place called gihinga .
when we reached a certain roadblock , they stopped us .
they asked mum to give them her identity card .
but she did n't have one .
then they asked her ; "@ whose kids are those ? @"
she told them we were not her kids , that we were just walking together .
they made her sit on a pit .
we refused to leave her .
we stayed there waiting for them to kill us , but they did n't .
after sometime , a group of interahamwe came .
when they reached there , one of them said to the rest , "@ i know this old lady , she is not a tutsi . @"
that 's how we survived then and went on .
i had a godmother in a certain place called ruzege .
mum took me there , but when we got there , they said that they could not hide such a big number of people , that they would also be killed .
but they allowed me to stay with them and asked mum and my sister to look for elsewhere to go .
therefore , they left and i stayed there .
but we had other relatives in a place called nyamiyaga in musambira commune .
when they reached there , they found they had all been killed .
mum immediately left for kabgayi and my sister stayed there with other kids who were there and they hid together .
after mum reached kabgayi , we never got to know what happened to her ; i wonder if she died or if she 's still alive , but she most probably died .
since the war ended , we have never seen her .
we do n't even know even know how she was killed ... neither where she died .
mostly , the hardest part in life is how to find food . because in life when you neither have where to get food from nor someone to help or care about you ; someone to find out if you have any problem , you feel like life is far from treating you well .
he is still alive .
he was once arrested ; karakezi killed a lot of people .
even if you asked him , "@ how many people did you kill ? @"
he would say he does n't know .
he was arrested for some time and later they released him becaused he said the truth and admitted his crimes .
now he is at his home .
explain about what ?
a message about what ?
that 's all .
they put us in a house where ... a house that belonged to some interahamwe nearby .
when we got there , we sat and the casualties laid down .
the men and women who were n't injured were cooking for the casualties and taking care of them .
an interahamwe came alone , he followed the people who were cooking , he entered and saw many people and quickly took the pin out of a grenade as people were screaming and threw it .
it fell on a lady who was near me and she died straight away .
the inkotanyis came by as soon as they heard the greande and the interahamwes run towards the back .
there , he met some people who were cooking and shot a boy who was with my dad and he died right away .
tell me about your life before genocide .
me ... mother ?
she has them inside her leg but she used to go to king faycal hospital for treatment and there was some improvement ... she 's getting better with time .
mother is a teacher at saint joseph , father is a manager of a bank in kicukiro .
life before ... i did n't have a scar on the head ... my parents ... dad had both arms ... today he can n't just do any job , we were lucky he was very educated and that allowed him to quickly adjust to this new life .
but of course life was much better than it was before the war .
00:27 manu do you know how your family members were killed ?
the life to come ?
development ... but again , development goes hand in hand with unity or with understanding among the people .
and then there needs to be tolerance among the people .
because , let 's take the example of the gacaca jurisdictions , some people were killed , others were charged of murder and maybe the ones accusing them are dying of aids ; maybe some of them will be released because there will n't be anyone to charge them .
but maybe somewhere in the village , there will be someone else in their deathbed who was unable to go and accuse him .
if the charged man really has it at heart to be united with the people he wronged , then he can make a step towards that person and work it out himself .
that way , i believe rwanda will develop because there will n't be any suspicion in the hearts of the people .
i 'd like to say that the fact that us rwandans are still alive and able to give out this message shows that there has been a change .
that change needs to remain forever and even improve .
the change is that people are free to express themselves today .
there 's freedom and one can say @: "@ today , i can do anything without it being harmful to my friend . @"
i believe that 's what development is all about .
they proceeded only with my father . my mother was left behind to die of sorrow .
then my father was handed to another gang of killers on mwendo hill . and when he saw the perpetrators with machetes and clubs , he decided to run away .
as he ran , the group that took him there acted as though they did not want to kill him .
the other group ran after him and grabbed him . he could n't run very fast as he was tired and chased by many people at the same time .
they lead him towards kiryango river and when they reached there , his whole body was tied ; arms and legs were tightly tied and then they drowned him alive .
it was the rainy season . it was raining heavily and water carried him as it flowed .
his executioners cast stones on him , aiming his head and saying , "@ he knows how to swim , he may get out of the water . @"
they did so until he died .
they went to their homes .
then i stood and asked myself if i knew where i was going .
"@ what kind of a life is this ?
oh god , i wish i had died !
if they see me , will they kill me ? @" i asked myself . but i was freezing and the more the wind blew on my neck , the more the injury caused by the hammer would swell .
my neck was swollen , almost to the size of my head .
then i started walking like this ... i wondered where to go ... i remembered a village called buha where my friends whom we went to school together and with whom we used to play drum together during the holidays lived .
they were called karangwa and rurangwa their father 's name was ndongozi .
but those boys had become terrible interahamwes .
but i still decided to go there because i thought that even if they went ahead and killed me , they would n't subject me to grave tortures before killing me .
but in order to go to their home , i had to cross a river called ruhondo .
and when i reached the water , i first rolled into it so as to get rid of all the excrements and maggots .
after a while i said to myself ... around that place there was a camp of habyarinama 's soldiers in a place called gafunzo .
as i approached that area , i heard people shouting and smoking drugs . "@ these must be soldiers and they are going to kill me @"@ , i thought . then i went back to our abandoned home where i found our dogs .
when the dogs saw me , they tried to follow me but i chased them away and i passed though a nearby bush .
around there , lived a man called pascal kamonyo , whose wife was my godmother . and my sister called mukaburabyo pelagie had hid in their home .
during the war , serubibi hid at mr. gwiza dionizi 's where he met many other boys [ tutsis ] who were planning to join the rpf troops .
he insisted that he wanted to go with them but he was too young to join the army .
they just went with him .
we were living in byimana and he was across in gahengeri .
some day , those boys were walking around in byimana and saw me by chance .
they met my mum and sister and after confirming that we survived , they went and brought him to us .
since then we have been living together . i guess you can now tell how many we are now ; two of us had survived , [ my sister and i ] then we got our young brother , plus our mum .
therefore , we are four .
later we heard that our first @-@ born sister who was married survived .
we met her in kinazi when we were going to a place called rwabusoro towards bugesera .
that 's how we survived .
no , they would just come to teach us and ask us , "@ why are you not in any party ? @"
but we would just tell them that we did n't belong to any party .
they would come to us ... hope you know how people from gitarama are hypocrits . they used to come to us and say things but they would n't force us .
force rose when they started hunting for inkotanyi . they would go to a certain home and search everywhere looking for the inkotayi .
i remember in 1992 that 's when they came to search at home .
there was a cousin who had come to visit us from nyanza .
so they came claiming that we were sheltering an inkotanyi soldier but instead of searching they looked for our local brew and started drinking .
and finally they left .
i was very lucky to recognize my older brother thanks to his trousers .
i reburied his remains at our home .
i even saw my sister in law 's body , the one who had been thrown in the pit the time i was also dumped there .
i recognized her thanks to her clothes too [ she was in her underwear ] we reburied her too .
others were buried together with the help of the local authorities .
no one was left in the pit .
they did not kill us because of the relationship between us ; they respected us . even though we were the only [ tutsi ] family in the area , they did n't take advantage of that .
fathers would warn their sons not to kill us because of a ritual pact of blood never to betray each other they had signed with our parents .
so they would n't kill us although they had the intention to do so .
some of their sons became interahamwe ; they even went for training and when they came back , they just wanted to finish us .
leaving us alive was partly due to the cowardice of rwandans , the fear to be the one to start off the fire .
they would say , "@ i can not be the one to kill them first @" due to historical reasons .
but later , they were the ones to commit the terrible murders .
i was born in 1977 . therefore , during the genocide i was about 16 years old .
i followed them because i wanted to see where they were going , in order to know where to pass . it was at night and they were drunk . after i verified that they had entered their homes , i found my way .
in fact , i did n't have anywhere to go , i was just wandering around . that is why i followed them .
marcel
from what i see , there is a change in the leadership in rwanda . there is a distinct change in leadership .
during the former government , there were several barriers ; it was a problem to get a school if you were a tutsi , it was hard to study .
but today people have proper access to schools .
however , in the aspect of ideology for example ; things never changed at all .
it is just because rwandans never say the truth ; people can appear as lambs yet inside they are beasts .
we live together but we do n't trust each other .
but as far as freedom studying is concerned much has improved . there is also freedom of speech in our country . nowadays , one can express his ideas with no fear , which is a great change compared to the past .
what can you tell those who do n't know rwanda ?
whatever the case , when i tell my testimony ... especially when i know that i am telling to someone i trust , someone who is willing to listen to me , i feel like i have given out part of my burden to be carried by someone else .
it is like someone who comes from doing sports sweating , and then he rests a bit and takes shower , then he is given something to eat .
he will find it so sweet and tasty .
in comparison to my story , when i give out my testimony instead of keeping everything to myself , i feel like i have shared it with someone .
it is like some one has helped me to carry my burden and i feel it reducing inside my heart .
at such times , i even sleep peacefully .
what are your names ?
in brief , i was young but i can remember some .
there were parties like unar , parmehutu ... mdr @-@ parmehut , rader , and prosoma .
however mdr @-@ parmehutu was a hutu party and unar was for tutsi .
members of unar party were on the king 's sid ; those are the people who were in the king 's party .
therefore those hutus were against unar .
and then later the hutus became more powerful than the tutsi because they got support from the belgians .
they abused the tutsi and destroyed their houses .
on the tutsi 's gate there was a picture of a tutsi in white clothes and on the hutu 's gate there was a red piece of cloth .
there were airplanes everywhere in the skies .
therefore those colors were to help them identify between the hutu 's home and the tutsi 's home . they would put the red piece of cloth in front of the house and hung it in a tree .
therefore , they would tell it was a hutu 's house and the one with out one , they would tell it was a tutsi 's home . even hutus from other areas would tell the tutsi 's home and burn it .
they would eat cattle and even killed them [ tutsis ] .
that was the reason why some people fled in 1959 ; because they were subjected to torturend .
the tutsi ethnic was tortured .
still it was the hutus torturing and killing the tutsi .
the situation continued like that till 1960s ...
yes we came back home .
they had said that there was some stability as they always did . they would say that , "@ things have stablised , people should come back home . @"
then we returned home . others proceeded and ended up going to exile .
my brother was among those who did n't come back home .
well let 's go straight to the 1994 genocide .
you said it was the most horrible time .
would you tell us in a detailed way , how you persisted in 1994 till when you survived ?
tell us how they killed your children or your husband or your relatives ... tell us how you struggled to hid , how it was or if you were injured or hurt ... things of the sort but much more information .
tell us what happened till when you survived .
tell us how your relatives died . you earlier told us that you separeted with your husband during the time of war , do you know how he died ?
we left saint andre and went back to muhima in an abandoned house and lived there till the day avaga came and found some american benefactors who built for us the first phase houses .
the second phase was built by farg .
then life continued and children started going to school because farg was giving out scholarships .
though we are still poor i thank them because our children are studying well .
generally , our problem is poverty like else where .
listen ... gacaca ... people who voted for gacaca , i neither dismiss them nor disrespect them .
but how i used to understand gacaca from the past experience is different from today 's gacaca .
gacaca used to take place once someone had grazed his cattle on the fellow 's crops or if two people had faught together .
then they would report to gacaca courts where they would later reconcile the two .
but i had never had of gacaca for the killers ... [ she gulped ] . i do n't even have words to say about it .
that so called gacaca ... it came into existance in order to set those perpetrators free ; those who would admit that they killed ahundred people would be set free .
i hear that in gacaca perpetrators ask for forgiveness , or they will be asking for forgiveness .
what about those who are already released ? did they ask for forgiveness ?
if yes , whom did they ask for forgiveness ?
umh !
who did they ask for forgiveness ; is it the government or is it the people whom they killed their loved ones ... ?
what happened exactly ?
that is the question we ask ourselves .
from no where one hears that so and so was released , yet you had convicted him or her because you witnessed his or her deeds .
then one starts wondering ; "@ did they find him or her innocent for them to release him or her ... ? @"
that is a big issue .
no body knows how the government goes about it . but if we concinder our acient rwandan gacaca , there was no gacaca for killers before .
it is beyond my imagination ... i can n't even understant it .
"@ gacaca for killers ! @"
it is unbelievable !
listen , the most hardest thing that is ever remembered and faces everybody to whom it concerns ; be it a widow who once had a husband and today she is surffering , definetely she will realise that she is suffering because the husband died .
be it the young children who have to mature before time , they will bare that grief of prematuring yet they were surpposed to be sat before their parents like other children of their age .
therefore , those things can be so hurting .
when it comes to a tough problem of tracing a living , especialy on special days .
for example , some children mature and reach a time of marrying .
those children begin saying , "@ i wish i at least had an aunt or one of my parents . @"
it becomes a very big problem . there are several problems in fact everything reminds those days .
i have finished .
it had heavily rained .
it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and it was getting dark .
people were coming and going .
some were saying they were going to kigali but they still would be killed on their way and the ones who had managed to survive would come back .
others went to the ntarama church because there were some people who had been able to survive there for some days . in general , things were so scary .
so i told my older sister whom we had run together , " let 's not spend the night here , it does n't look safe here .
how can we sleep here ? @"
and then some policemen came and called some of the people who were there .
they asked the people there , "@ what is the noise all about and why are you fleeing ? @"
they replied , " we are fleeing from the hutu .
they want to kill us . @"
then the policemen said , "@ calm down , it is over now .
gather up in one place there in the church so that we ensure your security . @"
in that house there were other tutsi who used to come and hide in it . they would spend the whole day in the swamp and the night in those houses .
i was lucky i had other people with me .
i used to spend the day alone in that house .
one day , they went to the swamp and in the evening they came back with my brother .
they used to hide during the day in the swamp , and in the evening , after the interahamwe 's leaving , my borther would bring me some sweet potatoes in a small bucket .
but he would go back after because he never used to sleep in those houses .
he used to sleep in another place called bitera .
after a few days , they left and never came back .
but within a short time , there came a certain interahamwe who used to work as a gardener at home doing part @-@ time jobs . he married a lady in the neighbourhood .
when i went to see her , she had thought no one had survived .
she was surprised to see me and although she saw how i had changed , she was happy that at least i was still alive .
she asked me if there could be anybody else who survived and i told her that there was none .
the time the inkotanyi saved us . one of the soldiers said , "@ the hutu do not really have any sham ; how could they dare hack a halfcaste person ! @"
he said that after seeing how i was looking like ; my hair was overgrown .
he could n't believe how they dare such crime .
so i lived with my aunt who had a daughter .
her grandson who is a soldier later on came with his wife and we all stayed together .
then i went to live in kacyiru together with my cousin 's spouse ; we met by chance and she told me that she did not know anyone in the family had survived and she could not continue to live alone .
she asked me to go and live with her .
at that time , people used to make decision at the spur of the moment .
we went together but she got sick and died after some time .
i then went back to kimihurura to live with my aunt ; we later on shifted in the neighbourhood of ‘ chez lando ’ restaurant where she owned her own house .
after sometime she also died and life went on ... i went to avega and asked them for a house to live in , and i was lucky they gave me one .
there were some children who were my relatives i brought in and we continued to live together up to now , that is how i am living .
what do you mean by families of those people who killed mine ?
i do n't know them .
he was not lucky ; he was caught among the ones who were confined for a long period .
yes , they came when they were grown @-@ ups .
my name is umuhire diane , i was 10 years old during the war .
this was our house , it is in kicukiro commune , sahara sector , niboye cell .
we were n't able to find out who their families were .
so your father was killed later on ?
i 'd like you to tell me how you feel towards this place .
how do you feel when you come here ?
six people lost their lives here , 5 from this family and somebody else ... they were our neighbours and they used to live on the other side of our home .
thanks to you .
on thursday morning ... it was on the 7th of april ; they came wearing dry banana leaves , some things , which looked like wings on their heads .
i saw them from the window and got so scared because i thought they were coming to kill us .
fortunately , there was a certain man who once was a bergomaster in nyarugenge commune ; he was called bakomera jean pierre .
he stopped them and told them that , "@ do n't attack these people , they are not rwandans . just leave them . @"
were the victims hacked or shot to death ?
they were killed here , there was a bus stop sign , but now as you can see it was moved to up there .
we remember so much , because our parents , relatives and friends died from here , everytime i pass here i remember and see because i can picture the time .
how were those people killed ?
personally would you like people to know what took place here ?
they should know what happened since what happened was not good and no one would wish for it to happen again .
over 2,000 people .
i am saying this because none of the people on this hill came back . in addition , most of people sought refuge in that bush hoping that some of them would survive .
there were 5,000 more people who had fled towards gahanga but they were forced to turn back .
there were other ones who were coming from giporoso , kicukiro , samuduha ... the killers were tracking them down as though they were dogs .
joseph rwagapfizi .
he stil works for damascene .
after bringing their victims till here , the perpetrators used to throw them into the pit . some were thrown in while still alive .
others after being cut down with machetes . no one could escape them ! then they mixed up their bodies to the bones of cows since there were many cows here .
this had actually become their home , they ate cow meat ... people were bringing to them those who were meant to be killed .
very few were killed by bullet , they used to say they did n't want to waste their munitions .
they were chasing people with dogs all around them .
the consequence is that we still have so many victims ' bones to bury in respect . it will n't even be possible because this place is very wide !
for example , we were shown this place only very recently by pastors who work at the rubirizi diary .
they have been here for 10 years and we only found them recently ! we shall then request the government that these people are buried in honor .
