my name is odette umulisa , daughter of matthias kamuhanda and of yulida nyiramatama .
i am from mabanza commune , in a place called rubengera , in rubengera sector , in mataba cell .
we were many in my family ... we were many .
i had 4 brothers called alfred , edouard , uwitonze and shumbusho .
shumbusho is still alive today .
i had one little sister called ngirabakunzi .
but she did n't ... no ne was ab ... she did n't survive .
only my brother shumbusho , my mother and i survived in my family .
my father also passed away .
i would say it all started when i was still very young .
i remember how when i was in primary school , they used to tell us to stand every year and then they 'd ask us to tell them about our ethnicity .
i remember how the first time they told us to stand up , they told the hutus to stand up and then the tutsis , i was in primary iii and that was the first time i was seeing something like this .
i did n't know what tribe i was and thus i remained seated .
the rest stood up , first the group of the hutus , then the tutsis .
our teacher was also a neighbour and she knew my tribe as she knew my father ; he asked me why i did not stand up and i asked her why i should have stood up and she asked me @: "@ do n't you know you 're tutsi ? @"
then i stood up ; i remember how my friends started mocking me saying @: "@ so you 're also tutsi ? @"
that 's how i states learning things about ethnicity .
i later on went home . i remember meeting dad on my way home .
i was very sad and i asked him why my friends had laughed at me telling me i am a tutsi .
"@ what does being tutsi mean ? @"
i asked him .
he told me @: "@ i do n't know how to explain that to you ... that 's just the way things are ... @" he told me he would one day explain to me as i needed to know that i was actually tutsi .
he said he also found things that way ... when i got home , i asked mother for more explanations .
she then told me @: "@ in rwanda , there are twas , hutus and tutsis .
this is not something that should make you feel sad or cry .
you are tutsi . @"
she went ahead and told me about my grandfather whom i never met . she explained to me that the reason why i did n't meet him was because there were some bad people who believed the tutsi was a bad person .
she told me it was n't true and we are all the same and i should never believe such a thing .
it went on like that and they used to tell us to stand up every year .
i finally got used to it and stop feeling like being a tutsi was an issue .
i remember a conversation i had with mom while i was in primary iv .
i wanted more explanations and she then told me what exactly happened to my grandfather .
she told me how in 1959 , they came and took her dad , she was 16 and a mature person .
she told me he was taken away together with other members of his family .
she told me how she followed him to the car where they tied his hands and put him in with other people .
she told me she followed that car throughout her neighbourhood as they were picking up everyone whose name was on their list .
he told me about other members of her dad 's family who were taken away at that time as well .
she told me how they never found out what exactly happened to her father but that he was taken by some hutus secondary school students who told them how he was killed .
she told me they threw them in a pit in ruhengeri but i do n't know the exact location in ruhengeri .
then came the multiparty system in 1990 .
things went wrong in our area .
but i was n't there for long , i moved to gisenyi where i lived with some of mother 's relatives .
she is from gisenyi .
in gisenyi , things were worse than in kibuye .
maybe in kibuye people acted as though everything was fine , but in gisenyi , they were doing it in the open .
they used to tell us that they 'd one day kill us .
but i thought that was impossible .
mother had explained to me that my grandfather was killed because he was a tutsi , saying he used to go the royal court but i did n't believe that was the reason he was killed .
i felt like maybe there 's something else he did that made them kill him .
i did n't believe that one could be killed just because they were tutsi .
but in 1990 , things were so bad in gisenyi that i started seeing that it was true , the were killing the ‘ abagogwes ’ [ a tutsi clan in the north of rwanda ] ; so i could see where things were heading , i even realized that one day it would probably reach me or any other tutsi .
i left gisenyi [ she starts crying ... ] and when to see my father after a long time .
that was in 1992 ... i had n't seen him in a long time as i had been living with my mother 's relatives .
i was a grown up and him and i had a serious conversation .
he told me to visiting him as things were going to be very bad soon .
"@ maybe i will never see you again my daughter @" he said while i was about to leave .
i told him @: "@ we will see each other again , dad !
the inkotanyis are fighting now and hopefully they 'll win the war before anything wrong happens to us . @"
i only went back home 5 months later and we would talk about what was going on .
i talked with my brothers , the one who followed me was only a year younger than me .
edouard told me @: "@ odette , things are going to be really bad around here and i want to leave .
since you live in gisenyi , i 'd like you to get me a way of fleeing to zaire [ current congo drc ] because we will all be killed . @"
i told him we were going to be okay but i promised him to look for a way as i had friends in goma .
"@ i 'll find you a way to reach goma and then go to the battle field .
maybe one of us will survive that way @"@ , i said .
he insisted that i assure him that i was going to do it for him and i promised i 'd do so .
i went back to gisenyi and there was a woman called immaculee . i told her about my 2 young brothers , still strong , who needed to flee the country , i told her i needed her help . she told me she was going to help me do that .
i told edouard to get ready . i went back to kibuye and told my dad about it , he said it would be great if it 's possible to get my brothers out of the country so that we would not all be killed . he was desperate , as though he already knew he was going to die . i was home on a monday and i remember telling edouard to get read and join me on friday .
that was in 1993 .
he got ready and found me in gisenyi with another young man who was his very good friend although he was hutu . he said he 'd follow him in exile . he said he was not just going to watch them kill my brother , he said he did n't want to survive him . he was called munyensanga .
i remember how surprised i was when i saw munyensanga , wondering if they were going to go together .
i tried reasoning him saying that edouard was fleeing because they were targeting us and we knew they 'd kill us even though it had n't happened yet .
he said that if edouard was going to leave , he 'd go with him .
i went and talked to immaculee and she told me everything was ready for them to leave on saturday .
a friend of mine called alivera came and told me she did n't think it was a good idea to let them cross the border .
she said that although munyensanga had n't said exactly when she was leaving , she had told them she was fleeing with edouard .
she advised me not to let them go as they 'd know i sent my brother away with munyensanga and they were going to kill me .
"@ his family will not be happy to hear that you sent them to the inkotanyis @"@ , she said .
i ended up not sending edouard , i was selfish and i sent him back to kibuye .
i told him it would be too dangerous for me when they find out .
he begged me to take him to immaculee but he refused .
edouard went back to kibuye and looked for a way to leave from there but never succeeded .
that was the last time i saw him , he went to kayove after that , he was scared to go back home and he went to hide in kavoye where mom is from , in a place called nkurutu .
he went to hide there and the war occurred before he went back home and that 's where he was killed .
i begged her and told her that she was the only one who knew i was tutsi because she knew my dad and that no one was going to find out unless she told them .
i remember her younger sister 's child was at home and he @/@ she had a fine nose ... i remember telling her how my nose was n't even as fine as his or hers and nobody could think i am tutsi unless she reported me .
she refused and demanded that i leave her house .
we were 3 ladies who were living with her , one of them was called melanie , she was married but i heard they were separated with her husband ... she was married to a white man .
she had also come to visit him .
there was also another lady called maria ... she told me @: "@ go ! @"
i asked her where i should go and she told me i should just go but she told me i just needed to leave her house .
she said if she kept me in her house , she 'd be taking the risk of being killed as well .
there was nowhere to pass and i did n't even know kigali well enough .
she chased me and i remember heading to ... there was nowhere else to go and i went to hide in the toilets at her house , at the back side .
i remember meeting a lady they were calling mama giramata there .
she was surprised to see me and she said @: "@ so , you 're also a tutsi ? @"
"@ yes ! @"
i replied .
then i asked her if she thought they were really going to kill us .
she told me that she knew i had a white boyfriend and i should start asking god for forgiveness if i had been involved in some sin .
she said we were certainly going to die .
she also suggested that i go and ask jules to help me flee . but i felt like ... i do n't if it was due to my young age or if it was that i was n't very intelligent but i thought ... i told her i did n't want him and i 'd prefer that he takes me to my dad if he had the ability to do so because i really wanted to see dad and edouard , i wanted to ask edouard for forgiveness as i felt like i should have let him leave and even taken the risk to be killed for him to be saved .
where exactly where you in kigali ?
i was in rugunga , in kigali . that 's where i was when the war broke up .
mama giramata told me @: "@ do n't say you 're going to kibuye ! which way would you use ?
pray and ask god for forgiveness .
i left her in the toilets , went and told maria @: "@ please maria , do n't chase me !
where will i go ? @"
she said @: "@ i am from doctor jean 's house and they told me they 've killed them .
so you and melanie should go to doctor 's house and look of there 's anyone who survived .
i was there and i saw blood but i was n't able to check inside if there 's any survivor . @"
i think she lied to me and she had been too afraid to enter . i do n't think she entered .
melanie and i went to jean 's home , that 's when i understood that it was over .
for the first time , i saw people who had been killed , everyone had been killed , even the children had been killed .
i remember an 8 year old child who was laying next to his or her mother , i then understood that it was over .
we got inside the house looking for something we could use to cover them but there 's nothing as everything had been looted .
we left jean 's house ... melanie was very scared , she told me she was n't sure she 'd survive or if i would neither .
she asked me she wanted me to choose among her many clothes the ones i liked when we get home , she said i could wear them if i happened to survive .
i laugh at myself whenever i remember that because when we got to maria 's house , i went among her clothes and chose the nice ones and tied them into a shirt and we left .
we went to a quarry that was in rugunga .
we used paths between houses and we passed dead bodies all over the place .
melanie was a lot more afraid than i was .
i felt i was strong .
we went and sat there .
in the evening , we left the place for helene 's house . helene was maria 's younger sister .
we begged her to hide us and she said she had no place where to hide us as everyone had become so wicked .
she told us to go and sit in the kitchen .
she took good care of us til evening then she told us to leave as she had no place where to hide us .
she told melanie to go back to maria since she 'd live with her for a long time and beg her again to hide us .
we went back there but it was n't easy to find a way to use .
we came out at the neighbours ' and found that they 'd already caught other people and they took melanie and i together with them .
there were many other people i did n't know , i did n't know many people in that area as i had only been there for 3 days .
the war started when i had been there for 3 days , i was just a visitor .
they took us to the kigali sports club [ cercle sportif de kigali ] in rugunga . there 's a woman who was with us whom i 'll always remember .
she had a very small baby , about 3 months old .
on our way , we met a friend of hers and she begged her to take the baby with her .
she refused saying that she could n't take the baby as our last day had come [ the tutsis ' last day ] .
i also remember that melanie kept reassuring me all the way .
they took us to a place that was kind of flat , the ‘ cercle ’ is actually kind of flat .
they started to shoot , both children and adults were begging for pity in vain .
some children were asking for forgiveness and even promised never to be tutsis again in vain .
i was so frightened i fell down !
many people fell on me , melanie included .
but melanie did n't ... about an hour later , when everyone was dead , i heard melanie 's voice calling @: "@ odette ! odette !
are you still alive ? @"
i replied that i was still alive .
she helped me remove the corpses that were on top of me .
she had been very wounded by the bullets .
she got me out of there and said @: "@ we do n't have anywhere else to go and it 's almost morning and when it 's daytime , they 'll find out that we 're still alive . @"
she suggested that we go backt o helene 's .
we went back to helene 's house and entered the kitchen and sat there , they did n't used to lock .
melanie was bleeding very much throughout and she was so frightened that she was trembling .
we stayed there until helene came in the morning to make some tea .
she was surprised to find us still alive .
she asked us about the rest of the people and we told her everyone else had been killed .
she said if we remained there , we 'd still be killed anyway . she said we should stay there until she came back and she went to look for someone who would agree to hide us .
we ate .
melanie was very tired .
helene did n't find anyone willing to hide us .
she told us to make the effort to go and sit in some bush at the querry despite the fact the melanie was so weak , until she finds a better place where to hide us .
in the evening , she took us there .
as we were sitting there , melanie told me she was very tired .
she told me i needed to find another place where to hide .
i remember leaving her house one day in the morning , it was raining heavily and she told me to go back to helene 's house .
helene told me that the fact she asked me to leave the day meant they 'd all seen me and they 'd soon be looking for me .
it was too dangerous for her to hide in those conditions .
she told me to go to the quarry , there was a man who was giving out identity cards for those who had lost theirs .
she told me not to show him my id and to just tell him that i was a hutu and that i had lost my id . i walked up in the day without trying to hide myself .
when i reached kiyovu , there was a roadblock ; it was raining heavily .
they stopped me and asked me where i was from .
i told them i lived at maria 's and they said they did n't know me .
i told me i had been sent and they said i was lying to them and i was a tutsi .
i denied it and told i was n't a tutsi at all and it 's just that i had been sent .
one of them had a gun . he told me @: "@ listen !
tell me the truth if you are a tutsi .
i promise not kill you if you acknowledge you are one .
but if you say you 're a hutu and i find out you are n't , i will n't have mercy on you ! @"
he asked me for my id and i got it out of my pocket and gave it to him .
then i said to him @: "@ i am sorry for lying to you , i am a tutsi .
but please have mercy on me as you 've just promised . @"
he looked at it then said @: "@ you 're an inyenzi , go and sit there ! @"
i went and sat next to 3 young men and an old man who looked handsome .
i do n't know but ... they used to say the tutsis had a long nose , a long face and that 's the way he looked .
he had all the tutsi features they used to describe .
i kept staring at him , hoping that he 'd ask them to have mercy on me but he did n't say anything .
then one of them ... the man with a gun moved backwards , i think he want to kill me because he stood behind me and loaded his gun .
i was so terrified i did n't even ask ... i panicked .
then his friend said @: "@ are you going to kill her here ?
we do n't even have a hoe to bury her . if you kill her here , she 'll rot here and start smelling bad . where will we put her ? @"
he then said @: "@ just leave her , there 's a car that went to nyamirambo to bring tutsis , the presidential guardians [ gp ] are the ones driving it . let them come and take her with others . @"
i just sat there in the rain .
at some point , a passerby i had never met before .
he knew that interahamwe .
he asked , "@ why did you get that girl to sit there ? @" he replied to him that i was an inyenzi .
he was like , "@ you guys are actually killing everyone on the pretext that they are inyenzis ! @"
his reply was that what he meant was that i was a tutsi and that they were expecting a car from nyamirambo that will be having tutsis in it and i would go with them .
he came back to me and asked , "@ where are you from ? @"
i told him i am from kibuye .
he asked me where exactly in kibuye and i replied , "@ in rubengera . @"
he then exclaimed , "@ where in rubengera ? whose daughter are you ?
whose daughter are you ? @" i told him our place is called ruvumbu , on your way to mutaba .
i told him that was called matthias kamuhanda .
he asked me if i knew a protestant pastor called nzabahimana in kibuye . i told him i knew him .
he went to talk to his friend , i do n't know what he told him because they were n't near me .
then he came back and told me , "@ i asked him to let you go and so you can leave but do n't go where tou were going ... where were you going by the way ? @"
i explained to him that i was going to look for an identity card with a man who gives them out up there because i had been told that if i had one that said i was a hutu , i would n't be killed .
he told me that the person who told me that had lied to me and that the man would kill me .
he told me to go back where i was coming from ... i went back to the quarry where melanie and i hid ourselves on the first day .
i was in the same bush till evening then i went back to helene 's house to ask her to hide me once again or to help me get someone else to hide me .
helene told me that she did n't have anyone or anywhere to send me to and that i was betrayed the day her own sister chased me out of her home .
she said if her sister had kept me in her house , no one would have ever known my tribe .
then she said she was going to ask therese to hide me yet again .
therese told her she could n't as her own mother was a tutsi and her mom had her with a congolese man and everyone knew that .
her other siblings had tutsi fathers .
she said she could n't take me in because if they found me in her house , they 'd kill us all .
i went to mama olivier 's home , that 's where helene took me but again mama olivier was waiting for them to come and kill her as she was also a tutsi .
but she told me i could stay there with her and it was okay if they came and killed us together .
i only stayed there for 3 days and then she asked one of her neighbours to kindly keep me because mama olivier herself was being hunted and they 'd certainly kill her if they found me in her house .
she then took me to her friend 's home .
i was there for about 2 days ... helene kept on pleading with therese and she finally agreed to take me in with her again .
by then , people in rugunga had all been killed .
later on , the inkotanyis kept on fighting and fighting .
when they reached a place called imburabuturo , people had toleave their homes for sometime .
but when they came back to their homes , therese told me that she was going to lock me in and if she ever came back , she would not keep me with her because things were really be bad then , she explained that they could even come on the next day searching in her house and find me there .
i remember helene begging her to keep me with her and she said she had already helped me a lot despite the fact that she did n't know me and she could n't continue risking her life for me .
she said she expected them to come soon and kill her siblings and her mother and she believed they 'd kill her as well .
then helene told me not to worry and that she was going to get someone else who could hide me .
she left and came back saying that she found a benefactor old lady from kibuye where i also come from and the latter understood my situation and she was willing to hide me .
she directed me to that place , she told me to go and knock on the third gate .
"@ she will hide you because i have already talked to her about you . @"
when therese came home , i told her to be patient with me as i had found someone else to hide me .
i remember living therese 's house at night . i went to mama sania the old lady 's house .
but i did n't know the place very well and i knocked on someone else 's gate by mistake .
they asked me where iwas going and i told them i was looking for mama sania and he directed me properly .
i went and knocked and they opened for me .
i did n't know mama sania , the old lady and i mistakened her with the person who came to open for me .
she told me she was n't the one and she went ahead and called her .
the old lady came and asked me about myself , where i come from , ... then she told me that despite the fact that she had promised helene to hide me earlier but she was not going to be able to as things had become really bad .
she told me she was hiding many people in her home but she was n't sure they 'd still be alive the next day .
i do n't know why despite all that i remained assured that i was going to survive .
bibi [ meme en swahili ] then told me to leave her home .
i told mama sania @: "@ mama , have mercy on me and hide me please ! @"
she refused and said i should leave .
when she said so , i felt like it was over and i was going to die .
but i was mostly sad that i was going to die without saying goodbye to my father and without asking edouard to forgive me .
i cried and then she asked me to come back .
i was crying so much as i was leaving that she asked me to come back .
she told me she was a muslim , she believed in god and if she let me go and i got killed on the way , she believed god would ask her to give an account about me .
she took me inside to a room inside her house and when i got in , i felt like the situation was hopeless ... i had been thinking that i was the only tutsi that was still alive in rwanda and then i found all these people who were hiding in that room .
they were so many !
the one i always remember is a girl who was there .
she never talked to me .
they had really destroyed her , she had been raped and done her really bad things .
there 's no other way to put it , she was rotten .
she was bleeding daily .
i tried talking to her in a way to reassure her that we were going to survive but she never used to reply .
she had become numb .
i prayed all the prayers i could think of asking god to heal her but ... she was in so much pain and she could n't eat . the old lady tried her best to help us but it was n't possible .
something that ... something that really surprised me and made me wonder why people were so much against us is that one day bibi went out , she used to walk around a lot .
she met somebody who was dying of hunger .
she brought him to us , the man was called minani .
we never used to get out .
bibi put the adults among us in charge of taking care of the injured and of the children .
she brought the man called minani and told me to take care of him .
i approached him but he could n't talk as he was very hungry .
i asked him his name and he said he was called minani .
i asked him where he was from and he told me he was a burundian refugee , him and his family were being persecuted and he fled the war in burundi .
a few days later , when he started getting back some strength , he asked me how i got there and i told him i sought refuge there in an attempt to flee .
he asked me if i was a tutsi and i said "@ yes @"@ .
his reply was that him on the other hand was hutu and the fact that we had met in such a place was probably god 's way of showing us how we really have no reason to fight and that at the end of the day , we are all the same .
but i did n't see any of them for about 3 months ... for me 3 months seemed to be a very long time .
i had given out my brother 's name and the organization cocern in gitarama told me they had a child called shumbusho .
i found very young children there .
a one year old girl ran to me calling me ‘ mom ’ , she was called mutoni .
maybe her mother and i looked alike , i do n't know what made her call me mom .
the other children came to me , they thought she had found her mother .
i explained to the ones who were old enough to understand that i was n't her mother .
i carried her and headed towards the management to find out if the child called shumbusho was there . they asked me the names of the child 's parents .
i told them father was called matthias kamuhanda and mother was called yulida nyiramatama .
they went through the names of the children they knew and shumbusho was a bright boy and he had given out those names , he was 7 .
they told me he was alive but he had gone to school .
it was a miracle and i felt like it was n't true even after they told me he was alive .
i waited until noon when he came back from school . his school was n't far from the orphanage and he came at around 12 .
when shumbusho saw me , he became ... he was taken by surprise , he just stared at me , he did n't even come forward to say hi .
i approached him and he looked so scared .
the he asked , "@ you 're still alive ? @"
i said yes .
then he asked me if there was any other survivor at home which i told him there was none .
he asked me about ngirabakunizi , our little sister because they followed each other .
he asked again , "@ even ngirabakunzi is n't there ? @"
i told him no , she was n't there either .
he asked again , "@ even dad ? @"
i said yes , even him .
he told me it was impossible , that dad was very strong and there was no way they could have killed him .
"@ he must have fought and run .
they did n't kill him @" he said .
"@ no , dad is not alive . @" i told him .
then he run away .
he run away from me very fast , he refused to approach me again ... i do n't know why ... maybe ... i do n't know why he did n't want to come near me .
i never ask him about it .
his guardians told me to go back home and leave him , they said it was still hard for him to accept it .
i went back home and then i started working again .
a nieghbour once came and told me violette and claudette were still alive as well .
i was very happy and i felt like it was a miracle .
i had some money and i remember going to buy beds and mattresses .
i thanked bibi for all she did for me and i told her i wanted to leave because i had found my younger brother and sisters and i did n't want to bother her with them .
bibi told me not to leave , she said she was going to take care of them just like she had been taking care of me .
i insisted i wanted to leave and i asked her to help me find a house , i told her i could now afford paying a rent and taking care of them since i had a job .
i told her she could continue helping me but i did n't want to continue bothering her .
bibi finally agreed to help me find a house .
she got me a three bed roomed house . i had 3 beds made , one for shumbusho as i intended to ask the people from the orphanage to give him to me and 2 others for violette and claudette .
i got another leave and went to look for violette and claudette . i went back home to kibuye and found out that the person who told me about them had lied to me .
my aunt chantal told me they killed them at the stadium .
she told me she had not wanted to tell me about it as she could see how difficult it was for me .
she said my uncle mutabazi was injured at the stadium but left there while he was still alive . he went to her house and told her everyone was dead .
he told her my dad got out of the stadium but they killed them all ... no one survived !
i still look at their mattresses today , i did n't use them ... sometimes i feel like it is not true , as though they did n't die ... some days i feel like it 's impossible ... it 's impossible that so many people can die at the same time , as though they were maybe somewhere else but that they have n't died .
but there 's nothing i can do about it , it is something i am starting to accept and i thank god that i have a good life today .
i later on got married and i have 2 kids .
whenever i remember my siblings who died and even our neighbours , i feel very sad but when i look at my children , it gives me the desire to continue to live .
they are my siblings and my children at the same time .
are you still with shumbusho ?
yes , shumbusho is still with me and i do my best to help him forget all the bad things he saw .
but sometimes i get the impression that life is meaningless to him .
sometimes he looks so absent . but he is such a source of joy to me because i believe that even if our family was wiped out , god will give it back to us one day through shumbusho .
you 'd think dad called him shumbusho ( meaning the substitute ) knowing that through him , we shall have a substitute to our family .
how many children were you in your family ?
we were ... the boys were 4 plus shumbusho , that makes it 5 and my little sister ngirabakunzi and i.
if we go back to 1994 ... can you remember exactly how you left kibuye for gisenyi ?
was it as a consequence of the war ?
no , it was n't because of the war . i left home before the war started .
i was brought up in gisenyi because that 's where my mom was born .
i was mainly brought up in her family .
did any of your neighbours in gisenyi die when the inkotanyis attacked in 1990 ?
not among our neighbours in gisenyi .
not where i was living . but people i know of people who died in kayove where mom was from .
you told us your mom 's family and your cousins lived in kayove . who were you living with in gisenyi ?
i was living with mother 's cousin in gisenyi .
how did you end up in kigali ?
we did n't understand it well ...
i had a white boyfriend .
i used to come and visit him but i would also bring some things to sell .
i would stay at maria 's until i finish sellingmy things then i would go back home .
you told us the war broke up when you had been in kigali for 3 days , you also said that there 's a time you were with the child called micheveux for about 2 weeks , i did n't quite undertand that part .
well , when i said 2 weeks , i also realized later on that i made a mistake .
i spent about 2 weeks hiding together with micheveux and that 's the time she one day told me she was convinced she was going to die .
i asked her why and she told me she felt like she was smelling blood all over her body .
i told her she was n't going to die , trying to reassure her .
but it was as though she actually knew she was going to die because that 's the same day her whole family was taken away .
only a boy survived plus a girl who was in butare .
michoveux died with them .
have you heard anything giramata , the one you were hiding with at maria 's ?
mama giramata survived together with her husband and children .
but i have never heard anything about melanie .
i never saw her again after the day i was with her in the bush .
were helene and maria sisters ?
yes helene was maria 's younger sister .
and helene kept on looking for ways to hide you ...
yes , she is the one who helped me to get all the people who hid me because i did n't know anyone else in kigali apart from helene and her sister .
meaning that if helene did n't help me find all those people , i would not have survived .
was she married ?
her husband was a killer .
he killed some people .
she even told me that if her husband had n't become a monster , she would have kept me in her home and that there was no point of keeping me there because he 's kill me ... i would n't survive even one night .
her husband used to spend all his time going to roadblocks and she did n't want to have my death on her conscience .
if her husband had been a good man , she would have hidden me because it was on her heart .
if everyone had been like helene and mama sania , the tutsis in rwanda would not have died and been wiped out .
but mama sania is the one ... among all the people who hid me , she surpasses them all because she became like a parent to me .
she told me , "@ everything that 's said about the tutsis and how wicked they are is not true , i am not a tutsi and to the best of my knowledge , there 's no tutsi blood in our family .
but i know my father became rich thanks to a tutsi , we lived a good life thanks to that tutsi and for that reason , i can not harm a tutsi .
the tutsi are not wicked , all this is only going to profit top leaders in the coutry .
do n't get discouraged to the point of asking god ... of saying that god ... @" sometimes i 'd be so discouraged that i asked her what crime we committed , what sin the tutsis committed to the point of becoming an outcast tribe .
i felt i cursed .. i felt like we all were cursed .
i did n't understand how god created us and could allow us to die like animals , even animals do n't die that way .
sometimes i do n't even how to put it .
i used to tell her that god did n't exist but later on i asked god to forgive me because i know he is there and he is n't the one who made them such things .
what about the child called mutoni you met at the orphanage , did you see her again ?
umutoni , i looked for ... after i got my own house , i was planning to ask for her and raise her up together with shumbusho since my cousins had also died .
i felt i could afford taking care fo the 2 of them . i had started all the paper works in order to ask for her and shumbusho , even shumbusho was n't immediately given to me .
they gave him to me when they were assured that i had the means to take care of him .
as far as umutoni is concerned , they told me relatives of her from burundi went to ask for her .
she was taken to the orphanage by a 12 year old girl , she had picked her among dead bodies .
she was older and she is the one who told the people of the orphanage the names of umutoni 's parents .
have you been able to bury in respect some of your people ?
yes , i buried ngirabakunzi my little sister , alfred and uwitonze and our uncle mutabazi .
because they ... mutabazi was killed together with uwitonze my 8 year old brother . we found them together .
alfred was killed near our home .
i found their corpses and buried them .
dad was also killed near home , he was at the stadium but he managed to escape and then went back in ruvumbu , our home area and that 's where he was killed .
but i found out about it when he had already been taken to bisesero with other corpses .
some people exhumed his body from where he was buried after being killed and took him to bisesero .
how did you manage to face life after the war after all the difficulties you went through plus the fact that shumbusho was seriously disturbed by everything he had gone through ?
how did you manage to face such a life ?
it made me feel mature because it was as though i became shumbusho 's mother , i started a new life ; i felt very responsible for him and i knew i 'd have to do everything i could to be able to raise him up and pay for his education .
besides , when i finished organizing myself and putting everything together , i found cynthia , my cousin , the daughter of mom 's younger sister alive !
so i was living with both of them .
i t was n't easy as cynthia used to spend the whole night screaming , she still does it at times today .
even today she wakes up in the middle of the night saying , "@ let 's flee , the interahamwes are coming to kill us ... let 's flee , the interahamwes are coming to kill us . @"
so they 'd make a lot of noise in the night , even shumbusho would join her .
it was as though in their mind , they were still living in the war .
they did n't believe it was over .
i put shumbusho in school but it was n't going to be possible for cynthia to be away as she was in a very bad state .
she went back to school later on .
shumbusho on the other hand ... i was trying my best to make my children happy .
i would use my salary to shop and pay the rent ... i suddenly had all these responsibilities ... my reaction was n't to ... the life i lived then did n't quite match with my age ... i turned 18 during the war .
i did n't think like an 18 year old person .
i felt i needed to do all i could so that shumbusho and cynthia could study .
that 's all i was concentrating on .
among the neighbours who killed your family , are there some who participated openly and never went to jail ?
yes there are ... in our areas ... most of them still do n't believe what they did was wrong and have n't come out in the open to tell the truth .
i went there after the war and they told mehow my family was killed and who killed them .
but when people started being arrested and the lawsuits started , they refused to testify .
and when we would ask them about the previous times they said it , they 'd say they never said it .
some got arrested but others were never arrested .
for example , among the children who killed ngirabakunzi - one was mature enough - do you believe a 12 or 15 year old person who kills is still a child ?
they arrested him and released him later on saying he is mentally disturbed , but i also think they released him because he was a child .
but even the rest of the people who killed my family or neighbours were never arrested and those who were have been released .
if i had known that they were going to release them , i would n't have wasted my time pursuing them .
i would just have let them go .
i would have let them go because this should be the time when ... they should be shameful of their deeds ... but when i see them , i am the one who is ashamed because they killed my family and others as well .
today i see them and i remember how i pursued them , wanting them to be arrested and i feel ashamed .
i see them and i am so dishonored i could hide myself or i wish i could move to a place where i would n't be seeing them anymore !
it 's so shocking to run after somebody who killed your people so they can be imprisoned and then see them released !
had i known it was going to be that way , i would n't have gotten involved .
the politic of the government consists in releasing the people who have acknowledged their crimes so they can live with the rwandan nation again and be united with them all over again .
what do you think of that ?
and how do you think things should be ?
personally , i can not say that ... i have lost so much because of those people .
they took away my family and everyone else who lost his or her people lost in the same way .
if my opinion is that they should be imprisoned and remain there - i have asked some people - and i believe that would be the right thing to do ... and that 's why i am saying that if i had known it from before , i would n't have spent so much time running after them for them to be put in jail .
in jail , it is the government that feeds them .
not only did they kill my people - i 'd expect that their meals are expensive , their lives , their health , all that is costly - so the country is losing and it 's already lost anyway .
so in my opinion , releasing them so that they can be working for the country is n't bad .
there 's no other solution anyway .
because if i take the case of my home area in kibuye , almost everyone in rubengera killed ; even the one who did n't take a machete pointed at the place where a tutsi was hiding , showing his or her friend .
it reached a point where even children killed in kibuye , a ten year old child or a seven year old one were busy looking for people in the bush .
meaning that all those people should be taken to jail which is impossible .
how would the country develop if everyone is in jail ?
that 's not possible .
so we just have to accept , there 's no other solution .
but it would be so much better if all of them would accept their crime and apologize .
not so much because they know acknowledging it and apologizing is a means of being in jail for a shorter time . i have a problem with it ! they teach them that if they accept their crimes , their punishment shall be reduced .
one should first of all apologize from the heart , it should n't be because someone else has instilled it in one 's mind .
they keep telling them how when they apologize even after killing many people , they 'll be in jail for a short time .
it 's useless .
the fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again .
are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ?
it was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 .
meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong .
so , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again .
you said that imprisoning them is a waste for the country .
do you believe the country will gain when they are free ? do you think it will be of any use for the country ?
putting them in jail in my opinion is ... a killer ... someone who killed infants , who got an infant , hit it on a wall and killed it ; who killed a mother with a shaped stick of wood !
actually ... you 'd ... i do n't think they should even be imprisoned .
i think they should die ... they should just die , they should be sentenced to death .
but if almost all of them did that , what 's the point of imprisoning ?
they should let them free so they can be seeing us on the streets ; they thought we would be wiped out !
they thought their children would be asking what a tutsi was looking like .
let them see us !
one thing that hurts me is seeing a survivor becoming an alcoholic .
we should n't turn into alcoholics or get discouraged .
on the contrary , what happened should be a reason for us to stand up and develop ourselves as much as possible for those who have the means to attain that development and those who do not have comfortable life , they could approach their friends ... that 's all i can think of .
what do you think of the lives of the survivors in this country ?
how do you feel about gacaca , unity and reconciliation ?
[ she laughs ... ] unity and reconciliation !
of course you can not tell people not to be united , because if you say so , you 'd be like the people who killed the tutsis .
you would n't be any different from them .
on the other hand , would you dare tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed alfred ?
would you tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed my father ?
yes , we have to live together in order to build the country but you can not tell me to reconcile with them .
you would be asking for the impossible !
that 's just impossible !
today march 21 , 2007 , we are here at the head office of avega in the eastern province with mujawamariya francoise , one of the people supported by avega . we are going to have a discussion with her and she will tell her story .
the story of what she went through during the genocide .
mujawamariya francoise you could start up with introducing yourself ?
my name is mujawamariya francoise and i was born in gashirabwoba , former gisumu .
when the genocide happened ... we all know it happened all across rwanda ... you , with your family in gisumu , would you tell us in detail how the genocide affected you ?
where did it find you ?
how many people made your family ?
what happened to you ?
we were eight children in my family with both parents .
when the genocide started we fled to the hospital in bushenyi .
interahamwes found us there and killed my parents and all my siblings .
i continued to run ... we fled to a place called ‘ ku kagatamu ’ . interahamwes found us again and killed everybody that was with me but i managed to escape .
while running , i met other interahamwe militiamen . they raped me but did n't kill me .
... i kept on running away ... there was a man whom dad had been in the past ... he took me to his mother 's house where they hid me .
later , the police took me out of that house saying that i had a son in the rpf .
then they took to be jailed at the commune office of gisumu .
policemen at the commune office raped me ... then at some point i was taken to cyangugu saying that they caught an interahamwe ... sorry an inkotanyi woman instead .
when i reached cyangugu , the soldiers raped me again .
at some point , a born @-@ again soldier came ... he called himself so !
he asked me if i had any relatives in congo then i lied to him that that i did .
i was trying to find a way to survive .
the first people who raped you , the interahamwe militia ... did you know any of them ? how would you describe them ?
they were two and they came from karengera . i did n't know them .
the born @-@ again soldier you told us about , is he the one that helped you get to the congelese woman ?
no . he just took me up to the road and he told me to go . i went i met the congolese woman on my way and when i reached rusizi river , we crossed it together .
that man only took me up to the road but we did n't go all the way together .
but you did n't tell us about the death of your parents or your relatives .
how were they killed ?
where did they throw them ?
could you try to tell us about that ?
my dad after managing to reach the football court of gashirabwoba got shot by some policemen and soldiers from cyangugu .
that 's how he died .
my mum and my siblings were killed with machetes at the hospital of bushenge .
does that mean that from your whole family and all the people you lived with , you are the only survivor ?
yes .
what happened in nyabushishi refugee camp ?
we would like you to continue telling us how life was like went so we can wrap up .
after some time in the camp in nyabushishi ... i had a brother who was in the rpf who came to know that i was in nyabushishi .
he came and took me where he was staying in butare . we stayed together in butare but after sometimes he died in a motorcycle crash .
after he died i returned to cyangugu and avega started to help me .
that 's how i came back .
we would like you to explain in detail from the time you left butare how avega came to know about you ... of course you were admitted in bushenge hospital but i do n't avega knew you out of the blue !
it must have happened in a way .
describe in detail how your life was like from the time the genocide started until late when it ended .
i was very sick at the hospital when some staff of the tribunal in kigali came to cyangugu for work .
i do n't know how they found out that i was there but after visiting me , they started to look for avega ... they were the ones to know about avega . they said that they would contact avega and let them know about my status and also so they follow me up .
after some time they took me to kigali to be admitted to the tribunal ... no rather to king faycal hospital !
that 's how avega started taking care of me . i never knew it before then when i was in cyangugu .
i do n't can n't tell you how they knew about me ... i was way too sick .
how did the people at the tribunal know about you ?
did they know you before ?
in fact those people were working on rights abuses and ... in the area where i lived ... they asked people and they were told that i was at the hospital .
so they came to collect my testimony but ... i was so sick then that i could n't even speak but later , i was able to tell them my story .
that 's how they came .
during that time at the hospital it 's all after being raped .
did you ever go to the hospital to be tested for hiv ?
i got tested during my admission period and that 's how i found out i was infected with hiv .
francoise , i know it is not something easy but i would like you to explain ... i guess when you were very sick , you could think and ... after realizing that it was the result of the raped that you went through during the genocide ... i mean how did you receive the fact of being infected with aids ?
i had never been with a man before the genocide so i immediately realized that i contracted it during the genocide .
immediately after figuring that out i was given medication because i had the right stage for the cure .
i started taking them at king faycal hospital where i was ... even though it was hard i had to accept it .
sorry but you have to be strong .
i wanted to ask you ... please try to be strong and bare with m but ... there is not another way .
i want to ask if there is anyone else other than avega who has supported you after the genocide .
there is no one .
maybe before i go into details about avega and how they help you .
the genocide happened and it took away your relatives and you were raped ... the question that i would like to ask you is @: is there not anyone apart from the men who raped you that were involved in the killings of your relatives that you recognized ?
i did n't even know how they died because i was n't with them . we were all scattered and i was n't with them . i were with them i would have also been killed .
were you able to know where they threw them at least ? that could have helped burying them ?
yes they buried them at the memorial site of gashirabwoba . my dad was drowned into the kivu lake . in fact all the people who were shot at the football court were thrown into the kivu .
today your neighbours from where you used to live ... how is life like together today ?
at least after the genocide when you go there , do you ever meet with people who used to live nearby ?
no i can not return there .
i can not be able to talk to them .
now that the genocide is over , there are many consequences after the genocide like misery .
your life after the genocide ... it is clear that it was not good but you told us that avega tried to help you as much as they could .
so what can you tell us ?
with the help from avega , do you sometimes feel that it is enough ?
or do you feel like the help is kills more than it can save the situation ?
can you tell us about that ?
because avega supports many people , the support it gives to individuals can not satisfy them . for people like me who are also on medication , it does n't help because we have lost of needs .
now i would like you to share your opinion ... what kind of advice would you give ? is it to increase the capacity of avega or to look for other organizations to help you ?
increasing avega 's capacity would be much better because ... or you could find other organizations if you can . avega does the best they can and there 's nothing negative that they do .
the only problem is that the support is very small and a lot of people need it . for instance , we have an association that has almost ninety people .
all those people have their eyes on avega and it is clear to see that it does n't help them much .
what 's the name of that association ?
duhozanye .
could you repeat for us in detail what this association does ?
who are the members ?
there are many people . i can n't remember their names ... they invited the lady who is the president the association but i do n't know if she came .
it 's an association of patients . it does n't have enough support though .
is there nothing else apart from the fact that the problems are not just yours but meeting with your friends ... you might come up with an idea because it is clear that if it is an association of a lot of people , there are times you might be able to discuss and exchange ideas .
would you try and tell us about life in that association if there is any help that it provides to you other than knowing that you are not the only one with problems .
if we ever get support , i am sure that we can find what to do . that 's the good thing about this association ... we would do it together .
now before we finish , there is another question .
i would like to ask you ... you see , there are lots of women and children who confronted lots of problems in the genocide .
that is to say rape ... and today , they are very sick , some woman got pregnant and infected ... they gave birth to children who are also infected with aids .
it 's clear that there are lots of problems . thirteen years after the genocide , it 's obvious that women who were raped during the genocide still face a number of problems today .
now what message would you send to all the people mentioned above ?
the message i would tell them is that they should n't give up .
i do n't think there is anything else although patience is not easy especially when you do n't have good welfare .
apart from what avega helping those people and looking after them ... maybe it is only avega that takes care of them ... what do you think the government should do ?
do you think that sometimes ... after the genocide has destroyed someone 's life , that people have some kind of care at least ?
let 's say , the government established an institution called farg ... the question is @: after the genocide , do you think that there is any effort done apart from avega regarding people confronted with diseases , regarding the issue of education , rebuilding lives ... could you say something about that ?
if you believe that something was done , what is it ?
and if you know it , could you also tell us if the help improved people 's welfare ?
what they did is a lot .
children were able to go to school ; some people were housed though it 's a few of them because housing and poverty are still the major problems .
i do n't know ...
all these women who were raped and also infected with aids during the war [ genocide ] need medication and we know that the medication is very expensive and we know that the life that goes along with that medication requires that you are self sufficient and a certain level of good life ... i do n't know if in that association or the people you meet in avega ... is avega able to do all of that to allow you to live a life that requires all of those things ?
i understand ... you have already told us that the support is not enough but can you give us an idea and you maybe could tell us that if any of the woman facing these challenges could do this or ... if there was no medication for them ... just tell us something about that .
concerning the medication , most of the people who have reached the stage to take the medication have already started to take them .
that 's not a problem but because they take the medications in poor conditions , they end up dying because those medications require a good life as you said .
most of them do n't realize its efficiency . avega is also not able to help them .
if there was something else to support avega , that would be good because their life would be much better .
plus , since the donors of avega stopped funding it , avega does n't help them anymore .
i do n't know if there is anything you would like to add to this discussion that we had but if there is something i did n't ask that you would like to say , whatever it is ... there is another question before you say something , i would like to ask you ... although you have all these problems ... problems of health ... do you still have hope in life ?
hope ... can you have hope in life when you realize that your current life is not good ?
i do n't have any hope ! i do n't even have a place i can call home .
avega was going to buy for me a house but because the funders stopped their support ... i do n't have any hope today .
it 's now thirteen years after the genocide and obviously life gets more and more challenging but do you believe that at some point , all these problems will end ?
and that people will have a better life ?
where would one get that hope ?
living conditions are even getting more challenging ... maybe if you could do something , i think that would be help somehow .
if not individuals , what do you think the government of rwanda should do ?
especially for those supported by avega or even others who faced similar problems during the war [ genocide ] .
most especially i think the government of rwanda should take care of us because if they do n't , no one else will .
we can n't wait for foreigners when the government , aware what happened to us does n't take care of us as it should !
in conclusion is there anything you would like to say that i did n't ask or you would want to tell us ?
what ... i would like to tell you is that you could try and see if you could find a way to help us to improve our lives at least as we are on medication ... so we can get food and all the other things that are related to that . then we can really feel that there are people who empathize with our sorrow
we would like you to introduce yourself to us as we are about to talk about what happened in the genocide .
my names are murebwayire josephine i live in kimironko in the sector of nyagatovu in the district of gasabo .
we would like you to tell us about your life with your family before the genocide , how big was your family ?
explain to us and tell us how big your family was ; your children , your husband and then after try and give us an idea or paint an image for us on how your life was before the genocide .
before the genocide we lived in a place called masoro at that time it was called ndera sector .
commune rubungo is where we lived , nowadays it 's called gasabo district , i had a husband with six children .
three boys and three girls , we also had a child that we had adopted , my husband 's niece .
we were living in harmony , we had a nice house , our standard of life was good , and my husband was working .
my children were growing up and were in secondary school , the oldest was in senior four and the youngest was in primary four .
we also lived with my two brothers .
one had just gotten married and he lived near us , we were a big nice family , the genocide rally started in 1990 , that 's when we heard that the inkotanyi [ rpf ] had attacked .
they said they came from byumba on the 1st of october 1990 , we all did n't know what it was when we heard about it with our neighbours .
on the 7th of october 1990 that 's when they came to arrest my husband saying he was a spy for the inkotanyi .
they did n't find him at home , because even though they had said that nobody should leave their homes , my brother went to the shop to work because it was near the house .
so my husband also went to see how things were at the shop , the people who were coming to arrest him only found me and the children at home .
so they took me first but before that they were doing bad things ; searching the house and throwing things around , hitting me with their gun @-@ butt asking me where i had hidden the gun that we had .
when they saw it they said that we use it to look at the inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . there were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them .
they said it belonged to soldiers and they started beating me but not too much , telling me to show them everything else i had hidden and show them the inkotanyi .
when they did n't get the guns they took me in the car and said that if they get my husband they will release me and let me go , when we reached near the shop we saw him .
so i said to them , there is my husband , he is coming . they stopped and told him to enter the car and go give them the gun i had promised them but could n't give it away without his permission .
so i protested that they had just lied and they told me to get out of the car and watch over the kids saying that they will bring him back later .
they took my husband and i went back home to watch over the kids but at that moment you could see that our neighbours started looking at us like we were cockroaches and stigmatizing us .
i went home and rearranged everything they had disorganized and thrown around , wheat and sugar . they were very confused .
i called all my children and started comforting them telling them that they almost took me , dad was taken , they might come back and take me too but do not be afraid .
nobody was even reaching our home anymore ; if i came close to someone they would seem afraid that i was going to cause them trouble .
so i would wake up and go home , rubungo is far from kigali and nobody would direct me where he might be .
in december we were told that we can go ask at cicr about our people who were put in jail .
i did n't know the place so someone directed me but i got lost and went to president habyarimana 's house in kiyovu .
soldiers made me sit down and asked for my identity card and then they said that i was a cockroach but i denied it telling them i was n't a cockroach .
they asked me where i was going and i told them cicr so they said i was going to see spies , no someone called me to offer me a job , i said .
so they told me raise my hands and walk away singing there is no way here .
one of the soldiers showed me the place and i walked away saying what they had asked me to say , when i reached there i asked and they told me they were going to check in the computer , i did n't even know what a computer was .
my husband was taken , now i am being told that he is not on the lists . so she told me to go home and come back in three days .
after three days i came back , she had asked me to give her the names of my husband . she told me that my husband was in prison .
so i started going to visit him at the 1930 prison but did n't see him until he was released six months after just like everyone else .
we were not allowed to see our loved ones ; they told us to just bring whatever we were bringing for them on the last thursday of the month , telling us that it would be delivered to them .
so whatever we would take we would give it to the guards as they were threatening and beating us , there was no certainty that our loved ones would get it .
he was released after six months and came back home , but from that point we were not sure what was going to happen next , but after a while it was peaceful and life seemed to return to normal .
in 1992 that 's when we started hearing about the killings in bugesera , bigogwe and he would say that may be it will n't reach our region , we thought they were just selecting and killing men .
when he would walk out i would keep thinking that he will n't return but we never thought that it would be as bad as it was in 1994 .
but i think the way it started depended on the region and the place where one stayed . how did you know that the genocide had started in the place where you stayed ? did you know that habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
how did all the events unfold in your lives , i would like you to explain and tell us ?
the place where we stayed was just opposite kanombe , it was in the valley but you could see everything that happens in kanombe .
when the plane was shot down we did n't know what it was but heard a loud explosion , it was at night and we were sleeping , we did n't have electricity so that we can stay up late .
we were in bed but not really asleep , in fact we were still talking but when heard the explosion we did n't give it much thought and we went on sleeping .
at 5 am my husband turned on the radio and it was playing classical music so he said there was a coup @-@ d' etat , when we were starting to argue about it .
there was an announcement on the radio am not sure if it was from the president 's office or the military command but it said that the plane carrying the president had crashed .
we were terrified and woke up , i said to him that its over for us but instead he said no the one who wanted us dead is gone and you are saying its over for us , i replied and said that we were not going to live instead it was over .
they knew where to find everybody and who to kill , it was planned long ago , the plain just marked the beginning .
that 's when they started working but that 's not when the genocide started , because they were already well trained and had planned , so i say that 's the day when it was implemented and perfected .
that 's when the genocide was over even though that 's when it started , so the soldiers came with one of our children showing them the way .
they found him on the way , tutsi 's were being hunted and him being one they got him and he brought them . they had list with many names and ours were at the top of the list .
when i opened i saw them and they said that i must be happy and they asked for the people who shot down the president 's plane .
i said there was nobody here and told them that we can not be happy because someone else died .
did n't you hate him , they said ? can we hate someone we do n't even know or does he know us ? we heard it like everyone else .
nobody is happy that he died especially when you are the ones that shot down his plane and the cockroaches who did it are your relatives
give us money . i do n't have money , he replied . you will give it to us , they said . he told them that they had found him sleeping and asked them to look for it . they did n't just let him go , they beat him and he gave them all the money he had on him .
they said to him , your wife must be keeping a lot of money ; women are the ones that keep money .
they opened the door for me and kept the children locked up , and then they told me to give them the money that my husband had told them that i was the one keeping it .
i told them that i did n't have any money as they kept asking for it . so i said to them , why do n't you take whatever you want and leave us in peace , it is clear that you came for a purpose .
so they took whatever they could manage as they were going away and said that they were only there looking for what to take but those who were going to kill us where on their way .
they went away and then around 9h we saw the wives of all the tutsis on one of the hills coming towards our house .
we had a big compound , so i asked them why they were coming at our home when it was the first place where they look , we are the ones they arrested first as spies , why did you come here ?
we were the first ones to be arrested . no , may be we 'll die together or something like that but we are not living this place .
my two brothers and my two older sons also stayed home and i went with the four remaining children with the girl that we had adopted and the other women that we were together .
when we reached a bit farther some people started blocking our way stopping us from moving forward but we did n't know that they were interahamwe fleeing inkotanyi from remera .
but we did n't know what was happening and started separating some going through the banana plantations , others going on along the way . we left home during the day but almost reaching our destination , a place called ndera it was n't possible because we met someone who told us that there was a road block just ahead .
the others continued to a place called jurwe , me and my children we went and hid in a place where there was cassava when we saw a police car , we stayed there until it was dark in the evening .
we went on but decided not to go to ndera but instead went to a place called musave , it was dark and we could n't see but reaching there found that that 's where everyone took refuge , there was a school .
so i asked the people i was with to force the door open of one of the classrooms since all the other classrooms seemed full .
i did n't know that i was telling interahamwe , i thought i was telling my people . they forced the door open and we spent the night there with the workers .
with other children that were our neighbours , in the morning around 8 am i saw that the others were cooking but i had n't taken anything except for sugar that i had remembered , i went to borrow a saucepan .
i had very bad memories because i got lost in the forest when my family was fleeing in 1963 .
i was found by some people , so i felt that if i let go of my child they would also get lost . so i pulled them and when we reached a little bit further we saw a car and inside was a guy form our region but he was an interahamwe .
he was a driver of the commune and was coming to take his family which had also spent the night in the same place with us .
i recognized him and i asked him if he could also take me with my children , he spit in my face and asked me where i was going since it was over for us . he packed his family in the car and left .
so i kept pulling my children behind me as we walked towards ndera , when we were almost there at a place called musave .
we saw a car with the head of region of rubungo and another man that was also from our region who was also coming to see his family which had spent the night in the same place with us .
i told him that his children had left ; they were told that their mother was alive . so , he put us in the car and took us to ndera at the catholic parish .
he said , your husband and sons are at the catholic parish let me take you there . we went but before reaching the parish we reached a place called mugahoromani and there was a roadblock .
he is called rugengamanzi , he was the head priest . he welcomed us ; he had even given them food to cook . so they welcomed us and gave us food and we were comforted that we had got refuge .
but personally i did n't want to stay at the parish because there was a man that we were not at good terms with since my husband was imprisoned among the spies .
a priest called gakuba always looked for me telling people that i was a spy , that we were cockroaches , always looking for a reason that i would stop me from coming to church or cause other people to harm me .
so i told my husband that the place had no fence and people were walking in and out at ease and also told him that if gakuba sees us he will kill us .
so i told him that instead we go to the seminary , it was the 8th . so we made sure nobody saw us and then went to the seminary which was not very far away .
with all my children and brothers we went to the seminary where we spent the night . there was a hall and we spent the night praying because things were not well .
the interim government was put in place , that 's when we found out that we were mixed with interahamwe because they started celebrating , all of a sudden we did n't talk the same language .
we spent the night in a lot of fear , in the morning of the 9th , i do n't remember well if the interim government was put in place on the 8th or 9th but it 's around that time . so on the morning of the 9th .
there is still a war going on out there , let them stay here they are ok when its all over they will go back home . so you do n't want to let them go ? let them go and we will give them soldiers to protect them , mbonapeka said .
those people who are going to protect them can not protect every single one of them , let them protect them from here .
mbonampeka went away and after a short while he came back with soldiers and shot the priests .
they were hutu priests ; one was bisop nsegiyumva 's nephew , he was called naniya rugasira and the other was ananiya , he died on the spot .
one who is called andre now lives at st. michael 's , they died on the spot . so they said whoever is hutu walk out with your identity card .
so people started walking out showing their identity cards and the ones who did n't show it , it was still visible .
young tutsi men who tried to hide in the crowd were shot from the gate . we did n't know what to do , two of my older boys so the other people going out and came to see us where we were seated .
they waved goodbye at us and said that we weill meet in heaven , they jumped the fence and ran away with one of my brothers .
there were very many and said , you took all of habyarimana 's money when your inkotanyi and cockroaches , give us our father 's money .
and whoever we find with even a coin will be killed , me and my husband did n't have anything except wearing a lot of clothes , we did n't have any money on us .
so whoever had money gave it away , but they did n't really want money they were just toying with us . after that they tried to throw a grenade where we were .
and then a lady who was wearing clothes with pearls came in with another man who had a bow with arrows , they had a list with some names .
on the list was a man called pastor , rukanika , nkundabarashe and my husband , but they did n't call out my husband a lot , they called out for pastor and rukanika .
there was also another young man called mutsinzi that they were looking for , they put a bead cover on him which made him look like a woman .
he tried to run away but they shot him , and then they saw my husband and said , here is the head of all the cockroaches , stand up , they said .
they also told my two daughters to stand up and took them outside but they did n't see me because i was behind some other women .
the woman removed their clothes and wore them , they were wearing trousers . she said to them , go back you will die at the same time with everyone else no one is going to waste anytime .
they brought them back inside the house and then the lady saw me and said , we took the child and forgot the mother remove all your clothes . they watched as i removed all my clothes .
i removed all my clothes and gave them to her as they walked away and only remained with a small dress i had on . after around 10 mins that 's when they came back and shot a woman called makurata , the wife of pastor .
they shot her legs and asked her to stand up when they had shot her legs ; they dragged her as they took us all out .
they were so many i think each one of us had two people to kill him , they took us in a field that was there and asked us to lie down .
if you did n't lie down they would hack you with a machete , it was all the same whether you lied down or stood , we lied down . my last memory is that i lied down holding hands with my daughter .
and i put the others on my side , i did n't want to part with them , they told us to lie down with our stomachs on the ground , they knew how they wanted it done .
my last memory was lying on the ground i regained consciousness only to see that i was hacked , i think it was on the 11th , at around 6pm is when it started raining and i felt like i was waking up .
so they walked around and then at night i tried to lift myself up but it was very hard , i think my brain was out where they had hacked and cut me .
it 's just that god kept me otherwise they had hacked me just like everyone else .
so i thought to myself that the others will also wake up since i had also woken up after being hacked .
i sat there among all those corpses and then all of a sudden the interahamwe came back .
i went to drink water and then as one of the interahamwe was about the hack me with a machete another asked him , you have hacked this woman so many times are n't you satisfied ?
she is n't really alive and even if she lives let her die of sorrow , leave her alone .
they went away and then i saw a priest standing in front of a praying room that 's where they had put ananiya 's corpse .
i went towards him , i knew him but he did n't recognize me because of the way i had become , i asked him to hide me inside since the interahamwe were coming back and they were going to kill me badly .
i went there , i do n't know if he is the one that covered me with those plants or god but all i know is that they came back looking for me to finish me off and they could n't find me .
they walked away saying , where is the woman that was here , where did she go since the priest did n't let her in ?
they looked for me and then said , even if she is still alive she is not coming back tomorrow . i spent the night there and then in the morning around 5am .
i went back and looked at the corpses , looking at my children and i could see their brains , i looked at my husband .
i could n't see where they had hacked him but he died holding another man 's hand , they died holding each others hands .
so i sat among the corpses and then after a while i asked myself what i was doing .
so i asked myself what i was doing among the corpses and then i walked around and then decided to go in the toilet .
let me hide in the toilet , i was thinking to myself that if they return except killing me they were also going to do other bad things , i was really afraid they were going to rape me .
they kept coming to use the toilets but they did n't enter in the one i was in .
after around three days they were still going through the bodies checking if there were no survivors .
after three days is when mbonampeka brought fuel , piled up all the corpses and then burnt them , i heard them saying it from the toilet .
they piled and burnt them and then dug a hole in front of the praying room and threw them in and then covered it and left .
but i kept saying to myself that may be one my children was alive just like i was , because the way they had made me i was n't meant to be alive .
and then i would say that may be my boys who ran away at least there is one who survived , i hid myself because i thought there was a survivor .
so i stayed in that toilet two three days without drinking anything , i had lost so much blood till there was no more to bleed .
on the fifth day is when a student from that seminary came , they had hacked people and corpses fell on him but they did n't really hack him but he was wounded a little bit .
he peeped through and saw me ; he is the one who gave me water to drink . he would give me tiny little droplets on my tongue .
he would say to me that if i drink a lot , the water would kill me . we stayed in that toilet and were joined by other children .
more people kept coming slowly ; by the time we left we were around five people . we stayed there until may 1st , that 's when they helped us from there ; we were also joined by another young boy @/ girl who also studied in the seminary .
i do n't know where he got a knife or a razor blade , he is the one that shaved me , my hair was stuck in my wounds and he could n't remove it .
the inkotanyi doctors are the ones that treated my wounds ; they started treating me from ndera . my wounds were rotten and i did n't think that they would heal or even if they healed that i would be normal again .
but they treated me and then they took me to byumba , that 's where i was treated from . so all my six children , my husband , my brothers and my sister @-@ in @-@ law .
they are all dead , but i did n't know that they were all dead . i thought that my two sons were alive , i kept saying to myself that they ran away , they are not dead .
i kept thinking that maybe they are alive , there is even someone who told me that my daughter was alive .
so one of my cousin @-@ brother from my mother 's side is the one that moved me from there and started helping me .
but when we were coming from ndera i saw they way my children had died and said .
maybe someone took my children adopting and helping them , even me let me help some .
i had been traumatized i did n't want any child to suffer so i reached byumba when i had around five children when my cousin @-@ brother was coming to take me .
i took some of them in an orphanage ; i gave the other one to a soldier who turned him into a kadogo @/ child soldier .
after the war i came back home but they were just ruins , they had destroyed everything , one of my nephews .
he is the one that got a a house for us , i went in with some of his siblings .
i became their mother but they got a relative who took them abroad .
that 's how i got orphans and took care of them and when they would find their family they would go and stay with them and if not they stay with me .
you told me that the people that came to kill you were in ndera ?
hummmm , at the seminary .
looking at where you lived its evident that it 's a long distance from where they killed you from . were those interahamwe from the region where you lived or from somewhere else ?
the interahamwe would take turns , those from ndera would go to kanombe , and those from kanombe would go to ndera . the interahamwe that killed form the seminary must have been from kanombe .
even those from kanombe were with soldiers , also those from our region , because my eldest sons fled and went back on our hill where we lived .
with my one brother that 's where they died from but i did n't know about it .
i kept looking for them , in 1997 is when we went to bury the remains that had been scattered on our hill .
they would tell me that they are in this particular place , wherever they would show me bones i would not look for signs and i would think to myself finally i have got them .
recently in april 2005 is when we buried .
someone convinced me that he knew where they were buried saying he was the one who had buried them , lets go i show them to you . i excavated twenty three people and buried them at gisozi .
they are very big graves with crosses written on their names but i realized that he was lying to me .
i do n't know if he knew what he was doing or not but i was really shocked .
n gacaca si where child who knew my children , he @/@ she was there age mate , he @/@ she is the one that clarified and said that they were thrown in a latrine .
that 's when they were excavated in october and we buried them in december and i saw signs that it was really them , like identity cards .
school cards and their clothes but they were just bones because they had decomposed .
that day we excavated two hundred and fifty people , before that people kept lying to us and we would excavate the wrong people .
we buried a lot of times burying people who we were not related to but we were burying rwandans .
we do n't regret it but they toyed with us , always excavating and burying .
burying the wrong people .
let 's talk again about burying a lot of times burying the wrong people , the people who were directing you on where to excavate were they your neighbours ?
looking closely , how would someone say that somebody died from a certain place even when they are lying to you ?
the people who were telling you where to excavate where your neighbours ?
yes they were our neighbours ; the one who even told me that he had buried my children himself was even a genocide survivor .
i said that these were the consequences of the genocide on me , it was the second time , before i use to tell him that
i am going to remember , i did n't do anything without telling him as a fellow survivor , telling him that today i am going to pray and remember and he would come .
i even asked him why he had taken so long without telling me where my children were buried and he said that he did n't want me to get traumatized .
and i told thim that i could n't get traumatized it was all the same since every 11th of april i would have prayers to remember them .
why did n't you let me get traumatized once and for all but atleast bury them , so in gacaca that child said where they were buried .
i called him and even thought that the child is the one who was lying to me , we almost started arguing but i realized i would be disrespecting myself and did n't want any confrontation with him .
i ignored him and said that i was just feeling the consequences of the genocide so i decided to fight them they way i normally fight but the other thing is that in 1995 .
those who misled us in excavating all those bodies on the different hills are the ones who participated in killing the not only my people but all the people on that hill .
but gacaca is exposing them all , they are turning on each other , those who are in jail denounce those who were not put in jail and those who are in jail also denounce those who are being released .
that 's how things are in our region .
lets talk again about the other children who were killed from ndera and were later burnt , we can tell that ...
where they buried them , i do n't if it 's because i was still very traumatized in 1997 is when we first said prayers for them .
i am the one who showed where they were thrown there is a bush even pictures of the place .
and the way i watered the place but when they said to excavate the bodies i said no , i do n't want you to excavate them ; they were n't many other people that survived from there .
it was me and the one boy who is now in switzerland , he is a member of ibuka there , his name is cesar . we asked them not to excavate them since they had also burnt them .
we asked if they could make the place look good and the priests promised us they were going to build a beautiful memorial , its there and every 11th of april we go there to commemorate .
they were in hundreds around four hundred because all the classrooms were full , there was even a hall that was full , the hutus later went out but they were few .
the majority were the tutsis seeking refuge .
so you mean that in the four hundred seeking refuge the survivors are not more than ten ?
at the seminary it 's just me and cezar , they are some kids who also ran away , but the ones we are sure of and count are me and cezar .
we are the only ones who came out of the corpses .
if we talk about your children that died in masoro did you get to know who killed them or how they were killed except the fact that they were thrown in the pit latrine ?
in gacaca they talk about the people who died but even the ones who are there played a major role in it but what is clear is that whoever is involved were arrested because of gacaca .
they normally first hacked people before throwing them in the pits , did you get to know if your children were thrown in the pit alive or after being hacked .
we 've been very good friends and we are going to die ; where we are going they do n't wear shoes , take my shoes and remember me whenever you look at them .
and please tell the story .
and then they told those who were about to kill them to wait so that they can first pray , and when they had finished praying they threw them in the pit .
he is the one who told us all that .
but personally i think that if that boy was given shoes by your son it means that he even saw the ones who killed them .
he knows them but he says that he ran away , they do n't agree to say everything clearly .
they do n't want to state facts i think of fear that the remaining ones will hurt them . he says that he ran away and says the one who chased him away and hit him with a stick on the shoulders .
so he says that he does n't know who killed them but others say that he was killed by a man called habari , he is dead .
he has n't even come back to court because he was imprisoned when he was still young but may be he will . gacaca will deal with it , i personally do n't know .
i understand that your whole family died but no one forgets her family , can you please tell us about your husband , what kind of man was he ?
how did he relate with other people and what is the one thing that you remember about him that you can not forget ?
there is no way i can forget him , i do n't know how i can describe him i think that picture describes a lot , he was a very calm man .
he was avery humble man who easily related with everyone but especially he loved children , i think that 's why he went with our children .
he was very easy to relate to and was very merciful ; he could easily ignore himselfo or others .
that was his nature , he was a man that really loved his family , i think if he had been greedy when he was released from jail he would have abandoned us .
but he did n't , he loved everyone , he did n't hate anyone , he loved the poor and humble .
my children were also like that , they loved other kids and were always warm and happy , i can n't forget them , instead i try to imitate them and fail .
i do n't know how to say it , but here they killed all your family and finished it , if they came and confessed their fault , would you forgive them ?
to forgive , they are words that people are quick to use but it does n't even make sense . the person who asks it and you who says that you have forgiven him it 's not something easy .
because personally the way i see this country it belongs to all rwandans , its not just mine it 's not even for only the genocide survivor , it 's impossible .
evil is not repaid by evil ; personally i told god that i can n't do anything on my own .
i can n't manage anything on my own , i do n't think i would even be alive , i think i would have gone mad . i surrender everything to god because to be able to get out of all the corpses of my children .
my husband , relatives and neighbours that were lying there dead , i did n't think i was going to live .
i told god that he is the one in control and knows why everything happened . i asked god for something and he gave it to me , i told god that those who died and those who are alive , i asked that he may give me the power to love without focusing on anything else .
so instead of being burdened i asked god to give me a big heart so that i can offer mercy to everyone who needs it .
even if it 's a hutu who killed my family and he comes when he is broken down .
in need of mercy and forgiveness , i would forgive him because he is a human being , i can n't do the same atrocities like he did . it 's really not by my strength that i can do this , i will n't lie to you .
because on my own i am nothing and i would be nothing but the fact that god saw that my children and body were dead .
i was disgusting and he revived me and people want to be with me when before they use to run away from me , people who saw me immediately after the genocide would avoid me .
i was hideous and disgusting and there 's no one who really took care of me to say they did it .
except my cousin @-@ brother but even for him it would n't have been possible without god 's power .
i would have gone mad , but god kept and made me who i am today , so even me in his love i must do what he asks me to do and whoever asks me for forgiveness in truth , i would forgive them .
and when someone is saying something from the depth of their heart you can tell and i can forgive them , but they do n't ask for forgiveness because someone asks for forgiveness is someone with a human heart .
someone with humanity in them comes close to you because he sees that you are human , whe he does n't it 's because he thinks that you are still the thing that he called you before .
they dehumanized us by calling us cockroaches and other horrible names so i think they still see that in us , so whoever comes close to me , i would forgive them .
after hearing the difficult things that you went through , surviving among all those people and your family being dead .
nowadays how can i describe murebwayire josephine , what kind of person is she even though her whole family died , is she someone with hope even though her whole family died in the genocide ?
please tell us , how do you feel deep inside because i do n't understand ?
it does n't make sense humanly speaking , it 's beyond our human nature and when they say beyond our human nature , it means it 's not human .
everything that happened in my life since i was a child up to now is beyond human nature but there is someone who created human nature .
i did n't think i would have those responsibilities , it means that i had died and resurrected . in resurrecting i resurrected a new being not the same person .
so i have to accept the way i always tell people that josephine died and aunty lived .
because now i am called aunty of all the children , any child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it .
to confort and convince that that child must live and encourage him @/@ her , so i think i was left behind so that i may be an aunty to all the children .
a child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it and confort them and convince him that they must live .
i encourage and strengthen them , i feel like i was left behind so that i can be a mother to all children without mothers .
it 's not a must that i take care of them in my house but they are some i advise on certain issues and they move forward .
they are some that i have here in my house . i have six children , two girls and four boys .
the other thing is that god who kept me has a plan for my life that he helps to fulfill it , he did n't put me to shame , i would have gone crazy , and it was possible .
they hacked me in the head but i did n't loose my mind i can think , it means i must live my life thanking god and doing what i can .
it 's something that can help others .
how do you relate to the neighbours that you had befor all this , how is your relationship ?
after the genocide which affected your life and the life of many rwandans , do you think that there can be normal trustworthy relationships ?
between the killers and victims ?
about trust i do n't know if its kadafi who said that , protect me form my friends because i already know my enemies .
god gave us the wisdom to think , when you live with someone there is no reason to disturb someone who is going through hard times , if i am able i can help him @/@ her as a rwandan and if they are celebrating i can celebrate with him @/@ her .
but i live well with my neighbours i do n't how to segregate people saying one is hutu so i will n't greet them , or insulting someone that they are interahamwe .
when i see someone i see a human being and i only see evil when that person commits it , but i do n't push anybody away .
my heart welcomes everyone who comes to me with good intentions , if you do n't then i do n't give you my time .
in the genocide especially women went through a lot of difficulties , besides killing them and finishing off their children , many were raped and infected with diseases .
besides being raped they went through a lot of fifficulties and problems that personally i think that widows have a lot of problems .
as a result of the genocide , it is very difficult because you find that someone has a sickness that will kill her at some point .
if she is not burdened by disease , the genocide ended and she is probably in a lot of poverty , i woulk like you as a woman .
who went through the same and lost your whole family which is a very difficult thing to endure , i would like you to paint a picture for us of the genocide widows who are suffering the hard consequences .
you have just asked me a very difficult question , i am part of a widows ' association called avega agahozo .
i am the second vice @-@ president on the national level , it 's an association that we set up because among widows there are many categories . there are some who were raped and infected with hiv & aids .
there are some girls who gave birth to children they did n't want , they are some who were hacked and do not have some limbs , some do n't have hands .
some do n't have eyes , they are different handicaps and then they are those who are emotionally handicaped .
and physically they do n't have a home , without a house to live in , many times they are next door to the ones who kileed their families and injured them .
you understand that its adding more sorrow to an already broken heart , so our associationts goal is to stand by them and confort them telling them not to loose heart .
telling them that the fact that they are still alive that they will continue to live , we are lucky that we got a project that helps them with anti @-@ retro viral medication for hiv & aids .
there are many who died because the medication just started coming in recently , they are many who passed away .
and it can really affect her because the medication is strong , to get food everyday is not easy because you can see that we are widows like them .
we do n't have work and those who do sometimes have other responsibilities in their home , but we try to help and confort each other .
what we mainly do is speak out because most people live in despair , so avega advises , conforts and brings us together .
that is our main objective of our association , to bring us together , confort each other , convincing someone that if they are in pain tomorrow they might be conforted , if they are sick tomorrow they can get better .
hiv & aids is bad disease in the body but its clear now that it does not even kill when one gets those medication .
so what we do is tell them the fact that they are in pain does n't mean that they die , and we speak up for them to the government , our desire is that these people are not given up on or forgotten .
these people who are sent home and forgiven really traumatizes us because it seems as though they are the ones who are cared for .
but with us it seems as though those who advocate for us do not have strength or there is no emphasis so that the problems are solved , of course nobody can bring back the people who died .
if they help us it can be over .
but it has been thirteen years after the genocide , can we say that people are still the same way they were when the genocide had just ended ?
thirteen years later , if you compare the way things are now and the way they were immediately after the genocide .
do you think that atleast people are moving from the state of turmoil and life is being restored ?
it 's just that no one can solve all the problems at once , or if we see a hundred people go on to say that everyone died but things have really changed a good example is the orphans that went to school and now have completed their studies it is evidence .
and now they are in university and some have finished , is their a child who came out of a pit thinking that he was going to study .
the widows did n't have a place to stay , can that person say that nothing was done .
it 's not enough may be because of limited means but i can n't say that they did n't help us .
generally rwandans are not doing great now imagine those who were taken out of their own .
but slowly i think something has changed but there 's still a long way to go . they problem is that there are some people who are doing very badly and it huts me when i hear that they support farg .
they say that in three months there are people who do not even it ten thousands francs , i am hurt whenever i hear this , sometimes i think thats its mocking us .
they should look for a way that a person should be supported continually so that they do n't keep going to ask for help .
i wanted to ask you something in line with rememebering our loved ones that were degraded and humiliated in the genocide .
they were thrown in different places after the genocide , someone has to go searching ... and then they are buried , so i wanted to ask you how do you think our people should be buried ?
the first and best way to honor our people is to know where they were thrown and we bury them taking them out of the holes .
to take them out of pit latrines , to be able to say that teh people in this district are going to be honored and buried and all of us get ready and go there remember and honor them . but rememeber well is to remember well is to remember the ones that remained behind . do n't go to remember a man
we teach them good manners just like their parents would have done and then go the memorial sites and remember all the people who passed away .
personally there is a way i feel that we should remember our people and bury them in such a way that we would always remember them .
but both things work together just like you have said , about the survivors . there is no way that someone can remain in that kind of trouble without knowing where to live and starving .
so that we may always rememebr them , i want that you will make your comment and say what you think .
i think that after thirteen years that the genocide has ended its not a lot of years , but when you look at the way the memorial sites are maintained .
it is evident that they are not well taken care of and nothing is done about it , clearly if nothing is changed about the way they are managed then after twenty years they will be in a visibly bad condition .
so here i want to ask , remembering is for who ? is it for the survivors , is for our neighbouring countries ?
because many times people remember in april , there is no initiative so that memorial sites are always mintined and in good condition .
you would think that we forget where they went and say , i will go visit my people in april .
but your loved one is always on your mind and heart and you always want to know where they spent the day and where they are but those memorials in the provinces and even the strong ones here .
you said twenty years but i think twenty is a lot of time because they are some that are already getting spoiled .
some places are crumbling , in other places there are bushes where animals are taken to eat grass , remebering is not for the genocide survivors only , its not even just for the government , because the government is people .
it 's for all rwandans to remember , i do n't see how some one who is neighbours with a memorial , i always take an example of kanombe .
at the main road they had put there a metallic fence but they stole them and finished them off , i do n't understand how some one steals from a memorial site , what do you do with those thinks ?
it is the home of those people , they may not be here on earth but it is there home .
i personally think that people should make it their purpose and we are also lucky that now we have lower levels of government the umudugudu @/@ village .
as we are winding up , even though the genocide took place , we can n't forget about it .
and we do n't wish for it to happen again , so i would like to ask you , according to the hard times we went through and saw we do n't want it to happen again .
what heritage would you like to give to the rwandan children who did n't go throught these things ?
what kind of rwanda would you like to give to them as a heritage compared to the one you lived in ?
i think that the new heritage has started already , there are still problems but i am really glad that no child is asked to stand up in class because of their ethnicity .
the way it 's not being done in schools it should also be the same in people 's homes because all the ad influence takes place at home behind closed dooors .
on the cooking stove that 's how they always say , we parents are the ones that offer as a heritage good or bad things to our children .
the teacher is given responsibilities and a syllabus to follow but no one controls someone 's home .
are the ones with a problem and nobody will control and know what is being taught . the genocide was slowly taught for forty years but we have just spent thirteen years teaching to live at peace .
if we continue to live in peace , our children would live together in peaceful rwanda with no turmoil and ethnicity .
but it starts with us the old and mature ones , we need to uproot it , i would like the government to emphasize refusing and condemning any word that leads to the genocide .
and whoever uses it should be punished publically even more than the one that actually used a machete , because a machete is used by someone who first talked about it . personally i would like our children without differentiating to all have a heritage of peace .
i do n't know if there 's anything you would like to add on as we are concluding our talk ?
there 's nothing except to thank you because you thought of me and came to interview me , and for these things to happen , you can also tell me if you think that the things i said make sense .
if they make sense then you can keep them and if they do n't then you remove them .
they can be somebody else 's opinion , thank you .
we told the priest , he packed for us bread and gave us a guard to escort us . he said to us @: "@ he will go with you and will keep on informing you the location of barriers because he lives in gisozi so he is used to cross those barriers . we left around 10 pm , when we reached in the small forest close to saint paul , we heard some people behind and they started to shoot on us . we ran back to where we came from . before we went separate ways , dominque said to me @: "@ do you know what , let 's go back and we will leave the place tomorrow if the inkotanyi do not come to rescue us , i have hope they will come to rescue . that is what happened , we went in separate places in order to sleep as we knew none of the interahamwe would attack in the night , they always attacked day time but we continued to hear gunfire increasing , within the gunfire i heard people coming and they said @: "@ masengo it 's us inkoyanyi . @" they were calling masengo , tunga and kariyopi , the reason those inkotanyi knew our names is because they are some people whom we were together in saint paul and were got rescued by the un peace keepers [ minuar ] , so those people told those inkotanyi about us . among those people was one called ndengeyingoma and another one called musafiri , so those inkotanyi came to rescue us .
they came saying , masengo it 's us inkotanyi do n't worry ; come out of where you are .
i thought it was interahamwe trying to fool us so that they can take us .
i tried to leave the place in order to hide in a nice place because i was feeling unsafe .
i left the place around 2 am and while i was going out i heard them talking , but there was still a lot of gunfire outside .
it was an exchange of gunfire between inkotanyi and interahamwe .
i went down slowly and hid myself in a bush , i saw ndengeyingoma in front of those soldiers calling me .
i carefully looked at them , because i knew how inkotanyi looked like . they were some of them i knew at cnd and others i knew from military course i took .
i came out of the bush and said to them @: "@ i am masengo , i am here ! @"
ndengeyingoma said to me @: "@ we are inkotanyi and we came to rescue you . @"
he told me to call others , i went back in the building to call them and the ones in the house said to me @: "@ you want us to get killed . @"
it has been a good while they did not see me ; i usually came in the night .
i said to them @: "@ i can not lie to you ; you know i am the one with the problem so they are inkotanyi . @" they said to me @: "@ you want us to get killed . @" i said no , they are inkotanyi .
few young men went out and found it was them , so they came back to confirm that it was inkotanyi .
some of them refused to come , we were about 1700 people and 30 of them remained there .
they [ inkotanyi ] told us to sit on the ground and they said to us @: "@ go down this way . @"
they showed us the way and we knew that road .
we went down until we reached the first road in rugenge , we continued up the second one until we reached the third one known as the heavy weight road [ poid lourd ] .
we passed through the swamp , heading to kacyiru by the time we reached kacyiru it was already in the morning and the soldiers were few around thirty soldiers .
the ones who managed to reach kacyiru continued but other camped there .
the soldiers tried to find them places to stay in and they went back to fight with interahamwe .
they fought the whole day to protect the people they rescued .
other soldiers [ inkotanyi ] joined them in order to give them a hand , in the afternoon that is when the remaining group managed to cross .
on the way going , some people like the wife of manyenzi , another girl lost their lives due to the shooting ; some were caught by the bullets because we were a long chain of people .
we went and reached gisozi , we were welcomed .
if i go back a little bit , the 30 people who stayed at saint paul saying that it was interahamwe trying to fool us were killed almost all of them .
one man called ally was one of the few people that survived the interahamwe attack .
he does n't know how he survived all he remembers is that he slept down and they started to kill people .
so for us we reached gisozi .
the young men became soldiers and the old women and others were taken to kabuga . i was one of the young adults that became soldiers .
the war [ genocide ] came to an end .
we did not stay longer as soldiers ; some were still young so want to return to school .
the main purpose was to quit the army because we felt kind of traumatized when remembering that someone had a family of ten people now he is left alone .
we applied to leave the army and some were allowed .
we went on and started new hard lives where there is no father , no mother only you alone .
we found the houses already destroyed .
it was very hard the first days ; there was no food we had to search for it if not try to find a place where to sleep also visit friends .
that is the kind of life i lived in .
i tried to search if there is any one of my family who is still alive unfortunately all of them died except one girl called chantal who was out of the country .
she was out of rwanda during the war time .
i knew about the death of everyone , my siblings , my mother and i accepted what happened .
about the other school i applied for , i was not able to go for it because i felt unhealthy , very weak , i felt i was not able to add two numbers .
i wondered why do i have to go to school , will it resurrect my mother so i felt it was useless .
a lot of people begged me to go back to school as i was still young .
i said to them @: "@ i saw where intellectual people went , even the phd holder died ! @"
i stayed in that miserable life .
sometimes god remembers someone .
i and the other sister of mine whom i told you , tried to rebuild our home house in order to have where to stay . in our financial weakness we managed to get small jobs .
we worked in o.i.m and the small salary we could get out of it , we would use it to buy cement or other good people would buy for us cement .
we finally completed the house .
it was a big problem to have where to live ; it was hard for us to stay in several places , spending the whole year changing houses to live in when sometimes the people in there are financially unstable .
the ones who are financially stable are mostly bad people .
our houses were destroyed and their too .
so asking for help when they also have such problem , we preferred to let it go .
after completing the house , my sister got married and i stayed with the housekeeper .
as time passed by i had this idea to go back to school and i finally went to school at ulk university .
i have finished the second year and i am going for the third year .
it does n't mean that the life of genocide survivors is easy ; we are not treated the way we should be treated .
we always hear someone is dead , a genocide survivor , and another day you hear a criminal was released .
that is the way we live , a criminal was released and a genocide survivor was killed .
you hear it on the radios .
in this country the security of genocide survivors is insufficient .
we can not forget that we have to live and we are aimed at living but what these men did for us , it is not that hard for us to do it too but we were not created for that .
i realized it is even hard for me to kill a rabbit or a chicken .
imagine you take an innocent baby and hit the baby on the wall or remove an old woman all clothes and rape her .
you ask yourself if this person was created as you were created and you can not get an answer .
another thing that hurts me , you find a person really confessing proudly of the a hundred people he killed , the horrible way in which he killed those innocent people , and the next day he is realized because of that .
you find the government is spending a lot on him while there are old women let 's say in gisozi who have nothing to eat , no where to live .
this should be taken care of , the government should think about this .
okay for us we are still young men , they should care about weak people , wounded people , raped people and old women so they could die happily because the ones who betrayed us die happily .
they came back and were given their properties .
got back their money from the bank got back their houses .
it is sad to see someone who destroyed your house living in a very nice house of his father .
we do n't want those nice houses , the government should build for genocide survivors houses to live in .
it is our right , when he is given back his properties he lives nicely than us .
if this is not changed so the government will n't be helping us .
here is what i want ; all people who hurt us should be punished .
if not i do n't see where this unity and reconciliation will come from .
there is this thing of asking forgiveness between each other and i find it bad .
what are we going to ask forgiveness for ? it is because they killed us !
i hear some leaders insisting that we should say sorry as if is there any fault we committed .
you hear them saying that they are going to give us indemnity because we do need it .
let me tell you that there is no indemnity that can replace a human .
it should not even be called indemnity ; it should be called compensation or another name .
they should find a way so the old men and women , and those wounded people could live .
they should maintain the security of genocide survivors .
it is sad people are killed in the day time , this happened in kabuga .
in kaduha , it is also the same .
you hear a person was sent to prison , but during the visiting days they take for him meat , tea , and other nice things .
you find that he struggles only from monday to thursday , but he lives nicely on friday like the way he lived while he is outside .
thank you too ; there is someone who said they call you nsababera , or nsababera eraste .
uuh !
your mother built for him a house ; did you find him after genocide ?
i said about it .
if is there anything you can say about it , go on and say it .
after when nsababera eraste caused us problems in ste famille , he came to know where my mother was and shifted her to another place .
he really respected my mother . he took her and said to her @: "@ old woman , things are getting worse here in kiyovu so leave because you are most wanted . @"
he took her from she was , at another old woman and took her to the carcuters .
in the carcuters that is where my mother lost her life .
when nsababera came back , he got a way to kill people .
he respected my mother at a point he could not kill while my mother is watching him .
as my mother was far from him , he got strength to kill people .
we raised nsababera as a child in the family .
we used to call him kajevuba [ new comer ] because my mother did n't know his name . she used to call him kajevuba .
he took the spear and started to kill .
he came to kill a man called ruhotorinyana , ruhotorinyana 's wife was a hutu .
his wife ran to the sector where she could find the police .
among those police men there was one who was a born again and she reported to him .
the born again asked kajevuba @: "@ why did you kill ruhotorinyana ? @"
he [ kajevuba ] replied @: "@ i kill him because he is a tutsi . @"
the born again said to him again @: "@ do n't you know the rules , so i am going to kill you too because you are a hutu . @" kajevuba said @: "@ you can not do that ! @" the born again told him @: "@ i am going to do it . @"
kajavuba said to him @: "@ i have twenty thousand on me , you can have it . @" the born again replied @: "@ no , i do n't want your money . @"
ruhotorinyana 's wife went to report to the police meanwhile kajebuva and other interahamwe stayed behind and dug a hole in which they wanted to bury ruhotorinyana .
this born again police man arrived when they have already dug only fifty centimeters but it was enough to put in a person an cover him with sand .
the police man said to him again @: "@ you have kill ruhotorinyana because he is a tutsi and i am going to kill you because you a hutu . @"
kajevuba said to the police man @: "@ you can not do this to me ! @"
the born again replied @: "@ you think i can n't do it , i am going to do it . @" kajevuba gave him the twenty thousand , the police man refused .
he gave him everything he stole within the few days he spent as killer , few days after my mother 's death but the police man refused .
the police man said to him @: "@ stand in front of the wall and i shoot you . @"
he begged him to give him the chance to say goodbye to a man called gikongoro .
the police man said to him @: "@ i do n't care , i came to kill you . @"
he stood in front of that wall and he got shot . ruhotorinyana did not die straight a way .
the police was a good person , may god bless him .
he called other people to take ruhotorinyana at the hospital , on the way going to the hospital ruhotorinyana died .
kajevuba was put in the same hole he dug for ruhotorinyana and that is how he died .
sometimes a person would say "@ things are not going well @"@ . you feel like commenting on it , a small advice to the government .
yes it is good you have started the gacaca justice but it should be followed in a certain way .
there is also unity and reconciliation but it should come after this or match in another way so that we can conclude within this direction .
the raison i say this is because there are people who are willing to give genocide survivors their respect back , who want criminals to be judged and to send free innocent people .
the kind of people who work truthfully , i think this is the way we should pass through .
studying is a tool to a better knowledge ; the same knowledge will enable you to understand the society and get to know how to handle the society .
we do have intellectuals in this country ; let 's take an example of the ones who finished high school because they have lived in society for a while . they know what is true or wrong .
you can not take an old man and it happens that he judges his son , this is a rare case .
the probability that it happens is one percent out of ninety nine percent . if it happens , the judgment will be dropped .
i endorse the fact that gacaca justice is there .
there is no other choice , the number of people is big and the capacity of the country is small so the gacaca courts are there as a quick solution .
this is a good way but there are some people involved in this while they are not inyangamugayo [ honest people ] .
the good thing is to remove the kind of people ; a person can not commit a mistake first time , second without noticing it .
it 's impossible .
thank you .
so freddy , maybe you can begin by telling me your name .
maybe you can tell me your name and your age .
my name is mutanguha freddy and i am 28 years old .
freddy , can you tell me ... tell me your earliest memory . the first thing you can remember about your childhood ? from when you were a child , what sort of things do you remember from your childhood ?
when i was young , i remember i was very boisterous .
i used to be so boisterous . i remember my mum would talk about me with other parents , telling them she had a very boisterous son who would break all utensils .
i remember i used to like playing football ; i joined a senior team when i was still in primary school .
nothing else could make me happy as much as playing football .
that is my best memory .
tell me about your memory of your parents .
if you recall ...
i will begin with my mum who gave birth to me .
my mother was the person i loved the most in the whole world ; i can still remember everything she used to do .
maybe because i used to be by her side all the time .
i remember she was a very kind and generous parent .
she was very social and had many friends .
she used to tell me , "@ life is about making friends and learning how to live with people . when you know how to live with people , you will never fail to get anything .
and , it is not good to be selfish , you should always share with others . @"
she did not have a lot but she gave a lot to those she lived with .
and , now i can see the fruits of her deeds .
all the people who help me do it in the name of ... they say , "@ you will never lack anything as long as we 're here thanks to your mother 's deeds . @"
what is the memory of your household with your sisters and everybody ? what is the strongest memory you have about all the children ?
i would say ... maybe i only talked of my parents ... but let me talk about the kids , my sisters who were killed during the genocide .
they were four and all of them were killed so badly because , some of them were dumped alive in the latrine ... of all my sisters who died , angelique is the one i remember the most .
sometimes there 's a special bond between two siblings . i was much older than her but we loved each other very much .
i loved her very much and she loved me too .
in fact , she would miss school if i was not taking her myself .
i always used to carry her in my arms when we were going to school and run with her and she 'd tell me that she was having a lot of fun .
i finished primary school when she was just starting it .
she used to tell me that in school , when other kids would want to fight with her , she 'd feel very safe simply because she knew i was around .
she felt like i was everything to her .
she completely trusted me . and , at home she would all the time be busy telling me all her little secrets .
tell me about particularly happy times that you had in your family ?
maybe holidays , maybe a celebration or a wedding , or a party ... i do n't know , just tell me something that you remember with a fond memory .
the most special event that used to give me joy was that whenever they would get paid ... my mother was a primary school teacher .
whenever she 'd get her pay , she used to tell me to find her in a place called rubengera at around 1 p.m. after her meeting and she 's buy me milk and cake as i was still a child .
when i reached secondary school , she once told me that she wanted to buy me a bottle of primus ( beer ) , but she forbade me to finish it .
she then told me she wanted me to know that there are many stages in life and that i had now moved on to a level where she no longer considered me as a child @: she could now confide in me .
she told me many things on that day .
tell me , what did she tell you ?
she first told me that there was a time ... tutsis were not liked in this country .
she explained to me how when she passed her primary school exams ‘ ordinary level examinations ’ [ tronc commun in french , it was once in the school system in rwanda and it is back again today ] , no tutsi ever passed again that exam until she completed her secondary school and became a teacher in the same school [ six years later ] .
she said to me , "@ i am the only one who is educated in my whole family yet my brothers are intelligent and yet their fate is to become cultivators .
hutu children get schools yet they are not brighter than my brothers but i can assure you that you will complete your studies .
and i am asking you to take care of your family as i did . @"
she gave me an example @: "@ hope you see that i fund my brother edward ... @" she took him to secondary school in congo , called zaire at that time .
"@ it is very hard for me to look after my family and catering for his school needs yet he is outside the country . @"
she added , "@ all you need to know is you are not liked and you ought to learn how to behave in such a situation . @"
she went on to tell me , "@ something i would like from you is that you behave like your father .
he is one of the people i appreciate for their patience .
personally , sometimes i give him a hard time and i realise it when it is too late , but he always responds perfectly to the situation . @"
she continued , "@ i know you like football , but do n't let it obstruct you from doing school work . @"
i had n't performed very well in class that year ; i had got 65 % yet normally i used to get a distinction [ between 75 % and 85 % ] .
she told me it was certainly due to football .
"@ but please i beg you , nothing else should take away your attention . in your life you have to complete your studies so that in the future , you can do something for yourself . @"
that is all i remember right now but slowly by slowly i will recall other things .
tell me about a difficult memory from the genocide .
well ... i was there when my sisters were about to be killed .
the perpetrators came saying @: "@ we are tired , we shall take these fat kids [ freddy and his sister ] later . @"
therefore , my sister and i stayed behind and they took the younger ones .
with our own eyes , we saw them being taken and they were killed not far from where we were .
however , i was not able to see each and everything .
but while killing them ... they would scream and we heard them screaming .
another thing i remember is that my mum was taken very far away to be killed .
therefore , we went running ... at night she [ her deadbody ] was still out there .
a certain boy and i rushed there and buried her . we simply covered her with soil .
in brief i only saw my mum 's corpse .
i never saw the corpses of the rest . i only heard the noise my sisters made while they were being killed .
do you know who did it ?
... do you know who killed them ?
because i would n't see him ... i would n't see them the way i am seeing you in front of me , but i know the people who took them .
it was our neighbours , among them was a man called benoit who had been our neighbour for years and who owned a shop nearby .
he was her friend and he even used to lend her money for me to go to school the times she did n't have money .
they were relating to each other very well . he was one of the leaders of the group that took them the time they came to kill them .
there was another young man called kanani . she was kanani 's teacher in primary .
some people inside the compound tried to fight with them as they had been given money by my parents and he 's the one who was holding her hand when they were taking her out of the house ; he later on let go of it .
when he released her , my mum ran away but they found her where she had ran too .
at least i can still remember that incident very clearly ...
freddy , how did they kill your mother ?
my mother was beaten to death with clubs .
during the rest of the genocide , did you continue to witness what the killers were doing ? did you see the killers often ?
i normally think about it ... it normally happens during april because that is when i think about what took place in rwanda the most .
yeah , in april is when i remember .
and during that time , i get nightmares , i see people killing others ... i see interahamwe killing people .
but otherwise , i am lucky i rarely have nightmares . however , in april i get them .
can i ask you more difficult questions ... can i ask two more ... is it okay ?
how did the killers go about doing their work ? what did you see them doing to your family , to other people , what did you see ? how did it happen ?
yes , i know them very well ... i know them .
one of them is called niyonsenga ; he wanted to rape my sister . however , he never succeeded .
they were very many and i knew them .
freddy , what does it mean to ... be a survivor , what did you feel when you survived ?
personally i believe having survived ... being a survivor is luck yes but it is also a big responsibility .
i look at it as responsibility because many of the survivors are very poor and do not even have the least necessary for life [ food and a shelter ] .
that 's why those who have something to share need to feel responsible for the ones who do not have anything .
and i call it a privilege because when i consider what took place in rwanda , with all the determination that was put in and when you consider all those who were fully motivated such as the government of rwanda or other governments of powerful countries , like the french government .
we can easily say that it is a miracle that some people survived .
therefore , i believe that it is a privilege to be a survivor and i believe it is a big responsibility .
what did you feel in 1994 ... ? how old were you ... 15 , 16 .. ?
oh 19 .
what did you feel ? did you feel angry , did you feel empty ? did you feel ... what was in your mind and in your heart ?
how i felt during that time ... maybe i can not say exacty how i felt .
but i was so afraid .
i used to imagine a machete cutting my neck all the time . and i would imagine my neck on the floor .
i would always imagine seeing my mum being killed [ i mean the period from the 8th to the 14th of april .
] my heart was full of fear while in the cieling where i was hiding in someone 's house .
they used to allow me to sit near the fire as i would be freezing in the cold .
i was hiding behind a big sieve [ used for sorghum ] so that whoever was making the fire , would n't be able to see me .
i was so afraid and i lost hope of survival .
i reached a point where i was no longer scared . i was no longer afraid of death ; death or life meant nothing to me anymore .
sometimes my sister and i would walk on the road ... we walked a lot but we were not afraid of passing where there were roadblocks .
we only feared to pass a roadblock once but we realised that it was n't good , because there is a certain place where i reached ...
when we reached that roadblock we tried to hide and used a way down that road but we were found out .
that was in a place called mwendo in kibuye .
they took us up to the roadblock and asked us if we were tutsis and we said we were not but they looked at us and told us we must be tutsis because of our soft hair and all .
they said many things and told us to stop lying to them .
they asked me to dig up my own grave and i refused which shows that i had reached a point where i was no longer afraid .
we were taken to the commune . they said the borgamster would be the one to judge our case .
we ended up spending one night in a cell as we found when the borgmaster was drunk .
but i was n't afraid anymore at that time .
all my fears died up after my parents were murdered and after seeing so many dead bodies on the way .
do you think that people understand your experience ? .
a few people understand .
obviously not everyone can understand what i went through .
some people did not even want me to live and they still do n't want me to be alive today and they 're not happy when they see me prospering .
those who are with us do understand , those who went through similar things , especially those who share our lives daily .
can you forgive people that carried out these problems ?
it is difficult to forgive .
it is difficult to forgive and i have n't gone down that road yet because i do n't even know where to start .
who should i forgive anyway ? the former government as it contributed to it very strongly ?
do i forgive people individually ?
do i start from forgiving ... ? i look around and i do n't know where to start from , as so many people were involved in it .
it is certainly hard but it is possible .
the reason i say it is possible is because patriots ... the survivors in this country are very few . and their strength is ... they can not develop the country on their own .
therefore , all people in the country should put their energy together and develop the country .
personally , i am not ready to begin that journey [ of forgiving ] soon .
first i do not know who i should forgive . it is better those who committed the crimes start asking for forgiveness .
they should come to us and we talk about it .
let 's say if it is a hutu who killed , he should come and say , "@ i killed people and i am really sorry . @"
they should do it in way one would really see that somebody is truly sorry .
then things would proceed and finally reach the countries that participated .
and they [ those countries ] should use their power to help the survivors who are needy .
i am not among them because i am not handicapped , i am able to work for myself .
in fact i could compete in healthy competions ... i am very ready .
but what about those orphans , those other kids who look after themselves with several other responsibilities , how do they survive ?
the countries who participated in the genocide know about that .
they should do something to show that although they participated , it was involuntarily ! they need to do something to show that they care about them [ the orphans ] despite everything that happened .
i believe the process of forgiving is hard but possible .
why did you start to be involved in a.e.r.g , why did you do that ? why did you think it important to try that ?
i personally would like to thank those who founded a.e.r.g. when you look at its objectives , its deeds , you ought to thank a.e.r.g. it is the only association with so many people willing to help the genocide survivors , starting with young kids and themselves .
i think it is an association worth ... i even worked with them and lived with them for a long time .
it was an organization that helps people believe that , although they lost their parents , some friends or a fellow students can try and do as much as a parent as much as possible .
and my hope is that as long as that association is still operating , orphans will stop looking at themselves as orphans .
that they will find that , in the absence of their parents and friends , a.e.r.g. is there for them .
that they 'll find peace in it .
i know this from experience ; i once lived there and found peace in it .
do we learn anything from the genocide ? do we learn anything from the genocide ... ? does genocide ... does it teach us anything ?
the occurency of the genocide teaches a lot .
there is much we learn from it .
we are not happy that it occured but it has helped people grow before time . people became responsible while they were still young and they forgot they were young due to the experience they went through in life .
well it was n't a good experience but it taught us great lessons .
a lesson on knowing who you are , how far you can go , how to behave with others and where you belong in this world .
generally genocide taught us a lot of things as far as being responsible is concerned .
what do you think the international comunity should learn ?
the international community needs to know that it is very important to keep one 's word and that they can not take it back .
they also need to know that they did very little to save the people who were dying in our country .
they also need to know that survivors are there and that these survivors need to live a good life .
they need to know that the genocide actually happened and they need to show respect to its victims and to acknowledge that these victims were actually innocent .
can i ask you the same question again .... would you like to have a family one day ?
in my future plans , i plan to have a family .
and i plan to teach my family the same morals i was taught .
what would you tell them ?
what they first need to know is that the word of a parent is of great value .
that 's something they need to know and keep in their hearts ; especially when they are positive advice .
i will keep on showing them the example of what i was told so they can one day tell it to their descendants .
here i am talking about my wife and my children .
and finally , who is freddy today ? which sort of a person are you ?
i feel like i am one of the survivors who have the development of all the others on their heart , whose goal is for us to be united as we fight against all the consequences of the genocide .
i am one of the people who dreams of a developed rwanda and i am also one of those who really wants to fight all genocidal ideologies .
several people , some of whom i know and others i do n't know are ready to fight those ideas as much as we can .
our plan is to build our nation and we shall make it only if we put into consideration the younger generations and if we work towards removing all bad ideologies from their minds and replace them with new ones .
this is the 29th of march 2004 , in kigali and we are speaking to rosette .
rosette could you first of all give me your name and your age ?
my name is sebasoni musabe rosette , i am twenty @-@ five years old .
and after the genocide ehh ... how many of your family were killed in the genocide ?
during genocide , i lost my parents and my four sisters . in total , i lost six people in my family .
can you describe for me ... eh , describe for me your mother ?
my mother was a wonderful parent . because i learnt strong lesson from her .
she a parent who knew very well how to look after us .
her great example is still very vivid in me .
she was very open with us , she used to tell us everything .
we used to think it strange that she would tell us that she loved us ; everyone we would tell about it could not believe it , as it is not something a parent easily expresses to his @/@ her child [ in our culture ] .
but she was a parent who knew how to look after her children .
she was very sociable and people still say so today .
she was a very good adviser , people used to come home to seek advice from her . she had very many friends and there would always be visitors at home .
we used to see several people coming home ; some would come to live at home , others would come for school fees or some were domestic workers .
if my mum found a worker to be bright enough to go to school , my mum would take him or her to school .
they are a lot of people whom she took to school and some went up to secondary yet they started as domestic workers at home .
saying everything about her would take ages ; all i know is that she was a very wonderful parent .
tell me about your father .
all i can say about my father ... he was also a wonderful parent .
we realized it after the genocide as people say a lot of good about them .
they say , "@ it seemed impossible that such good people would spend their old age together and see their own children when the latter are adults . @"
actually all i said about my mum similarly applies to my dad .
although he was a quiet man , he also had so many friends .
... especially his collegues and neighbours .
and most friends we have now ... the people who helped us after the genocide were my father 's friends .
former schoolmates , colleagues ... usually the female parent is the one who is more familiar with the children . however , our dad too showed us love .
tell me about happy times ... a particularly happy memory that you have with your parents .
the one who was after me was called consolee , another one was called angelique .
she was followed by the one called illuminee . another one was called florence .
there was also an adopted child at home called jeanne . we considered her as part of our family .
sorry , could you please tell me the names of your sisters again ?
my sisters who died in the genocide , were consolee , angelique , illuminee and florence .
but there was also an adopted child who died together with them and we considered her as our sister .
she was called jeanne .
what was your relationship with your sisters , how did you get on with your sisters ?
what i can say about my sisters ... they were still young .
it took long time before my parents gave birth to other children after we left burundi . they were still preparing themselves for having other children .
therefore , the young ones were much younger than us . they were very obedient kids .
they considered me as their aunt . they considered me as someone more mature than them .
we used to discipline them because that is what mum used to tell us .
another thing i can say , our mother had forbidden us to fight . we used to teach them good manners ; we would tell them that none of them should abuse the other .
she used to tell us that insulting someone as stupid could make them grow up with a belief that he or she is actually stupid .
therefore , she would warn them never do it again , she told them she did not want to ever hear them abusing each other .
and that is the discipline we taught to our young sisters .
of course they were naughty just like other children are and we would punish them .
but they would never abuse each other because we told them not to .
another thing i recall about my relatives , angelique was an extraordinary child .
she was very bright . i remember she was good at playing draughts ; it is a very popular game .
she would play with twenty @-@ five or thirty @-@ year @-@ old people .
it a game that requires thinking .
but she would win over them all yet she would be the youngest .
i remember she was in primary two .
she won over many people .
i remember she was a very sharp child ; she knew how to distiguish different types of music at a very young age .
i mean types of music ; she could listen to music and tell which one is funky , which is rock and which is zouk .
she also enjoyed dancing a lot and most people liked her .
while she was still in nursery school , her teachers used to take her to the lake in gisenyi or in kibuye .
she was such an interesting child that almost everybody liked her .
she knew how to sing and how to make friends as young as she was . she left us special memories , we shall always remember her .
the other children had a more quiet spirit .
however , she was different , she was more noisy . it was easy to forget she was just a child looking at her ability to reason like an adult .
no one considered her to be young .
but , she died so young ; she was only ten years old .
if you were going to remember only one thing about your mother , what would it be ?
what i remember about my mother ... is the advice she used to give all types of people .
and that was why most people liked her . she was humble and able to give people advice .
i guess that is the one thing i recall .
did you see it happen ?
yes , i saw it . because we were together when they took them . and killed them in our presence .
what happened ?
on the 7th of april 1994 , it was during the holidays ... i remember i was with mum coming from the market .
then she told me that ... meanwhile she had read a certain newspaper .
then she said , "@ horrible things are going to suddenly happen in rwanda . @"
then she talked to her friend called xaverine who is still alive today . then we passed by the market and brought a few things , then went back home .
she went telling me how bad the situation was .
but we were not prepared for anything like what happened . then on the 7th [ around the 4th ] on the 7th ... that is when ... [ after habyarimana 's plane crashed ] it began at night .
we heard them talking in the bedroom [ our parents ] they woke us up and said , "@ wake @-@ up , things are not good . @"
they tunned on the foreign news and heard it being said in both french and english .
then we asked them what was taking place , they told us not to worry , but bad things were likely to happen in this country .
in the morning we heard that our neighbour had been killed .
then mum sent us to a certain person who was selling ... in the neighbourhood , he was also a tutsi .
she told us to go and tell him that he should close his shop because things had deteriorated .
he was running a bar .
and on our way as we were going to tell him , we met people going to kill others .
we ran back home and never said anything .
that was when the war had really started ; people started to kill .
at home they came to kill on the 12th .
they first protected us ; some people were willing to protect us .
"@ nothing will happen to you @"@ , they promised .
but people from different areas were saying that if our family was still alive , then no tutsi was dead , then the inyenzi were still alive .
later we were attacked by groups from gisenyi ... they headed towards our home .
they could n't believe we were still alive .
therefore , they fought those who were protecting us ... the soldiers and interahamwe who used to come home would tell us who else they had killed and in what way they had killed them ... @" mum would constantly comfort us saying , "@ do n't be scared .
even if you die , several people have died too , do n't be afraid .
that would just mean that all the tutsi were meant to die . maybe if you survive you might suffer .
so do n't be afraid , all people in this area have died , we are the only ones remaining ... @" they were protecting us and stopping us from fleeing telling us that we should n't go anywhere and that we should just stay there .
then later , after the attack of the 12th of april 1994 left us alive , on the 14th of april 1994 ... meanwhile they had come home and said that all the boys should come out .
but my older brother was not there ; together with other cousins who lived at home , they had taken them to hide in the ceiling of other people 's house .
therefore , they did n't find any ... they only found my parents and i plus the young ones , who had come to hide at home thinking that we would be protected .
on the 14th is when the group of attackers ran after us and searched for us in all corners where we were hiding .
we fled but they followed us and found us .
i myself hid under the bed . they even hit me with a club on my ribs while they were searching for me .
then i decided to get out .
i had realised that they may kill me inside there . we came out .
they ran after my young sisters . they were young and they were screaming . they took my parents .
then they said , "@ everyone is dead , you are the only ones remaining , yet you are the top inyenzi [ cochroaches ] " then they killed them .
mum said goodbye to us before they left .
we asked them to let us say goodbye to them but they never let us say goodbye to dad .
but we got to say goodbye to our mum .
then mum told us , "@ be strong . @"
and the way she told us , "@ nothing will ever happen to you .
you have several relatives in burundi and in kigali .
you shall live with them with no problem and nothing will happen to you @" still surprises me today .
the only thing she told us is to be strong .
we said goodbye to her and then we left .
then they said , "@ we will n't kill you , we only want to kill old chockroaches .
the rest of you can leave . @"
we were taken to a certain old man 's house but there were several other interahamwe .
they told those interahamwe to keep an eye on us , "@ these kids should not leave this place , we shall kill them later ! @" they were back on the 15thof april 1994 .
the interahamwe had spent the whole night watching us ; they abused us , bragging about how they had killed people and some of them [ the people they killed ] were our relatives . in the morning they came to get our sisters .
they said , "@ you , you look older , killing you would require some energy . @" therefore , they took our sisters and killed them .
poor kids , all the way they went saying goodbye to us , "@ bye bye ... we wish you a good life and may god help you ... @" it was surprising to see them talking to us as though they knew we would actually survive for everyone [ tutsi ] was entitled to die .
i really wonder why they said words like such as ‘ we wish you a long , good life ’ .
later we left that place when we realized that they wanted to separate me from my brother .
they were planning to take me to congo and do with me ... we bribed someone and then he helped us escape at night .
we left as though we were going for a short call , one by one and then we all left .
we walked so much that it seemed as though we had walked around the whole of rwanda , in gitarama , in gikongoro and maybe in cyangugu as well . most of the time we used to walk at night .
i guess ... for us to survive , we went through several hardships ; it would take too long to talk about everything one by one .
we went through many things , we were starving most of the time , we spent nights in the bush .
we used to get somewhere and fail to find ... i remember once in the forest , we had no idea where we were , neither which province it was .
then we suddenly heard hyenas . we got into the forest ; we did n't seem to know whether we wanted to get in or out of it .
then we heard the hyenas squealing and heading towards us , wanting to bite us . we slept there and were rained on .
we used to hide at day time and spend the night walking .
i was with my brother called freddy .
i guess that is it .
do you know how your parents died ?
my parents were hit with clubs to death .
after killing them , they threw their bodies outside and cursed them .
later that evening my brother went and covered them with some soil with the help of someone else .
did you witness ... did you see the interahamwe carrying out their killings ?
i saw the interahamwe killing people .
we experienced the war for quite a long time , not just one or two months .
from the 7th of april 1994 to the 1st of august 1994 , we were going through the war because we were still running away .
we witnessed the interahamwes murdering many people .
some were shot down and some were beaten up with clubs and we saw it all happening .
we sometimes had to jump over dead bodies as we were running away . we could at times reach a roadblock and they would tell us to go away with the hope that we would be killed on the next one .
in other cases we were able to somehow escape .
i saw many of them killing people .
can you describe for me anything very dificult ... can you discribe for me , the ... just one of those things you saw that stays very strongly in your mind and maybe ... no. before you do that , what was going though your mind ?
was it fear , was it survival , what happened during that time ... what were you thinking ... what were you feeling ?
during genocide , we spent two weeks very frightened ... for a week we were so terrified .
and after we saw our parents being killed , our sisters and other people ... when we realized that all people were finished .
all the fear disappeared . the only problem remaining was why you did n't die with the rest .
i remember this man called nyarusenge who came and told me he wanted to help me flee so i would n't die ; he said he was going to take my brother somewhere else .
i was still very young but i could understand that he either wanted me to become his wife or he had in mind to rape me .
he had a club they called nta mpongano y' umwanzi [ a spiked club ] .
he asked me to enter the house and wait for him .
i was so hurt !
what shows that all fear was gone is the way i replied him so rudely , "@ i can not do that ! @"
i think that 's the reason why we left that place ... when we realized that things were going so wrong .
they were saying that they would come to rape me .
when my brother heard about that ... i was scared about that ... we decided to go and be killed elsewhere .
during the genocide , i was n't scared most of the time .
i told him , "@ if you feel like killing me then just go ahead and kill me .
my parents are now dead , they were educated people , they had degrees ... you were among the attackers who came to kill them yet you once lived together , they once fed you , you were friends .
and now you want to use me in any way of your wish . @"
i went on and told him , "@ i 'd rather be killed than becoming your wife or fleeing with you . @"
he entered the house , very angry saying that he had the rights to kill me .
then i asked him that , "@ why do n't you kill me ? @"
he just kept quiet and left .
but they were waiting for the nightfall to kill us .
it could even be that they were thinking of other ways of mistreating me or both of us .
i was with my brother .
but god helped us and and we left in the morning .
they never found us .
it shows that in reality , we were n't scared .
by then , all fear was gone .
can you discribe for me just ... just something you saw during that time , which really stayed in your mind as the most terrible , the most difficult moment ?
the one thing that still hurts so much is the way my sisters were killed .
it 's maybe understandable that my parents were killed because they were tutsis and they were even maybe contributing in helping out the inkotanyis , they were adults and responsible for the actions but my sisters were just kids !
but what about young children were just screaming ?
i can still recall the way the last @-@ born was crying .
they carried her and told her that my mother had gone for a meeting and that that was where they were taking .
my mother used to go for meetings and she would bring for them biscuits or anything else they wanted and so they told her that that 's where my mom had gone .
what i am saying is that what hurts the most is the way children were murdered in the genocide .
they did n't even know the meaning of "@ inkotanyi @" and they acussed them of being "@ inkotanyi . @" they did n't know what the word "@ inyenzi @" meant . they did n't know whether they were hutu or tutsi .
sometimes i do n't understand it !
those people must have been extremely cruel to do such a thing !
killing an innocent child , who does not belong to any political party , who knows nothing !
that is the only thing ... that comes back to me .
i was never cry when memories of the genocide come back to me ... the image of the death of our kids .. whenever i recall it , i feel so much pain .
rosette , what does it mean for you , being a survivor ?
personally , knowing that i am a survivor ... the fact that i survived makes me feel good because i realize that god helped us .
it pleases me so much because so many people died . i strongly believe there a reason why god saved us .
to me , being a survivor ... is to have the responsibility to stand in the position of the people who died .
what do i mean ?
i have to be my mum , my dad , my sisters and try to be complete .
i have to try and be in their position .
i mean , i have to do what i am meant to do , go to school and study and finish my studies , i have to work .
if it is to be a sociable person ... i would n't want to hear people saying that my parents left no one behind , or that we are irresponsible .
i would n't give a chance to those who thought that they exterminated my family to find us in a shameful position .
i can n't find the right way to express it .
standing in the position of both your parents and your siblings who died , being a man is a big responsability .
and , i think it is everybody 's resposibility .
to stand in the position of those who are gone . meaning that you do what they were supposed to do . although you are only one person , you try and do their work as well as yours .
and after the genocide , how did you survive ?
who looked after you ... where did you go ... ?
what did you do ?
we tried looking for a family after the genocide ; many of the people we were living with had died .
my mother 's family was completely decimated . only 5 out of more than 60 people survived !
in my father 's family seemed to be more ... but all those who were in rwanda during the genocide had been killed , nobody was left .
only one aunt survived and very few cousins who are very young , our uncles also died .
most of them were exhumed and reburied at gisozi .
others ... almost the whole family was decimated .
the way we used to live with other people ... how our parents behaved around others is what helped us to live in their absence .
everybody who would see us , would say , "@ these are the children of so and so , they survived . @"
and people were good to us , they helped us in completing our school education .
we did n't have anywhere to live , it once happened that we did not have where to live .
we led a horrible life but we tried our best .
our parents lived well with others , we also had to do so .
there is a certain family , that had remained in burundi ; when they came we lived with them .
presently we are living with a certain lady who adopted us .
she had once lived with both my parents and we had known her for a long time .
unforfunately , she recently passed away .
now we are living with the family she left .
how many of your simblings survived ? who survived among your brothers and sisters ?
in my immediate family , we were six and only two survived ; my older brother and i.
what do you think about the future ... what kind of future do you see ?
the way i think about the future ... i think it will be good .
in my opinion , the future is promising ; the future will be better than the past [ i mean after the genocide ] .
because before the genocide things were the other way round ; everything in life was like milk and honey .
but after the genocide until today , one can believe ... in most cases , the citizens still depend on the government .
when i consider today 's leadership , i can say that their aim is to bring people together and stop divisions . they want to unite people .
therefore , the future will be good to many people .
but i would n't want to ignore that some people will still find the future so disappointing ... because they were left with diseases , there are some children who never went to school yet they were able to study .
but to me , the future will be better than the past [ i mean straight after the genocide ] .
because one had not yet defined the right path to go through .
personally i was lucky .
i am educated ; i completed my secondary school and i have now completed university .
and now i see that ... well , of course life is not totally based on education but i guess there is much i thought i would never be able to achieve that i have achieved , which i am glad i did .
i guess the rest will go according to god 's plan and personally .
i will emphasize on the fact that in many ways , people 's lives are dependent on the leadership .
people died due to a bad government .
if the government had done the right thing , people would n't have died .
thanks to the plan that today 's government 's has , many people have the hope of living and this reassures me that the future will be good .
i am not forgetting that some people will have a bad life in the future . i am not saying that things will be like milk and honey [ a good life ] for all people .
i always think about people who were infected with hiv @/@ aids during the genocide ... very young kids who were two or three years old then who never experienced parental care .
today they are not well cattered for in orphanages . others live on the streets , they are cattered for by passers @-@ by . they move from house to house .
i think that may have some negative impact on their future lives .
i guess i was lucky because i got a chance of having parents and they prepared me .
and now i guess i have a foundation . i tend to think that i will never have to face plenty of problems [ as i did in the past ] to be sincere .
rosette , is it possible to forgive the people who committed these crimes ?
it is not possible for one to forget his or her people .
that 's impossible .
even wise men say that forgetting is a form of sickness .
forgetting what happened in one 's life ... for example there is no way i can forget that i had no parents .
sincerely i can not believe that i was born from a tree !
i can never forget that i once had sisters just because i do n't see them anymore !
i often see children of their age who used to go to school with them and who are now finishing secondary school .
there 's a lot that reminds me of them !
it is simply impossible to forget .
we can never forget !
do you think that you have had justice for your parents and your sisters ?
has justice been done to your parents ?
i would say that justice ... justice is needed .
the victims of the genocide were innocent .
my parents , my friends and relatives ... i really believe that justice needs to take action .
it is hard to find the right words to say it ... umh nothing can bring them back , that is impossible .
some people killed others ... let 's say there are several people who killed others in the history of the world , but they were killing people with whom they did n't have anything in common .
but rwandans killed each others while in reality , they were brothers and sisters !
therefore , you can never find the appropriate punishment to exercise on them . death is not a punishment .
neither is imprisonment . i guess people should be sensitized and there should be justice .
and the law should determine the kind of punishments to be given so that people will learn that human rights should be respected .
be it a child or an old woman or an old man , be it a hutu or a tutsi , be it a foreigner or any other person , as long as blood is shed , nobody should be killed when they are innocent !
and justice needs to be there .
not only in rwanda , i would request for justice in the whole world .
because justice is needed .
people should n't die innocently .
my very last question .
do you think that genocide is possible here again ?
i hope genocide will never happen again in rwanda .
i guess the ideology that rwanda has now , together with the lessons people learnt from killing one another , really people ... i do n't think it will ever happen again .
i believe we experienced it , we unfortunately experienced it .
i think we have a task of teaching people how to respect each other .
i mean , if everyone respects human rights , then there would be no genocide again .
and even now i believe there will be no genocide again .
i said that was my last question but i have one more question .
what kind of person are you after this ?
are you hopeful , are you optimistic ... are you sad and unhapppy ? who is rosette ?
[ she smiles . ] today i am a very happy person , that 's who i have always been for those who know me .
i am free ; i am a very free person .
i do not constitute a burden to the rwandan society or to the people around me . i strongly believe that i will live long .
i wish i ... i wish i would live a better life than this .
i guess i mentionned it earlier that i would like to stand in the position of my parents , my friends and my sisters ; all those who died in the genocide .
i wish i would represent them .
to represent them requires to be a different person , that 's my goal ... how can i say this ... [ she smiles ]
my name is mukundwa safi , i am 21 years old , and before the genocide we lived in kibuye , in the former commune of gitesi , currently known as karongi community , in the bwishyura sector , the sector kept its old name , bwishyura cellule .
how many members did your family have before the genocide ?
i was in kibuye when the genocide started , i was eight years old .
could you give as an account of your experiences during the genocide and how you managed to survive ; could you in a few words recount how you lived through the genocide from its beginning and how it was carried out in your area of kibuye ?
the genocide ; in the morning after habyarimana 's death ; i was still a child and i did n't understand but our parents told us to stay in the house , not to go anywhere and stay home ; at that time we stayed home , my mother later sent me to town ; our town was a small centre ; on my way there , when i was nearing my destination , i met this lady who was like an auntie to me , her name was marie goreth , she was so angry she nearly hit me , she ordered me to run home otherwise i was going to be killed there ; at that time people had started looting the town centre ; some shops were being looted while others were left alone , i did n't know why ; then there was this relative of mine who did business in this part of the centre , i saw him run and some people welding machetes were chasing after him , at that point kayishema had fired bullets and the genocide had started in kibuye , that is how the genocide started in our area of kibuye .
two days later , that was on the ninth of that month ; the men and elder boys went up towards bisesero , we remained with mother and my brother who was a little older than me , he was called claude , we stayed home , as you can understand we were very scared and my mother was very worried about the events that were unfolding , it was not an easy situation .
we stayed at home and the food cooked was left untouched on the fire stones because people were too scared and we only ate after a few days ; after a few days , someone came to our home , my mother worked in the ministry of works , she had helped that person get a job ; he came running and screaming ; quick , quick , you are the third on the list of those to be killed and whose property is to be destroyed ; my mother got hold of a few things ; she only took a few things ; she asked us to move with the people who were moving towards the sports stadium , we lived near the side of the road ; after some time we moved into the sports stadium , we had initially stayed at home but we were told we should move or we would be killed , so we went and joined the others in the sports stadium , it was about the tenth of that month , that is an estimate , i can not remember the dates very well ; we went to the sports stadium and found many people with the same problem as ours , we stayed there for about two weeks ; we soon run out of food we had brought with us , mother had a little money , she used the money to buy some food , some people in the stadium had brought their cattle with them and were now slaughtering them because of the food shortage ; people were buying meat but only able to cook it with dry grass because there was no firewood and once you had entered the stadium you were n't able to leave , there were very many road @-@ blocks and those soldiers would not let you leave , we were also very thirsty because there was n't enough water , there were no toilets either and people started getting sick because of dirt , we stayed there until the eighteenth , i will always remember that date , there are two dates that i will always remember .
the eighteenth of april , it was about two o'clock in the afternoon when three buses arrived with people singing and hanging on them , they were singing genocide songs ; the genocide songs that they sang at that time , those songs that you all know , they got off the buses and kept singing , for those who know the kibuye sports stadium , gatwaro is in a low laying area with hills on either sides , we were in the middle , then they started to shoot into the crowd .
one of my first terrible images of the genocide is one that always comes back to me , there was this man , who claimed to have become a hutu following some rwandan customs , he moved up towards the interahamwe on the gatwaro hill , when he got close enough one of them picked an axe and hit him splitting him open like firewood , they cut his body into two pieces and threw him back into the stadium .
many people died during that period , many people died in the stadium , when i was with my parents , there was a man named mutabagisha thomas , he was a pastor ; i usually loved to pray very much and i loved to go to him to hear him talk about god , i used to go to listen to children stories about god from the bible , so when the interahamwe came , i was with my mother , i immediately looked for a way to find the pastor but i was not able to get to him , i lost him , i went back to look for my mother who was also worried about me , when i got back i found my mother 's sister and grandmother had been shot ; after they died , my mother covered them with a sheet of cloth , i took the sheet of cloth off to look at them , i felt so angry but my mother told me to calm down , she told me to keep quiet which i did ; when my mother was covering the bodies she was also hit by a bullet but it was not serious .
we stayed on in that situation , they sometimes threw in smoke grenades into the crowd and we poured water on them , after some time we had no more water and no more energy and that is when they wanted to come down into the stadium and start hacking people with machetes , in the stadium there were some tough men like a man called emile , i remember him , he was a family friend and his wife worked with my mother , he asked people to gather stones , he was like a leader , he ordered people to stone the interahamwe to keep them away , shooting rather than letting them come down and start hacking with machetes , time went on and about six thirty in the evening , it was dusk , the interahamwe started using whistles to create chaos , i was never hit by a bullet , the interahamwe then called it a day and left fearing they would shoot each other because it was becoming dark , we also prepared for the following day .
early next morning , we left the stadium , the smell in the stadium is one of the things i always remember about the genocide , it was a terrible smell , people had died , animals had died , some cattle had been shot , some food had gone bad , when we got home , we found a child , about nine months old , the baby had been shot in the abdomen , it was my auntie 's baby , it was a very nice baby that everyone loved , it was very sad .
we continued in the forest until a point when the interahamwe came in with dogs , they brought dogs to hunt us and they were able to find some people , they would shout that they have seen someone and if you got scared and run then you would give yourself out and they would chase you and kill you . i know many people among my relatives who ran and they were chased and killed .
we were in that forest but i do n't know why they were not able to see us ; we were able to see them and that is why i am able to tell you about the many things i saw , in that forest you could be in a position to see a person while that person was unable to see you
you see when the rain came down it was mixing with blood , it was very scary , that was life in the forest , that evening we left the forest , my mother said we should go and try to find the congolese and see if they could help us in anyway ; we left together with my brother and another small boy whose elder brother , jean , worked at a pharmacy in kibuye . jean 's family was not from kibuye , they were from kigali . jean 's little brother was just visiting and he did not know anyone , i do n't know how my mother spotted him and she then asked him to come with us , we left together ; we moved down the forest towards lake kivu ; to go to nyamishamba , one needs to go past lake kivu .
we saw a lot of bodies at lake kivu , we heard that many of these people had been killed in the friday market day and their bodies had been piled onto a truck and dumped here . we saw very many bodies in that place , they seemed to be white as they reflected the moonlight , we moved on because we were very scared , we also saw trees and we kept thinking they we people only later to realize they were trees .
we moved on until we got to nyamishamba , when we got closer to where the congolese lived , we found the doors and windows and all the house property had been taken and someone had been killed there ; i did not know these people , i only remember my mother saying that someone had been killed in that house that night ; here , here , someone said , the inyenzi rebels have attacked , i thought these people may have seen those who left the stadium and were trying to get to bisesero . these people may have seen them and mistaken them for rebels . i remember mother saying , these people must be mocking us , if only those rebels came .
we stayed and slept there , in the morning , my mother who had a stomach problem , woke up hiccupping ; she hiccupped so much and being a child i started to cry , i cried hard and my mother tried to calm me down saying that it was going to be alright . i thought she was going to die . i was also thinking about many things because she had a stomach problem and we were hungry .
we had slept in the other house ; in the morning ; about five o'clock , some people came to the house ; the interahamwe came to the house ; they said that the people we saw last night might be hiding in these ruins , so they decided to check the house , that is how they found us , they immediately saw us , they ordered us out and with many others took us to nyamishaba , they took all of us to the gasura sector
at the gasura sector , about one hundred people had already been killed , many people had been killed and their bodies had been put up in piles ; the bodies had already started decomposing and as a child i had a problem with nausea and vomiting , when i saw the bodies that had been piled , i felt nauseated and that also made one interahamwe nauseated and he hit me on the arm with a stick , when he hit me the nausea went away , since that day i no longer have that problem when we got there we found a girl called claudine , she was down , hacked by machetes and had been stripped naked . my mother took a sheet of clothing and gave it to her .
when the girl saw my mother she cried out to her , she said she had been raped and hacked with machetes , you see my mother , my mother was , i do n't know if i can say she was weak , she was affected by such a situation , she sat down and started crying , she told the girl to persevere because there was nothing any of us could do , that is how life is , you have to remain strong
the interahamwe at that point had not given us any orders , then suddenly they came , i think they had been in a meeting , they ordered us to dig pits , go did pits they said , children will bury children , you should bury your relatives , the rest will be buried on top to cover the pits and we all thought that is how it was going to be .
people then started to dig up the pits ; when we got to the nyamishaba memorial many people had already been killed and we were throwing them , i mean we were burying them , but the interahamwe had ordered us to throw them into the pits . i saw many children , i saw three children that i had gone to school with , they were still alive , burying their friends and some hands were coming of the bodies because those bodies had already started to decompose , those are some of the memories that i get from the genocide , i do n't like thinking about it ; our people were desecrated .
you see it was my first time to see a dead person , then i was soon forced to carry them and i was not able to do well because of reasons beyond my control , after the burials they ordered us to move forward to be killed , that is when my mother leaned against a raised wall of soil , she stopped hiccupping . there was a lady who lived in nyamishaba , i did not know her name ; i tried to ask people about her name , gave her description but no one seemed to know her . she helped us a lot , she helped small children and my mother when she was sick , she gave us porridge with no sugar , she helped us in ways she could , she also gave us sweet potatoes to eat but we knew elsewhere we were heading for death
when they saw my mother they screamed , they were surprised she was still alive , they got hold of her and hacked her with a machete , that is what i saw , i even saw the machete , she immediately fell down with fear and the whole group descended on her with machetes , i do n't know what part they hacked but i saw them hack all parts of the body , i was like someone who was losing my mind , my brother kept calling me , @"@ fill @" that was my pet name at home , please hurry he was pushing me away , when he pushed me away he remained behind and he was hacked together with the other child , the group split into two and the followed the small boy and also hacked him , the boy who was visiting was hacked , when my brother pushed me , i fell down into a garden of sweet potatoes , i quietly crawled away and hid behind a tree , it was a bit dark , it was about quarter to seven o'clock and in the rainy season it was already dark .
after hacking the others to death they were leaving when suddenly one said ; they were with another child , where is the other child ? they started searching for me , the guard was with them searching for me and he was the last person i saw and he hit me with a slasher and i lost consciousness ; he hit me on the arm because i had seen other people use machetes to hack , i had seen many people who had been hacked at the forest in nyamishamba , most were hacked on the head , that is why i raised my arm , when i raised my hand above my head , he first hit me with a slasher which was not sharp but my hand bled badly , he then hit me on the head with a club , the club had nails and my head bled a lot , they also slashed my leg and stabbed me ; they also slashed my ribs , i think i tried to turn i am not sure , i only felt the blows to the hand and head and after that i lost consciousness ; i was unconscious , i was not able to talk , i was not able to think , i was not able to do anything but the last thing i heard the guard , francois sinzabakira , saying was " pay me back if you can @"
i do n't know how much time i spent unconscious ; i did not seem to remember everything that happened , i stayed there a little longer , i then slept until sunset when i came around again .
i slowly regained consciousness and woke up hearing the wind ; being close to lake kivu , it was cold ; i was hearing the wind and noises from the valley below wondering where i was .
what am i doing here ?
i then remembered how the interahamwe had attacked , how they had hacked my mother to death , how they had hacked my brother to death , how they had hacked the other child , i did n't see how they hacked him but i clearly saw the rest , i did n't see this child because he was a small distance away but i could hear his screams , i kept on gathering my thoughts up to the point i remembered how i had been attacked and the first time i had looked at my arm , i saw that the bones had been exposed and were in pieces ; i realized the pieces of bone were not attached .
i kept on realizing where i was , at that time i was wearing a dress , it had been torn to pieces by the machetes and was full of blood , i then thought about checking other parts of the body , and they were also full of blood , the whole body as it was , with mud from the valley , water and other things ; that was at the sunset , early in the morning i wanted to ; when i regained consciousness i wanted to know truly if my family had died .
i really wanted to know if my family was dead or still living , i had stopped feeling like a child and was now feeling like a grown adult , a responsible person , although i say that , getting up was not easy , it was difficult , you see , when your legs are injured , you use your arms to get up , it was n't easy ; i crawled towards my brother who was lying next to me , i looked and saw his neck had been hacked and only something small here was holding his neck together , he was dead , i asked him , are you still alive ? just like someone can ask you a question , voices are not clear . i was a child and i did n't know that the voices are not clear . he asked me , are you still alive ?
voice is not clear . he had been traumatized , i thought about how i would have been taken and killed , i showed him bodies , i kept quiet , i did n't have what to say to him ; at that point the man took me and gave me tea ; they got me other clothes and took off the clothes stained with blood , that auntie gave me a bath and helped me wear the new clothes .
later about eight o'clock that morning , i went to visa 's house , they had told me that visa was a friend of the family , let 's see if they can give us any help , so we left , when he saw me , he immediately shouted ; fille , you are still alive ?
and i said yes , i immediately entered the house , they took me in and gave me some food and because i had not eaten in many days , i felt like there were some wounds in my throat , voices are not clear , i was hungry but i failed to eat , i asked them give me some water , give me some water , and then visa told the husband of my auntie that their house was always being searched and they did n't know where to hide me , let 's take her to the back of the house in the sorghum garden until the sunset .
i was taken to the sorghum garden and when i got to the sorghum garden i did n't feel like staying there .
the neighboring house belong to a man named emile , he and his wife had already been killed , i do n't remember how i came to think of this , i was n't able to stand , i crawled into their home , i entered a room and pulled myself near a door that was about here ; the family was here and i was by their side , voices are not clear .
there was blood everywhere .
voices are not clear honestly , i could not believe it , someone gave them directions because they came knowing i was hiding there , they did n't find me because i had already left , they looked around after failing to find me , you see an empty house gives echoes so i was able to hear their voices , they were in the living room , you see that room had a lot paper scattered on the ground , so they said , let 's look around and see if we can find emile 's inkotanyi papers , so they started looking through the papers and were moving in my direction , one even nearly stepped on me but picked a piece of paper and left , i am not sure he saw me or not .
i stayed there for about four hours , later that evening i crawled back into the sorghum garden , there was a nearby maize garden owned by someone named patel
patel , i mean his wife , patel was not there at that time , his wife , her younger brother and a worker came to harvest some maize and saw me , they were very surprised ; ehh , this child is still alive ?
the lady lamented about my mother , the lady said , this girl 's mother was a good friend to me , let me take her into my home and she took me in ; they carried me away because i was unable to walk , she took me to her home , it was a drivers home ; her husband was kayishema clement 's driver , you all know his stories from kibuye , he had to be driven by a very important person . his wife put me in the house where i stayed ; i spent about two weeks because i was wounded , she was treating my wounds . i had wounds all over and that made me very weak . some wounds , especially on my legs had become infected .
he also told the head of the pediatric ward that when he returns he should not find me missing from the hospital . he then left , that 's the last i saw of him , honestly , he had been so good to me , he kept me from killers because they were scared of him .
they were unable to kill me , i stayed in the hospital but got no treatment , they could have treated me if they wanted ; i stayed in the hospital and the infected wounds that i had caused a lot of pain , there was a man named bahutu pierre , he still works in kibuye , he was one of the workers in kibuye , he took me and "@ stole @" me away from that part of the hospital , he cleaned my wounds and tried to clear the infections by dressing the wounds with cotton . he recently told me that he would take me into the operations room in the middle of the night , because that is where he worked , to treat me and a certain other girl called esther , she was also from kibuye .
my leg was flexed and i could not stretch it out because i was not getting any treatment ; esther also had the same problem , she could not stretch out her arm .
as you realize he tried to help me as much as he could , we stayed in the hospital , it 's the place ; it 's where i saw the worst happen ; it 's where i saw the things that will always remind me of the genocide , even when i fall sick , i still fear going to see a doctor in a hospital because if i get admitted it would remind me of the genocide because of the things i saw there ; many members of my family were still alive , you see it had been from april to may , it was in may when many members of my family died trying to visit me because they saw me as only a child who had lost a whole family ; a child who had been hacked in her hiding place , there was a man named twayigira , he was my mother 's brother , some people had managed to hide him and assured him that he would be safe
when he heard about me , he said ; would n't it be stupid not to try to find her ? they tried to tell him that they would find me for him but he insisted on coming out . he then left the place . he should have had his wedding in july 94 , he left his hiding place and came rushing to find me .
he reached me about seven o'clock one evening ; when i saw him , i felt overcome with grief and i felt like crying , i kept myself from crying because i did n't want them to see me cry , when he greeted me i almost broke down and cried , i replied his greeting , he had a lot of money because he was preparing for his wedding ; you see , he still had all the money , his fiance had already been killed , he took his wallet out of his pocket ; i am not sure he was going to give me some money but as he took out his wallet , an interahamwe named bizuru quickly came up to him he was carrying a machete , he then led him down towards the pediatric ward , those who know a little history about kibuye know about a very large pit they called onapo , just behind the windows of where we were living
it is where many tutsi from that neighborhood who came to the hospital were killed , you see many were injured so many came to the hospital ; they took twayigira and started to hack him , i could hear his screams , he screamed until he died , pascal had been killed ; pascal had a younger brother called bosco ; bosco is still alive , he lives in kacyiru .
they also told him that fille is still alive although she was hacked by machetes , at that time it was the kind of news that travelled ; let me go and see that child he said , he came with pascal 's fiance called christine , they came together , she was butchered in that hole ; then came another uncle 's wife , his name was pascal , his wife had given birth in a hole where she was hiding .
they told her that fille was still alive , she also came asking , how is that child ? she like many others was also killed in that place , at that time it still was n't important to be one family
we all had something in common , everyone felt responsible and wanted to come and visit and many people were killed by an interahamwe leader called mahundaza , i remember him ; mahundaza also had his leader called benoit , they used to come together . there was also the headmaster of gatwaro school .
my mother was well loved and many people said she was a social person , i did not get a chance to know her well ; many people came to visit me ; one lady came wearing a skirt and blouse that was given to her by my mother . another girl , her father 's name was gisunzu , there was also a second girl who had clothes given to her by my mother , and she was also killed there .
it was also another form of torture , they would come and say to me , "@ we killed aime , we stripped her naked and paraded her through the round @-@ about . they also killed an eight year old girl and they bragged about it , today they deny it but in the past they were talking about it even when no one asked . they said they took the pastor 's wife naked from church and paraded her through the round @-@ about , your relative masamaza , they said , has been crucified at the round @-@ about .
many told me how others had been killed , they said butati had been killed and many things about rutabingwa .
the voices are not clear , they said that sankara ; thomas had resurrected to see his relatives but they had killed him too , together with masamaza . they told me many things ; they told me how they killed many people .
honestly , i thought only esther and i had survived and life became unbearable and it became worse than even during the genocide , another thing , that interahamwe named bizuru is that one who killed most of these people who came to visit us from nearby ; bizuru who killed them also tortured us ; he used to cut us with razorblades , hit our feet with a hammer .
those small hammers were used on us on specific days , that is one thing that hurt most during the genocide , if only people were to be killed without being mocked and tortured ; they always gave us dates to die , if i remember well , they once said , today is the 19th , on the 20th no more tutsi 's will be living
we always waited for the dates when we were supposed to be killed but the interahamwe would come and say , we will kill you the day after tomorrow , then one day they came and ordered us out to be killed , i was so weak and i was unable to move , esther was also very weak and so we were unable to walk to our place of slaughter so they promised to come and kill us later
the auntie that i had lived with earlier had also come to the n.t ; she tried to follow @-@ up with the treatment but they asked her to leave it to them ; she asked them to let her take me to congo and see if some of my relatives can help me .
they tried to treat me . i would like to talk about the time at the hospital again , there was once an old lady who came running after they had discovered her hiding place , i do n't know where she came from , she came running and hid under one of the beds , she was very scared , she had a rosary and was saying her prayers . the interahamwe came and took her . i will always remember that lady , i always remember her when i remember the genocide period .
after leaving the hospital for n.t ; when we moved to congo , i met my relative , there was an auntie working in bukavu , she was studying at istem , she learnt i was still alive , we usually gave out our names and other details . she came and started helping me get treated but with a lot of difficulty ; if she had no medical knowledge i do n't think i would have been able to walk . she taught me a lot , i first learnt how to stand like an infant , then i had a wheelchair and later with improvement i was able to use crutches . i then stayed there
until the point i left bukavu ; but there are a lot of things that happened there ; you understand ; the auntie who was helping me was called murebwayire sheriza , most people only knew the name sheriza , later people realized she was rwandan , there were very many interahamwe that i used to meet and they wanted to know where i live so they can come and kill me . i met interahamwe from kibuye where i lived and they always asked , fille , where do you live ?
my auntie ordered me to stop speaking kinyarwanda ; i did n't know any other language although i slowly started to learn swahili and tried to speak .
i used to have very many operations and when i was under anesthesia , i always spoke kinyarwanda and i also spoke about the genocide . i always remember that when i remember the genocide .
we later left bukavu , i really wanted to see rwanda , i really wanted to see how my home was .
my auntie remained in bukavu and i returned with the family of my mother 's brother . she remained behind because of some things she had n't finished and was later to return to rwanda .
she was then attacked by some people who knew her as my relative ; they attacked her and tried to kill her , but a white colleague who worked with the saved her . this white person , i do n't remember his name had been my doctor . she then moved to europe in a country called norway , she had a school going child , she moved with that child . i stayed with my uncle 's family
recently , in the year two thousand ; the year two thousand and two , she died ; she was n't ill , it was a sudden death , she left work , went to bed and died , that pushed me back a lot , to be honest about life ; about the experiences i lived through the genocide . i do n't know how to rank those experiences that remind me of the genocide , they are just so many .
i will never forget
you told us about your mother , you also talked about your brother , you did n't tell us about your father or any other siblings
they went north towards bisesero , we did n't meet from that point
so you never managed to know how they died or the way they were killed ?
in the beginning it was very difficult , i felt a lot of pain ; even when i had other kinds of problems , they always brought up the memories of my mother 's suffering and i wished she was still alive . it is understandable to hurt when your parent suffers and her life is taken . the pain you feel is understandable
you were quite young during the genocide , eight years old , is there anything you remember about life before the war , you and your family at home ; the genocide later came and claimed the lives of your family members and parents , can you tell us the fondest memories of your mother ?
i have very many memories of my mother ; i was the only girl in the family and she use to tell me ; when a family has only one girl and she grows up into a foolish person that 's a terrible thing to happen , so i grew up with that in mind , not to grow up into a foolish person , she also told me that a girl is like milk , she can not be tasted , i heard those things as a child but up to today i still follow those principles ; she always wished to see me study and get into secondary school and finish , i always wanted to study at least until i finish secondary school and i was able to do it .
i can not stop studying until i have attained at least ; at least a degree , she had high hopes in me , she hoped i would grow up to become someone ; a rwanda girl who is the pride of her mother , as her single girl child , and about the genocide we were able to share her last suffering and when i think of that , it gives me strength to keep fighting to live again .
can you recognize any of the people who were involved in the murder of your mother and brother ?
as i had already said , it was sunset and i was n't able to see clearly and it was out of our neighborhood ; there is one person i know though ; i remember him , he even told me that i should pay him back if i can , it was the guard named francois sinzabakira
they were dead and covered , but it could not reach us , after two weeks we returned back at our homes .
one month later we went back to school and continued to live on but at that time it was the beginning of persecution , they sent to prison presumed accomplices and everything else even my father was part of those presumed accomplices that were sent to prison .
later he was released from gako where he was jailed , at gako ... rather gashora .
he came home after his release and life went on but people were still persecuted .
in 1994 , the war [ genocide ] restarted but we thought it was similar to what happened in 1992 , we fled in a church like the way we did it in 1992 .
i did not go with my parents , we went alone ; at home we were nine children and i was a twin sister to one of the boys so we fled as we were .
i and my brothers ran into a church in ntarama .
my father , my mother and my other two brothers fled in the same church we ran into .
they hacked my brother ; they cut his arms and legs and he was left out with the head and the upper side of his body .
i spent three days and some people from nyamata came , the survivors , among them there was a man called bahena who lived in nyamata , he rescued us with other men from nyamata .
they came searching for people who are still alive , they found me still breathing and saved me and other five children and laid us somewhere .
they also rescued my brother and my eldest brother too ; he was still alright even though he was full of blood it is just that he was also covered by dead bodies .
my brother introduced us , his sister and his young brother , to the people who saved him and said to them @: ‘ let me take her with me ; i want her to be with me wherever i will be ’ .
the other people left , he took me on his back and we fled , we hid in the swamps of cnd , known as cnd .
the interahamwe attacked and found us inside , we started to run and there came a time we ran separate ways and i could not find my brother again , other people picked me up because i was terribly wounded in the head that i had shrapnel inside the wounds .
they used some small sticks to remove those shrapnel inside my head so that i can get healed .
they used to take me on the back , and then we ran in the swamp up to musenyi , the genocide continued , and i finally met with my brother while i was still with the other people who rescued me .
when we met he said @: ‘ thank god i found back my sister and i would like to have her back with me . @"
he took me again on his back and nothing happened to him , he had no wound .
we continued to flee , whenever the interahamwe would attack , we would flee to gafunzo , nor go to gasozi .
once the interahamwe attacked and caught us surprising , normally they used to attack around 8 am but this time they came 6 am .
we were used that whenever they came , they came shooting but this time they came without shooting so we could not hear them and we were even at the edge of the swamp , it was not easy to run into it .
my brother managed to escape but it was difficult for him to flee me because i was terribly wounded the whole body so they caught me and others .
they killed some of the people and made me sit down , they were watching me .
when they finished to kill the ones inside the swamp and they took me with them , on our way going they saw a pot and told me to carry it , i asked them to let me search for some banana leaves so that i use them to carry but they forced me and put the pot on my head with all the wounds on it , they said @: ‘ carry this it is going to hurt you and kill you faster @"@ .
i carried it and we continued till we reached the other church , they heard other people who were coming even shooting so one man among the interahamwe who were with me started to shoot , and then they ran .
they left me there and i hid myself in the bush till morning .
in the morning around 4 00 am i went back to the other swamp and i could not find my brother .
i spent three days without finding him , i found him on the third day .
when i saw him , he said to me @: ‘ i will n't leave you , i will always go with you ’ .
we passed the first day the interahamwe did not come and they came surprisingly on the second day , it is safe , "@ get out of where you are , it is safe @" said the radio .
so we went out suddenly we were surrounded by the interahamwe , they took my brother with other people and killed them after that they left them there .
they knew my brother , they said to him @: ‘ we are going to kill you first and finish your sister after @"@ .
they killed others first and came to him after , they hacked him ; they put him in front of everyone and hacked him while everyone was laughing at him .
they left him there .
they took the metal tank they had with them and went to fetch water in the swamp .
they had a metal tank , a water tank and casseroles that they stole in several places .
after fetching water , they searched for fire woods to cook with .
they said to me @: ‘ think the way we are going to kill you brother , it is going to be awful for you ’ .
they heated the water that was in the tank up to the boiling point , after boiling , his brother was still breathing a little bit so they carried him and put him in the boiling water and closed it .
they tried to increase the heat after he was thrown in the tank .
they took shaped woods and started to press his head saying his head is getting out but the truth was that he was tall and could not fit in it .
they heated the water , after an hour i was scared thinking the way they are going to kill . i sat there and they said to me @: ‘ you have seen how we killed him ’ .
they even said we were about to cut him in pieces but his body is of useless state , nothing we can eat from it .
they took him out of the tank and he was completely naked that his body started to become white . they left me there and said to me @: ‘ you ..... you are going to die right there , we do n't even have the strength to kill you , and we finished all of it in your brother ’ .
undefined
i spent three days feeling crazy and even all others we fled together none of them passed there .
i stayed there , on the third day i regained my sense i woke up and found my brother still beside me but the smell was so awful and his body has grown bigger .
i had a dress that i used to tie up my stomach so that i do n't feel hungry , the same dress he used while taking me on his back so i took it and covered him .
i went back to the swamp in the cnd , i found lots of dead bodies and i did not recognize any one of them because the people from our place fled in several places .
they fled to ntarama , nor to nyabarongo .
i stayed in there after some days the inkotanyi came wanting to rescue me , but i refused to go with them thinking they were interahamwe , who are trying to fool me that it is safe .
after two days i felt like i am almost to die , even the water in the swamp was stinking .
a while later , the inkotanyi stood at the edge of the swamp and said to us @: ‘ it is safe , get out and come to us ’ .
the people we were with said okay lets get out it may be the inkotanyi who came .
they helped me because i was not able to move and the wounds in my head were not yet healed .
unfortunately the number of shrapnel was increasing , i tried to pick up some grasses and remove them but still i was not recovering .
they took me on the back ; i could not recognize any of these people who were helping me . they took me at the hospital in nyamata , i was treated for about two weeks .
we were taken to mingeti orphanage with other wounded children ; the ones that were terribly wounded were taken out of the country .
my wounds were not that dangerous , i was treated in the orphanage .
she became weak , and she was hospitalized for a longtime in faycal hospital .
i stopped my job and went on to look after her , she was hospitalized for almost six months but she did not recover , and then she was transferred out of the country .
so i stayed at home with the children and their father .
one month later , the father decided to send the children outside the country and we , i and the father , will follow them later because it was not easy to get air tickets for all of us .
he sent them in belgium to meet their mother because that is the place where she the mother was hospitalized .
i stayed with the father of the children .
after a while , i proposed him to let me go back to school , as i was doing nothing and i had no job .
the good thing i finished high school with good marks .
when i wanted to go to farg and apply for a scholarship , he said to me @: ‘ no , wait a bit i am still searching for your papers in order for you to study out of the country . @"
i said to him @: ‘ while we are waiting for those papers , why will n't i go to school if everything is finished i will quit the school but in the meantime i am doing nothing . @"
he said to me @: ‘ no you are going to study in the country side and i can not make it without you here . @" so i stopped .
a month later , he started to act strange .
he started to come home after job when he is nervous and talking rude to me . one day , he said to me @: ‘ even thought i sent your brothers out of the country , there is something i would like to ask you . @"
i said what is it , he said to me @: ‘ i would like you become my wife . @" i said to him @: ‘ it is impossible , you raised me as you child , and i am your child and that can not happen . @" he said to me @: ‘ you have to be my wife . @" i said no again .
he said to me again @: ‘ if you can not then leave it . @"
he said to me @: ‘ by the time we reach in another country , you are going to live on your own . @" i said fine . he continued to act strange .
at home we had two housekeepers , a boy and a girl , i went somewhere and i returned back and found the girl was chased away .
i asked him why ?
and he said to me @: ‘ that is none of your business , it is between me and the house girl . @" after two days , on the third day he came home , i was alone and the house boy was not there .
i was used to not sleep alone at home ; i always called a neighboring friend to sleep with me . he did not know that i sleep together with somebody else .
that day he came back home around midnight , it was the first time came home that much late .
when he arrived at home , he knocked on the door and they opened for him .
i was asleep in the room , so he went straight on the dining table to eat .
when he finished eating , he went in his room .
after few minutes , he called me and said to me @: ‘ yvonne , come here i want to tell you . @"
i went in his room and he said to me @: ‘ there is something i would like to tell you , return in your room i am coming . @"
i return in my room , thinking it is nothing of importance because since 1997 ; he never called me for a serious issue .
i went back to my room and he came after me , he realized i was sleeping with somebody else . he said to me @: ‘ who is this ? who is that girl ? @"
i said to him @: ‘ it 's the other neighboring friend . @"
he said to me @: ‘ i do n't want you to bring somebody in this house when i am not aware of it . @" he wanted her out , i begged him saying it 's really late .
i said to him @: ‘ please be patient until morning and she will go once and for all , i was just lonely . @"
he refused saying that he does not want my friend there . when my friend realized that it was getting far she woke up . he said to her @: ‘ wake up , i will escort you up to your gate . @"
he escorted her up to where she lived and came back .
when he came back , he went straight to his room .
he did not stay longer in his room , he came back to mine but i have already closed and slept .
so he tried to enter and found it was closed .
he said to me @: ‘ open . @" i refused to open and he said to me @: ‘ open it 's my house i will break it , open . @" i opened straight away and he said me @: ‘ you know what , the other thing i told you and you refused saying it 's impossible , today it is going to be possible and you are going to be my wife . @"
i said to myself @: ‘ i am going to scream . @" by the time i started to scream and everything , he took a pistol out of his pocket ; he was wearing a jean trouser . he said to me @: ‘ whatever i force you to do , you have to do it otherwise i am going to shoot you and go to jail . @"
from there i accepted whatever he asked me to do , i took off all my clothes and he raped me .
when he finished raping me , he went back to his room to sleep and i remained in my room . he locked my room and he opened it while he was going for a shower in the morning , after he went to work . i woke up in a desperate mood feeling like a fool . i was asking myself what if he is hiv positive and that he just contaminated me , what if ....... i do n't know .
i woke up right away and went to see a neighboring madam who was a friend of mine ; i told her the whole story . she said to me @: ‘ let 's go and report him . @" we went to remera police station because we lived nearby , closer to rwahama 's building .
we reported him and they sent him a letter asking him to come at the station . the madam asked me to not go back home , i stayed there the way i came . i came with nothing except the clothes i was wearing . when he came at the police station , he was directly sent to prison .
i went to stay at the madam 's house . four days later , i passed at the police station and i found out he was released .
when i realized that he was sent free , i asked why ? and they said to me @: ‘ he escaped . @" i went to the madam 's house ; she lived near the prison in a short distance .
but us , we lived closer to kie near rwahama 's building . i and this madam went to check if he might be at his house and we found he packed everything and shifted to another place .
when we reached there , they checked on me and found out i was pregnant .
i tried to calm myself and this mother helped me to calm myself .
we stayed together and she said to me @: ‘ i will help you as i can , just be strong now that he left you and we can not find where he went . @"
i wrote to his wife because i usually used to contact the children and their mother and i asked her about everything .
i told her everything his husband did to me and she told @: ‘ i am sorry , but you should have reported him at the police . @" i said to her @: ‘ i reported and later on he escaped . @"
i realized that the man did not go in the same country of his wife , but he went in different one . the wife was still in belgium .
later his wife wrote to me and said that he was in australia and he has contacted her .
i stayed in that life , i stayed with that mother and she helped me as she could till i gave birth .
finally i gave birth . after two months , she left the country because she had a husband who was a student in makerere university in uganda . so she went to see her husband .
i was left alone with the child and she said to me @: ‘ there is nothing i can do , i have to go and i can not take you with me because i do n't know where to take you . @"
she said to me again @: ‘ you can not handle the life out there , so try your best to live . @"
the only thing she left me was a mat to rest on .
i stayed there ; i started to struggle with my child .
i could stay in the house desperate ; i could spend the whole day and night without eating .
the next day , if i meet a good person and he or she gives me food . perhaps the following day i do n't find someone .
my child could get ill , if it happens i get a job i take care of my child .
later i suffered the kind of headache i suffered in 1996 , i started bleeding in the nose but it was somehow different from before , though i was bleeding so much .
i started to lose weight every single day ; day and night i was losing weight .
i said to myself what if i am hiv positive and my tests came negative . i do n't believe i am alright .
i went on with other tests in order to be aware of how i am doing physically , i found out i was alright .
i continued to lose weight ; i lost weight every single day . i did not stop calming myself though i was like that .
i had 85 kilograms before ; i lost almost 33 kilograms in that sorrowful life .
up to now , i live alone and i feel lonely .
whenever a day passes , i thank god the way i live with friends and good people who understand me and my life .
i wonder how i am going to return to school .
this is a problem i face up to this moment .
do you have a house ?
i do n't have a house , i rent ; i live in a rented house .
i stay in there and when i manage to get the rent which is five thousand rwandan francs i pay it .
sometime they even want to throw me out of the house but god helps me , or i meet a good person and he @/ she gives me two thousand rwandan francs so i pay it that way coz that is the only money with me .
i finally finish my day and night like that .
what would you ask for , the people who are able to help you .
i would ask the people who are able to help me to live , house renting and send me back to school .
what is the image , or thing that will cause you not to forget genocide in your entire life or your memories ?
the thing or image that will make me not forget genocide in my memories or my thoughts is the way my brother was killed , how he was killed .
this will cause me to always remember him .
that is the thing i always see in front of my eyes , in my daily thoughts .
he is the one i think about every day , or during commemoration time in april .
he is the first person i think about .
i can not pass two days without thinking about him , whether i am sleeping or walking on the road , i just find myself thinking about him .
his image is always in front of my eyes because of how awful he was killed , i was there seeing him .
today is 23rd of march 2007 .
we are at kacyiru together with father muzungu bernardini where we are going to have a conversation on history .
father bernardini muzungu can you start by introducing yourself .
like you already said , i am called bernardin muzungu and i am a dominican father i live here in kacyiru .
i was born back home on a hill called buhoro in nyaruguru , i was born in 1932 .
i got here amongst the dominican fathers through the lengthy journey of schooling starting from kibeho , in the elementary school in kabgayi , being part of the dominicans made me go to countries abroad , france , sweden , england , canada .
you have begun well , that is a very important question having the first point to what i am going to say , the history of the world and that of rwanda like i will talk about here , is got from things i read but in brief because often when we are asked you find someone just merely speak
i want to tell those who will be able to hear me that what i am talking about comes from three chapters of the history of rwanda .
i will start from the first chapter , and what happened before that .
the history of rwanda we know , in french it is math , archaeology and fossils that scholars found on earth that told them the history before man could write , i think that you all heard about it .
the first human on earth in the bible is called adam and also eva , they say that they were in africa , which is very close to here , our home , i will start from here .
these therefore are the things we find in those fossils .
and the other chapter in which we find history especially us rwandans is the one which our forefathers told us , i think we all know that we find stories and many other things , names of hills but usually the source of these stories or way through which we get these ideas of rwandans and their true history which is with evidence are three
the first are poems , i think you have all heard that poems exist and that they existed starting with queen nyirarumaga in the 16th century .
then there is the second one , royal secrets , royal secrets also are things which started long ago with gihanga .
the royal secret keeper of the ancient basinga clan who was called rubunga who was the one who brought royal secrets to the banyiginya clan and told them to gihanga , which resulted in that ritual of continuing to teach the royal secret keepers during the reign of the banyiginya clan .
what existed before kingdoms in this country ?
coming back to the scholars who base their research on fossil findings say our country , our region and africa is where they all claim without doubt that the first human being was discovered here .
this made them explore this place because of the fossils which revealed how the first human beings were .
there reached a time when explorers came to rwanda and burundi .
and you often hear that ancient human beings including the king used to hunt . there was also if you analyse the period when the forest reduced is when cattle came , like they say , when cattle graze .
the thick forest is destroyed and then demolished .
then the hoe followed , if you observe , i will come back to it , is when they begun to come up with names we are used to now like hutu , tutsi and twa you see that those they called the twa were hunters .
those who bred and herded cattle were called the tutsi , those who were cultivators were called the hutu but you realize they were one people .
we shall later come to see how the error of calling it tribes came to be .
those are the people we know of and what existed before the time of kings , in brief that is what one can say and i think that is enough so that we continue our journey of the questions you are going to ask me
let me quickly ask a question , you have told us that those who were hunters were called the batwa while others were called the hutu and others were called the tutsi .
what made them for example the people who bred became called the tutsi , what was considered so as to call the tribe that bred cattle the tutsi ?
as well as one who hunted to be a twa ?
there are things we know of which are also spoken of which may not be well known or came from the history which people do n't know well and say that those three groups of people you have told us about did not reach rwanda at the same time there are those who say that the tutsi came last and others who say that the hutu reached first .
is that right ? can you tell us something about that but starting with the question of naming , what was the reason behind it ?
i will come to that , we shall talk about it . there is a man called speak who brought that theory of tribes , if you are patient we shall get to it in a little while , but rather the question is how the cultivators or the breeders or the hunters came to be called tribes , if you can be patient , i will explain it to you .
i said that they were just natives , and it is archaeology because no one saw them .
it is archaeology giving an example as to why they say what they say like what we see here if we can maybe say like archaeologists who found blacksmiths .
here in this book , there are photos of hummers and small rocks , i think if it were visible one could see that there are small ropes here and pots .
when they say that the first human being was from africa , close to here , the assumption that they came from somewhere else is a misunderstanding , they did not come from anywhere , instead they came from here to other places and those who migrated were coming from here .
to say therefore that the hutu , tutsi and twa are tribes , i will explain it to you in a while and where it came from , now let us only say that where archaeologists found cow dung were cattle keepers , the hoe was also discovered .
they were found in the ground and they found them not to be present day hoes but those of long ago , so there was also cultivation , there were cows , they also found jaws of cows .
try to look closely when you are in the national museum of butare , there is a jaw of a cow of that time which was measured .
you see then that things to do with the problem of tribes , which i will answer later if you can be patient , are things which honestly came later , they came later and not at the time which people think , it is in the 7th century bc , a long time ago , they too did not know yet , saying that they lived in ethiopia , which ethiopia at that time did not yet have people who travelled .
in reference to those people you have told us who were cultivators while others were live stock keepers and others who were potters , what were their cultural similarities so as to know how the inhabitants of rwanda were related at that time .
i beg your pardon ?
during the reign of gihanga , the kingdom if rwanda had been established , what can you tell us about the way of life of the rwandan society ?
we shall add the second one later .
let us start with the way of life in rwanda then the leadership of the settlement .
the father has just finished telling us about the way of life in this region we are living in , the time before history .
poems truly are the first source , in the royal secrets , the royal secret keepers especially speak of how the leadership of the country is , i will come back to it in a little while of course , there were also riddles and family lineages of the kings and how they succeeded each other like the queens and the tribes of rwanda which were called also went succeeding each other on the throne
it started therefore like we said a while ago that here in rwanda , they found a long time ago , before jesus , hunters , livestock keepers and cultivators .
after some time they came together and became many , then they ruled so as to live together , if one is to explain it properly , one can start from how the society of rwanda started , i will also add on how it came to give birth to a kingdom .
that is ok .
a family as we know it is a man or a boy and a girl who come together and give birth to children .
while the rwandan family is still small , be it three people that is man , woman and children before they are married is called a home , that you know .
after the homes have become many to the level of grandparents , they are called households after the households had become many and populated , one would go and live over there on the hill .
you all know that the children , on the hill , would settle next to him as he went on taking over .
hills while he still had strength .
and get his own portion of land .
when the houses become many , they were then called clans , those clans would have an area in which they lived and also ruled , protecting their land and property , later it came to be called a kingdom , that is how kingdoms came about .
later on after the kingdoms had become numerous with clans , i think you know about kingdoms made up of clans we hear about them , we find them especially in this book by father kagame , it is the one i wanted to show you called inganji karinga , it is where he showed us where the banyiginya clan begun their reign with gihanga , it is in this book that we are told the kingdoms which were in our region , which was later called rwanda .
the kingdoms that existed around the time of gihanga , in the baziga clan which we now call bubari is in the nation park , also in ndowra was the reign of the bashambo , you realize that it is the kingdom of the bashambo it was over there in kibungo , gisaka , of the bagesera , here in nduga , there were the babanda and here where we are seated also were others and in many other places .
gihanga begun his rule by trying to bring together all those small kingdoms made up of clans , he started by working together with others but you realize they begun from a home to household to clans , a clan does not mean what we term it as that is to say hutu and tutsi , tribe meant what is called clans , those were tribes .
this has led me to show you another book which talks about it clearly .
that is how it was .
a family had a head , a parent those heads of every family , family in this case means household , in the clan they were ruled by their leader who headed the whole family and was called the king , the king is to say the popular one in ancient kinyarwanda , to be famous is like being popular .
later the king of the banyiginya who was called mukobanya , kigeli mukobanya the 1st .
he gained the wisdom of never again sharing with children , before they used to go together and they would be let 's say like the basinga or especially like in gisaka .
in gisaka is where it took long to be part of rwanda because it became part of rwanda during the reign of rwabugiri the 3rd .
mukobanya is the one who started conquering countries and colonizing them by putting his own rulers , he went bringing things together , that is what gave birth to rwanda .
before they were just small kingdoms , rwanda was only made up of the banyiginya but it was not a kingdom when it had just annexed others , rwanda existed but together with others relatives , and came together with others .
mukobanya is the one who worked together with others to get things for himself .
that is where the word to escape from rwanda originated from and he then established the rwanda of gasabo .
when you see the way i put together a society and kingdom ... it begun as a society , society came from home and as it grew to become a large kingdom , it became many small kingdoms , the banyiginya came and brought together those small kingdoms after winning them in battle and made them a united kingdom .
mukobana is the one who brought that ideology of one nation , he established a government of course , i can not go through the whole government except that there was a king who ruled together with those he shared with the leadership .
there were the commanders of the army guarded the whole country .
but concerning the country 's wealth , there were heads of wealth , that is to say those who looked after the resources , there were also cultivators who headed all cultivators who was known as the head of the land .
there were three branches of government , they did not put a government for hunters , often they all were hunters especially in the royals who hunted more than others , potters also moulded of course but that did not mean that they were leaders .
and those who were potters . that was the government .
i will talk about how it later came to be removed , later when white men came , they removed that government which was of three branches and made it one , they became chiefs , assistant chiefs and others but that is something else .
that is what i can say on how the government of that time was there was something similar to democracy because the king , after they had one government when the banyiginya clan had conquered , that is nganji karinga .
after the banyiginyahad conqured other kingdoms , of all those kings that existed , after inganji karinga had conqured others , they looked for a way of woking together with societies which were strong , there were societies called ibibanda , ibibanda are the ones who give birth to the royal family .
in the ancient royal family to be honest , the king came from the banyiginya clan but had queens who resembled , the queen with whom he shared the throne had a clan from which she came from .
from the bega clan there were 10 and after there came the bakono clan , then the baha clan , then the bagesere clan , then the first from the muzigaba clan was a true muzigaba , it was a way in which they included something similar to democracy of today . you see therefore , i can not say it in many words but the ancient rule had something similar to democracy , there was unity , there was especially in the general leadership of the army which one may call administration of today , it is like the government of today but there is a government concerning three resources of the country , livestock breeders and cultivators .
that is what came to give birth to the words that clans are not calms because nobody was only a cultivator , nobody was only a livestock breeder , no society was only made up of livestock breeders and another made up of cultivators only , that is a lie , we were related and one would become a cultivator and another a livestock breeder .
in a few words i think i can stop there and maybe you can ask me anything on that .
you have just finished telling us about the way of life in the rwandan society and you went on to tell us a bit about the governance . i want us to therefore go deeper into the way of governance of the country .
you told as that governance result from people coming together coming from families to the households which came together .
and they became clans .
and they became clans , you told us that the banyiginya clan was the clan from which rwanda came from but there were other clans in this region , and many other kingdoms here .
i want you to tell us how that kingdom of the banyiginya , that kingdom of the banyiginya , how it went in building rwanda .
did it go capturing other kingdoms , how did they capture them ?
those who were captured , how were they captured ? what would those that were captured give to be part of rwanda ?
but we will not make it long , it is in brief .
speaking in a few words , if i talk about how they went about with it , often they went to war , you know that long ago in rwanda , there was something called an army , they were called an army and they came times of war
all rwandans were part of the , army when they heard that rwanda had existed for long , the first weakness is that it all depended on the army .
the army had heads of government .
every rwandan belonged to a certain group of the army , therefore had many responsibilities but the most important was to fight for the country but there were many other things like dance , like doing all other duties , but they included fighting for the country .
be it to stand for it or save it when it has been attacked .
if you take a close look what the banyiginya were better at than others was the wisdom of knowing how to safe guard the country and how to fight .
they went therefore capturing small kingdoms while adding them to others and maybe they had better leadership like sharing and interacting , so how did they rule so as to govern them ?
first of all is that they would go and remove them from leadership but share with them .
the next question is on the history during the colonial time but before we go to the colonial time , there is a question i wanted to ask which i feel lays ground for the next question of the colonialists .
history tells us that rwanda probably begun
from rwagasabo which was one hill . the hill of gasabo , is there something you can tell us about it .
the white man found extending to rwicanzizu , rwanda had grown big and extended to masisi , it was very large .
i therefore want that maybe we first answer the question of rwanda 's history , there reached a time of colonialists in 1897 .
can you tell us how rwanda was changing and developing , as new people came , how far had rwanda reached ?
i think it is better for us to have a few questions because we have a long way to go .
let us talk about things like the conquests of rwanda , is to say that i had to start because they begun around ... how they were and things would be going too far ?
let this be an opportunity for mr to tell you about this book i have so far told you about three books about clans , this book ‘ l' histoire du rwanda precolonial ’ , i wrote it a few years ago in 2003 , that is where i compared many things which are not even in this one of kagame .
if you take time and look at what went on , there is a way the banyiginya clan had their way of life and their knowledge in what they called royal secrets , what you can call the constitution today , look at ‘ constitutionnel ’ , is a book i am writing now which is about to come out . if you read that book you find the laws they went by so as to safe guard , stand for and save the kingdom , to save in terms of capturing other kingdoms , in terms of supporting it and also culturally .
all that is in what they called the path , there were 18 paths , royal secrets are in those 18 i am telling you , there are 10 to do with wealth . let 's say for example rain , when the rain became too much , there was a path of kivu , the path of kivu was a way the king had to do rituals so as stop the rain , there was also the path of rukungungu when there was death as a result of too much sun shine , they would find a way in which the king would have a ritual to bring down rain , they had a way of praying to god and the rain would stop every time there was a problem .
the king had a way of solving it .
most of it concerns the wealth of rwanda , there was also the path of war , a path of muryamo , and also there was in those royal secrets let us say laws , laws they followed so as to fight against attacks on the country or to find a way of benefiting rwanda in every way , that included the way how the kings succeeded each other , that is what i told you , it is too lengthy for one to tell it all unless one gets a book and reads it .
let us talk about kings , kings had a way in which their names reflected their responsibilities .
there were two kings , one was called kigeli and the other mibambwe , there duty mainly was to conquer for rwanda .
that was kigeli 's duty , whenever he was on the throne , he had to conquer for rwanda and his son too who was succeeded by the one called yuhi , yuhi was one who brought peace and security and he was also involved in thing to do with activities and all others which involved resting and others .
there were others for milk , the ones called kirima and mutara brought plenty to the kingdom , that is why mutara is place of cows , that is where that name came from .
that leads us to things concerning how the kingdom had to move forward .
you were asking how kings let 's say amongst those kings who went far in what you were saying to benefited rwanda .
first there were those called ruganzu , they were to be fighters of ruganzu , the first was ruganzu mpimba and ruganzu ndoli .
that name was removed from the history because those who were named after it ... it made them lose their lives .
one was mutabazi ruganzu mpimba and another was killed , ruganzu ndoli and they were removed because it was cursed .
anda in kinyarwanda means a world without boundaries .
kigali means large , without boundaries , it is one kigali , that is what they name it .
you have known that the first capital here was kigali , rwoya which was found in at the ends of kigali above in the ground in the woods above there .
gasabo of course is a churn of rwanda , of milk , it 's like saying it charns rwanda , it 's what churns milk for rwanda .
over there in muhazi you see that it is its tributaries .
thank you , continuing with our conversation with father muzungu , we have finished talking about .
i can not say that we have finished because were are following our program , we seemed to be talking about rwanda in the time of colonialists .
can you tell us about rwanda in colonization in the time white men reached rwanda .
that 's a good question , it 's in line with what we were saying , in the same way i will divide it into two parts , that concerning how locals of rwanda were colonised and how the colonialists took over power in rwanda , i think that 's better .
let me start with the locals of rwanda , how were they colonized ?
that 's where our problems started because the white man came with foreign ideology
there was a british man called captain john honing speak who came to our africa around this area in ethiopia and even reached uganda , then saw people of the hima tribe , babito tribe and then reached here and saw the rwandans especially the tutsi who of course looked like the hima who were cattle keepers .
after seeing this he thought that the tutsi were not rwandans but from up there in ethiopia , from the bagara , that they looked like the bagara who were the cattle keepers and drunk milk
milk has an effect on one who takes it .
he brought about the mentality that rwandase were not the same , that some that is the tusti came from up there and that the hutu are like the other africans from around , he brought about that mentality they are not from around this area , he gave us that mentality , we all thought were from around here without discriminating that this is an african or a kenyan or tanzanian or abisinya
he brought that .
other priests and white men with whom he was believed him and when he went back to his home he wrote a book talking about that trip he took to africa and in the 9th chapter of that book talked about rwanda in other words his discoveries here in africa called aux sources du nil in french , a book was written in france called aux sources du nil
here i have a book by a white man called alexander arnold , a white priest , he wrote this book called les peres blancs aux sources du nil ; he is one of the people who took on speak 's ideology and he made it a rule , speak said that it was just a thought but those that copied it believed that the tutsi were not real africans and that they came from up there
there is another book by albert pages entitled ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique ’ , that is where they all support ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique .
’ that is where i said that the himites of here or the reign of the banyiginya or rwanda of the tutsi but i honestly do not think it 's the tutsi but rwandans .
it was followed by everyone else .
when colonialists came , there came another problem , colonialist of two different kinds @: there came those whom i call of the trouser , that is to say civilians but there were also of the dress that is the priests .
they came in collaboration with the priests and wanted them to help the rule africa properly , tell us about these people and the african we can use .
and others said "@ is that what is difficult ?
we shall help you
there are people , the tustsi who have acknowleged that they are a tribe that was made up by someone , join hands with the tutsi , they know how to govern so asks them your helpers . @"
that 's when there came a change in the leadership in 1926 and 1927 of a resident called mortohani , he removed the deputy chiefs of before who were the germans , that time that man dismissed 30 twa deputy chiefs , that time leaders were not supposed to be hutu or twa , so in that reform the twa chiefs were dismissed and their list can be found at shyorongi
and dismissed all hutu and even tutsi who were short , and only the tall tutsi were left saying that they were the only ones who knew how to govern .
and can help the white man to govern and they will be rewarded with wealth a live comfortably .
they were helped in this by the priests because the priests were put in place to educate the africans , to treat them and they were the ones who initiated any form of development like building houses , they were the ones while building their quarters who brought bricks and they were the ones who started road construction .
the priests were able to help because they were the ones who brought christianity and started teaching families about it .
in their teachings they started up leadership schools , until it got to a time when the colonialists would take over leadership since they were always on the side lines
how do you think they made the locals leaders and how did the rwandans react to this ?
that 's what i want to tell .
first of all they removed the rwandan form of governance , where by the king was the over all ruler of the country , they removed the king and replaced by leopold who was a white man , and they would continuously refer to him as the king ignoring our king .
the leaders became servants so that they could show that it is that and those who were doubting stop doubting .
the king who was there was musinga and when he did not agree with them they chased him away and he died in congo where they sent him after they realised that kmememba where they had sent him at first was n't far enough and he died at moba
they replaced him with his son rudahigwa , who had to agree that he was to be governed by the white man and was thus baptised .
the priest classy had a role to play in chasing away musinga and putting in place rudahigwa , he had a big role to play even in consoling the tutsi at that time who were only top officials .
that is when they came up with identification papers .
those who inter married , the children they gave birth to are supposed to be having a name like half cast , in fact in recent times during the first republics , they said that it was a problem and they said that there were the husi tribe and things like that but we have lived for all these years with only hutu , tutsi and twa and those who intermarried knew that they were intermarrying but it meant nothing because they thought it did not mean blood line tribes , that is truly evident , no one ever took on their mother 's tribe yet she too gives them blood .
you see , to put in place the malice tribes was for what ?
what the colonialists brought is that malice to change rwandans who were from the same womb .
and they said that they were tribes that had no relation and then it came to exist on the royal throne , and they became enemies because they are the ones who brought not sharing of power .
before they used to share but they gave it to some , it was written and we shall talk about it in a while that those they gave power came to reject it because they used to say that did not share with others .
the way the ancient leadership was , they used to share things , there was something which people do not like called ubuhake .
ubuhake is something people despised later on , work was introduced by the white man ; the whip and the prison too .
ubuhake existed , it was not a bad thing , it was similar to how one goes to ask for a job today .
when you go to ask for a job in the government , is that serving ?
if you are lucky you get to be a servant , no one ever got beaten for it and neither did anyone ever say that come and serve me , a servant would do it if they wanted to .
long ago in ancient kinyarwanda , ubuhake was like a ladder one would climb so as to reach those who were superior to him .
what would your superior help you with ? the money of that time was cows , what did he have that you did not ?
he could support you and fight for you .
long ago , there was not yet any kind of leadership that could speak for all people , your boss or superior would save you and could even fight for you when treated unfairly .
ubuhake therefore was a good thing at that time , the money of that time was cows and everyone including the king used to serve , even karinga , that is what they said , the rich were the ones who were befriended because they had what was worth serving for , if you do not own anything , you can not be served
another thing is every rich person was supposed to have a stepping stone even rudahigwa used in rwabutogo , everyone had someone to befriend .
as we say a servant of god you 're a servant to one who is higher than you , everyone has a person who he is higher than , just like when one fails to get a job , a jobless person is like .
honestly , ubuhake , dictatorship and whipping are not the same thing , you can ask about it if you wish but those are things the white man brought .
and favouritism is one of the reasons as to why there are those who killed others , also it is to say that there are tribes that have nothing in common .
the first and most important thing is obviously to make us their slaves , they came and took our power and made us dogs .
they sent away the king and those who remained would be whipped while they were naked , they would make them lie down and whip them with no clothes on , annoying humiliation .
they use to respect women but they would also tell them to kneel down and slap them , is that human ?
that is what one can speak about the colonialists
i will talk about how they came and what resulted from it , the riots of 1959 i even have a book that talks about it here .
in a few words and maybe you can ask some questions but this is how i can say it .
i would like to ask you a question , there are many people who follow laws that are not comprehensive or that do not exist or they confuse themselves about certain things because they do not understand .
the king musinga was exiled in kamemba because he did not agree with the white man and after that as you told us they sent him into exile in moba in congo .
it 's clear that there were some things that they did not agree on .
and go to church , he could not understand that because it was not his faith and indeed that religion of god had no fault and they removed it and up to now it makes no sense .
even i as a preist i 'm one of the people who fought this .
they came and said that our faith was based on idolatry and wrote about this in a book called "@ god is our father @" fighting this .
they came and changed the name of god and said that it was "@ mungu @"@ . we fought against this and won , "@ mungu @" was removed and reinstated "@ imana @" and showed that we black people had a religion ; they used to say that we did no religion until we affirmed this to the pope and the acknowlged that africanas had a religion .
after writting the book , "@ god is our father @" where at taught at the university in kinshasa , i asked the students and found out that all the blacks in africa especially in the sahara belive that there is something that created heaven and earth and they give several names but we called it god and we have this in common ; we did not worship idols .
that distressed musinga because they insulted him and told him that he worshiped idols but a wise man like musinga could not accept this , i wanted to say that they kept the truth from him because he could not accept this and even his son merely took it because he believed that if he did not accept it he would end up like his father
on merely accepting this , the first thing he did was to be baptised , and accepted that rwanda should worship jesus , i 'm not saying that i 'm against it but that was musinga 's biggest crime , his removal from power and forcing the white mans religion that he did n't understand on him and calling him a fool , he was n't a fool he had his own god and honestly it was a true god and jesus did not come , instead came saying that i have not come to remove but instead i have come to affirm it .
i wrote a book later , "@ i did not come to abolish but to affirm @" i did not come to remove what god had put in the hearts of your fore fathers and what they knew but i have come to fulfill it .
you see musinga was a victim of the truth , and that he was wise amd he was a man of honest character , colonialists came saying that we were stupid and had no brains , that we were animals and that was hard for him to accept and that was his crime .
that 's what i think , other things maight have been because they wanted one who was easy going , baptized and willing to learn the white man 's things but he was old and they found that they could not get along with him .
if you take a look at africa , rwanda and burundi were not the only countries that were colonised , other countries too were colonised .
but you find that it was especially rwanda and burundi that had problems because even though the white man came , rwandans had away of ruling eachother , they had away of life and i ask myself , what made it possible for the white man to divide or to come up with with tribes amongst rwandans so as to divide them into pieces or like you said use the tutsi to rule for them .
so why did they choose thetutsi because yuo realise that the most of the problems we have today are from the colonial time because the white man made up somethings to help them with their plans but why did it happen in our countries ?
the example i can give on only rwanda and burundi is that we were the only ones who had good leadership and they saw that they could not just penetrate us like in other countries .
i would have answered that later because we shall come to things of 1939 .
our misunderstandings are those things that came to be but i will come back to that problem in a while .
honestly , if you take a close look at where they came up with tribes like you have said clearly , they came up with these tribes elsewhere but the problem became more complicated in the time they wanted independence .
that is why i was proposing to talk about it later because they came up with tribes here but they came up with other things elsewhere .
if you look closely you realise that along the way the catholic church or should i say the priest did not behave propery because they evidently showed crookedness , what was meant to be teaching people the word of god became politics and things did not go well .
i do not know what you can tell us in regards to the priest and church .
so as to simplify things , let us talk about it all , let 's talk about thing in 1959 because it is like talking about all these things because we shall mix things up and you will find that it is tiring . that is where we come to the priests and colonialists and ourmiunderstandings with them , it is speak 's ideologies and what i said before about befriending but that is something they needed to use .
they knew that they were telling lies but they honestly did not want to leave this place , they did not want to grant us independance , those are the things that became difficult as they tried not to grant independence .
i think if one is to talk about that , there are many thinga that are part of it .
the little you have told us on the colonial period , there is a question we want you to answer on the catholic church .
we shall talk about the riots of 1959 and the protests .
there are those who call it riots , others call it a social revolution while others call it something else .
tell us about it and those who had an active role in it . who did it ? , what was their goal ?
who were they ?
yes , this is the of end result of all the questions .
the problem became evident the day that africa got tired of being a slave , the time it wanted independence and stop being slaves .
many people now know the history of africa and even read about it , that is an easy thing to talk about today .
in the berlin conference , that is where the white man claimed africa as their land to do with it what ever they wanted , they especially needed raw materials for their factories so as to make machines and every thing else that they would use .
they found that africa had most of the things they could use and they decided on how they will share the world and africa was part of it .
so the colonialists came here with priests and all the archaeologists and wrote the lengthy history of the colonialist which you all know .
there reached a time when africa seemed to be courageous and decided that enough was enough .
there was the ordinary colonisation like ours , where they were not harsh but there are those they would take abroad like to america , asia , what they call slavery .
we were lucky to have a man called rwabugiri who they named makare bwana mukare who resisted and fought , but later they came .
.
in the period around 1960 , i think the first country to gain its independence was ghana .
the white man tried to find away of not granting independance , those who wanted independence started coming together and forming political parties , they were called nationalists .
most of us know that they included nkrumah , jommo kenyatta , there was the king of ethiopia haile sellassie .
close here we had rudahigwa , lumumba , rwagasore , you know all the names .
into two parts because when you do this with tribes , for example if there are ten religions , there is no way you can divide them into two .
they always looked for away of having two factions because no one can fight if they are many factions .
they looked for something to divide the country men into two , they call it dual .
here they found that it was easier to use tribes even though they are three .
they put one aside say that it meant nothing so they left the twa alone , they considered the hutu and tutsi and gave one side arms and told them to fight eachother .
there are places where they used religion like in sudan .
the white man always wanted something that divided the country men into two opposing sides of which they would chose one side to help them .
that is the reason as to why they came up with tribes because it was easier .
the hutu were the majority because the poor are always the majority , if you look closesly , the hutu , tutsi and twa were cartegories of wealth , and the very poor were the twa , and those who were average were mostly leaders and they were called the hutu , those who were very rich but few were the tutsi .
that is what they did but if there had been an easier way of dividing them into two , they would have use it .
if they had found that regions were easier , that is what they would have done .
like in sudan that is how they divided blacks and arabs .
it is not that they prefered the hhhutu , it 's because it was easier to divide the tutsi and hutu .
it is evident that they came looking for those who could help then rule .
they are the ones who broght the division between those who know how to rule and those who do not .
the hutu were cartegorised as dogs that did not know how to rule who were fools and had no brains , ugly and like pigs , they just ate what ever they were given . the tutsi were the good looking ones who had brains and knew how to rule .
then those they had given power , including rudahigwa who had collaborated , was a christian and not been like his father , who was the first to arise among those who wanted independence .
when he went abroad and saw what was there , the gained courage and decided that he would go to the u.n.o and ask that his country be given independance , when he gained the wisdom of seeking independance , they felt like , "@ you dog , we made you important and now this ? @"@
, "@ wait and see !
. @"
they came and said that the children of the hutu , were treated unjustly , first of all they are the knowledgable ones , they are well behaved , this country belong to them , they are the majority and that those dogs are not even true rwandans .
they needed that theory of speak which said that they were tall , light skinned .
the white men said that that is what they saw .
they said that the county belonged to the hutu and they said nothing about the twa .
since they wanted independence , the white man said that the hutu should expel the colonialists starting with the first ones who were the tutsi , and they said that the river nyabarongo was a short cut to sending the tutsi back to where they came from , and that they would go after them .
that gave birth to a very bad problem which got worse .
there is a book called ‘ mission au rwanda , ’ which was written by a white man called colonel guy logest who was flemish , i know him , he was here in kigali .
he came from congo in 1959 for the first time , he was made the resident special .
he removed all the leadership that was there and was colonial .
he came with orders to remove those dogs who were the tutsi and were not even rwandans from power and put the hutu .
he therefore came and removed the tutsi without any reason and put the hutu nad he begun to burn
this white man burnt my home in buhoro , white men without any black are the ones who came to burn my home with shooting , what they say as 1959 ...
we saw that if the tutsi had had bad leadership , they would have removed them .
instead they removed the king and put their oun king , rudahigwa without following the rwandan way of leadership .
he was not a king who ruled , he was a worker like others headed by the administration , the name they gave him was ‘ mwami ’ , and there was ‘ umwami ’ and ‘ mwami ’ .
in fact as we were praying in the church we would say that let us pray for our king leopord .
we did not say that let us pray for our king rudahigwa , we use to say that let 's pray for our king leopord the 2nd .
when it reached the time that the leaders wanted independence , they gave it to those who were not asking for it , parmehutu , they forged elections for political parties and voted and built the republic of kayibanda .
the first government which they put place was made up of hutu , tutsi and white men and parmehutu .
what followed in that period were governments which had the mentality that the country belonged to the hutu who were called parmehutu and their followers .
it resulted in the tutsi being considered as bad and colonialists who should be killed .
those who were able to flee fled , you know that that is when refugees , burning and killing came into existence , saying that the tutsi were foreigners .
it followed in schools and places of work and it resulted in the tutsi feeling as thoughthey were not at home .
one can say that this did not get them anywhere , one can go through all these early governments of the republic if you wish that we continue .
in the history of 1959 that you have told us , there is a man who is often talked about who maight have played a role called peraudin .
peraudin was my bishop when i was a priest , he is the one who ordeined me . father peraudin was my superior in nyakibanda , what i mean is that i know him .
let me not only talk about pedoli but the catholic church .
the role of the catholic church in all these things especially to with divisionism that happened amongst the rwandans which they called tribes .
i think that is better because it would be an exageration if i only spoke of pelodi because he was not the only one involved .
i told you a little while ago that the idea of there being three different tribes was written in books by the first priests .
i showed them to you , one is by pages , another is by arnold .
the other is ... , the other i said is by father classe .
the major role he played is saying that the tutsi were good at leadership and the fact that he was close to king rudahigwa .
he is the one who caused the king to leave queen kankazi .
rudahigwa remained in nyanza but in order for the queen not to stay involved in leadership of her husband , they built for her a palece in shyongwe close to father classe for him to guard her from infecting her son with old ideologies .
they used to say that father classe was a friend of the tutsi while it seemed like peraudin was a father to the hutu
they based this in the letter he wrote during the fast saying that ... , love and many other things but when one is talking about the role of someone , he must speak things which are clear and honest .
what i can honestly say is that pelodi was considered to be on that side because he opposed father classe .
they say that there was a priest for the tutsi and a priest for the hutu but they did what they felt like , that is what i always say .
i heard them say that in the time of father peraudin , he was told by the colonialists that the rwandans were going to gain independence and the tutsi had been removed , like you see it 's over so chose to help tutsis , rather help the hutu and leave out the tutsi .
he was told to help the hutu and not to give the leadersip of rwanda to the tutsi so as to make it suitable for you .
some say that he chose what was on mode like the rwandans say ... that is what he did , i can not judge him because i 'm not god .
however what i see that is true without deffending only peraudin , it 's the fact that it happened when they are many priests who were working together with colonialists thinking that if they grant them independence they will expel the colonialists as well as the missionaries , you see that had that ideology in that it was even said at that time and it is written .
kayibanda , besides being a christian , he was a brother , he was close to being a priest .
so you can also include him amongst those members who wronged the church .
habyarimana was also a seminerian and he also had sisters who were nuns .
his father was a catechist , he was from uganda in bufumbira and he come with priests from rwaza , they even came to inaugurate the diocese of rambura and then he joined the seminary .
so if we said that the church wronged , jesus would be inclusive .
i just wanted to say that some members of the church are bad , indeed they did some things that brought divisions and they even got to a point of planning the genocide .
so in the group of ... even priests are included .
let 's say if i give you an example maybe you can n't differentiate it from the genocide , this had started way before the genocide .
you know that there are priests who were found guilty .
i wanted to mention a few name because i can n't mention those who were not found guilty because it would be wrong .
you see i did n't want to sound sure about peraudin , and i even know other priests , i know them myself but i 'm not in position to mention any before evidence is revealed like before arusha confirms that he destroyed his church when he was the priest in charge ... you heard of nuns who are jailed in belgium , there are priests who are in jail , i can n't accuse him but there those i know myself who even wanted to have me killed .
but i can not mention him because he is not yet found guilty , you may say i 'm telling lies .
let 's say like in churches , the role of the catholic church i 'm telling you that is obvious and makes me sad and i even say it .
tell me , even if someone said it and repeated it , i mentioned it earlier and explained it on the radio .
let 's talk about what happened in rwanda like during the time when the laws of parmehutu that talked about what agreed on .
let 's talk about the time the radio gave confirmation that there is an enemy with a name .
let 's say like there is a bishop focas , you heard of him nikwize he said that a tutsi is naturally bad and he knows that character is created by god and no one disagreed amongst those bishops disagreed with him so that he says , one with whom we share god we do n't share a word , it 's exaggerating .
i was a refugee for 27 years , bishops used to write in books saying that there is no more room in rwanda , that those who left should look for room outside the country .
you know that every has has right in his or her country , in fact if the country has nowhere to settle its people , it looks for a solution .
you would hear radio stations like rtlm saying such things like while people are listening .
priests would lead mass and though they had heard these things , none of them would speak against it in what they taught by saying that those things are not possible , let us rise up and tell the government that what it is doing is not right , because were believe in god , we reject those things or maybe write a book against what kangura had written or even write to the president and say that radio station is causing division , you should silence it .
these things did not happen , like me saying that it is a bad thing or the church .
but you see that i have not said the catholic church only , i 'm saying the church as a whole , those who speak for the church should have , at a certain point said no.
when you take a close look , they were small writings but nothing solid reflecting that the catholic church or christians that a particular mission or that priests or christians had a meeting or a walk to show that priest , christians or other people manifested it , no one went and stood up against what they had previously heard on the radio .
what i am saying is that the catholic church and their leadership were not brave .
jesus would whip those who made the house of god unholy , in fact they killed people from churches and we simply kept quiet and run away .
i am not saying that there are no people in the church that were holy , they are there including amongst the bishops , there are those who rejected it and it 's there in what i write .
there are those who clearly said it like bishop bigirumwami and many others but in general that is what i despise .
there are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where i always say we failed including myself because i am a catholic and a bishop .
we failed , we could have been like saint peter and cried that we have failed in our place .
i once spoke on the radio when we were being asked , i said that if someone ... meaning the catholic church ... they killed people while we were watching and what did we do ?
if you fail to fight it until maybe it even kills you , the one who left you with his cow , whenever he sees you and you run away , will never leave with others again .
at least he says you are useless , let 's not say anything more .
this is where i can say the role of the catholic church was and it was something which was openly rebuked .
they used to go killing people here and there and there is a way they referred to them , i will talk about it in a few minutes , what did they mean by the cockroaches are coming ?
they started killing people here and there and you could see that they are training to see it if can be possible , if there is someone who could do it without fear , if it would have no consequences or if it can actually happen .
how i can say in few words then , at first both republicans followed the plan of colonialists and fulfilled it and went on towards genocide .
it means to separate rwandans , a tutsi is not rwandan and that he has to die .
and then they came up with a way of talking about him , the way he is , that he is bad , in all the ways they painted him to be a bad person and they taught it to others and it went into all kind of teachings that we know but they come to make it understandable that he does n't deserve to live .
basically i can say that that 's where it reached in few words .
i have a question on the republics , when you look at the first republic and the one of kayibanda .
kayibanda was given power by the belgian colonialists . kyibanda was there for some time then habyarimana toppled him .
then the only thing i want here as someone who was there but when i look at this and the life in the genocide of 1994 , there is a way kayibanda was given the power but he would rule with them but when habyarimana come to power , when he toppled it .
he had lived with french people .
there are two things ; belgians look like the people who created that thing of hatred among rwandese , conflicts started and people started fighting each other .
then after the republic of kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in rwanda and then habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the french who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 .
in a way , up to today you see how the french were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all .
is there anything you can say about that ?
that 's really a good question because i used to think about it a lot .
it 's true after the belgians were defeated during colonialism ; it was taken away from them , the white leaders left .
the french wanted to take over . basically they did n't want to give it all up .
even if the french have many tricks , all the countries they colonised they gave them up without truly giving them up .
they put something which seemed like their hand that was always there .
they looked for something the belgians seemed to have failed at , that is how i view it .
but the french people worked together with habyarimana and even others .
truly french people , the way it is , are wise who are generous .
when belgians granted independence it looked like they have given it out and nothing behind it but there would be something that would keep them around , they used the black leaders or the ones from asia because there are leaders but they were still there too .
here and in burundi and in congo as well .
because belgium is a small country when they granted it they meant it but the french were thought that you can n't just let them go just like that yet congo has riches .
they came and replaced them , the french wanted a way of replacing belgians because of the french language so as to add them on other french countries .
so let 's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by french long ago .
it 's like they replaced belgians so that they do n't just let us go .
it 's as if they replaced them yet they had n't agreed on it . they did n't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that .
actually whenever we disagree with the french , belgians do n't mind it , it makes them come back saying they got they took their place .
i guess that 's how i understand , it i did n't really think much about it .
belgians left but the french refused since they did not go anywhere at all , instead they said this time since belgians are leaving . let 's put that little thing back in our pockets .
basically the francophone 's .
they told habyarimana that first all you are still young , it 's french language now .
they got close to him and convienced himto come .
they told him not to worry that they were bringing wisdom and they were going to fight against the tutsi , they are the ones who do n't want to grant independence and there is nothing else , it was easy .
habyarimana as well had nothing against them because he used to say that you are nice people , we speak french .
i think it 's because french people replaced belgians and made us francophones . habyarimana was pleased with them and they would give him all he needed , that 's how i understand it .
there is something else that people say so often about kayibanda . the fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not rwandese and killing rwandans meant nothing to him .
then he used it to bring conflicts among the hutu and tutsi with the help of the white man .
kayibanda was really not rwandan .
he was neither tutsi nor hutu because he was not rwandan .
to start conficts among themselves , with help of white people , i think it was fine with him .
it was fine with him but , he was n't going to say it because it would not be easy to say he was a foreigner and he is bringing conflicts .
maybe he is the one who would be the one to say that you are not rwandan too however , he was supposed to hide that i think .
maybe he did n't mind it but i do n't think the fact that he was from bukavu was enough for him .
that 's what i 'm saying .
i am saying that he felt like first of all he was not hutu neither was he tutsi .
to create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him .
no , it 's not him . if you want you can say it but i think it 's not the important thing really , it 's not important .
i guess tutsi , let me tell you the good reason especially why he disliked the tutsi .
his dad came and served birasa , maybe he was mistreated , it 's possible that he has something against the tutsi who disrespected him , maybe the tutsi who his chief or his master , i do n't know .
another thing , there is something that made kayibanda hate the tutsi , only that you do n't know but he suffered from something , i know he had bad background in the school , he suffered from ............... , you can imagine ...... the hatred of tutsis had it 's origin .
he was sick of ........ , then that sickness of ..... in school but that one i 'm not sure if it was supposed to be mentioned here .
he used to fall sick of ..... but then really it 's not something good .
what i know is that in school , the priest , the bishops , i am a priest so i know peraudin it 's like i was his boss some time back .
he really did n't like being disrespected .
so to say that the tutsi used to be disrespectful is something that was common in the time of colonialism , they spread it all over that the tutsi were disrespectful , so he did n't like it .
that 's why he created conflicts among them , saying he is not part of them and they are actually not even his brothers , so let them all die .
any way , if you want you can even say that with habyarimana , those issues are mentioned . he is also a foreigner if you do n't know , he is a mufumbira .
did you know the meaning of the word mufumbira , do you know that the kitchen helpers who are cooks are called the bafumbira .
it started with his father , he came from the bufumbira land and came as a cook of the priests , it went on and that 's how they called them bafumbira .
they are helpers called bafumbiras from bufumbira .
if you want you can also say that brought conflicts among rwandans because he 's not rwandan but that would be exaggerating .
he actually brought conflicts so he can have the power , no one can say that he did because he did n't go against the killings among rwandans .
i too can n't tell if that 's the true reason .
i can n't confirm that .
i think you can go on telling us about the attacks of the refugees . the ones who died because of being called their agents , how did it go ?
i think even that would be part of it , truly , the genocide of 1994 itself ...
some of the causes of the genocide , leaving out the white man because it 's something that someone can add , it seems like the trigger were the attacks of the refugees , the attacks of the refugees started with the nyenzi who i think came as a number of times especially in 1963 , that came up to kanzenze terrorising and then the people from here started ..... every tutsi , that 's a long story and i think repeating it would be hard , i think other refugees that attacked ....... who were strong were inkotanyi , i will talk about it hurriedly because we shall talk about it again .
the time inkotanyi was scary especially for the people from around here . they fought at the border , they were pushed back the first time in 1990 , and then there came agents . every tutsi was called an agent and some would be put together over there in nyamirambo , you can see that all this contributed to the eruption of the genocide . i can remember a priest who once found me in kinshasa , i do n't remember the year but it was before genocide and after 1990 , he told me that , tell your relative , s as if they are under my control , not to attack because if they do , no single tutsi will be found in rwanda , so i said that those who are out of the country should stop trying to come back home so that the ones who decided to stay in the country will not get killed .
fighting tribalism seemed to the be the cause of the war or the inkotanyi ..... and other political parties and mrnd with its descendant cdr got scared when they found out there was no other way but to get rid of all those who disagree with them , i think this should be mentioned as well ...... of arusha that time inkotanyi realized it could not work out , they did n't have mercy and they kept on killing here and there ; they kept on moving forward untill they were close to here , that 's how we know it . afterwards the white men said that , those inkotanyi are unstoppable and you can no longer chase them away , they have reached at the entrance of kigali so you should agree with each other .
i think that that is when habyarimana and his followers and the other political parties that had the same ideology of sharing the power went to the peace talk of arusha , as whole planning of genocide went on slowly by slowly up to the time it was triggered , it reached a point where habyarimana accepted but you could see that he did n't really accept , they said it and he said it in writings , others said that they were going to plan a genocide and then you could see them sign papers without meaning it .
they signed without signing ; basically you find that arusha is the one that pushed the trigger ..... so the plane of habyarimana which was blown up i really do n't know who did it wish he could be known but i wanted that instead of the refugees that wanted to go back in the country and it could n't happen and they applied force then they looked for a way force should not be used and they started peace talk which also reached a point and they rejected it saying that they can n't share with refugees , we can n't share with inkotanyi so let 's look for a way of defeating them .... with those who help them and their agents . but its starting point then is cause even the others who help them are these political parties .
.... but the trigger of it all is the pretext of the plane of habyarimana , i do n't know who did it but whoever it is must have been the one who wanted to bust the first bullet of the genocide ...
i think that there if there is any other problem , i think even if someone can be can be cutting short the reason for the beginning of genocide i think , maybe you come to talk about those who wanted it and those who did n't want it . so you can understand who wanted it .
who are those who wanted it ? they are sdr members , in real sense they are the ones who wanted all that in all times the ones who were behind him , who actually helped him were colonialists .
they are maybe few from before who helped him but mostly the last ones as in those french people we mentioned before who had read it from the time of kayibanda so that they can go on with their colonialism . this also they are the ones who helped them , they wanted to it is obvious . the ones who did n't want to came to an understanding as well , they some who died for that . they are generally all tutsis and also someone can include those who were against it in that time of looking for leadership in the leaders of political parties ......... if you look at the first night , they started with people like agath who are the ones that died first .
so i wanted to ...
i can maybe ask you a small thing that you can tell us about or maybe as someone who did analysis on that and tried to see the difference between the genocide and others that happened before because when you look clearly you find that the killings that took place in 1962 and 1959 are very different from what happened in 1994 because people would just flee to some government institution , to places where you find churches . people would say that let 's run to the leadership , nothing will happen to us and that 's what really happened , people ran to where they could find the leadership and to churches , some of them survived .
they would say that he is an ethiopian and the short cut is through the river nyabarongo , and no one made a sound . condemning things , what was left was to check if it 's really possible .
..... they tried fighting back to see if really would n't work out the first time they started . when kayibanda had just started they got them out and made them shift .... he started by trying to make an area for the tutsi only .... and hutu , he did n't know that it would be possible to kill them and it 's true it would n't be possible if logist had n't come and white man had n't stood up because they knew that it was possible . they went on planning it slowly by slowly and even the people who thought it was horrible started doing it , actually that 's what happens ; what someone was terrified of goes on finding it normal and one could think that maybe when you do it you will be struck by thunder and when you do it nothing happens .
little by little they killed people and got stronger in 1973 , that 's when people gave it all up to god and evidently fled like the seminary of nyundo that was all chased and had to flee , it was the first time , and was forbidden , the nuns fled , they were chased and for the first time they butchered people . they dared to butcher people in their homes . there are priests who were killed in kabwayi . kayibanda and bishop peraudain were in the junior seminary , you understand that these are things that were coming little by little and people were getting used to it , whatever someone was terrified of finds that it is no longer terrifying . slowly it reached a point where by even after doing something horrible , one says that is what they always say .....
like the ending to the other bad saying ; the more they shed blood , the more you get used to it and become fearless , when one gets so used to killing , it reaches a point where he is used to blood and he becomes like an animal , it 's high time .....
... just wanted to ask you a question as we come to the end , genocide has just happened and come to an end it 's understandable that the rwandan community was divided into parts , the ones who killed and the ones who survived . there was a serious problem for the people who were normally living together and then today there is gacaca of unity and reconciliation . gacaca can give something that can maybe make people reconcile because in that case there would be telling the truth but me the question i have here , i can say that long ago , people like you who lived in earlier years than ours of today ... rwandese who practiced it , now i wanted you to try and compare the gacaca of that time and that of today , do you really think that gacaca is the solution for rwandese to such a problem and can they live together like a rwandan community as a whole again ?
traditional courts ( gacaca ) of long ago and the ones of today can n't be the same because genocide ideology never existed then . what existed similar to gacaca , there used to be a meeting .... let 's say like a judgement of the communities .
earlier i told you that long ago rwandese used to live in communities , families , tribes and the country and in every community there used to be leaders and important members of that community , during that time in case something like a crime would have happened , if was within the community they gathered and the one who has committed a crime would be put out in public and would confess or they would report him , he would be penalized accordingly , in case of a crime committed by an other community , let 's say someone was killed that 's when it would like gacaca of today , it was called "@ inzigo @" during that time they would be a revenge . that was the law and the victimized community would revenge according to this law .
one by one but there times they would have mercy and revenge on bananas meaning ... they would cut it down and then it replaces someone but the family that killed would ask for forgiveness and ... and then the other law if revenging by killing the family in the name of revenging for theirs , they take it to the bananas so you can understand that long time many of those things existed , to punish crime and the criminal and forgiveness existed and these two still exist up to today . gacaca firstly has a fact that they should not go easy on them as in not praising them like they used to do before .
maybe among the given punishments then i am one of the people who had the idea or were influential long time when they were still thinking of how it can happen especially .... they is some small journal i write that had that discussion it 's even written if they are all the same you have to remember to divide them into levels the first level .... people put it in their heads and comply with it looking for a way they can work with everyone whoever does n't is forced to comply with it they say it to him we 've said the way people managed to say and to confess that they are christians or they are generally caring , to know that people accepted to kill others with machetes in churches .
why do n't i put it in god 's hands to handle things that are not supposed to even be thought about , i also said that it was mostly caused by training , there was fear it reached a pointed people were hopeless , they once told me that someone said that they were condemned that all along they were condemned .... that they will die it 's wasting time .... you were condemned you will die they were condemned it 's already done just like the way long time a king would condemn someone with his parent to be killed saying that they have been condemned to death with his relatives
it got a point and they said that it 's over for any tutsi , that he should die , i have forgotten ...... where were we ?
we were on gacaca comparing the gacaca before and that of today , if it 's true that gacaca will be productive and make the rwandan community rebuild itself
yes .... you understand old time things are not the same so we can say that would it be possible ?
to reconcile then we can even say punishing first all even punishing itself involves those people you hear it sometimes , it includes punishing and reconciling ... there some people who have that thing of saying that gacaca does n't punish the ones who caused it are not punished that 's the problem , the fact that i was talking about . i had forgotten about the levels of leadership that i was actually part of the ..... levels of leadership is what i had forgotten just ... are the ones who were used .
who are those who caused it they are the ones on top .... who punished habyarimana maybe whoever that warned him is the one who punished but they are many who followed it closely let 's say the ones who helped them i 'm not saying their names so they do n't think i need anything from them , i do n't need anything from them but .... those who helped them are known and they are mentioned in the news papers
those who helped interahamwe and the ones who helped in the killings are known many are not punished they are far they have means sometimes you hear arusha many of those are not even seen kabuga and the others are in france and they can n't be reached they are the ones who started it and they even sensitized the churches they some of them that i 've mentioned .... those who sensitized it that i 've mentioned some of them even wrote it in the books they taught it to children in schools saying that a tutsi is bad all those are the ones who deserve to be punished more than the others where will they get from ?
but you understand that it 's hard whatever the case i will chose the lesser evil .
gacaca is the only possible and good solution rather to reconcile is understandable .... then to say something is to say that when you say that all hutus killed even me sometimes i say it once in while there are times i say it thinking it 's just a saying .... us who are going there we stand up confessing that we are hutus and we refuse to be painted black us we are going to have a group of hutus that confesses that they do n't agree with that and we separate ourselves from it and we are against it the people who betrayed us messed up our name
there are those it will n't come out of , i do not know yet what caused it , why is there a hutu who was made to feel that his purpose is that a tutsi should not live ?
... it is useless to him , how will gacaca rehabilitate him so as for him to feel that he was poisoned , i do not know how gacaca can undo this because they taught them that bad people ... there is a person born in kajogera who used to terrorize ...
you were telling us about gacaca
gacaca will be better and it will arrive at the desired goal
honestly gacaca was the best prescription
and it 's the best , they are some things that will not be possible or that will be difficult
but this will be solved with time continues to teach .
and to feel that it 's not important as even to those who have will die in it , that 's where the hatred and the poison
because he feels that the genocide can not happen , and that feeling remains in him
that state of heart will not be attained very soon by the gacaca , it will come with time , people and so on
like the story goes , that he who time leaves behind ...
those generations were taught to kill for a long time
i think it changing because now those that are being born today are being taught good things and those that were taught bad things are growing old
i would thus like to ask the last question then we shall wind up , that 's all we will need . after the genocide
of 1994 , everyone who was present
who is alive today wishes to live in a rwanda that is harmonious without any divisionism
will develop or become a rwanda that 's doing well without any segregation . what message can you give those children
since they are the future of rwanda on how they will be able to build a rwanda that is not characterised by any form of segregation
there is no message i can give that you do not know about , what i see is that we should follow what we are taught
by our leaders that says that we have the same origin and are related so we should be one
and we get the satisfaction that we deserve , most of the time that stuff about segregation was said those who did not share
and called each other greedy
honestly , it is all just talk that we are related and al created by one god , especially the christians who are many like i was saying
many of those that believed in god committed crimes ,
it 's education that most important and that 's where people are taught unity
and whoever does n't understand , they help him understand , those that do not understand ... that 's what i can call it
thank you
we would like to ask you what happened during the genocide ; how you were called , how you responded , how you joined the attackers troops or if there is some one you strungled to death , generally tell us how you saw it .
my name is bamporiki emmanuel i live in nyamata district in kibungo sector in the province of kigali rural .
i am married and i have one child , and i am 31 years old .
i witnessed every thing that took place in kibungo .
i followed up whatever happened during the day and in the night in that area in 1994 .
it is true that there was a war in 1994 and i must admit that i participated in this war with other different people with the object of killing tutsis and finishing them completely .
but before that , the local leaders had sensitized the locals to participate in the killing together with the help of the soldiers , who were later joined by the policemen in the sensitisaton .
all those leaders tried to persuade citizens to kill tutsis .
and if anything , to destruct all their properties and they assured us that no one would accuse us or follow up their cases . i will start by telling you what happened in that area .
generally the massacre started on the 9th .
if i remember well it is when ndengeyeinka 's house was destroyed . they even tortured him .
on the 10th the massacre continued .
some villagers from this area , together with the help of soldiers , attacked a certain centre called nyarunazi .
so many people lost their lives in that attack .
i can remember some of their names .
there was ndekezi , bikino , sango and rubangiza .
in that time you could see that people knew what they were doing and they did it with all their efforts .
it did not stop there , on the14th april in 1994 .
that was when we attacked ntarama at the church .
but before we went there , we held a meeting with people who lived in the sectors that surrounded ntarama that is ; kibungo , kanzenze , rurindo , musenyi , people from other neighbouring districts like ; gitarama district , kanombe and butamwa commune plus so many other people from here and there .
we had to meet in one place near ntarama , led by a policeman called subuhindo who used to live in kanzenze .
i remember very well that we arrived there on the14th .
most of the tutsi who were being hunted had fled to that church .
most of the soldiers and policemen we were with started planting bombs around the church and throwing grenades in the church .
we did not stop there , but we also went and entered the church .
we found that some had already died because of the bombs .
so we started killing others using machetes , clubs . honestly one has to say that .
that time the tutsis were killed very harshly and the truth must be said .
i was also there with the intension of killing and i should say that i also participated and i killed an old man using a club .
for that reason i was imprisoned for six years .
after all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile .
when we returned the country i was imprisoned by the current government because i had participated in the massacre that took place in murambi .
later , i admitted and i said the truth on what i did in murambi and the people i was with .
i had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow rwandans , so i felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it .
i was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but i had already admitted and i had said the truth on what happened and the people i was with and i was released after that rule that was given by the president .
but it does not mean that i have forgotten what i did .
i remember very well that i killed that old man on that morning when i was in ntarama and i am always ready to say the truth of what happened in ntarama .
besides the ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ?
that centre , but i participated by giving them support like bringing back people who were trying to escape and others would kill them .
but i believe that i would also have killed them myself if the people i sent them to had not killed them .
i should admit i did terrible things by stopping these people maybe if i had not stopped them they would have escaped and be able to survive .
i still admit that i participated in the genocide in public and killed someone using a club .
it 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . but you participated in only two ; that of ntarama and nyarunazi . why did n't you participate in several others ?
sincerely speaking in ntarama ... i never knew who it was .
and the reason why i did know him , in ntarama several people gathered there ... to be sincere , they were very many and i guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there identity cards for one to tell who was who .
well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the id to know who was who or where he was coming from .
the main theem was killing .
and our motto was to finish the ethenic of tutsi ... looking for ids by then , was nosense .
point was in killing only because that was the deal .
do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations .
to the extend that , if one had a bias in the tutsi would ... ?
if i consider that war ... as a person who followed up everything yet i was mature by then .
we live in peace with our neighbours . i did not have any hatred for tutsis because i had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years .
but the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of habyarimana .
we sensed segregation among people that particular day .
people started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at tutsis as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the tutsis .
and so you should stand up and defend him .
you have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . that means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed .
well before the genocide there used to be several political parties .
can you tell us the one you belonged to ?
how did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ?
yes i was old enough to join any party i wanted to join and by then i was a member of mdr . i was there as any other rwandan , and because i was illiterate ; i could not get any good post .
therefore , i simply had a membership card for that party .
but what i know is , that party disliked the tutsis so much . i had told you that i did not have any hatred for tutsis .
but most of these parties always taught us that the only enemy we had was a tutsi .
though you did not have any hatred for the tutsis .
when mdr was teaching you how tutsis were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ?
i did not attend most of mdr meetings .
but i remember some time when sebuningo oswald ; he was the representative of the party in kibungo sector .
he held a meeting at kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto .
but one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . and the whole meeting was about the "@ hutu . @" therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights .
thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide .
during the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ?
the troop that attacked ntarama was very big and so powerful and i should say many people died in that attack .
i do n't even think that there was anyone who survived .
in case there is one , it would have been through god 's mercy .
i remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking ntarama .
i accused sehene siriveste , sindikubwabo gilbert , karangwa charles , they all admit that they killed .
plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something .
but i accused so many people and that shows that i was not alone .
and i realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing i can do to pay the fine of what i did .
during the war i was not being hunted . so , i was free as a rwandan .
therefore , i witnessed whatever happened and i feel that i should say the truth about what happened .
because the majority of rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . and survivors do not know everything because they were hunted .
others are rwandans who came from exile .
they were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . the only alternative is us who were free by then .
and fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector .
there is some thing we call ; "@ asking for forgiveness @" and what we call "@ admitting what you did . @"
therefore , i would like to ask you about the survivor ; there are some survivors who do not know those who killed their relatives , and though they survived , they are always hurt about what happened to their people .
i would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? have you ever asked them to forgive you ?
it is true that those people faced horrible things and they lost their people , which is very sad .
personally i do not know the family of the person i killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families i decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general .
but we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like rwiheza innocent .
he was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector .
we would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise .
but the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ gacaca level . @"
in gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ i am sure we know family per family ] .
then we will count .
it would be more or less like a census .
then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies .
well i can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried .
hence they exhume and rebury them officially .
in that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything .
on behalf of the servivors , it is agony to loss their beloved ones .
and when they add on not knowing where those people died , it hurts a lot .
in the gacaca corts that are going to take place in the next few months , we planned to come together as rwandans and say the whole truth about what happened .
we will tell the truth to the survivors and we will pread for forgiveness as much as we can .
the crime we committed we will never do it or think about it again .
we will tell them the truth about all the people we killed and how they were killed .
those whom we still remember where they were dumped , we will show them to those who survived . and those that we do n't remember ; because they are some who died from here and there . but we shall use "@ saying the truth @" as our weapon to calm them .
saying the truth is nothing much rather than showing people what we did and put everything in open .
we have to avoid keeping it as a secrete believing that once you are released from prison , you are going to enjoy out there forgetting the main reason why you were released .
we are ready to say the truth in gacaca .
what do you feel about people who criticise the genocide .
people who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of genocide ?
up to this moment , some rwandans believe that genocide is just a simple fight . a fight like that between two drunkards who start it up and maybe one of them dies .
the same people say that there was no genocide .
i as a rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , i admit that there was genocide in rwanda .
i do n't deny it .
yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" and they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @"
one group of rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed .
up to this day leaders in the former government are behind it .
yet those of us they were leading in different places by then , admit it as a truth that genocide happened here .
we have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was genocide .
those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country .
there is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her .
we admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light .
as a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful .
instead they should unit together with the rwandans who are ready to say the truth .
and together tell people what happened and how it happened .
they should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime .
this means that , there was genocide .
then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there .
preach them how it took place repeatedly . but not keeping quiet about it .
until when everyone will learn that genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country .
thanks a lot .
i would like to ask you about those who participated in the genocide yet they are not imprisoned .
you may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ?
yes there are there . up to this moment in my document i mentioned so many rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed .
some of them are out there and i remember them .
when they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily .
"@ though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did .
he is lucky he was released . @"
that is what they say . one can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . and it is true their time will come and they will be put in open .
because i will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . i do n't intend to hide the genocide .
therefore , those who are still out there , i would like to remind them that gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime .
those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . but they should also have the courage to say the truth .
saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed .
if it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true .
instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did .
therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only .
there is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth .
so , you killed some one you better say it .
because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the genocide .
was he arrested ?
no , nobody knows where he fled .
the other people that i knew died .
but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area .
we normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released .
after being released he disappeared ?
yes , he disappeared .
where did he flee ?
he lives up there ... in the former kanombe commune .
in case he is needed by the authorities i can get him face to face . i know his adresses .
does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why i asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide .
can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy .
it would be possible to find them , since the government is putting in a lot of efort in getting those people who participated in the genocide hidding out of the country .
for example if i had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to arusha it is better .
if it means to go and witness in arusha i can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond rwanda .
lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called issac . he lives in ririma .
if he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , i can hurry to go there and convict him .
i would remind him whatever he did while i was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period .
i feel that even the government is delaying me because i am very ready to say the truth on what happened and i feel that i should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too .
in conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors .
what i can tell rwandans in general , is that "@ it is true there was genocide in our country . @"
and so many people died ; more than one million people died as it is shown in the statistics .
and all those people were killed by their fellow rwandans .
which was done in broad daylight .
i believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the rwandans .
therefore i believe that rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ rwandans ] .
so , i am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it .
because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . people were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open .
therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth .
to the genocide survivors i would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible .
which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history .
in the past , rwandans used to be kind .
therefore , i am kindly asking rwandans to be strong and forgive us .
and what we promise to reveal the truth , because that is the only thing we can offer . that is our only contribution ; "@ showing the truth . @"
so that , the truth is written in the world 's history . we will tell them how their people were killed , and then ask for forgiveness from the bottom of our hearts .
thank you !!!
could you please identify yourself ... ?
i mean your name , where you were born ... ?
my name is ayirwanda gaspard .
i was born in nyamagabe commune .
how old were you during the genocide ?
during the ... my family and i migrated to karama but i was born in nyamano .
i asked you how old you were during the genocide ?
during genocide ... i was 41 years old .
would you tell us the crime you are accused of ?
i am accused of genocide .
would you please tell us in details what you did and where you did it ?
i witnessed the beginning of the war of 1994 . and i will emphasize much on the murambi events .
it was here in murambi where we were on a night patrol together with other soldiers . we were making light so as to reveal the enemy passing by .
would you tell us where the patrol was taking place ?
it took place in our home village in gashiha cell , in muganza sector in karama commune .
who organized it ? briefly explain to us about the patrol , before you tell us what happened in murambi .
a certain local leader whose name was anastase uwihanyanye organized it . he had got an order from ngezahayo the burgomaster .
we patrolled with other local leaders in shifts and whoever would try to dodge would be punished .
it was an order from the authorities that we should hunt for the enemy .
what was his name ?
he was called kabera .
the number of attackers had really increased ; it was about 8 o'clock in the evening .
then we were told that the tutsi were in murambi .
then we were asked to put on eucalyptus leaves since they might also come while camouflaged .
then we wore the eucalyptus leaves .
it was a command from the counselor .
when we reached there , we found a man called xavier .
he had a gun ... he is also in prison .
after sometime , a certain man came from murambi and told us it was no longer possible because we were few .
that we should leave and come back another time .
therefore , we did n't attack on that day .
we went back home with our leaders .
on 21st they told us that things had worsened that we should go back to murambi .
at that time we went back and the number [ of attackers ] had increased .
i was with our local leader called senkware and another one called serujangwe .
all of them are out .
what do you mean by saying that , "@ he is out @"@ ?
does it mean out of the country ... ?
not arrested ... i mean they are not imprisoned .
but they are in the country ?
yes they are all inside the country but out of jail .
we came .
we were in a large group led by the man called ngaje who was a supervisor in nyanza .
then we held a meeting with two local leaders and both of them are brothers ; we are together here in prison .
i told him to confess but he refused .
and in return , they chased away my wife because i was trying to make them confess .
those two leaders convinced us that burgomaster ngenzahayo had a written command from the mayor , which was saying that we had to go to murambi to kill the tutsi in order to save our people .
we came here on 21st and gathered up at a nearby school .
we were commanded to wear eucalyptus leaves , then we moved from kiribi up to here .
we met people from mudasomwa there and many other people who had been gathered from many other places using a lorry .
therefore , when we got ... here , they told us to stand up and go to murambi .
we had two people among us who had guns ; it was xavier and ngaje .
we were with the counselor and other local leaders and one of them was called sebukima innocent , the other one was called senkware venuste .
uwihanganye was also there .
we were many people from different sectors like muganza and kiraro .
they gave us the rules to follow and we were immediately told to wear eucalyptus leaves .
we went with our machetes up to murambi and stopped beside that house without a roof .
for how long did the killing take place ?
the killings stopped at 4:00 a.m. , when it was almost dawn .
that is when the shootings stopped .
what happened afterwards ?
they [ interahamwe ] started looting their property and stealing bags from the dead bodies .
during that war that took place , which role did you play ?
did you kill some people ?
the role that i played ... i killed some people .
how many did you kill ?
i killed two people .
what about those in your company , did n't you see them killing ... ?
yes i did . the local people we were with would get any tutsi who would try to escape and kill him or her with a club ... i was with them ...
if you consider the size of murambi , were you all on one side ... ? were you surrounding it all ... ? how was it ?
after the soldiers reinforced the [ murambi ] natives , they continued with the war .
i am asking you whether you surrounded the whole area or whether you were in one place .
soldiers are the ones who surrounded the area but citizens were just beside that house .
but when the tutsis started running interahamwe followed them in that school and even in the homes they where they were hiding and started hacking them .
you personally , did you kill anyone you knew before ?
i did n't kill anyone i knew but there is some tutsi neighbour who was killed while i was seeing . even counselor budengeri was present . someone killed that tutsi a painful death while i was watching .
what about those you killed , how did you kill them ... how long did you take to kill people ?
the people i killed ... i hit him with a club and he died right way .
the same for the other one , i hit him with the club and he immediately died .
what interval of time did you kill them ? did you kill them at the same time or it was at different times ?
i killed two people ... i killed them in ... as i 've just said , i hit him with a club and he immediately died .
what time was it ?
i killed him towards morning . it was around 4:00 a.m.
did you get time to properly identify whether he was a tutsi or not ?
i believe he was a tutsi because there was no hutu among them .
and when did you kill the second one ?
like this ... i killed both of them at the same time .
did you kill them in a few minutes interval ?
i killed both of them in a few minutes interval .
what if that person did n't die , would you recognize him today if you met him ?
i do n't think i would recognize him because there were people of all kinds .
so i would n't know him .
you do n't even remember his looks ... ? are n't you able to say , "@ the person i killed looked like so and so ? @"
i think i remember what he looked like .
did you know where they came from ?
i did n't know where they came from ; they had fled to murambi .
did you have any reason for killing them ?
it was just because of the bad leadership that forced us to kill but otherwise i would not have killed them .
you have recently known that it was a bad leadership because now there is a good one .
i believe if you had known before that it was a bad leadership you would not have killed them .
therefore there should be other reasons that forced you to kill ; would you tell us some of those reasons that might have forced you to kill .
the reason i killed them is because the authorities ordered us to . they said , "@ there is only one enemy and you must kill him or her , and if you do n't , you yourself shall be killed . @"
from your personal point of view , did they appear like your enemies ?
we never had any conflicts between us .
in fact i would n't have killed them if it were n't that they told us that if we did n't kill them , they would definitely kill us .
are you trying to say that if you had refused to kill then , you would have been immediately killed ?
is there anyone who came to you and said , "@ if you do n't kill , i will kill you . @"@ ?
that is why i realized that what i did was very bad and reported myself .
i killed innocent people who had n't done any thing wrong to me . that is why whenever i think about it , i become very miserable because i killed my fellow people yet they had n't done anything to me .
so if you had let them pass and you had not hacked them they might have been alive up to now ?
yes they would be alive .
if i had n't killed them , they would be alive today .
maybe they would have survived through god 's mercy .
so that means that you did it voluntarily and no one forced you ?
i was convinced by those people to go to that place . when i reached there my savagery led me to killing those innocent people .
so it was out of your own will ?
no one forced me , it was out of my own will and that is why i apologize for what i did .
how did you know the people you tormented and who are they ?
they were our neighbours just in the nearby area .
did you kill other people from that same area ?
yes there are some people i killed .
how many people did you kill altogether ?
i killed a certain child called kagina and a man called manama .
kagina was hiding at the home of my in @-@ laws .
then a certain boy call kiyihura found me standing in front of my coffee plantation and told me , "@ there is a child who is hiding at the place of your in @-@ laws , he is an inkotanyi [ rpf member ] i am going to bring him so that we kill him . @"
he went and brought him .
he made him pass by a place called muhora in muhungo when we reached there we found six other men .
then we took the boy , kayihura and cyprien ntakirutimana who is in jail today , tied him up with ropes made out of tough grass and drowned him in the river .
from all you have said , it sounds like other people drowned that kid in the river , but you are saying that you killed him .
so what do you mean ... ?
what do you mean when you say that you killed him ?
you told us that other people drowned him ; they tied him with grass made out of ropes but in no time you are telling us that you killed him ...
that child called kagina was taken and the people who took him killed him while i was there .
which means that if they never killed him , i would have killed him myself .
did you help them ?
i did not help them .
but i was just standing watching . like the way i 'm standing now .
they drowned him while i was watching and we were together .
okay , tell me now ... the people you killed yourself how many are they ?
do n't worry , if you do n't remember them it is okay .
the people i killed myself ... they are ... [ counting with fingers ] i killed three people .
those are the people you killed with your own hands ?
yes , those are the people i killed with my own hands .
there are the two others from murambi you told us ...
well , there 's another child i killed myself .
after killing him ... i hit him with a club and threw his body in the river .
how did you see him ?
explain to us .
we were looking for his father and failed to get him .
but i saw the son . therefore i decided to kill the son .
were you with other people ?
we were three but i 'm the one who killed him . the other men whom we were together did n't .
i am the one who killed him .
my question is , during that time when you were killing him , what was your main reason of killing him ? i mean , not now ... but then , what was going on in your mind ? how were you feeling inside ?
what was your attitude ?
at the time when i was doing it , i had wild thoughts that made me think we were hunting ... wherever i saw a tutsi i would kill .
so you felt like you did not have any interactions with the tutsi ... ? i am asking you ... did you feel like you did n't want to interact them ?
by then ... imagine i had killed an innocent child who had n't done anything wrong to me !
you can see i am an old man ... that was really a very bad thing to do .
you mean there 's no one who is imprisoned ?
there 's no one in prison . at least no one from my family , maybe my neighbours .
you have told us that you killed the tusti because your leaders forced you to . so personally what did you think of the tutsi before the genocide ?
before the genocide , the bad leadership of that time influenced us . they used to convince us that our only enemy was the tutsi .
so we were forced to believe it and yet it was not true . simply because the government was sensitizing us all the time .
when did they start telling you that ?
they started telling us that after habyarimana 's death .
we are asking you how you used to find the tutsi before habyarimana 's death .
before the genocide we would intermarry , i even have a sister who got married in that ethnic group .
we were friendly .
so you used to look at them as if they were your relatives but later on you changed your attitude towards them ... i guess you know something about the war that took place in 1990 , is n't it ?
yes i heard about it .
during that time , did n't you see signs , which showed that in the future there would be genocide in rwanda ?
we could hear that there was a war going on towards kibungo . that there were people coming from exile who were fighting against the people they found in the country . but for us in gikongoro it was peaceful .
therefore , you never saw any signs of the genocide ?
i started seeing those signs after habyarimana 's death .
is that the time you saw signs ?
yes , that 's when i saw some signs
let me ask you ... you have just said that all changed after habyarimana 's death .
which changes did you experience after habyarimana 's death ?
and how did you handle those changes ?
after habyarimana 's death , i was at a place where i was working as a watchman .
as i was coming from mudasomwa to buy irish potatoes , i met a tutsi woman who asked me , "@ gaspard , how come those houses across are burning ?
what is happening and why are you running ? @"
then i told her i was from buying irish potatoes from gasharu .
but i told her that i had left houses being burnt up there .
i told her how i met some men taking cow 's there in mushishito .
then i told her , "@ since you are my neighbour i will tell you what is going on .
from now on , i will never work as a watchman anymore .
they are killing the tutsi ! @"
then she thanked me and immediately left ; she never slept there in her home .
i also went home and stopped moving around . i stayed at home .
after realizing what was about to take place , did n't you at least think of what you should do to help your neighbours since you had even intermarried ?
my neighbours ... when they heard about it , they all fled . some came here to murambi .
you told us that here in murambi was a horrible massacre . after the killings do you know of something else that followed in your home village ?
after the murambi battle , no more killings took place .
the french troops intervened and stopped it .
did the french find any tutsi around ?
they found all the tutsi already dead .
it sounds like the french came to cover up the deeds of those who went to exile ?
yes they just wanted to cover up on what those people had done but the tutsi had already died .
do you remember when the french reached here ?
i do n't remember ...
maybe it was within a short time after the catastrophe that happened in murambi ...
they found when all tutsi from murambi had already died .
when you estimate , what time do you think it was ?
if i estimate ... the tutsi died ... i heard that the french had reached kibuye and within a short time i heard that they had reached gikongoro .
but that was less than a month time after the tutsi had been murdered .
that is not what i was asking . i know you 've changed and you are a good person .
but i was asking whether you remember what you did ... what 's the most painful souvenir ... ?
what i remember that always hurts me are the innocent people who were killed .
well , those who died were all innocent .
but as a person who was in murambi , what would be the souvenir that you will never forget ?
something you ever think about , maybe blood that dropped on you ...
what i can never forget are the people who died here , killed by wrong doers .
i mean you personally . let me give you an example .
let 's say you have a wife and you quarrel frequently ; you quarrel once , twice , three times and finally you fight .
and maybe she hits you with a burning charcoal or you hit her toot . that can stick in your mind maybe because it is what hurts you the most in the whole fight . now , comparing that example to this situation .
you came to murambi , is n't it ?
so tell me among all the horrible things you did or saw , what do you remember ... something that stuck in your head ?
maybe a memory about hacking somebody or somebody you saw being crushed by a grenade . that is all we need to know .
an incident that you will never forget .
the thing i will never forget is seeing people being crushed by grenades .
i will never forget that .
what happened ?
a grenade was thrown to them and they died .
how did they open the grenade ... ? how did you see them dying ?
what i saw about their death , they fell down and died slobbering .
that is all i saw .
is that all you saw ? i mean the worst thing you saw ... it might be an event that took place in the twinkling of an eye ?
the two men i killed myself is the worst thing i saw happening in the twinkling of an eye .
i will never forget that , in my whole lifetime .
yet they were innocent .
what do you remember about that event , which always comes back to your mind ?
what i recall ... is the fact that i killed them .
i killed them with clubs and they died right away .
whenever i recall it , i feel so sad .
they were my people but i killed them . instead of hiding them i killed them .
whenever i think about it i feel so sad . whenever i remember that i killed them ... that is why i ask god to forgive me . i always ask for forgiveness because i killed my comrades yet they were innocent .
i killed them because of the wrong mentality we were fed then .
do you think about it often ?
yes i often think about it and it fills me with misery . because of those two men i killed yet they were innocent .
you personally told us that you killed .
there are some events that you still remember clearly and you admitted what you were accused of . how do you look at that crime especially when people accuse you to have participated in the genocide ?
no one forced me to pleade guilty . i reported myself as my conscience did n't leave at peace because i knew what i did was very wrong . no one forced me i did it willingly .
i reported myself in my home area and talked about what i did in murambi .
i saw so many innocent people dying in murambi .
wrong doers killed them although they had not done anything wrong . those people had fled to murambi .
i reported myself about it before anybody reported me .
having participated in the genocide or being called a genocidaire , does it make you feel embarrassed ?
having participated in the genocide ... personally i feel that , i did wrong .
and , it was due to the bad heart i had .
later the government said , "@ you killed , tell us how you killed then we shall forgive you . @"
then i thought about it and decided was going to say how i killed and then be pardoned by the government and by god . @"
you know there is something called ‘ justice ’ that is being practiced in rwanda , concerning the genocide that happened .
so how do you think justice should be done ?
how should they go about it ?
on my behalf , justice in rwanda ... i suggest that the government forgives me because i always try to simplify its work by confessing and convicting those who do n't admit their participation in murambi killings .
i say everything truthfully and i help the government by telling what happened here and what i personally got involved into .
therefore the government should forgive me .
because i say the truth about what happened without giving them a hard time .
besides being forgiven , personally after all that happened in rwanda , what kind of justice should be done ?
it is ‘ justice ’ that unites all rwandans .
so that we can build our nation and stop what happened from happening again .
we should build our nation and make it look like it was before people died .
you have just talked about unity and reconciliation .
what do you think about unity and reconciliation ?
how do you expect it to work ?
i think unity and reconciliation should unite the rwandans so that they live in harmony the way they lived before .
people should live with those they betrayed and ask for forgiveness .
do you think that unity and reconciliation are possible after all that happened in rwanda ?
i know it 's hard to unite and reconcile after what happened in rwanda .
but again , the government is working hard so that people may say the truth about what happened in order to reconcile .
you have told us that you confessed ; now we want to ask you whether you asked for forgiveness to the people you hurt . did you go to them , especially the survivors ?
yes , there is a woman to whom i asked for forgiveness ; she was happy and she thanked me for having told her about the people i killed , she said she did n't know them .
and then she said there was no problem with her ... i told her about who killed her family members and she said she did not know them .
what does it mean when one says there is no problem ?
she said to me , "@ i did n't know those who killed my relatives .
now you have told them to me and in fact we are neighbours . @"
she told me that they always deny that they did n't kill them .
she appreciated me and said , "@ you say the truth , keep it up and do n't change . @" she told me to keep saying the truth like i had said about her family .
but i am asking you if you think it is easy ?
being easy ... people should forgive those who did wrong to them since the majority is ready to forgive .
maybe those who do n't accept their roles in the genocide yet there are evidences should be punished because they do n't want to expose the truth .
you have admitted the crimes you committed and always regret what you did .
now according to you , how do you find the future of rwanda ?
rwanda is no more like the former rwanda . children of rwanda today think about building their nation .
they do n't think about doing things like what happened in the past .
the government is teaching the children how to live in peace with one another , how to work ... i do n't see genocide happening again .
you know very well that rwanda lost so many things and very many people .
so in case you were released , what would be your contribution as far as unity and reconciliation or development in rwanda is concerned ?
i think i would go and try to live in peace with the people i tormented and since i 'm a farmer , i would try to work with them as we try to help one another .
when you consider what happened , do you feel like you are a rwandan ?
yes , i feel i 'm a rwandan .
thank you , would you please remind us your name ?
my name is ayirwanda gaspard .
how long have you been in prison ?
i have been in prison for five years and eight months
thank you .
thank you too .
ayirwanda ?
yes please ?
listen , we all learnt ... all of us were taught about unity and reconciliation .
we understood and even practiced it .
in fact this is what we are doing right now .
but as human beings we have hearts and brains .
therefore , i am not asking you about what you were taught .
i am asking you according to your conscience and beliefs .
on your behalf , if one said that they are going to bring someone who killed your child , would you be that kind to him ?
or would you say that you do n't even want to see him ?
such a person ... the majority forgives and others do n't .
i 'm asking you personally , i 'm not asking you about others .
if it was a true story that happened to you , let us say one time you went home and found your child 's body lying there dead . can you forgive that person who may have killed your child ?
personally there is a time i forgave someone who killed my wife . now he has been released .
but it was n't during genocide , that person used poison and she died .
but later we reconciled and started sharing everything ; we would invite each other for events .
therefore i would forgive him .
my heart would be at ease to forgive him .
well that is all i wanted you to tell me .
now would you tell us in brief , your life experience ; you told us that you have been in prison for 5 years and 8 month , which means you were arrested in 1999 .
i was arrested on the 26th july 1998 .
after the genocide stopped in 1994 , what kind of life did you go through ? please tell us in brief .
in 1994 after the war when all tutsi had died , people were wild .
everyone in gikongoro was bad except me .
i want to know if you fled .
no i did n't flee .
what hurt me were the neighbours i had whom i would no longer see .
that caused me a lot of pain in my heart .
did you continue to live your life in the village like any other villager ?
yes i lived a normal life but i was n't happy at all because of the innocent people who had died .
in the place where you lived , how many ruined houses were there ?
where i lived , there were about six houses in ruin .
whenever you would see them , would n't they remind you of something ?
yes they would remind me of something because whenever i would like to send my children to my neighbours for some water , i could not because they were no longer there and yet there used to be people whom we would talk . it would really hurt me .
meanwhile , according to what you have said , it seems like it took long before you were arrested . but you are not telling us your life during all that period .
from 1994 to 1998 ... until you were arrested .
what happened is that , the lady whose child i killed was a hutu but she had married a tutsi . so she reported me to the authorities and then i ran away from my home .
i let my home and i would sleep in bushes .
when did she report you ?
she reported me in 1998 but whenever they would come for me , i would run away .
were you hiding in the bush ?
yes i was hiding in the bush .
near your home ?
near my ... i would go to a place called rukondo and then i would come back at night while no one was seeing .
i would stay in the house for the whole day , and then go back when no one was aware .
were they arrested too ?
they were not arrested .
they are out there in their homes .
i am the only one who is in jail among all people we collaborated in the killings .
how were you arrested ?
how the arrested me ... they got me from home where i was digging .
when they took me to the commune and imprisoned me .
and when i reached there , i immediately i admitted that i committed the genocide .
who arrested you ?
the counselor arrested me ; the one who brought us here in murambi .
together with the local leaders they arrested me . and that tutsi survivor who married a hutu lady .
you have told us that you were arrested by the counselor , is it the one who brought you during the time of killing ?
yes he is the one .
did you talk about it in the testimony you gave ?
in my testimonies and in my documents he is there . even in the testimony i testified in cyanika i mentioned him .
that was in kibuye . in my document all of them are mentioned .
what could be the reason why they are not arrested and you have told us that some are leaders ?
i said it for a long time and they said that they will arrest them in gacaca but i do n't know why they do n't arrest them .
you as a person who s in jail , when you hear about such ... a leader in your sector ... it means that he is the one who gives orders yet he is supposed to be the one revealing the wrong things .
you are very sure that you all participated in the genocide .
what do you thing about your sector ?
if i were given the opportunity to go back to my area , i would go pointing out the people we were with and even though that leader is among , i would name him too .
i just wanted to know how you feel about the leadership in your sector in this time of your absence .
well , a place like my home sector , which is lead by a genocidaire , i suggest that person should be arrested .
i am just asking you what you think about it .
what i think about someone who is leading my home sector yet he killed , i guess he is doing nothing .
i think he should first go to solidarity camps and try to forget what he did because he did many things .
so you think if he went to solidarity camps he may change ? or maybe he went there but you are not informed ?
he has not yet gone there .
how can he go there yet he was not arrested ?
but there are camps purposely for leaders .
he ignored and never admitted what he did , unless the truth is revealed and then his crimes will get him to jail .
of all what you have just said what would you suggest ?
based on all i have said , my wish is to let people know that all the bad deeds i did were of the past government .
and , now in this government of unity and reconciliation , i would like to testify what happened .
and the truth i would like to show is how my heart was renewed and now i am human and i can live with other people .
together we can build our motherland rwanda .
we should reveal the truth about what happened and live with those whose beloved ones we killed .
who is kabombeki ... ?
he is the zambian ... anyway i do n't remember well which country he is the president of ...
is it thabo mbeki ?
yes , the president came while i was there .
by then bizimungu pasteur was the president of rwanda . i remember all of us came here and by then i was not yet imprisoned . and when we came here , i remembered all the bad deeds that i did here .
they had come to see the remains of people and several other things . but my heart was haunting me . deep down in my heart something was telling me , "@ you too came to attack here ! @"
and i knew that once they get me i would say the truth .
and indeed i admitted everything willingly .
of course if i had denied no one would have known what happened .
therefore , i admitted everything personally so that even those people whom we ...
had you ever confessed before they came to arrest you ?
no i had n't , but i confessed immediately after i had reached the commune .
but if you had not been arrested , would you have confessed ?
i they had n't arrested me , reporting and admitting my deeds ... if they had n't got me ... if someone convicted me saying , "@ you were with us during those acts of killings . @" i would immediately have accepted it .
what if she had n't known ?
did you want to report yourself ?
if she did n't know , there is a place i went to ... at the local leader 's ... there at the counselor 's place . he was my relative because i was born there in gikongoro .
therefore , he advised me to go and report myself that they would reduce my punishment in case i did so . he told me that i should say all the roles i played in the genocide and stop living in the bushes .
i had started developing scale like those of a frog .
therefore i assured myself that if i report myself , my punishment would be reduced .
so in my plans i knew i would report myself because i had noticed that things had become worse in my life .
have you ever seen people 's corpses that are lying here ?
i saw them ; they were very many .
when did you see them ?
i saw them in the morning when they had just died .
that time when the presidents came here , did you also go to see the corpses ?
when the presidents came , no citizen was allowed to go there .
it was only the presidents .
but there is a rumor around that , after they had killed those people , did they rush to bury them ?
yes they buried them immediately .
what were they using ?
tractors .
did you play any role there ? did n't you come to help others ?
no .
but you got that information ?
yes , i got that news .
i only know that information of how they were exhuming them from that place where they had buried them .
the citizens had refused to ... exhume and rebury the remains . therefore , the current government ; this government of unity and reconciliation had to pay them to do so .
okay , thanks .
how they came ... they came on friday , that is how they came and then we saw a flame of fire we were at the market , they said that they were burning tutsi belongings then we moved a bit because the other side was burning , when we came that night we found houses had been burned and the neighboring houses were also burning and then i sat down , i had people to but people were no longer alive ,
they were not tutsis ?
yes , i asked them what is going on .
they said that tutsis have been attacked , how have they been attacked ?
it is happening again ! since i was a child they were burning tutsi belongings , chasing them away and now it has happened again ?
so i said @: ‘ that is how it is . ’ and then i told the others , ‘ listen to me kids .
the war has begun and you all should go home . i do n't want to die with you ’ then i sent some of the kids at home .
that night passed and on the following day , i saw them taking a young boy ... they came to me and said @: ‘ there is where ... they sent student 's books ... when he came home from school with many books brought by a boy of about his same age .
i kept the books and after keeping them i saw someone called wellars coming .
i took him in the house and asked him where he had been then he said that he was from kigali . i asked him @: ‘ when did you arrive ?
habyarimana died yesterday but one ... when did you come ?
’ he said , ‘ i came yesterday ’ . i put him into the house and locked the door .
many more people came in the house and among them were girls .
i said to myself @: ‘ if i put these girls and the men together and that they get discovered , they will tell everything they know .
girls are not good at talking .
’ then i made some traditional medicine and gave to one of them and told her to drink and smeared the other with it .
stayed with one of them and i told the rest to go home .
who were those you told to go home ?
were they tutsis ?
yes .
i told them to go home and then they went home , go home and die there because the war has begun , and i was left with the other girl i smeared them with medicine i would not bath them and they came another young girl and i stayed with all of them .
i brought them into the house because they were young saying they would have said it .
i remained with the other one tied her to my clothes like this , we walked around together when i went out of the house there she was with me and thought to myself there is nowhere i am going to reach with these children with this young girl , and they said that we will get her from you when i went to fetch water they would say that we will get her from you and i said that you will n't get her !
why get her from me she is a hutu do you think she is a tutsi ?
when i went to fetch water i found corpse all round , i said this is a tragedy in my home so they came closer and closer and i asked them what is this that you are doing ?
they said that if i say what i had seen they would kill me on my way to the market .
on my way to the market they surrounded me but i had drunk my medicine and i had some in my hands .
i told them , you are lying and they said , is it a surprise ?
presidential guards who had come from kigali came i got some fuel from them and i said that if anyone ever came to get anyone in my house i will burn them .
just like they would burn me .
they threatened to kill me , they said that since that old woman likes tutsis we will kill her , we do n't know her back ground and neither do we talk to her .
i stayed there with the others and i showed them where to pass .
whenever i saw them planning on how to get on this hill . trying to know how people come .
who were those living there ?
the interahamwe ?
did n't we go together ?
................
at muhamudus , at sezikeyes !
i took them there , and then when i got back i would skip a day . the next day something would itch and i would go back and say is it over crowded .
i would smear them with medicine and take them home .
i want to ask you , the time the presidential guards came with the interahamwe , how did you do it for them not enter into the house ?
i said that nyabingi would eat them !
i could try and called these things and shake other things to .
i would say nyabingi will eat you !
i told those that had come there .
they asked do you work with witch doctors ; did you come after meeting them ?
i also live in rwanda i have my nyabingi let me come !
i got up and started knocking like this !
and things would shake with these bracelets and they would run . they ran and they called the interahamwe and presidential guards .
one presidential guard came in saying that they wanted medicine ; i asked them what kind of medicine do you want ?
they told me the medicine they wanted , i went and got it for them .
i had prepared porridge i gave them and we drank and then i told them , what if i opened the door will you look inside ?
they said yes , i opened the door and i asked them do you see any person in here ?
they said no , then why do go telling people that i have people in here , as an old woman you think i can hide someone ?
can i know how to hide a child or a woman ?
i thought that if i said a man they would suspect it so i did n't say it instead i said children and women .
so i said i will send you an animal and beasts to eat you .
that 's when they got up and went just before they got out of sight they brought back those logs doing this , they made roadblocks and at night i went and got it and used it as firewood and those in the house were scared .
they told me not burn a roadblock ?
and i said to them , then why do they burn you ?
i said it 's not possible !
wellars is the one who called and i told him not talk about me again .
i went where the cups were i brought them i took them .
i said you should n't come out !
you should urinate and defecate here !
i took the wastes and they said we are killing you , i said is there worse death than this ?
that 's how i did it after doing that , other came presidential guards came they gave me a girl that came from mugina .
they said that , take this girl we are giving her to you because you were good to us .
after the war we will come ask for her if it does n't end and you die together fine !
then there came some stupid guys , they told me to give them the girl and i said it 's impossible , i can n't give you this girl , is she yours ?
they said that you will give her to us !
and the girl said to me , instead of them killing you let them take me !
i it 's said impossible , i said let me first pray and i brought my mat and prayed and said god be near me and rescue me , the girl got out of the house and she went with them , while they were undressing her the inkotanyi ( rpf ) there like pa pa !
there they were , and the others were like wait the girl escaped .
after she escaped they came and shot me , when the interahamwe came from up there with guns and some grenades .
they pointed them at me ; i was sited somewhere here i said all that is nothing !
they left their guns here and there and the others came , i went up there with a girl called bebe we went to fetch water and the inkotanyi came and said @: ‘ hey ?
’ i said ‘ yes ’ ‘ why are you fleeing ?
’ i said , ‘ fleeing from what ?
’ ‘ fleeing from the inkotanyi ?
’ i said that i was also inkotanyi ’ !
‘ if you want you can tell i am also inkotanyi i said that there is no inkotanyi that is greater than me , they said but you 're an old woman , i am an old woman ?
so if you have you mother and you 're an inkotanyi she also one .
so they came in and brought everyone out said hello that was it .
do you remember the number of people who were in you home ?
some came from kinazi ; they were coming from different places and another man who was from near here with his sister and her two children .
if you want to love you start with your neighbor .
i want to ask you , for them to come here they knew that you were a traditional healer , did they know that you had other powers ?
they knew , because each morning i would say good morning and good after noon say and they could see people coming from all over to spend nights here .
coming for treatment ?
no , just visiting .
so for them to come here were after something ?
i used to treat most skin diseases , kidneys , gonorrhea etc i knew various medications for them but now days ...
so for you to be able to go and tell them that you use the nyabingi , what that ..........
my aim was not to see any corpse in front of me .
i used to say if they die i will also die but i would him eat them .
among the people that you helped do they ever visit you ?
that old woman mariya , ever since we came from exile i use her plot to plant my crops because mine is too small , that 's how i survive .
no other ...
aa !
that man bourgmestre .
who ? bourgmestre wellars ?
yes , wellars , he provides for me , they say that i 'm mad that he was supposed to give me a cow but who would take it graze ?
unless if i gave it to you and you bring me milk daily .
does he ever tell you how the other people you helped are doing ?
i always saw this when i was a child my parents used to hide tutsis , the war has not only been now !
it was always there even before you were born !
in bufundu , they killed ruhingura and ruzimpuhwe son of rujuga .
i saw that .
they killed the wife of semugeshi they put them underneath their traditional beds i was watching , and me too there those that i put over my garbage when was still young so do n't you think i was seeing ?
i was one and the in another war , in the referendum war , they killed each other i was seeing i was here as a woman !
my in laws hide people !
the killing of gafiiligi gaspard and his your brother bikotwa !
hiding those , at my parents in law hiding three cases of money , i was a seeing !
why do think was n't supposed to do it ?
mama came home from grinding sorghum and they hide two me in the fermentation pit and covered them with sorghum flour , do n't you think i was seeing , a child comes from their mom .
how old are you ?
i was born in 1912
that means in ...........
i am 90 something ...
two ?
two .
bikerinka was also killed ?
you see now your old and children have been seeing this .
have you ever visited any place that went through the tragedy ?
the tragedy took place , i came from murambi
murambi
murambi
in gikongoro
in gikongoro
you looked and soon the tragedy that elapsed ?
up to now i am afraid , did n't i count ?
were n't you there with me ?
but you did n't reach ?
i counted thousands , i counted forty thousand and they told me to stop , because i look a muslim among .
that 's it we are asking about the white according to what happened to rwanda do you think they played any role in that ?
no , i did n't see any white man killing .
but in history as time goes on they could have done something to stop it .
yeah , it 's history i also could have done like they can do , just like they saved us that 's what i can thank them , they saved us let them keep on saving us , save the leaders , save those that they are above , save like this , like they took my picture , they say that this old woman is insured
so i ask you another , what is your message for this not to ever happen again , what can you tell the people ?
just to pray to god
nothing else in the standard of living ........
it 's just to pray but for me i will n't live with them because they killed my child and later my husband .
so do n't you think reconciliation is required ?
let them reconcile , let them bring them out and after bringing them out , those who steal they catch him and shot him on spot .
you think someone who does something again like that should be killed ?
his to be killed because he says that i will kill and i will later be freed from prison , what will happen to me ?
if you do something and your caught let them kill you .
that 's what you think ; you think there should be tough punishments ?
very tough punishments , some aside then says that somebody was killed , what he did we should n't do the same .
so someone like of long ago did you ever hear the racism things when they started ?
me ?
how did it happen when they were starting racism ?
someone who was greater than the other they would , they would talk about him and say that , that tutsi should n't live .
so those who were rich were called tutsis ?
yeah , he would be wealthy .
when they could see you as a cultivator doing that kind of work ... then that one is a tutsi with cows , kill him and we still his belongings , then take over his .
so you can tell that this thing of racisms went according to how rich one was ?
it was according to what you had , in other words they were all like brothers and sisters and you had your sister and when you saw them being greater than you and doing something for that person and they gave them a cow and you like that tutsi is being granted that you should kill them .
then that can make you tell us how people killed each other because of property .
according to the property ... how they were ... you would set your eyes on your brother .
when he become bigger than you and he worked for a someone that rewarded him with a cow , you say the tutsi has been rewarded . kill him . no other alternative
so to you see things that happened in rwanda
what happened in rwanda is from long ago
it 's beyond your imagination .
it 's beyond my imagination .
but still rwanda needs to live .
we need to live , who likes you ?
now it 's difficulty , let them free them from prison , let them come home and build for those that they destroyed for and after that they live and anyone who put his head up they put him back to jail and never let him out .
so what about the gacaca courts you know it since long ago ? how do you think it should work now days ?
the one of today , listen many of those who killed are already dead !
some of them committed suicide even mine just near here on that street they buried them here on the yard they saw that they were left and said that his old woman is going to report us and they committed suicide
but what can you really tell us so that our gacaca can go accordingly and people live together ?
mostly we want o know about he truth
truth , the truth is for them to bring the other machine
how is it like ?
it 's there do n't hide it from me , you do n't know that i am telling those who are in that camp bring them , free them and the put the machine on both sides and those who participated will be seen , and they should call me also .
really or you want to tell us in reconciling there those who were watching ?
there are those who were watching ,
or you want to tell us that the things of reconciliation there those who were observing it
there those who saw it .
on your behalf what do you think was the cause of the genocide to the people ... ?
selfishness , selfishness and wanting to have other people 's belongings , they could say , we do n't want this one , he is educated , he 's been to europe , my brother mussa twagirimana is stuck in europe .
where he went long ago when they wanted to kill him and now he is still there .
so you think most of it is based on greediness ?
it 's greediness
so for that not to happen again what can be done ?
let them come and cultivate , let them come and work those who do bad things ... have accidents , he who says that i want this or i hate this is should be taken
what advice can you give us ?
the last one , free those who say that they did n't kill , since we did n't kill let us free .
there some people who say that they did n't kill , and indeed they did n't kill , some were watching there is also my son who is in ririma son of bekerinka , also called kabanyura , he had hidden a person and later he was killed , so he was asked , people came to your home came and killed him where were you ?
he said , i do n't know it 's them who killed him , tell us who were they ? that is what has gotten him stuck in there .
and many others but those who say we did kill when they did .
but the simple like him in prison .
the great say we killed but he did n't let him stay in prison .
you told us that you managed to hide many people , how did they survive ? where did you get what to feed them ?
it 's you who did n't want me to feed you and you also see what they were eating , beans , they were eating sweet potatoes .
where did you get them ?
just nearby !
your neighbors were n't helping you to .......
gosh ! those who killed , if you said anything they would report you and thus you would have given up some one .
i could n't say a thing .
so you never asked for help from you neighbors ?
no , only one to whom i took people to .
what did you fear ?
i feared that they would report me .
how did you manage to feed these people for a month ? or they had little to eat .
but was it a month ?
it was two months the last two months .
i had beans , i had sweet potatoes . i cultivated , i was still young .
but there is also like those who used to get out and go ?
no , except the one that escaped , up to now he is in jail in gitarama because they rooted his belongings .
he was a tutsi they burnt his belongings .
at that time when he left they caught him and he gave them a bull for them to let him go so he was told to bet up a corpse .
he ran off but now his in jail yet never killed .
so his in prison only for what he accepted to do ?
yeah , that is it , after we came home from exile . it 's me who went to the government told them to come and get the corpse from my front yard .
thank you
now they are alive that is what i know , only that ill have problems with the money you give me
what happened here ? the important events to start with . the first trench .
the first trench is over there .
start with how everyone came .
ok , the first section there , there was a man who was a friend of mine who i used to build for , then i went to that side of electrogaz , they were saying that their employees were saying that they heard them say that they were going to kill him , a pastor in fact he was a chaplain shyogwe there at bishop musabyeimana , then they said how they were going to kill him but i had talked to my burundian friend who told me how frodebu used to dig holes .
i thought of hiding him and i looked for trees and dug this hole four meters deep five meter wide , and i dragged the ground like this and then i took off the ceiling of the house and i took it to the hole and covered it .
i added more dust to an extent that rain could n't penetrate through .
i went and brought him .
he gave me another man from ntogwe called emmanuel twagirayezu , and he told to come back and tell him .
after some time when i went back i found more people that had come among them was the daughter to kabiligi , ancila , she knew me we had been together in school .
she asked me to take her with me , she had two children and one of her late sister .
i brought them and put them in there to now there were five of them , a man named bugene from over there , he could always come to see me with the interahamwe and they did n't recognize any thing , they came and searched my house nothing was in it .
no one was in there and there was nothing to eat for them yet the people were out there in the hole .
then bugene with whom we went way back came of fear at to ask for refuge for his people .
at that time people who they found hiding tutsis they would kill them all , i did n't believe him i thought he was a spy .
i said no up to when he told me that he had people and he did n't know what to do with them . he told me that they were about to come and demolish his house .
i said ok if you are willing , there is no making choices on one person to another and dying was all the same if they found me with five or sixteen it 's all the same , i told him that and he helped me digging some more
what time did you dig ?
we started digging at eleven when they had stopped the patrol and we finished at two in the morning .
i removed my ceiling and we used it to cover the trench .
we ceiled it with soil and i had many .... trees and the charismas trees there i brought them used them to prepare it and then we covered it since the hole was towards that banana tree .
those who came in for searching could n't see a thing . the people were in the holes outside .
at times when it used to rain i would get them out and put them into my house even the other residences could see them but it would be raining and when the rain is almost over , i would hurry up and get them back into the holes so that no one ever saw them .
a time came when the war ended and the inkotanyi arrived they got them out and we went to the part which they had conquered .
i came back in july after the war .
in beating they must have been people spreading rumors ?
people would have said it those who saw them going for shelter , and they would say that people go for shelter in there yet after we look for them we do n't find them , that was the puzzle .
people say that some were found in there hiding , and neighbors helped you .
what can you tell us about that ?
that time when they found them , i had a big brother with some others like thomas and the citizens . they helped me and it led to nothing .
where were those whom they discovered ?
they were in this hole right here .
what caused them to be discovered ?
the daughter to murebwayire , she was tired of being in there and got out and when she saw people with machetes , she came back running and got back may be they were watching her .
the people then saw her it was like at 1 pm , they came and removed the cover .
the rpf had arrived in this area so nothing happened and no one was hurt . all the fourteen are still alive .
my name is mukarujugiro monique
i pledge allegiance to the republic of rwanda to work diligently
and fulfil the task that i am assigned with .
i swear to comply with the constitution and other laws
i will work at uniting all rwandans
that i will from heart respect the duty to fight for
rwanda without any form of discrimination
that i will never use the power i was given for my own personal benefit
i commit myself to the service of all rwandans
that if i do not fulfil this promise i will be punished by the law
may god help through this
before we continue i would like you all to stand up
in respect of all those who were victims of the genocide .
in remembrance of the outcomes of genocide everyone should come up with an initiative
so that our country comes out of such problems , thank you
you can take your seats
and then show us identification , journalist also .
i would the people in charge to check if these people are allowed to be here
the article says that a general meeting for the sector
has the responsibility to analyse the workings of the gacaca courts
in the sector , in the cell without interfering with court rulings
hold on a little bit , forgive me i told you about the general meetings
of the sector yet i wanted to tell you
about the general meetings of the cells
those who were abused by ..... those they played a part in what happened
it is said in this organic law .
the meeting is required to give evidence
and testimony against the all those suspected of genocide crimes
and others who had a hand in it
to study and pass the report made
by the gacaca court of kigali
all the locals who had a cell should explain
so that we help them reveal the truth .
we convict those who committed genocide crimes in rwanda
what we want is to live together in harmony
what 's most important so that we get to this is to put out
in the open what happened so as to give those that were victimised
their right to reveal what happened
this concerns us all .
you should take part in all the activities of the gacaca court .
made without first agreeing and exchanging
ideas , you have first priority
in gacaca courts so that the court is useful to the community
all either victims , suspects and others
in the well being of our country in the future
it 's important that you have an evident part to play
and become un corruptible and honest
crimes were committed and we saw it or were victimised
should follow the path of truth , the truth that is evident
because everyone says what they know
and be given the chance to say something
as the president f this court i promise before you
i promise that i will give everyone time
to say something
there are some articles that put in place rules and regulations governing gacaca
undefined
by raising his hand , the second
is the president gives that permission , thirdly
we should give time to those from far or travel long distances
the fourth the speaker should strive at speaking the truth
the fifth is no one should go irrelevant when given the floor
now we would like to remind those with mobile phones to help us
and turn them off so that they do not distract us
the sixth is its prohibited to mock , abuse , snicker
can have a chance to speak too . no one is allowed to bring an issue that does n't comply with the agenda
those were the 8 rules concerning requesting to speak .
everyone who does n't give or refuses to give testimony
about what he saw or what he knows as well as who gives false testimony
is tried by the court that gets hold of him
he is punished by imprisonment of not less than 3 months
up to 6 months . if there is a revisit of your case
he is punished by imprisonment starting from 6 months
to know something about a particular problem that others revealed
and remains silent
you are charged with , with holding of information
anyone interrogated about something in court
with prior knowledge that he has information on this or it is revealed
that he does but he refuses to say something
but remains silent and refuses to answer
the question asked . anyone summoned to appear in court
he is considered a liar . one who gives testimony
and adds on that he is saying is the truth and has evidence
then swears and signs for it
and its revealed that what he said was false
that he did it intentionally .
allow me to tell you that ...
giving evidence of what he knows that happened
during the genocide he lived herein gikondo
i would like to ask all the locals here
if you are aware that is a way turn yourself and confess
or to stand in for someone giving testimony
i would like therefore to ask if there is anyone who feels convicted by their hearts to turn themselves in
and confess because it has good out comes
for them and the family of rwanda
if we have time we shall give them time to confess
i would like to ask the second vice president
done before the court , let me give you the floor
fifty four , everyone who committed of the first category
of this law has the right to admit their crimes .
to confess to their crimes and ask for forgiveness .
asking for forgiveness happens in public when the oppressed are still alive .
and to the rwandan society so that the request to admit
confess and apologize may be accepted .
the accused confessing to their crimes must at first elaborate in detail
the victims and where they threw their bodies .
and the damages they caused .
to state the names of the accomplices and other felonies
in order to
confess and ask for forgiveness for the crimes committed .

or landlord , oscar who worked in rwandatel
serushyana francois ... we first left altogether then we dispatched .
he remained in the one the side and went to the one on the other side , the other side which was opposite kayijuka 's was where oscar ruzagiriza lived , and he also died .
he was killed here
i now live in nyamirambo
i would like to ask first if what i am going to say ...
there are things that i think i saw but i can not be very precise because i immediately fled
both of them and prosper are here
i am called munyeshema prosper
he is the one with whom we were together as well as my brother called semigabo mucyo emmanuel
it was brother and ruzagiriza oscar who died
yes , i would like you to swear that what you going to say will be the truth
swear saying that i so and so swear to tell whole truth and nothing but the truth
i mucyo yohana swear to tell truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
we can receive the testimony
the killing that happed i should had a number of things that preceded it before1994
before the killings
there is a day i do not remember
the day bucyana died
that time people climbed up to this area here
and as they reached here we were watching them
they had machetes small hoes and whistles
and some things that they sounded as the climbed where we lived
that time we said that , "@ but today seems to be a bad day @"
and we said that things looked bad
while we were still saying that , i do n't know where he passed
i think he will tell us something about that
people climbed up here with whistles
.....................
me and safari .
safari said "@ mucyo , what do you think of this ? @"
and i said "@ safari for you how do you see it @" he usually had news about mrd
we remained there and the assailants climbed up with whistles
and machetes , they climbed over there and when they got we had remained behind keeping watch because there was no security
i was with oscar ruzagiriza
and my brother and he jumped over the fence i fell behind
that time we had said that in case they come where shall we pass ?
that 's what happened in 1994 , that time they jumped and went across
towards the methodists but people came knocking on safari 's door
and they knocked at our door as well because that time i had n't got time to jump over
they surrounded the place there then they dispatched and attacked at ...
they must have been people who knew .... that time
....................... .........................
i do not remember because they were young men from the area one the other side
what i know is that they entered and told us that the people they stabbed were the women they found in there
they did it in a short time , and they immediately run away
at ......... they had many dogs and they started barking
they barked and those who were there started ... you see , there were people watching what was happening there ...
who they said was the representative of sdr , a short light skinned man
with a bald head , many people liked to talk about him
those who were around , will supplement in 1994
on the 6th of april in the evening , people called home
and said that the plane and been shot down , i do n't remember who called
and he said that the plane of habyarimana had been shut down
that time those with whom we were together and with whom i also lived
and we were surprised
and said that this day we might be killed or flee
then morning came , when morning came
i saw safari because i was on the side that face his home
i stood on my side and he stood at his and we talked
safari said "@ mucyo do you know what happened ? @"
that i have no peace and i said that its all of us
and he said "@ things look bad so i feel i want to seek refuge at your place
i think he 's here . maybe safari can correct me if i 'm wrong .
that this is where you can have peace , and he came
with his family
they passed .... that separated us , they refused to pass outside
that people see us entering mucyo 's
darkness fell and we put a ladder over here and they put one over there
and was followed by the wife and 2 male children
there was no one girl at the time when they came home and we stayed there together
then we called so and so is dead
that time i remember there was a relative of mine who lived in nyamirambo who they killed along with her children
so we stayed there with the workers
my relative was called francoise and worked at the hospital
and she had a husband called sevuma vicent
they lived in nyamirambo near the person with whom serushyana the owner the house in which we live stayed .
he had another house in which they stayed that serushyana in nyamirambo and in front of it is where they lived
someone called they had shot her and all her children
it was around 11 o'clock
because they lived next to each other i told him , check for me because i have been told that they have killed people there
and he told me not ask him about cockroaches
in a short while that 's when we started the car
because we said that come what may they are going to attack us
we had to pick
who are those who can come ?
so it was either oscar or my brother
because when you were at home you could see behind as we had done during the time of bucyana
it was n't outside the door , for us we were in the house
so that we know who is coming
then we would go outside and stand in the compound behind then look outside
this way and the other way on the path behind
and we keep switching , so that we would see who was coming
after a while that young man ruzagiriza and emmanuel came and said that we have heard a car , a car is coming
the car came and stood behind while they jumped over
they jumped over where they put the ladder they fell behind
the children remained there with the his wife , the children got a problem
that 's what happened and they were wondering if they should go or stay with their mother , you could see that they had a problem
they were male children , i do n't know their names but they are men now
so the shooting continued and as they shot
if we are going to die we shall not all die from here so jump over and go
"@ follow your father , " said ruzagiriza . the others had also left
i remained with his wife , i do n't know if she is around and she said that you are not leaving me
"@ i will not leave you , but if stay in the house those shooting will shoot us from here @" i said
so i told those young men "@ climb over and follow your father i looked for my brother and saw that he had left
even the boy with whom we lived had left , that when the old lady told me that mucyo you are also leaving me
i told her that i was n't going to leave her and we looked for a place , behind there was a toilet , we entered and locked
and kept quiet , then we heard a car leave
when it left ....... she told me that we should n't go out
that if you go out they will kill us , i went to look over the other fence to see what had happened
because she could not climb over the other place and fall behind
i was looking for a place where we could hide
the one who is around , etienne munyabigoga lived besides us
he still lives there , i checked again and i heard the other coming come
where i left the other lady ...... they made hard for me , they shot and shot
they shot and made things hard for me , they left and we went outside to check
when did n't any other coming back ......... @"@ where do you think we should go ? @"
i told her and that there was a place we could go to
i was thinking of mukuza 's and i told her that if you feel we can go together , come and we go
after a while that 's when they started shooting at snd
and i said there is a place we were supposed to go , if you feel we can go together , come and we go
and she said that let me leave you to go i can see the others have left so you can also look for a place to go
........ i do n't know where they took her , maybe it 's ghazi ...
but they told us that they are going to the methodists over there
that 's when we started communicating with kayije who was over there and i told him that we should leave when it 's still early , he had also called me
we planned come back when its dark
in the evening that 's what happened , that time we told prosper over there , a young man who worked for us
to go ahead and check if there were people near there
and he sloped until he reached near here .....
there is a question i would like to ask you
those cars and those who were shooting there anyone who you knew ?
there was n't anyone we knew but they told us it was an army car
they shot but we never got to know them but i do n't know if there is anyone who knew anyone
for me i did not see them because that time we were together safari 's living room
the others are the ones who kept watch outside
manuel and ruzagiriza . later we came to flee and let mukuza 's
he could n't walk ...... they told us that he was killed
they attacked mukuza 's , i do n't know where he hid
but i do n't think he died from mukaza 's , that he climbed up
and passed by etienne 's and went to hide at a place where he had hidden at the time of bucyana
i do n't know where they were hiding
my brother who is here he can say he was the one with whom they hid
my brother is called mucyo emmanuel
that what they told me , they told that he was killed there
the person who told me this was called leopold , i do n't know if he is around
leopold who worked around here , where there was a bar called leopold .
i do n't know if he is still alive , people around here can help me
we met after when was alive
we would to know if there is anyone here who knew leopold
all his names ?
people knew he lived here
we reached mille collines
they said that we might be in the ceiling , yes i had left my car and they brought fuel and set it on fire
but that time we were n't there
we were in mille collines and i called etienne 's
and it was answered by his daughter that 's when i found out that they were burning our place , that they are burning your place
but what happened there even if i was n't around , but those two young men were around
prosper and is ..... they were around and they told me that after we left there were bricks
they removed and went in between and then covered it
in that they will tell us what happened . they burnt the place and finished
they were workers
who were around and they told us what happened
we left mille collines and went to kabuga
among the people there i was able to go with my brother
to mille collines and that 's how he survived
but that young man with whom we lived ruzigiriza did not survive
i would like the people who know how he died to tell us
that 's what they told us that they threw him in a hole
another thing i heard was that among the people they burnt there were some people who lived behind
that there were some night watchmen from mironko 's
that maybe who were told to hold some things and failed , iron sheets and all
whatever i forget the others will help me
i did not see a lot there we were at makuza 's that 's when i saw people jumping out
and i felt that many people had died
and those who were not able to leave died in it
you said your house was burnt , we would like you to give us a list of anything valuable that you did not take
even that car after the genocide , i found they had thrown it over here
thank you mucyo for giving us your testimony of what you saw and heard
during the genocide who can add to what he said , what your name again ?
prosper
prosper come and give you testimony or supplement on what mucyo said
even those who have been mentioned can beg for a word and supplement
the one who starts will give his personal details , your name , parents and date of birth
i am called munyeshema prosper , i was born at gikongoro in the district of kaduha
where did you live during the genocide and where do you live now ?
at the moment i live in kicukiro near my work place at the police station
first swear before the court that what you are going to say is the truth
you say that i swear that what i am going to say is the truth
i munyeshema prosper swear that what i am going to say is the truth
that i will supplement on what he said is that after he left
they burnt the other house , after he left some came and amongst them was a man called vincent
he was led the group of attackers and they said that they should burn the house because there is no where they could have gone
we put some wooden planks up and then covered with more bricks
all his belongings , his suits , everything was taken while were watching
i would like you to name anyone you remember
if you remember where they lived then tell us , if you know their addresses you tell us so as to make things easier
the man was called vicent but i do not know where he disappeared to
another was called kijyambere or maybe donati , i do n't remember what they called him
he was called rwajekare , yes he was called rwajekare
those are the people i remember
i would like the people around not to make noise
the house was burnt while were there , then they got the car and tried to open it but failed
after failing to they pushed it then burnt it over under the road
so the house burnt up as we were in the bricks , when it got dark that 's when we pulled ourselves out and went see a man called etienne
we went to see etiene and slept there besides his car in the compound
the small one that was there , then during the day we would sleep in the kitchen but he seemed not to take this well
he was n't happy about it at all
when we realised he was n't happy what we did was
she hid us
do you know zaninka 's other name and where she lives ?
we are neighbours up there but here there is boy who might know all her names
and we lived there , after which we fled together
and went to the police post , she called an relative of hers who was called ndindiriyimana
who did you say led you to refuge ?
he was called ndindiriyimana augustin who was a soldier
in the olden days and a relative to the old lady
i continued to congo
if there were any people you knew you can tell us
this is all i can testify , i do not remember
the car lowered and turned over , after i the war i found it below safari 's house
they burnt it , then burnt safari 's house and at kayije 's
everyone who can testify to this is around even etienne
thank you , you can sign your statement
thank you , you can go back to your seat
i do not remember precisely the day they attacked
because we left on the 7th and left at night
and went to mukuza 's where we spent the day , so they must have attacked at night but there are some people who can tell us
i do n't remember it but there are some who can tell us
also i would like you tell us when ruzagiriza came back to where you lived if you remember
yes , after he jumped , i remember i remember they disturbed me when they got back
but i saw my brother here and he told them because he was the one they were waiting for
he was the one with whom they were with
we went below the church
there was a white man who lived there , he might have been the pastor
and he seemed well acquainted with safari 's sons
a pastor of which religion ?
he was the pastor of that area because he lived behind the church
the church up here which was methodist
and they told us that they were going to seek refuge there
we remained behind the fence , there was a fence made of shrubs and we remained behind it
and let them in , after a while safari also went over
and he also entered but we remained outside because they asked to wait
they came to tell us after a while ........
he entered the methodist pastor 's place ?
yes the problem was that we would all enter an they would find us and kill all of us
that 's when his son went back and closed the door
so we remained there
what was that boy 's name ?
muhirwa
its muhirwa
so we remained there till evening around 3 o'clock and that 's when the shooting started at the parliament
so we remained in hiding there , i was at 5 o'clock when te safari 's came out
and i thought that they were going to see their mother , and they immediately came back with her
they entered and we asked them if we could also enter
and they said no
then it started to become dark at around 6 o'clock
they had attacked gatera 's
we got there when they had already left , no one was there
prosper is the one who told us that they had sloped to mukuza 's .
that 's what we asked him to do , to check this path down here
to see if we can pass
he went ahead of us checking for us and we got to mukuza 's door , they opened for us and we entered
we spent 2 days there
we left there after finding out that they burnt our home and killed kayije 's children and wife
i think this is where my testimony ends
thank you . go back to your seat if there are no questions .
what jean de dieu said i agree is what happened
but there is a decision i wanted to give
that day when the shooting took place and things looked bad
i called munyengongo .... and told him that things looked bad
can i send you my children for refuge
and he replied that you are not afraid ?
there is kayije claudine , kayije francis , kayije line and kankundiye francoise
so i went looking around to make sure there would be problem along the way
i sloped with them and they got there
i stayed home with the older boys
remained with the boys kayije jules and kayije ......
and their mother mukamutara venansiya
i got to mukuza 's
and spoke to the wife saying that it would be good if you remained with the children
when we got to mukuza 's we stayed there for 2 days as mucyo said
we communicated with them by phone
i spoke to my wife on saturday mornings
we spoke and she told me that etienne told them that since we used to go out
that things were not good
and i told her to patient i will come and pick and get you in the evening
.............................................. ................................................
i would like to ask the court to stop here ......
we got to mukaza 's which we left after 2 days it must have been a saturday
and went to mille collines
we went to mille collines but because there were many people
we entered in groups , there are some people who remained who were the near cars there
that time i entered in the first group and oscar remained
they came back for the second group but he was left because there was n't enough room
would mucyo like to say something ?
i wanted to talk about where i parted with that comrade , so the rest will speak after
the car came back , the person in it asked for ose the brother to joshua
that "@ where is ose ? @"
i was next to oscar that time
i told oscar that we are the ones who were now he car is back , this is our chance
to go because this place will be attacked and it was clear that this would happen
because the interahamwe were passing below where we were in trucks pointing at us
and everyone was jumping over mukuza 's which showed that they were going to attack the place
i told him this is our chance to escape come and we go
he delayed and yet this needed to be done fast because everyone was running saying that it was only one car that had returned
also people started saying that those from kanzayire are being killed so people are jumping over the fence to mukuza 's
i stood with him and then told him "@ you see
they are going to attack this place we should look for a way to leave
others have left and might not come back and we left here @"
that we should look for a way to leave and that we met the car coming back
when it came back and said ose people sloped in big numbers so that they could get in
and i oscar that this is our only chance , if people get in before us we will not be able to leave
he fumbled around and i left , i remember at the door way and i turned around again and said , oscar you are staying here
but after he said everyone else came
that 's when he told me "@ for me i 'm leaving so you should go and if you live then you live and if i live then i live @"
where it was coming from was it supporting you ? what kind was it ? was it from the army ?
was it for a relative , what was it ?
it was a suzuki but makuza would know better
however it was a suzuki because two groups were taken and many of makuza 's cars were taken but what came back was a suzuki
i think is some else who can give a more detailed account , so honourable president can you give mucyo 's employee permission to speak
i am called udahemuka silivani and i live in kimihurura
so you should swear that you are going to say is the truth
i could say that what happened this neighbourhood as he said before the slightly genocide
happened as we were watching
me and a man named prosper lived there together
and what mucyo told us as were together there
as they tried to commit the killings we talked about it together
because the night habyarimana died he called us together in the sitting room
and told us what to do and we immediately dressed up in what we could wear at that time
about those car that came , because i could only describe what i saw i agree with prosper
..................... me and prosper hid in a small room
on the fence it was made of bricks
we cut through the bricks and entered when we saw attacking our home
there were something up and we put bricks on top and entered
when they entered the compound and there was the car of this man jean de dieu
and in the house the phone was ringing and they said without doubt these people are in this house
they tore the doors down and entered oscar 's place where they threw a grenade
we could look through a breach between the bricks and look outside .
we did not know how he died , as that man prosper said we were together with the other old lady in the house
after this man etienne betrayed us and told us to look for a place to go and leave
what happened at etienne 's place , had you sought refuge in that place ?
mucyo 's place was burnt and by evening it was properly burnt
and we saw people coming to loot while were still that house
i told prosper that this place is being looted a lot
"@ hold on etienne betrayed them and can you can you explain yourself to them ? @"
when night fell and we went to his place hoping to knock at his door because it was dark
we went to his place but decided not to knock at his door .... under a rundown truck
when we saw it was morning that 's when we knocked at their door
his wife and daughter were around and they covered us and put us in the boys quarters near the toilet behind
i would like you to give the names of his wife and daughter if you remember them
i do not remember them very well but i feel people who can help me and tell me
the wife brought us some tea and told us that they did not know that where we there and we said that we were , etienne was not around
i short while etienne came and found us there , they told him there are some boys who live with mucyo
he entered the house .... but when he got out we could already see that we were an inconvenience
after telling him this prosper got out of that boys quarter that we were in and called the old women who lived next to etienne
the old woman could get up , i do not remember her name
i do not remember it , it 's been a while
"@ old lady we have asked for assistance from etienne and he has betrayed us @" we told the old lady the problem we had
"@ come and live here there is no problem @" she said
we stayed there until someone noticed that we were the only ones left in the neighbourhood
i do n't know if that person was a relative , i do n't know if it was a friend
he was called augustin , he was the chief of staff of gendarmerie
another thing that i can add concerning the man oscar who lived next to this man
i personally when i was still with prosper that woman 's house we never left the house
but people passed outside who interahamwe running that they were going to kill people and passed above that house
i heard them say "@ that man with long legs who lived above here , we put him in a hole over there
blow the pastor 's place , " that the one who lived with the dark skinned man , and it is this mucyo jonah who they were talking about
it was oscar they had killed , when i eaves dropped on what they were saying as hid at the old lady 's place
did you see where they were going ?
i was in the house and the person i told this was prosper that they are talking about a man with long legs and dark skinned , is n't it oscar ?
what i was able to here and follow up is that
you may stop there , there are some people who have questions on what you were talking about
when he came after around 15 minutes he knew that we were around and he jumped behind the house and then into the house
and found us there and because he knew us he told us that help me and leave this place and find a place to go or something
and that when me and the man prosper came to a decision
and the youngster who worked for the man oscar because we were together
where is he ?
they shot near the house of this old lady and the people who fled . they run away and he also left
because i was into politics for a while
from 1991
hold on i would like you to introduce yourself briefly if you want to supplement
i am called safari stanely son of gashumba paul and nyirantezimana florence
i was in 1982
right now i live at kinunga in the district of gikondo , i am a senator in the senate of rwanda
i would like to be given time to give a detailed testimony
right now i will talk about what my neighbours were talking about and i will even give dates
that was the last meeting of political interests that was help in rwanda and i presided over it
there were supposed to be many people from pl especially ...
even mdr and psd who were not "@ power @" were not able because they were stopped along the way and beaten up .
they brutalised most followers , even those here in kigali were stopped
i was the stadium holding a microphone with radio rwanda around
i tried and talked to the few who were there until my throat was hoarse and i could see that i might be killed
i sent one sent one benoit living in electrogaz houses next to the stadium to call twagiramungu and agatha
to inform them that if they do not remove me from there they would kill me , they were tired to get there as well ........
that 's the last word i said that passed on radio rwanda . those in need of it can find it there { radio rwanda } they must have recorded it .
i had a brother at the university called ... who told me that he had what i said and actually he left the university that day and did not sleep there .
i slept at agatha 's and called home telling them how the situation was ; i do n't know how they handled it .
i think i came back on a sunday the 20th and on monday they shot gatabazi felician .
i remember i was in my living room and i heard my wife saying that what she said has started
the 22nd was a tuesday as honourable mucyo jean de dieu was saying
that morning , { 22nd } they killed bucyana at mbazi next to their place and behind their place .
we did not know they killed bucyana though those of snd got that place
they spent the night shooting but we were n't aware of what they shooting at ... there at kimihurura but we did not know what it was .
that when they killed at gikondo on 22 february 1994
they killed 53 people on gikondo hill
that 's when one gakwaya , a tutsi was killed and another woman next to bucyana 's place . i do n't recall their names
those counted dead on this hill of gikondo are 53 people .
maybe on 22/02/1994 , i was supposed to be the first person killed .
even gatera karipoforo , i can say that i did not know gatera was alive , he has already been sentenced to death
claiming that him and rwigema spent the night shooting in kigali town
then it 's said he heard people trying to bring ethnic divisionism
they is a way they said and you got what they want to imply
safari they were saying that they are coming to kill me at exactly 11:00
because we are interested in knowing the truth about the genocide , i want you to reveal their names
i do n't know the names of those people , but he { my brother } told me they were speaking "@ urukiga @"
my wish is for you to spell out the names you know , because it is a good example
because if others testify while not revelling the names , it will be a problem as we shall not get to the truth
he did n't tell me their names but he told me that they were speaking "@ urukiga @"
safari
safari at 11:00 ? and he answered , "@ at 11:00 @" i asked whether he has proof of what he was saying and he said "@ i 've told you you 'll be killed at 11:00 @"
i ran out of ideas and became very confused asking myself what i can do . and he told me , "@ flee @"@ . ‘ where can i go ? ’ i asked , " i do n't know @" he answered
i remember he asked me whether i had some money and i asked my wife , "@ do you have money ? @" i told her to give it to me . all the children were at home .
my daughters and sons ran to his place in remera and he gave us more money
i asked myself where i will flee to and my heart told me to go to my place of birth
i was wondering where i will pass ? what if "@ kugiti cy'inyoni @" is locked and i 'm known by the people of kimisange ?
i fought mrnd and came back here climbing there at the top next to rebero and passed through kariyeri and i came back to kamisange
your honour i 'd said that i will give a long testimony because you can see that i know a lot of things
it is then that we were attacked after he told me , i fled
i passed through the same paths i told you earlier , to that place under that .... and crossed
later they indeed attacked as he had warned me . they came home and destroyed and they broke windows
they went to gatera 's and raped one gloriose , i normally see her around .
she will tell you what happened , what i wanted was to tell you was that at that time we were attacked by people selected from here , gikondo .
i later learnt that fupi son of gakara was among the assailants . in fact i one time met him
he was among the assailants
where did you live ?
close to here at a place called salo , behind here , all residents of gikondo know it , all those you are seated know it
i knew only those who were among the attackers
i could say 53 people died in the genocide
there a times we refer to the people of 1994 together with those who died
you said that they were victims of the genocide , i would like you to explain this
they were victims of genocide because i know that despite the fact that they called it revenging bucyana , but bucyana was a sdr
cdr was a political party that openly hated tutsis with divisionism , they killed tutsis then
when w ego there , i should skip the part when habyarimana died
habyarimana died and i found out around 9 pm
i went to gatera karopoforo 's and asked him if he knew what happened and he said he did not
that the plane was shot down , "@ we should we flee to ? @" he asked and i said we could pass butamwa up to bugesera
because i have a land there and i felt the locals could help us cross over the lake
that 's what i thought at that time and he wondered whether we should go and see kayije in the middle of the night
i climbed up and woke kayije up and talked but failed to come to a decision . in the morning there was a law passed on radio that no one should leave where he is
we stayed in the house and at 11 o'clock on the 7th a woman from ndera came
"@ who told you that ? @" i asked "@ by my child in town @" she answered
i started to feel more scared and i told myself to hide at kayije 's
...... the woman told me "@ going to kayije 's , is far you see passing in front of my place up to in front of kayije 's
i can not dream of it @"@ ... the fence was there and he was also being sought after and i could not go there
up to when i felt those with whom we shared a problem were the ones i could flee to
i decided to go to mucyo , i could go twagiramungu 's with whom we were neighbours
but i never thought about it , and that 's when i fled to mucyo 's
i remember he the time he called nyamirambo tears filling his eyes
there is another time when they came to my place during the day with soldiers to kill me but did not find me there
that 's when i climbed while hiding in bushes , i think with the oscars but we did not flee together
but we did not flee to the same place , some gathered together and others did the same
they fled to the bushes ..... they gathered in the bushes and the children followed me and we gathered there
in the evening i saw someone draw the curtain
that 's what the other youngster said , a white man drew the curtain and i went ... and the children and the white man said that we should not leave the house
he called the msgr and asked "@ what 's your name ? @" i told him and he said "@ there is someone called safari who has come to seek refuge here what should i do ? @"
ruhumuriza said that if they find out that he is a round they will kill you
i think it was god who led me there .... a bag , and murenzi sloping conversing and my heart told me
you should hide there , i could see a big house behind but that 's not where i hid , i had at that one 's place
up to when i survived , honestly that is what happened , what i want to explain is that on the 7th
the 12th .... i was surprised at 10 that you are going to be killed
they attacked at another time but no one in the area was killed
i think if they had seen me they would have killed even if they had seen karipoforo they would have killed him
that what they had planned on the 22nd of february , after that date was a whole different story
they did not discriminate they killed in row , that all i wanted to add
for the methodists and when night fell they threw a grenade in it
people died in it while i was lying in the corridor and he told me to sit in the corridor with my legs straight
and i sat and he came and told me that where you refused to go , you were right they are killing people there
that 's all i wanted , to add on the testimony concerning the date 22nd
and the 7th only of april of 1994
i would like you to repeat what happened on the 22nd
there is a point where you said "@ at first you wanted to flee to kayije 's but it was far
and i went to mucyo 's @" and you added "@ i was neighbours with a man called twagiramungu
what made you do this ?
listen , he was with mugezi so do you think i could seek refuge from a man who was with mugenzi knowing that we did not agree
did not trust him because he was amongst .... people with whom we did not agree
that 's not all , even the time of bucyana they destroyed my house
during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected
during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected
i wondered could n't it be that when they come to kill the do not mistake his place for mine
that 's what i thought
on the 7th , i was at ..... it 's like we were watching them , it was the 7th of april 1994
it was around 1 o'clock because honourable mucyo had people keeping watch
because when i called him that i 'm coming to seek refuge at your place and he told that "@ do n't come forward @"
that there are people watching
because they watched us they thought we had n't gone anywhere and were still in our houses .
the day before yesterday is when i came to know this when i went to kigarama to testify .
in the gacaca court of kagarama i found out that twagiramungu who was my colleague who was my neighbour
burnt my house because they thought that i was in the ceiling but i did not know that up that day .
yes we shall call you so that give a detailed testimony .
testimonies related to the crime of rape are not given in public .
any witness ...
let 's try to restore the society .
this restores rwandan society in some way .
in order to achieve this , gacaca courts have been established as a strategy .
in gacaca courts each and every rwandan is required to tell the truth
about the genocide , what he saw , his own contribution and what he has heard of it
investigating on its implementation , perpetrators ,
as well as its damages , so that this may serve as a foundation
and then give us courage to really restore the society
in reconciling rwandans , the tripartite people
so that they may live in good relations again , so that they may live together again being aware of what had broken them up .
it is within this context that we always gather here all
in order to remind each other what happened all over rwanda
especially in rugenge sector .
during the genocide , rwandans often went to hide in places where they used to go to pray god
thinking they would find the very god who used to help them . however it was not the case ; most of time they were killed there .
those places are catholic churches and others .
particularly , many people died in sainte famille .
as you will be realizing , it remains even unknown to some that people who died in the church .
they had come to hide ; others joined them and went to the church courtyard .
some who went out were killed and others were thrown grenades at .
some were picked one after another and killed . i hope by today we will listen to
followed the events , heard , saw what was being done in this city of
kigali .
the most important thing we want to know is
the information about what happened what will help us know what i was just saying above
and lead us to reconciliation and rebuilding of our nation .
normally we want this information to be delivered in its full truth .
there are three things @: what one did , heard and saw .
among people present , there are eyewitnesses and those who just heard of things .
rwandans here present are looking forward to making known the truth and making it available to the public
as it has been said , it is made up of eighty @-@ one gacaca court members
from seven cells , the sector court and the court of appeal . that is nine times
nine is eighty @-@ one . for the moment they are to preside over the session .
i would like to let you know that this sector of rugenge
has been selected among gacaca courts trial sectors . the information collection step is already finished .
trial proceedings started some days ago what means the judges have gained some experience .
they are good at law and penalties as well as all other related issues .
as it has just been said , today is not scheduled for trial proceeding ;
the cession will be chaired by the presiding judge of the court in front of us .
in his power and wisdom , i would like to go over to him
and ask him to chair the cession as empowered by the law .
i hope you will give constructive ideas
to provide us with good and full information that will help restore our nation
and take it from the chaos it was plunged into . thank you !
it will also help us be aware of consequences of genocide and the role of each and every rwandan in order to fight against them .
thank you ! be seated please !

to insult people , attack or intimidate them . the speaker should not be brief
and give time to others .
no one should go beyond the agenda
set by the court so that we may all respect it .
here is article 29 in relation to respecting gacaca court activities @:

as well as refusal to say what one saw or knows is punishable .
one year in prison .

and kept silent , and discovered later that he really had it but did not reveal anything
or intentionally refused to answer a question asked to him ; any who will have been summoned
by the court and did not appear without reason so to avoid being asked about anything
while it is clear he @/@ she received the summon , shall be considered as having refused to give information
dishonesty is addressed during trial proceedings of the case in which
the prosecuted person gave his @/@ her testimony in case it is discovered he intentionally told lies .

anything intended to getting it involved in anything different things from its attributions be it in physical actions ,
in this respect , the president might stop any speaker who does not respect the usual way of holding speech .
when need is , the president of the cession might as well apply
article 38 in relation to rape ;
the raped person chooses among the members of the gacaca court panel .
as it has been demonstrated ; major general munyakazi , in the time , i think
he was still major ; was in charge of the gendarmerie at sainte @-@ famille . rutabana in question
is one of the people who escaped fights at gisozi . he and his colleagues came
and formed a fighter group at sainte @-@ famille . they had guns . of course they were not trained .
to explain to us his relationship with rutabana , how the two groups
were established at sainte @-@ famille , how people were killed .
that is the reason why we have called him as a witness .
we have not called him for trial .
unfortunately , he received the invitation belatedly whereas he himself had asked
to share with us some experiences at the level of nyarugenge district . now , we may go over to him .
in case he is needed somewhere else such as in cells , such institutions will invite him
on their own .
without delaying , we go over to him .
the floor is his . he should start by what he did .
eeh thank you gacaca court panel members ! my name is .........
major general munyakazi . i was born in kinihira district
in 1954 , i am married to
mukamanzi monica with one child . i am in charge of the second division
operating in byumba , mutara and kibungo .

try to be slow in your speech
the first thing i want to highlight is that
genocide started in 1959 and kept being planned and executed by the government of rwanda .
i mean the governments of rwanda during the time of mdr parmehutu and mrnd .
i will show how the genocide of tutsis was planned and executed
from october 1st , 1990
to the 4th 1994
from the first october 1990 to november 1991
the president of the republic was habyarimana juvenal
the government was made by of ministers who were all from mrnd .
from december 1991 to april 1992 ,
the president was still habyarimana juvenal , the then government headed by
nsanzimana was made of mrnd and pdc .
from april 1992 to july 1994 ,
the president was habyarimana juvenal and the government headed by nsengiyaremye
the president was habyarimana juvenal and the government headed by uwiringiyimana
was made of mrnd , mdr , pl psd and pdc .
from 6th 1994 to july 4th 1994 ,
the president was sindikubwabo , and the government was headed by kambanda .
i also want to show you that after the government exiled , it kept on
attacking rwanda in order to resume genocide from where it stayed in the time .
i also want to show you strategies used to make possible these killings in rwanda .
i will show as well , in my testimony , that the killings that started on april 6th had been planned .
as you may have just realized it , i saw all of that all along different services i was involved in . this is what i am about to tell you right now .
the period going from 1959 to july 1st 1962 @:
during the period going from 1959 to july 1st 1962 the genocide of tutsis was carried out by mdr parmehutu , aprosoma using hutus so far considered as the majority .
the then policy aimed at chasing tutsis out of the country and exterminating them .
the genocide of tutsis started in 1959 .
many books show that the killings started in the very period .
yes , the genocide took place but neither the un nor foreign countries took appropriate measures to punish the perpetrators in that time .
during the period going from july 1st 1962 to october 1st 1990 the genocide was carried out by the government of rwanda with mdr parmehutu and mrnd .
the government established the policies briefly detailed as follows @:
it established the politics of exclusion aiming at chasing tutsis out of the country in 1962 , 1963 , and 1973 .
in 1982 , the then government of rwanda refused the repatriation of rwandan refugees living in uganda .
the government of rwanda raised troops at the boarder in order to shoot at refugees intending to come back . this is real .
the genocide of tutsis took place but neither the un nor foreign countries took appropriate measures to prosecute those who carried it out .
please sir , we would like to ask you the copy of what you are telling us and start precisely from 1994 on april 7th to the 31st 1994 .
please , i beg you not to muddle up my message !
i need to be calm because there is a logical sequence of events in it . this is just an introduction . i am soon starting october 1st 1990 .
i only still have two lines .
i think you are getting my point @: i must provide explanations about the period going from october 1st 1990 to 31st and i have to introduce it .
i would like to go on , if you allow it , without dropping out this introduction .
we need to work together so to follow our programme
we have told you three things to talk about @: what you did , what you saw and what you heard .
you will start by what you did . if there is not tell us there is n't or you will ...
from 1959 , the government favored killers of tutsis . in other words , it enthroned impunity toward any who kills a tutsi in rwanda .
the government of rwanda and mrnd , the then leading party , refused the repatriation of refugees .
as you 've just asked me to , i am now going to tell you what i saw and heard , in the following lines .
i mean the three points you asked me to develop .
the government of rwanda in power since 1st 1990 till december 1991
had major general habyarimana juvenal as the president of the republic and ministers from mrnd as it had been for many successive governments by the way .
the genocide of tutsis started on october 1st 1990 .
the extermination of tutsis started being put into practice on october 1st 1990
the government of rwanda and mrnd , the then leading party , started killing tutsis in rwanda because every rwandan and all leaders at all levels adhered to mrnd hence had to execute the orders from the mrnd central committee and its president .
on october 1st 1990 , the strategy of bringing fake accusations against tutsis started being used by the government of rwanda and mrnd who faked the charge of betrayal against tutsis so that hutus might exterminate them in very short time under pretext that tutsis who were in rwanda collaborated with inyenzi hence had to be arrested and killed .
tutsis were wrongfully accused of keeping guns and bullets to kill hutus all over rwanda .
they were wrongfully accused of keeping inyenzi 's guns and bullets and having transmitting and receiving sets to communicate with inyenzi .
all this intended to arresting and killing them . it was said that , in their murderous operations , tutsis had identity cards model iv drawn and printed in sisi evariste 's printing house
so that inyenzi might kill hutus who had identity cards model iii .
tutsis were also wrongfully accused of having dug graves in their houses in which to bury hutus after killing them .
the government of rwanda headed by habyarimana lied to rwandans and foreign countries that the rwandan army had just beaten inyenzi and their accomplices having invaded kigali and that the invaders had been caught with their guns and many bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets .
it added that in case one needed proofs would go to see them at gikondo police station .
in kigali , the arrested people were taken to nyamirambo stadium and had to be killed in the shortest future because they had been called the enemies of the whole country .
here is the high @-@ ranking staff of far ( forces armees rwandaises ) [ rwanda army forces ] similar to one of the unities in kigali .
in the president 's office , the president was habyarimana whose private secretary was sagatwa .
in the military intelligence , there were such people as nuwayezu and simbikangwa .
the commander of the republican guard was lieutenant @-@ colonel nkundiye . all of them were from gisenyi .
g3 @: lieutenant @-@ colonel rwabarinda and g4 major ngirumpatse .
the gendarmerie staff was headed by the gendarmerie chief @-@ staff and army chief @-@ staff habyarimana , the mrnd president .
the gendarmerie deputy chief @-@ staff was colonel rwagafirita who was also the president of the central committee .
g1 @: colonel ngayinteranya , g2 @: lieutenant @-@ colonel rutayisire , j3 @: colonel hakizimana and g4 @: major nsanzimfura .
here are unities operating in kigali @: the commander of kanombe military camp was colonel bagosora , battalion commander was major ntabakuze , junior battalion commander was major ntibihora , the ordnance commander was mutabera , colonel bagosora , base commander was major nubaha and the head of health department was lieutenant @-@ colonel baransabitse .
esm ( ecole superieure militaire ) [ senior military academy ) : the director was colonel buregeya ; the air force department was headed by colonel ntahobari ; in kami military camp there was bararwerekana ; in kigali military camp , major ntizigirwa whereas kacyiru military camp was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nyuragabo and the mobile group by major rwarakabije .
in october 1990 , colonel rwagafirita who was a member of mrnd central committee and gendarmerie deputy chief staff always said that all tutsis living in rwanda had to be killed because they were the enemies of the country and accomplices of inyenzi .
according to them , all tutsis had to be arrested and killed in the shortest future without any trial . he always said that and it was realized that he told it french confirming that tutsis were in small number , that they would easily be killed .
he said it in the parliamentary report submitted to general jean valle who was in charge of the french military commission .
he [ general jean valle ] also told the commission that he had known this from rwagafirita himself .
in october 1990 , colonel serubuga who was a member of the central committee and rwandan army chief staff said that he had just found the alibi to kill all tutsis on october 1st all over rwanda .
he always said that , confirming that tutsis were the enemies of the country .
he even said it to french in his own words that tutsis would all die .
it is clearly stated in the parliamentary commission report that the then ambassador to rwanda said that he had been told those words by colonel serubuga .
clearly both colonel serubuga and colonel rwagafirita who commanded the army and gendarmerie headquarters had already told french that tutsis would be killed .
even in october 1990 the then defense attache colonel rene darny wrote in his report that seven hundred thousand tutsis would die in rwanda in such a way that the issue was raised in the french parliamentary report .
the reason why people were not exterminated in 1990 as it had been planned is that other countries and embassies put pressure on habyarimana and obliged him to release people showing that they were innocent .
when they went to gikondo police station , they realized that the guns , transmitting and receiving sets were just a story invented to put fake accusations on tutsis .
that is why i wanted to deeply explain this problem in order to make you understand well .
during all this time , that government carried out genocide of tutsis .
it carried out the genocide of tutsis in october 1990 in mutara and byumba . it carried out the genocide of tutsis in january 1991 in kibirira , gisenyi and the genocide of bagogwe in january 1991 in ruhengeri and gisenyi .
other countries started denouncing those killings by the government of rwanda .
however , the government of rwanda and mrnd refused the agreement of nsele signed on march 29th 1991 and kept planning the extermination of tutsis in rwanda .
from october rpf had always denounced that genocide of tutsis carried out by the government of rwanda and headed by mrnd for successive terms .
mrnd members were present in all positions in the government of december 1991 till april 16th 1992 .
the president of the republic was major general habyarimana , the prime minister was nsanzimana and ministers were mrnd members .
the prime minister was from pdc .
the government still rejected agreements and went on planning the extermination of tutsis in rwanda .
the government of rwanda kept on killing people and in march 1992 there was the genocide of tutsis in kibirira , gisenyi , in bugesera , and kigali ngali .
the government formed on april 16th 1992 and reshuffled in july 1993 had major general habyarimana juvenal as the president of the republic and nsengimana as the prime minister .
this government was made up of ministers from different political parties @: mrnd had 9 , mdr 3 , psd3 , pl 3 , and pdc 1 .
from march to june 1992 , the president of the republic habyarimana , the government headed by nsanzimana , and the government headed by nsengiyaremye kept carrying out the genocide of tutsis in gisenyi and elsewhere in rwanda , as i have just demonstrated it above .
rpf asked the government of rwanda to cease the killings and decided to stop the genocide in rwanda .
the government of rwanda accepted to stop killings in bugesera , kigali ngali . the government and rpf signed arusha agreement on july 12th 1992 .
mrnd , cdr and some officers in favor of mrnd were not happy about the agreement of the 10th and 30th october 1992 and 9th january 1993 concerning the power sharing in the government .
they accused minister ngurinzira from mdr of being rpf 's accomplice since he had granted to rpf the ministries before occupied by mrnd .
those ministries were the ministry of interior , the ministry of transport , the ministry of health , and the ministry of youth .
in january 1993 , the president habyarimana and mrnd continued the genocide of tutsis in kibirira and kibuye .
on february 4th 1993 , rpf asked the auo [ african union organization ] to tell the government of rwanda to stop the genocide of tutsis in gisenyi , kibuye and all over rwanda .
it also said there was enough force to protect rwandans who were being killed not later than three days from then
rpf did it and on february 8th 1993 it decided to start the war intended to stop genocide all over rwanda .
mrnd refused to go to bujumbura and continued the plan of exterminating tutsis in rwanda .
on march 7th 1993 dar @-@ es @-@ salaam communique signed between rpf and the government of rwanda was issued .
as you know , mrnd and cdr rejected the dar @-@ es @- salaam communique and continued their project of exterminating tutsis in rwanda .
the government in power from july 1993 to april 6th 1994 comprised major general habyarimana as the president of the republic , uwiringiyimana agatha as the prime minister , 9 ministers from mrnd , 3 from mdr , 3 from psd , 3 from pl , and one from pdc .
on august 4th 1993 , rpf and the government of rwanda signed arusha peace agreement .
after the signing of arusha agreement , mrnd and cdr continued to refuse the agreement of power sharing with rpf .
during that time , mrnd and cdr continued to stay away from those agreements and maintained their programme of exterminating tutsis and rejecting agreements as well as training and equipping their militias .
after august 4th 1993 , mrnd , cdr , alongside mdr power and pl power , continued the programme of exterminating tutsis . the president habyarimana refused the establishment of the transitional government and national assembly .
the government would have 21 ministers and the national assembly 71 deputies .
the president habyarimana was afraid that 48 of 71 deputies would make decisions and that 14 of 21 ministers would decide as well .
that is why he wanted to have 1/3 plus one person .
in the national assembly there would be 11 deputies from mrnd and other 13 of whom he thought 6 would come from mdr power , 5 from pl power and 2 from other parties .
5 ministers would come from mrnd , 3 from mdr power and 1 from pl power .
the part of far on the side of mrnd , cdr , pl , mdr power supported mrnd 's , cdr 's , pl power 's , and mdr power 's militias in such a way that it supplied them in war equipment to use in the war of exterminating tutsis in rwanda
those protocols of agreement of october 10th 1992 and january 9th 1993 talked about power sharing .
the protocol of agreement of august 3rd talked about power sharing in national army and gendarmerie .
there were some soldiers who said they could not work with tutsis and inyenzi in the national army and gendarmerie .
from 1960 to december 1993 , people from gisenyi and ruhengeri constituted the majority in far and occupied very important positions in all domains in far .
they were not happy about hearing that the government headed by agatha uwiringiyimana would demobilize their officers due to the principle that had just been set in relation to sharing 12 positions among 11 prefectures of rwanda .
the government headed by uwiringiyimana agatha decided that each prefecture would have one place except gisenyi that would have two .
this decision caused discontent in soldiers from gisenyi and ruhengeri who turned against the prime minister uwiringiyimana agatha given that those decisions had been made at the level of every prefecture .
rwandan army 's seats to transitional government were shared as follows . rwandan army ruhengeri @: chief staff a1 major general nsabimaana ; byumba @: brigadier commander colonel bizimungu ; kigali city @: brigadier commander colonel gatsinzi ; kibungo @: deputy brigadier commander lieutenant @-@ colonel sebuhire ; butare @: deputy brigadier commander major gasarabwe .
national gendarmerie in gikongoro @: colonel rutayisire ; deputy chief staff in cyangugu @: major bavugamenshi ; kibuye formation commander @: lieutenant @-@ colonel nzapfakumunsi ; kigali formation commander @: major nsanzimfura ; gitarama formation commander @: commander ndereyimana ; gisenyi formation commander @: major munyarugerero and major nzabonimpa had been appointed .
from january 5th 1994 , after the president habyarimana swore , there was a bad atmosphere in politicians and far soldiers .
on 8th january 1994 interahamwe of mrnd , impuzamugambi of cdr as well as other young men of mdr power made a march in kigali city and at cnd showing their strength and that they would exterminate tutsis who lived in rwanda .
in the government in power from june 4th 1994 to july 4th 1994 , the president was sindikubwabo and the prime minister kambanda .
in the night of 6th to 7th april , the government of rwanda headed by kambanda that was composed of mrnd , mdr power , pl power and others continued to plan and carry out the genocide of tutsis all over rwanda which cost more than one million lives between april and july 4th 1994 .
the strategies that was prepared since october 1990 .
on april 7th 1994 , rpf inkotanyi decided to stop the genocide . on 4th rpf inkotanyi stopped rwanda 's genocide , they stopped the genocide all over rwanda .
strategies used to exterminate tutsis include blacklisting them in order to kill them . here is the problem you usually encounter probably .
i am going to tell you all of that because i have come here for that .
blacklisting tutsis and bringing fake accusations against them so that they get killed by hutus , publication of ten commandments of hutus so to make the latter hate and then kill tutsis , convincing hutus at all levels that any tutsi living in rwanda or in exile is an enemy that needs killing , setting barriers in all paths even in cells all over rwanda so to hunt every tutsi and prevent him from escaping , searching houses in order to find where tutsis might be hiding so kill them ,
giving out guns in the population of all communes all over rwanda which guns were to be used in order to exterminate tutsis , establishing militias interahamwe of mrnd and impuzamugambi of cdr intended to kill tutsis on the barriers and where they might be hiding , training interahamwe and impuzamugambi in order to invade houses of religious people of the catholic church , churches and schools where tutsis might have gone for escape so kill them in a very short time .
convincing hutus that they are above tutsis and that killing the latter , raping tutsi women , burning their houses , seizing their property shall not be punished in rwanda . blacklisting tutsis was a strategy that started being used since 1961 and 1973 by mdr parmehutu .
the method was also used by mrnd chaired by habyarimana juvenal on october 1st 1990 . the president 's office had an intelligence department that kept the lists of tutsis to be caught and killed at once because inyenzi had invaded rwanda .
i think i have already told you that on october 1st 1990 , the government of rwanda used the strategy of charging tutsis of fake accusations in order to abuse their reputation .
i will repeat it because the very accusations took four years .
no , people are making noise . you may tell them to keep quiet !
please hold on ! hold on please !
remember the instructions we have already read .
let him finish .
on september 21st 1992 , chief staff nsabimaana told soldiers in the army that every tutsi living in rwanda was an enemy .
this ideology had already existed since 1963 and had just been put into writing by the army staff .
political parties such as mrnd , cdr , mdr power , and pl power with their lists had convinced their members that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed .
in order to locate the enemy and prevent him from escaping , barriers were set in all paths in cells of rwanda .
houses and bushes were also searched to se where a tutsi might be hiding and kill him .
this method was used since april 6th 1994 till july 4th 1994 and cost many lives of tutsis in rwanda
because the population in cells was ordered to settle on the barriers , be on patrol all nights looking for a tutsi in order to kill him .
this method was called self and common defense . this was just fancying other countries so that they might not denounce it but the method was actually intended to exterminating tutsis in rwanda since it had been put that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed .
guns had also been given out since october 1st 1990 . the guns intended to exterminate tutsis .
the establishment of mrnd and cdr militias was illegal as far as rwandan law was concerned .
interahamwe and impuzamugambi were also trained . from 1959 , tutsis had been escaping to houses of religious people , churches and schools of the catholic church and could survive
because the population feared to kill tutsis in those houses .
mrnd and cdr trained interahamwe and impuzamugambi to attack those houses , churches and schools of the catholic church and kill in very short time the tutsis in .
now here is what i saw at goma when i was exiling with far people though people may say that is not necessary , i am afraid ...
april , june 1994 till july 3rd 1994 , officers who were in the army and gendarmerie staff command are the following @: in the time bizimana was not in rwanda .
bagosora was the principal private secretary .
in the army staff command , there were regions . mutara region was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel karyabwite and byumba region by bizimungu replaced by lieutenant @-@ colonel ruvugabagabo .
gisenyi region was commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nsengiyumva whereas rusimo was under nkwiyekubona .
butare was commanded by gatsinzi later replaced by muvunyi , gitarama by lieutenant @-@ colonel habufite , bugesera by ntabakuze .
nyanza was under gasarabwe , cyangugu musonera , and kigali region was commanded by colonel muberuka whereas overall command1 was under colonel ndahimana and command12 under nkwiyekubona .
in the capital kigali , there were many unities and commanders @: one for kimihurura military camp , one for kigali military camp , one for kanombe military camp , one for esm , one for muhima military camp , and another for kacyiru military camp .
killings .
political parties such as mrnd , cdr , mdr power , pl power and governmental administration kept conspiring in the capital kigali .
as far as the killings of tutsis from october 1st 1990 to december 31st 1994 are concerned , the reaction was that all reports showed that those killings were carried out by the government of rwanda together with far , authorities at all levels as well as a big number of the population .
i was the head of central record @-@ keeping from october 2nd 1990 in the capital kigali .
in my duties , i drew a report to the gendarmerie chief staff and the minister of defense saying that i had not caught a single tutsi with model iv identity card so far said to be held by all tutsis in rwanda , what was just an invented story .
the second thing i did is that i drew a report saying that we found no spool neither in sisi evariste 's printing house at kicukiro nor in other tutsis accused of keeping them and giving them out in tutsis so that inyenzi might distinguish them from hutus .
those accusations had been brought by the central intelligence department of the president 's office .
munyakazi munyakazi i drew a report saying that there was no gun found , illegally possessed by a single tutsi because there were tutsis who possessed guns that they had been given by the government
i reported that no gun stores , bullets , transmitting and receiving sets were found in tutsis ' houses . i also went to gikondo police station . i found out that the guns showed to be taken from tutsis were worn and greased .
they were kept in small stores of the rwandan army . we asked gendarmes who were around . they told us that the guns had been brought by gd soldiers commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nsengiyumva . we met there some agents from embassies who had come to see the guns
i handed it in to habyarimana 's regime
is it before the war ?
yes , before ! i told you that it was on 4th and 6th .
that is the time when we met agents from embassies , which started putting pressure on habyarimana saying he was bringing fake accusations against tutsis in order to have the alibi to kill them .
i do n't know whether you are through so that we may ask you another question !
not yet . i 'm still developing what you have asked me about ....
try to tackle questions you 've been asked @: what you did personally .
of course that is what i did personally !
that was just reports ! what would you tell us about the genocide ?
did you do anything ?
on april 6th 1994 i was the commander of muhima military camp and kigali mobile group commander . the mobile group was a unity of the national gendarmerie in charge of protecting radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef .
i say it once again @: as the mobile group commander , my duty was to protect radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef . as the commander of muhima military camp , i had to protect muhima military camp .
do i answer your question about what i did ?
what i did as the mobile group commander is to give the order to gendarmes to protect radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef as well as the population and religious people who were in saint @-@ michel cathedral .
go on
in saint @-@ michel cathedral ....
you have just said what you did and the duties of gendarmes under your command .
now we want to know ; what was your role in all that ? you have absolutely said you did not do anything wrong . would you explain to us ?
in saint @-@ michel cathedral ... in saint @-@ michel cathedral ... the gendarmes under my command succeeded to protect all the people who escaped to saint @-@ michel cathedral .
i protected religious people and all others who came there .
displaced people who were at gisimba 's were taken from nyamirambo to saint @-@ michel cathedral because it was known that it was protected by gendarmes under the command of lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
let him talk so to explain what we will ask him .
you are allowed neither to laugh at him nor to acclaim what he says be it false or true . you shall be given the floor when need is !
i now go to something else ; as the commander of muhima military camp .
at one time , nyarugenge territory company came to settle next to muhima military camp . it used to stay in the police 's place today .
though nyarugenge territory company belonged to kigali formation , i gave them orders .
i ordered captain nyiribambe to go and protect the people who were in hotel de mille collines , in sainte @-@ famille church , in saint @-@ michel cathedral , i beg your pardon !
it is rather saint @-@ paul centre and lycee notre dame de citeaux .
the gendarmes of the company protected hotel de milles collines . they were with lieutenant @-@ colonel mwangi of minuar .
on june 27th , the army staff command displaced people who were ... those who had stayed were displaced pretending that other activities were to be established there .
it was said french would come to settle in kigali .
in that time , the territory company had no responsibilities because the hotel had just been seized by rwanda army staff command
on the 10th , hotel de milles collines was repeatedly attacked by interahamwe militias because it sheltered people called rpf accomplices .
however , the gendarmes of the company together with the mobile group who were at hotel de milles collines , as i told you , fought against interahamwe
on june 17th 1994 , the interahamwe militias came in a very big number and succeeded to enter the hotel . they broke doors and started getting people down in order to kill them .
i was called and i went there . i found two families that had just been taken to the reception desk to be killed .
i may even tell you the families so that you may ask them yourself .
there was the family of murindangabo embroise and one of habiyakare . they all saw that i was coming for their help
when i was at hotel de milles collines on 17th , there was father uwimana the priest of saint @-@ andre parish who had escaped to saint @-@ paul center but went to hotel de milles collines after .
he saw me at the hotel ; i even gave orders to go for help to people who were at saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille and chase interahamwe who were going there to kill them .
father uwimana told me @: "@ i can see that you still have a human heart to help people . i want to beg you one thing ; i want you to go for help to people who are at saint @-@ paul center who are going to get killed by interahamwe . they are at father vermerie 's @"@ . they were sitting down in the caves at bishop vermerie 's .
he had been with the people in saint @-@ paul all the day , refused to be taken with others and went to bring fake accusations against me in the church saying that i was going to kill those i had taken with me .
all those people are still alive . investigations have proven that . they are all alive .
because i was at saint @-@ michel cathedral , on 18th and 19th i was asked by priests to take saint @-@ vincent and assumption sisters as well as religious brothers who were in procure and bring them to saint @-@ michel cathedral so that they might stay together .
i took all of them to the cathedral . nothing bad happened to them . they are all alive , invite them ; they will tell you . i did not harm them .
meanwhile , the gendarmes i had transferred to saint @-@ paul center and sainte @-@ famille had another duty given to them .
it had not been evoked but we have to evoke it for the moment . displaced people comprised two parts @: there were displaced people who were for the government outside the church , to the primary school and to joc .
these ones could walk without any problem .
there were others who were hiding in the church and saint @-@ paul center who could not have neither food nor water .
father hakizimana , praised for having helped a lot displaced people , together with father galican as well as other priests they were together , told me the problem .
they said that they sheltered displaced people but did not have means to get water and food .
there were interahamwe there and they could not leave so to bring food from caritas stock at nyamirambo , saint @-@ andre and ... the place where the church built a very big house
they asked me to give them gendarmes to help them get food for displaced people .
i accepted that gendarmes at saint @-@ paul center and sainte @-@ famille went to fetch water for the displaced people .
they even went to bring food for them . even though these things are not often evoked the priests who were there may tell you that the gendarmes did that work .
something else i did as far as helping people is concerned is running a secret operation with father hakizimana . in our secret operation , we were well @-@ suited that the food would be taken from sainte @-@ famille stock and sent to king faycal hospital and hotel meridien through red cross because there was no food .
we wanted to secretly take the food from caritas stocks at nyamirambo and bring it in the area controlled by rpf . we would proceed like that .
we did it exactly that way .
priests who present , that is the secret . you have been asking what we did .
i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , accepted to send in a deep secret the food eaten by people in king faycal , in hotel meridien . even my seniors asked me about that and i denied it because it was a very deep secret . you can see that i was a good @-@ hearted man ; i did not even want people to starve
do you think you are through ?
have you said that the mobile group at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ...
definitely !
was n't it that way ?
i gave orders
alright !
before that , i want to start by the reason why we had invited you though you did not get the invitation ....
i did not get it
we want to know your relationship with ... as you explained , there were two groups at sainte @-@ famille .
one of gendarmes of course under your command , and another of the population who were armed . was n't it that way ? did you explain it that way ?
you had the responsibility to protect people as you said . how come that there were armed people killing others who were running away because of their ethnic group ? i think you all know that . you have also explained it .
before we get deep into the matter , we would like to ask you about rumors about you so that you may say something about it as well .
would you say something about your relationship with armed people who had escaped from fights at gisozi ? these people set barriers in roads and arrested people who went to sainte @-@ famille in order to kill them .
how can you explain it given that your protection did not save lives since all people who were at sainte @-@ famille died ?
you shall explain to us the above relationship and tell us the importance of your gendarmes considering that people died every single day .
i am afraid you have not understood me well ! i told you that i commanded the mobile group .
i also told you that the mobile group watched over saint @-@ michel cathedral . do you get me ?
i told you there was no problem at saint @-@ michel cathedral .
i told you that the gendarmes protected the population there . whether gendarmes went there from time to time , whether they were connected with them , captain ntirugiribambe may explain it to you better . i ensure you that i had no connection with the interahamwe who attacked sainte @-@ famille church and saint @-@ paul center .
do you accept that many people died at saint @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul sir ?
of course ! i do know that people died there
so , the task you had given to your gendarmes was to protect who exactly ?
the population , yes i know !
which population ?
one that had escaped there
in the church and at saint @-@ paul center ?
isn ’ it ?
tell me first what those reports are so that i may have the idea of those accusations brought against me as you are saying .
i just wanted to explain to you so to have the same understanding of things .
this is not a trial . it is just information collection
you have just said yourself that this is not a trial !
on june 17th , i read in newspapers that i headed the interahamwe 's attack to sainte @-@ famille .
it is impossible @: at that time , rpf had carried out an operation and took people from saint @-@ paul . the interahamwe became angry and decided to attack all institutions .
they attacked hotel de mille collines , sainte @-@ famille church and tried even to attack saint @-@ michel cathedral .
as a commander , i already told you what i did . i was told that the doors of hotel de mille collines had just been broken and that people had already been taken up to the reception desk .
this was my reaction @: i quickly ran from muhima military camp to hotel de mille collines .
i immediately brought the interahamwe 's attack to heel and the very gendarmes chased the interahamwe who were taking people from sainte @-@ famille church and making them enter the procure .
you can see well that saying i headed the attack is pure lies because i was at hotel de mille collines . here are even people who saw me . i can see them here . there is uwimana and others . i was not part of that attack ; i was at hotel de mille collines .
we would like to ask you a question sir !
still about saint @-@ michel , can you really confirm that no single individual died there ? i know one who died there . his name was semuhungu . he worked in the national bank ... i mean banque de kigali .
i think he first worked in banque de kigali and shifted to the national bank after .
the man died there .
okay , let 's just forget about that one . let 's come back to the issue of sainte @-@ famille .
you have just confirmed that you saved people who were in saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines because the gendarmes could protect them . why did n't the gendarmes protect sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul center and let such people die ? talk about that that very minor issue then we give the floor to the audience and listen to their views .
i told you that the gendarmes i sent to mille collinnes , sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul belonged to the nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation .
do you mean that protecting sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul were not within your duties ?
they were under nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation
who was the responsible ?
each formation had its own commander
what was his name ?
his name was lieutenant @-@ colonel kanimba . he was there temporarily but he normally belonged to kacyiru military camp
what about what you said that you once arrived at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ?
of course i did
did n't you realize anything strange ?
i was with father uwimana from hotel de mille collines . we went together to father veneche 's and we carried people who were hiding at father ... bishop veneche 's in the pickup . this took us two rounds of times .
please sir !
we learnt from the case of a prisoner going by the name of rutabana that he killed one 186 people picked from the church where gendarmes settled . there was a barrier too ; can you tell us that you really arrived there ?
i arrived at saint @-@ paul and mille collines !
do n't you think you can explain those things to us ?
i mean the 186 people killed on that day .
you know ... when only one person dies the whole area can get informed in one day .
did you never know anything ?
explain to us !
i told you that i was at hotel de mille collines .
by the way , why are people shouting when i am explaining ?
they should keep quiet .
keep quiet ! we are about to give them the floor .
we only want you to explain that minor issue .
in the testimonies you received people said that i headed the attack !
i told you that on june 17th i was at hotel de mille collines . we had been fighting the interahamwe there all along the day . from there i went with father uwimana to pick people from father veneche 's .... bishop veneche 's . i carried them in two rounds in my pickup .
surprisingly , mp rugema said that i was going to kill them .
there were your gendarmes
i did n't know it
eeh ... i got it ! the man and his family died . he lived near saint @-@ michel
according to the report i had from the priests , no one of the people who had escaped to saint @-@ michel cathedral died . i was told that .
let 's go on !
let 's give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . you have actually talked about everything . let 's now listen to the population ; you will get their views as well
allow me to add something !
try to be brief
in a word , i would like to ask you to carefully investigate this case .
some days earlier , at the tenth anniversary july 2004 , all the survivors who were living in that area praised the government authorities for having saved them .
their representative said @: "@ you should also thank also lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi who came to us for help @"@ . you may make noise yes , but i am not lying ! the division commander who delivered the message is here himself ; he might explain it to you .
it is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . the very people who were praising me just some days ago !
i did not mean to accuse you , sir !
they have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me .
that is a good thing . any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it .
i have not said that people must accuse you . we only have to let the two sides speak . we go to the court panel first and listen to their views .
you said that you gave orders .
did you give orders and did not follow them up ?
the problem arises there . more than 180 people died but you did n't know it . however , we know that when a person dies of a car accident in an area , we all come to see .
as a high @-@ ranked rwandan in the time , you should have known that .
you should have known what your colleagues were doing . tough the territory company was commanded by someone else , you had enough power yourself . you can see that we did not get the point well .
i think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you .
he also reminded you that , as a leader , you should have known the death of the people you have been asked about . that is his point .
we go over to someone else
thank you mister president . according to the information we have ... there is a prisoner called rutabana who told us that you usually used to come to sainte @-@ famille with father munyeshyaka and that you were aware of all the things the prisoner could do . i want to ask you mister munyakazi ; do n't you think you might have forgotten that information and that you have just been reminded ?
it is also said that you might have taken some bodies and that the place where you took them is still unknown . you may also tell us about that . thank you !
thank you .
i never drove that red bus .
i had a white hilux pickup . even my driver belonged to the national gendarmerie . i never travelled in the red bus . you can see it is someone else they are talking about not lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
let 's forget about that ; the red bus never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
no this is a trial . it is being proceeded right now !
it is not a trial . he has just asked his question in his own way but this is not a trial .
that question must remove all confusions . the red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
the second thing i did n't mention , i guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , is that i see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas i did my best to protect them .
once saint @-@ famille church was being fired at . i myself went to sainte @-@ famille church to console the population . we took sick people and they went to be treated in red cross infirmary . red cross was chaired by kayiranga in the time .
i never travelled in the red car . remove that accusation completely .
that is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , sir ! of course if it is one .
we have not come for trial . you should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself .
you are asking me what you 've been told though .
of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial .
i go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well .
court panel according to rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp
it was not an accusation . he just wanted to know .
food can not be an accusation because everyone eats .
he is saying i and the interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people .
court panel i want to ask a question . mister colonel munyakazi has just examples such as mille collines , sainte @-@ famille , and saint @-@ paul and he tried to help rwandans everywhere .
probably he was doing that during the day . i would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action .
thank you !
right !
about that question ... do you mean rwandan journalists or foreign ones ?
about that question ... about that question ... from 1992 ... from 1994 ... if you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people .
all of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living .
however if you read the book le droit de vivre by hibert , you can see that book shows well that hotel de mille collines was protected by gendarmes according to the investigations . that is why people did not die there . that is what the book says
there was an american who was with gisimba 's displaced people in saint @-@ michel cathedral . we had taken him from nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral .
even gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major karangwa
unfortunately this is not evoked .
for the time being , however , people should know the action took place . when people arrived there , some were even told not to say they had been saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi because he would be charged of killings later . fortunately there are gacaca courts ; you have given me the opportunity to tell you that i had given orders to the gendarmes of hotel de mille coliines .
i had given orders to people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . i also gave orders to gendarmes to go and fetch water and bring food . you have known that too . you can see that i did not intend to plot against tutsis
yes sir , that was perfect . what you did at mille collines was perfect ! what you did is also recognized .
just because of the power you had in the time , we get curious and worried and we are obliged to ask you questions in order to know .
we would also like to ask you to stand appropriately in front of the court panel . this is because people fear even to ask due to your dignity .
no , by standing appropriately i do not mean standing that way .
; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity . they have said you are an important person so they have much respect for you .
if you feel tired you may even sit down so that they may ask you .
you know sir ... may the court panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in kigali . however , i had prepared it . i hope you will allow me that .
when you check well that structure and see how i did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area .....
this is not a trial . the other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened .
so , we want you to provide us with explanations . this is not a trial . it is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . we are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . we give the floor to someone else
court panel thank you . just out of curiosity tell me about three questions @: you have been evoking mrnd a bit a lot ; would you please let us know which political party you belonged to ?
second @: you told us that you drew reports denying the accusations brought against tutsis . so i want to ask you ; as a high @-@ ranked personality of then who could go abroad at times , how many tutsis have you warned ?
third @: you told us about a man called ntirugiribambe . where can we find him ?
what was his responsibility ?
thank you .
the first question concerns the political party i belonged to .
according to the rwandan constitution in force till june 10th 1991 , all rwandans including you adhered to mrnd . surely it was the same for you .
all people adhered to mrnd . even you because any rwandan did .
after june 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . soldiers did not adhere to any political party .
the second question you asked is about reports i drew and how many tutsis i might have warned .
i drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . i was told to verify .
i committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . i did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at sisi evariste 's .
i also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . that is why they started putting pressure on habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating tutsis and start releasing people .
people were released .
there are even people who were released . habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore you should check those who are being released @"@ .
in april 1991 ... it would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing tutsis for fake accusations .
i am telling you ; the report served a lot because i told foreigners that we had verified and found out that tutsis were innocent .
what was the third question again ?
ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of nyarugenge . he exiled to zaire . i do not know where he might be right now .
thank you !
my names are nyirangazare marie immaculee
parents ?
ntwarabashi joseph and cecilia ...
date of birth ?
1959
place of birth ?
kabarondo in kibungo
district ?
are you rwandan ?
yes rwandan ?
raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i swear to god that what i was going is true .
you shall say the truth . do not lie to us !
you have already said that this information collection . i would like to remind my brother some few things i can remember .
in 1990 , i do not remember the month and date , he co @-@ presided over a very big conference i attended at kimihurura . he was with renzaho tharcisse .
they told us that any rwandan living in kigali had to return to his or her place of birth .
otherwise , they had enough soldiers in all over the country and bullets so that every rwandan would be shot at .
renzaho ended saying @: "@ a word to a wise is enough ! @" this saying was a puzzle to us .
we could not figure out what it meant . many of us could not know what this intended to .
i beg your pardon , i want to be very brief .
a long time after , you , the then gendarmerie commander , joined us somewhere in sainte @-@ famille .
do you know me ? do you ?
you know sir ; i do not have anything against you . i would advise that you accepted all that has been said and that you consider as lies . we are many witnesses for that . you know that we only wanted to remind each other .
we shall give to each speaker minutes not to go beyond .
i was born in ubumanzi cell , rugenge sector , nyarugenge district . thank you .
wait a bit !
you first raise your right hand and swear @: "@ i , your name , swear to god that what i am going to say is true @"@ .
i , gasasira jean marie maurice , swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
tell the truth then !
thank you mister president1 even though we have been given few minutes , i would like to ask to be given the same minutes as him because we are all equal before gacaca .
in fact , he asked to give his testimony . we can not give you the same minutes as him considering your number . try to look behind you ; there are other people . we might even receive testimonies from five people .
you can see that the testimonies can not take such a time unless you want to tell us stories from 1959 as well !
in case you want , say , to evoke something wrong he did , just go straight .
he had his own car . the red one usually rolled before his .
the car bore the script commune nyarugenge ... mrnd commune nyarugenge . do n't you all know those cars in this city ?
the car bore the script commune nyarugenge above which mrnd and commune nyarugenge was below .
such pickups were known in this city . people who were at sainte @-@ famille may remind each other .
when he came to sainte @-@ famille he was always accompanied by interahamwe . but he had his gendarmes as he already said .
it is surprising , however , that , as a commander of muhima military camp , he did not mention the name of munyeshyaka among the priests but only limited himself to celestin .
you all know what munyeshyaka did in this country .
we always say his name . he is even known abroad . munyakazi usually came to munyeshyaka 's office where they held meetings together with another priest who was the army chaplain in esm .
the very munyakazi here present ... after they entered the office , all other activities stopped .
we will tell you the names of the army chaplain in other cessions . mister president , i am now going to tell you the names of people who were taken from sainte @-@ famille and how they were taken .
shortly before april 28th , this man came to sainte @-@ famille . he went to munyeshyaka 's and they killed people . i call upon people who were in sainte @-@ famille to remember well .
father wensislas munyeshyaka wore a bullet @-@ proof .
this one wore the gendarmerie uniform and had a pistol in his white pocket . he said @: "@ what i want today is tutsis who are in sainte @-@ famille @"@ . i beg you , mister president and other people who were in sainte @-@ famille with me , to follow up well this issue . he entered .
he had come with interahamwe from everywhere ; gikondo , muhima , rugenge , i could even see my neighbors of nyarugenge .
munyakazi and renzaho , the prefect of the capital , were present as well .
those of our area , rugenge had also come uphill . you remember four groups that were at sainte @-@ famille i guess . renzaho , munyakazi and the school inspector were all present .
please , look at the court panel not at the audience !
thank you mister president . i just want that we may remind each other .
in regard to the attack i am going to talk about , -@ i have already told you that the interahamwe had all come uphill @- it is clear that it had already been planned since they all met there ; what means they were coming to kill tutsis at sainte @-@ famille @: those from muhima , rugenge and gikondo were all present .
i would like also to tell you , mister president , people who died in sainte @-@ famille church .
they are 18 @: among them was a man from gikondo who covered his head with a veil disguising himself in a woman .
munyeshyaka himself ... wensislas munyeshyaka said not to put the 18 people among others . they were all taken to renzaho 's .
it was said they were going to give some information concerning inyenzi . i beg you , mister president , to go to the field so that we may prove what we are saying @: how he exercised his power and what happened under his authority .
the people were tied with shirts and put into the pickup . your own pickup , mister munyakazi , was white as you said but another before yours packed those people first .
in that time the interahamwe i have talked about were in four groups . it was clear that they were coming to sainte @-@ famille . when the people were taken , it was said they were going to give information about inyenzi and residence certificates . we never knew what happened after .
i beg him to tell us where they were taken @: what happened to those who proved innocent and those who were guilty so that we may even worthily bury them .
the last thing , mister president , after having asked him about those who were taken to renzaho 's .... -@ i guess i also have that right @-
as you have just showed us the power you have on munyakazi ... we shall bring our testimonies to the tribunal . but before i leave , i would like to ask you one thing @: he has been continuously evoking rugema donatien .
he came to sainte @-@ famille escaping .
you all know rugema donatien was jailed among accomplices in 1990 . i have a close family relationship with him ; he is my uncle .
rugema said @: "@ among people i have just escaped from , there is munyakazi @"@ . he came crying and said @: "@ you should know that today is your last day @"@ .
you all know rugema at kimihurura . his wife and children had just been killed .
he arrived at sainte @-@ famille after his house had been attacked . munyakazi had always been swearing to harm him . rugema is my uncle . i will even communicate to him that munyakazi 's case is being proceeded in the tribunal .
we had tried it in 1997 . we wrote to the then military auditor general , major nzabanita joseph that there was a man in the army called laurent munyakazi we were accusing of genocide . fortunately gacaca has brought him to us . the judgment is up to you ! ask us then .
as far as i am concerned , we will continue together in proceedings because i have much to accuse him of ; from 1990 in the time of accomplices ' case . i accuse him of torturing tutsis and people who were jailed among accomplices . he here is now !
i do not want to be too long mister president . we will be together in tribunals . i am asking you two things , mister munyakazi , in very strict words @:
as you can see , this is still the information collection step . we have also tried to collect information concerning the people we lost . we heard of many things from people who happened to arrive at sainte @-@ famille during the first days . they told us that munyakazi had been at sopetrad asking whether there was no shit to be cleaned off .
that means tutsis . he was answered that there were no tools .
that is the information we have also collected so that justice for our people might be done . that is all they expect .

i do not know that . i left there cells changed . i will tell you my residence
your cell of residence ?
thank you ! though you want me to swear , i am not giving any testimony . i am just asking
do not swear if you are asking
i want to .... mister major general munyakazi , you had told us a long story . however i think genocide took place between october 1st 1990 and december 1994 .
he also told us about the invented scenario after which tutsis were arrested in order to kill them .
when you asked him you said that you want three things ; his role , what he saw and what he heard .
you did not show us your role .
in 1990 , at the time of the shootings i was here in kigali .
i know that many people were arrested by major general munyakazi when he was still major .
he said that it was an invented scenario . i want to ask him why he arrested people knowingly . how did he consider that ?
second . at nyamirambo regional stadium , many people called upon him for help because he was in a vey good position for that .
among people he helped , there is one woman he released and she went home . others perished there . he told us he drew a report but i do not agree with him because if he had really drawn the report , he would have released the people from the stadium . on the contrary , he took them to jail .
third . you all know the international pressure . even those who were not in the country might have read newspapers . that pressure made them release those they called accomplices .
why did n't he show us who was arresting people but only told us that he saved priests and nuns and did neither see nor hear of the death of more than 180 people at sainte @-@ famille ? do you really think this gentleman will tell the truth as he swore ? he should spare our worries because the situation has already started worrying us !
thank you .
come only if it is the matter of testimony . those with suggestions will have their turn after . the turn is for witnesses . those who do not have testimonies should move back ; they will have their turn and give their views .
right ! my names are nyirubuntu epaphrodite , i was born in 1970 . there is something i ...
are you going to give us a testimony ?
yes , a testimony !
eeh ! raise your hand
i , nyirubuntu epaphrodite

swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
you did not mention your parents ' anmes !

eeh ... we spent there all the day on 14th and 15th . it seemed escaping from the rain under a sweating tree . munyakazi came with renzaho . he sent interahamwe into the church .
they started seating us in the very church and picking up people whom they packed in the red pickup he has often evoked . they carried them in eight rounds till they saw strong young men had almost finished . they mainly took young men
eeh ! then after ... i will be brief . minuar came . they wanted to take people who wanted to go to the area controlled by rpf . minuar started by mille collines . we were carried in about two rounds . however interahamwe could stop people at times but things ceased after on the date i do not remember well . it was probably on june 15th when minuar came . meanwhile , they gave us a conference and told us they would come to take us .
eeh ! renzaho entered . for munyakazi , sainte @-@ famille was like his home because he usually came there . they usually came there with goats and asked to have their meal in priests ' buildings .
the only priest who stayed there was called wensislas munyeshyaka . he [ munyakazi ] was at sainte @-@ famille every time and every single hour . they were checking whether the number of young men was enough so that they might carry them out .
they sometimes picked some and carried them out . once they heard that minuar would come to take us . they met and said that in case young men were taken , rpf would gain much force . it would gain soldiers .
it was decided that in case people would be taken , it had only to be children , old men and women
at that time , munyakazi himself , renzaho and munyeshayaka were standing there . they told a lady called angelina to go and come with her interahamwe in order to circle us .
let 's see ... they were discussing about the departure of young men on 16th that was the time they also told angelina to come with her men to surround sainte @-@ famille
they [ munyakazi and others ] said that they would be bringing others during the whole night . the place was circled by the morning . munyakazi himself came and went to carry them and dropped them behind the church . about 9 , they started climbing and getting into the enclosure . they ordered to only shoot at young men and not women
we were seated and some of us were opened rapid fire at . we were seated on the floor . minuar came on 17th . it arrived . those who were not killed , we were seated on the floor . munyakazi who is defending himself entered and cried @: "@ withdraw ! withdraw ! minuar are there !
"@ get out with those you have not yet killed and kill them outside @"@ . i also stood up among them .
when i reached sainte @-@ famille ’ s door to the steward 's office , while munyakazi and his colleagues were preventing minuar from getting in , i went to hide between containers which were there . those who lived there know it .
munyakazi seated us and they picked young men whom they took into the minibus that stationed next to containers outside . i do not know where it had been taken from . young men were seated in it . i stayed behind . this man owned a bar where nzeyi worked . he [ munyakazi ] even used to deliver driving licenses there some time ago in order to earn a little money .
the man called nzeyi was his employee . we could sometimes meet in nzeyi 's bar . i stayed behind and i went to tell munyakazi that we were not inyenzi but displaced people . we were about to go downhill a bit . one of the young men tried to get off the car and enter the steward general 's office garage . munyakazi and munyeshyaka followed him . and i moved back .
in so doing , ladies who worked in the infirmary that was there told me to sit down . they covered me with loincloths and sat by me . the young men sat there all along the day . in the evening , this man himself , major general in front of you , came back .
i do not know ... though he is denying god will accuse him ! he himself carried away the young men . there were among them gasongo munyensanga , uwiga aloys , ignace . i can only remember those because they were very close to me
he carried the young men that evening . we do not know where he took them . whether he employed them or ... we do not know . he should tell us where he might have kept our young men . he carried them away ; they were 18 . he took them away himself and only him ! though he said he had no connection with interahamwe , he once entered the church with twelve interahamwe . they were not many and there was no policeman .
angelinana and munyakazi were there .
the interahamwe left in the evening .
because he came back to take them away , he should tell us where he put our young men . i am almos through but , like my colleague , i also worry about my personal security .

raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i , uwitije jean paul , swear to god that what i am going to say is true
tell us the truth then
i will tell you the truth .
the first thing is that this very munyakazi himself invited us .
what munyakazi told us is not a testimony at all . it is just a eulogy of his . tutsis died . people from ruhengeri killed them . what he said was not our expectation . we already know it .
what i am telling munyakazi is that he kept killing people and now people are accusing him .
i am accusing him as well as someone who was at sainte @-@ famille .
i went there on 19th ... 14th . i left when the war ended .
there are people who were at sainte @-@ famille but have not seen him yet well . i beg him to stare at me carefully . he himself , stood by me wile i was sitting down . i will remind him the words he pronounced then he will remember as he said he does not know anything .
munyakazi himself first came to sainte @-@ famille .... we 've been given few minutes by the way !
munyakazi came and took away one lady called chantal and about eight young men . he carried them in a pickup and he said he was taking them to mille collines . if the young men are still alive it might be just luck ; i can only see the woman today .
we came in very big number believing you sympathized with us . you separated those who wanted to go to the side of inyenzi and those who wanted to go to the government . realizing that the number of those who wanted to the inyenzi 's side was bigger , you became angry and moved your spectacles .
you talked to renzaho . i do not know what you said . only you know . you even immediately left .
the following day , i think there were still few people left at mille collines . you came for evacuation . when you arrived you did not allow any man to go . when he wanted you said he was going to join inyenzi .
you can see well that we know that you were present . do not try to tell a single lie . then after , you went and told the interahamwe to stop men so that only women might go .
even those who received them can say it .
on june 16th the day i will n't forget , after people had been taken to saint @-@ paul and we were staying there , you came and stared at us
then you went out and came back at once with renzaho , commander gisunzu , angelina , and the then sector councilor called odette i guess . you went some where . you were with the interahamwe kimba and seseko . because you are saying that you were not there ; i am just reminding you .
you came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . then ... you munyakazi . they started picking people . among those left , there was a man called enock and others . there were still about ten people in front of amri 's house . you talked and after a while we saw the interahamwe standing all along the fence . we were outside the church . we were sitting in the sunshine . at once , we heard the interahamwe shooting at the door of the church .
women had stayed in . they ran out . meanwhile , there was a policeman with them called yoramu or something alike . he was from ruyenzi . he had arrived in the morning and told us @: "@ you know what ! today might be your last day ! inyenzi have taken others with them . what about you then ? @"
what he had predicted became true . you came with many interahamwe . every man was shot at . we survived by heaven 's will . only god saved us because no man would have survived . we stayed there till the night . i understand why you say you do not know it ; it is because it did not concern you . i was hiding in grass . there were toilets we had dug .
then i went down . i ran when gunshots worsened . somewhere down i joined men sitting down . these are the men my preceding colleague was talking about . you came and stood on the slope .
he asked me @: "@ why have you come here ? @"
i told him @: that "@ i am businessman and all the money was taken from me ; so i have no money to give them so that i might be released . so i have come here @"@ . he asked me @: "@ why have n't stayed on the yard and prefer to join inyenzi ? @" i said @: "@ i just came here ! @"
he asked me with whom i was . i gestured like this and showed him that i was with all of them . he asked me @: "@ why are with all of these inyenzi ? @"
then , came another black tall young man in sports suit . his name must be ntirugiribambe samuel ; i guess . you were standing nearby . he was brought there . others were immediately shot at in the very place . you asked @: "@ why are bringing this ? @" they immediately shot at him and he ran away saying @: "@ mercy ! mercy ! @" on that you said @: "@ taste it ! why did you come here ? @"
calm down first then you will tell us .
if you can n't go on , wait and calm down ! you have your time .
let him . he has not finished yet . he will resume . let him calm down first .
on 19th , you , munyakazi , came back and took away people you found there . you said that there were others you had taken from the church . you came to us and we were about eight people down the water tank . you were with an interahamwe . he himself said that at rugenge . you started designating people telling them to stand up . the interahamwe beat me with a gun on my back , i fell down and you came to stand by me and wondered @: "@ what hell on earth has this come here for ! @"
"@ have n't they always been told to stay on the yard ? @"
did n't you say it yourself ?

you shall raise your right hand if you are going to give a testimony . or tell us whether it is a point of view .
is it a testimony ?
there is someone we talked to who has got information . he shall say it and then i will give my testimony about what i saw then i will end by asking two questions . i will n't bee too long actually
raise your right and swear as it is a testimony . you shall say @: i , your name ...
i , mudenge sylvain
swear to god
swear to god that what i am going to say is true
tell us then
it an information and testimony frm james
from james ?
but he is alive . he lives in ubumanzi or ubumwe cell
tell us an other name of james
i do not remember it . others may help me . but i know where he lives
tell us in brief what he told you .
actually , munyakazi you know ! we even once had a talk . but i have first to say what i was told by james .
it was in 1990 , i do not remember the date ; james will say it himself . munyakazi took james and a person nicknamed the priest to police station . it was kigali central prison in the time .
i was told this by james .
when they arrived there he told them @: "@ do you see the place ? @" james will say this himself ; i only say this so that we grasp the information in advance .
arrived , he told them that he wanted to take them to that place . they both resisted . then he told them @: "@ let 's forget about for the moment @"@ . he immediately called muhima police station office . since then they were jailed . it was in the time of "@ accomplices ' imprisonment @"@ . that is all i was told . we might ask him personally when he will be present .
you were coming for final cleansing . you were accompanying them and you arrived there . i would like also to beg you to ask the minister of defense here present because they once arrived together at saint @-@ paul . he arrived , i was with robert and many other guys whose i do not remember names since i have not prepared it properly . i have just come from cyangugu unexpectedly . when i heard that he would be invited , i took the advantage because i have come twice and it did not
on 22nd , you came . i should also be asked about the 20th at saint @-@ paul in cela
which month ?
april . he used to pass there as an authority .
when he had just left , father munyeshyaka , the then sainte @-@ famille parish priest , arrived in a gown together with gasasira . when he talked he was wearing a bullet @-@ proof
in case i forget i beg him to remind me because he , munyakazi , came to take some people . there were mukamurenzi and other athletes .
i have forgotten many names . the reason i point at him is that he once came with robert kajuga . so , many often events overlap in fact .
without turning around the bush , i can firmly confirm that these people are genocide planners . i do n't want to take too long on that . have a nice work and thank you .
wait . we want to ask you a little bit .
you told us that you arrived at cela but you have not told us how was the situation there
i may have trouble . i will tell you when i will be invited or i may even send a script to you .
otherwise , you may read the book entitled african . there is full information . for the moment i want to end by asking my questions
i think even honorable kanzayire was hiding there . we went and sat down . we hid in an infirmary where priests found us . there were many people
his excellence munyakazi arrived . after he left father munyeshyaka came too . they continued to saint @-@ paul . it is too difficult for me to provide full information in fact . i am afraid i may lose control . however , i can answer some few questions if there are any . or ... you may even ask the very questions to renzaho or any other you may find belonging to his group .
ask the questions you have just evoked
my question is about ... i was praying during that time . i would like to ask him about father munyeshyaka when he arrived at saint @-@ paul after him ... many have even been saying this . they came and separated people then took some with them .
what can he tell us about munyeshyaka ?
he has already said a lot and you took notes . what can he tell us about the attacks at lycee notre dame de citeaux ?
i am curious because i was a student there but i did not have time to investigate due to everyday problems .
can he tell us about saint @-@ michel ?
can he tell us about saint @-@ paul after we left there saved and they still had sainte @-@ famille ? we want to spare our worries .
the last speaker has just asked munyakazi to say what happened at saint @-@ paul after they left there
we would like to facilitate you sir . so to go faster , we shall tell you questions to answer !
he has lastly asked about munyeshyaka .
we know that munyeshyaka lives in france . probably he would like to know what you know about munyeshyaka 's role because he might have been close to you . would you give some explanations about that ? let 's start by that one .
listen sir , in order to be brief and save time you should n't tell a long story when you are asked a question .
tell us for example @: munyeshyaka did this and this or if you do n't know say you do n't
all i know of munyeshyaka is that he was in charge of those displaced people . i told you that i did not participate to those attacks people have been talking about .
that is what i told the court panel .
people have also been evoking the date of june 17th 1996
the court panel had already asked me to say what i did on this date of june 17th 1996 .
i told the tribunal that on this date of june 17th 1996
when rpf had taken people from saint @-@ paul , you know there was a zone belonging to rpf , interahamwe attacked all the places .
i immediately went to hotel de milles collines because the interahamwe had just broken doors there
though it is being said that i was at sainte @-@ famille chasing minuar soldiers , those who were in that area were staying at hotel de mille collines . i spent the entire day with them . their commander was lieutenant @-@ colonel mwangi from congo brazzaville
i never chased minuar soldiers . neither did i see the attacks of interahamwe as i told the tribunal .
so let us ask you some questions . many questions have been asked in fact but we shall help you to go faster
there is a question by nyirangazare about the conference you co @-@ presided with renzaho tharcisse saying they had to leave kigali for their places of birth
you shall explain the reason for that in brief .
did it take place or no ?
it did n't
she evoked something of sainte @-@ famille but you have been explaining that .
there is one question left
what i can add , if you do allow !
i read of nyirangazare in new times and someone called gasongo was often evoked .
it is said that i took away that gasongo from kibuye on that day when he left saint @-@ paul center
concerning what gasasira said they had submitted the accusations in the army auditor 's office , at nzabanita joseph 's , i did n't know it . i was never called in order to provide explanations
a member of the commission once joined me in gisenyi . i will say his name later as you said this is not a trial .
i was with officers i commanded . he told them that there were many accusations against lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi
however , we conducted an investigation and we found that rugema donatien and prefect kabera were wrongfully accusing lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
the person would have been here and give you explanations if he had not been abroad . if things do not improve , he told me he will come
and show you that it was found out that those accusations were fake ones brought to me whereas we are all leaders as it sometimes happens when one hates another
the person joined me there and told me that i was wrongfully accused ; that i never killed a single individual ; that those i took away
on 17th , 18th , and 19th i took them to saint @-@ michel cathedral ; that they found out that they are all alive . it was said when i was with officers ; they may come and tell you .
i never knew that investigation conducted by the army auditor 's office . that 's all i knew .
you are going too far sir . we have what we are asking you that is simpler .
saying they were to provide some information . they must be those you took away in order to save them . what would you say ?
he , as well as others , may be wondering @: who proved innocent ? where are others ? would you explain it more ?
i told you that the people i took on 17th , 18th , and 19th from sainte @-@ famille and procure
were all taken to saint @-@ michel cathedral . they are all alive .
that 's what i told you .
i never carried those other people in the pickup people have been talking about red or .... not at all
they said you arrived at sainte @-@ famille . did you or not ? so that we may ask tell us first whether you entered ?
i went there even at the time of gomme falling down .
every time there was a problem and i was called upon for help i went as an authority
given many people always died there -@ you might be aware of it yourself @- and that you arrived at sainte @-@ famille sir ;
i also told you i did my best to help the population
would you spare our worries about the people who died on 17th and 16th whom epa said you put their bodies in the steward 's office buildings ,
in the steward general 's office garage in order to hide them from minuar general ? would you tell us about that general ?
i did not kill them .
here is the whole story @:
eeh ! tell us if you do know
as i told you , interahamwe attacked saint @-@ paul center , sainte @-@ famille church , and hotel de mille collines .
i was at hotel de mille collines .
interahamwe entered sainte @-@ famille church , took people form the church and shot at them between procure and the church . as i was told by some priests .... i saw one here by the way !
he might explain it to you .
... their bodies were taken to the steward general 's office buildings . that took place yes but as i told you i did not head that attack
i was told by priests that the bodies were taken from where they had been shot at , between the church , procure and priests ' buildings
people were shot at there . there were many interahamwe ; that is true . i was at hotel de mille collines
i never headed those attacks though i have just been accused of it together with colonel renzaho , angelina and odette
i was at hotel de mille collines helping all people who were there . i think it was that time when father uwimana saw that i had just helped people
and asked me to go and help the people who were at father vermerie 's
we got it .
would sit a bit !
please wait a moment . wait
i am father galican .

that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
we are expecting father to tell us the truth given you were there and watched the whole scenario
my mother is kamanazi charlotte
year of birth ?
i would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
whereas it is the center of the problem .
people have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way
we , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @:
on sainte @-@ famille primary school playground , on sainte @-@ famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by interahamwe
those who were at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul even at cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from interahamwe
right !
we did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from interahamwe
we did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . that means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings
in order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there
we did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against sainte @-@ famille
there were even people who held meetings among them .
there were xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack .
the information could be got that way
since we could not know those who were connected to interahamwe , we did not reveal anything .
one could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . that is the way it worked
i do not even know why people have not evoked munyeshyaka . munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . he never intended to betray people .
that is why i was telling you people understand things in differently . we , as priests either in sainte @-@ famille or
saint @-@ paul ... we had appointed father celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ paul . i do n't know why people did not mention that interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies
as they came to sainte @-@ famille to take and kill people . this leads me to talking about munyakazi now
what i am telling you is a true testimony . i would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
we had resorted to minister aloys . munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and interahamwe were coming to kill people
he said he was going to handle the situation . i worked with munyeshyaka . then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day .
gendarmes settled at procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed .
once a very strong attack came to take people from sainte @-@ famille and because interahamwe entered in disorder ,
we asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance .
they did it .
however as i said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks
they were stronger than them till munyakazi himself some were stronger than him
please , listen !
i still have the floor . if we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things
we shall ask him questions .
he will explain . listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his .
please , stop shouting
what i can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed .
it became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield
we asked that some might be transferred . you can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out .
after that , the interahamwe talked about who were at sainte @-@ famille set a barrier saying inyenzi were being given water .
after the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . they did it .
in the parish yuhi where i lived , i went with major nsanzimfura jean baptiste after having called him for help that that the assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . i told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place
he told me to go and take them . i first feared to go far and he ensured me that if i was to die we would both die .
so , we went together .
okay ! that evening we were facilitated from gitikinyoni to sainte @-@ famille by one thing ;
inkotanyi were shooting and bombarding a lot in order to come and take people from saint @-@ paul .
we came and arrived around midnight because our tyre deflated . we had never been at ease all along the journey . at any time we could be told @:
"@ speed up ! we may get shot at @" because the car was slow .
arrived at sainte @-@ famille , i spent the night in procure with father munyeshyaka because i had forgotten the keys of the door from the steward 's office to saint @-@ paul .
then we heard a lot of bullet shots in saint @-@ paul
i remember that father munyeshyaka told a soldier called murekezi to call minadef and tell them that interahamwe were killing people left at saint @-@ paul
the soldier did then told him @: "@ inkotanyi are already there @"@ . they had just known what we thought was wrong .
i wanted to leave then and i told them that at night one can not recognize that another wears a bulletproof .
what they said is true he wore a bulletproof .
the following morning -@ i had already spent the night in procure @- the intrepid people i talked about ... i mean interahamwe
would you be brief father ? there are still other people who want to talk
okay ! i just want to tell you about the following morning .
it is true that colonel munyakazi arrived
in the morning
on 17th ?
no sooner had they said so than i quickly ran to hide in saint @-@ paul .
as i was saying , those people really died in the yard of priests ' buildings .
after they were killed , the bodies were thrown in the grave that was in the steward general 's office garage
i can n't say that ... i with others wo were in saint @-@ paul only heard they were being killed . we ourselves were hiding
in the afternoon , around 5 p.m. general munyakazi came to take us . he took us to the archbishop 's palace .
we went there . some time after the french bernard couchner met us there . we told him @: "@ so to verify the scandals ,
go to sainte @-@ famille and enter the garage ; you will see a heap of bodies @"@ .
it was true because we had just known that the bodies were still there .
that is what happened there but the story is longer than that . if there are questions you may ask me .
i want to ask you one question father ; the bodies thrown in the garage , have they been exhumed and worthily buried or not yet ?
after some time after the bodies went stinking and people came and went to bury them . but where they were buried ....
who took them away ?
i can not know that . we were at archbishop 's palace at that time . i do n't have information
were they taken from the graves and taken away ?
they were taken from the graves and taken away ? the graves were still stinking even after war .
have you said munyeshyaka had a bullet @-@ proof and a pistol ?
was he a soldier ?
munyeshyaka first owned a kalashnikov , then
please listen
he once phoned me and told me that he had just had a gun . i went and joined him at sainte @-@ famille . i asked him whether he could dare bear a gun on his shoulders and walk .
he told me that it was of course heavy .
he told me that he was going to ask for a pistol .
he asked for it and he got it . i asked him whether he would shoot at person with it . he slipped on his shirt and put it here .
then i told him @: "@ what will you do with a pistol ? @"
he answered @: "@ i can not dare kill .
it is just to make the interahamwe believe that i am one of them and then fear me @"@ .
that is what he told me .
so , i told him to slip on it but not to reveal it .
"@ it would be of no use . @"@ why would i have asked for it if i slip on it then ? it is just to make the interahamwe fear me , see me and find in me a partner @" he said .
are you allowed that at least ?
munyakazi arrived there in the morning .
what did you talk with him ? what did he come for ?
i did not talk to him
what did he come for ?
i do not even know that .
i just got out of procure -@ i spent my night there @- and i found him there . then after he left . i would be lying if i gave further explanations
you might go to your place ! we want the lady who wants to for work . do not worry . your turn is coming soon .
you can also see that she is old . introduce yourself first .
thank you .
my names are agnes mukandutiye

i am going to give a testimony just for some minutes
raise your right hand and swear @: i , your name ...
i , agnes mukandutiye
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that all i am going to say is true
tell us now
they immediately went in the church together with interahamwe . i do not know their names because i was from cyahafi sector .
angelina saw me and exclaimed @: "@ tutsis , you are as hardy as weed . are you still alive mukandutiye ? @" she was an acquaintance of mine actually .
next she told me to join others . they were 18 young men and i was the nineteenth .
in my testimony i want to thank this man munyakazi because he saved me . how would have saved me if he had not arrived then ?
i went out with the young men . when we reached the red car i was talking about , munyakazi told angelina @: "@ i do n't know anything wrong with this woman ! @"
angelina replied @: "@ we have been sent by renzaho . why do n't you come with us and go to tell him that the woman is innocent ? @"
what munyakazi did immediately ; he told me @: "@ go back @"@ .
i really thank you sir . however , we would like to know where the young men disappeared .
let 's receive that one .
what are your names ?
eeh ! ...
raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i , ntaganzwa evariste
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
tell us now !
he carried in the car bidede and others . that is the day when people were killed at rugenge sector 's office . you remember their number .
for the first round , he carried bidede and others .
what about the second and the third ?
the first round i am talking about there were bideli and other young men from kacyiru whose names i do not remember .
there were also other guys from nyanza
there were also murashi 's children from numuhungu 's place and a one @-@ handed small boy called rukinirwa .
actually those bodies which were lying there from the tarmacked road down to rugenge . all those bodies ! for sure bidede was among them .
i am talking about bidede because he was the first to be caught , then shot , and finally burnt with oil
from there , they went downhill killing people up to the farm in rugenge sector .
when the car reached , people on board included @: ngamije ,
ndamage , bikomagu who was nyirabagenzi 's brother i guess .
they told me to join others and go to cleanse .
i told them that i did not understand that language . i sat down again . i was holding a bible .
they went up cleansing as they said . they went to saint @-@ paul . the first person who approached me is mazimpaka who asked me about murashi 's son ...
he told me that in case i found one of his family members i would tell him about his death . of course if would be still alive myself !
no sooner had he said it than ngamije and ndagijimana asked me whether i knew him . i said that i did , that his name was mazimpaka . they ordered me @: @" go this way ! follow him @"
then i told them @: "@ yes i will @"@ . when i wanted to stop they pushed me and i fell on the other side of the road . i sat there .
they started their task . what i want to say is that though munyakazi is denying the red car , it went for the first round , went back to carry others . it went three times .
for the third round he brought those young men . they were sixteen . they were killed in cnd down rugenge sector 's office .
there was mutarambirwa 's son who jumped over the fence of the house over there and went downhill through those houses .
this is written in the cell gacaca court record .
another part @: those who were hiding in sainte @-@ famille church . i think he might clarify those things and how he does not know the car ... actually i once saw him in the white car
that he acknowledges . he came to the barrier to see someone . i do know the man who was with him . he immediately met one cell leader from rugenge ; narcisse .
they went together some steps to nyanza . i was watching . after some minutes they were back and held a small a meeting . they left nyirabagenzi there who ordered not to tear tutsis ' steel sheets anymore but collect them and later be used to build houses to live in ,
and to grant to the poor survivors some of the steel sheets .
the following morning , mukeshimana 's father came to destroy steel sheets of nzabonitegeka gaston 's houses . when he started , i reminded him that the sector councilor had ordered them not to destroy steel sheets .
i asked him @: "@ why are you destroying them ? what will you build your own houses with ? @"
on that , he ordered jonas ' son to come and teach me a lesson and go back to carry wood .
please evariste ; tell us about the role of this man first . we shall follow up that after
his role is that though he is denying the car , everything was done under his command . jonas ' son beat me here !
nurses there could not treat me . then they told me to go out very quickly because something bad was to take place in a short time .
when i went down to sainte @-@ famille the interahamwe there took me and made me sit down there all the day . munyakazi should not deny because he used the two cars .
no one should not go beyond three minutes . be brief .
as a group you should write and give us a written testimony .
you shall bring the testimony to the tribunal if there are other issues in relation to aiding and abetting .
wait a moment
raise your right hand and swear @: i , your name
i , uwanyirigira mathilde
swear to god
that what i am going is true
tell us
people have been talking about sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul . i was at nyamirambo in saint @-@ andre . i want to talk about what happened there .
because the gentleman might have no time to go there due to daily activities .
it was on the 6th . it was known that there were babies from nyacyonga .
when we were attacked , priests who were there said that they had babies who deserved no death at all
then , we asked the priests @: "@ as you have babies , take also ours , go and put them may be in red @-@ cross or hotel de mille collines ... wherever provided they are survive . please help us .
we knew that we had absolutely to die .
anytime we heard soldiers we would immediately went under beds , in rooms , everywhere ! he came and took all of us from there .
he used a french word @: "@ c' est impossible ! we thought here were only babies . get out . all of you @"@ .
we went out . we went closer and greeted him .
he did not harm us at all . we told him @: "@ we know you are a high @-@ ranked soldier here in kigali .
and we have babies . we are not asking you to save us . we know you can go nowhere with us . pleases save at least our babies ! @"
he told us that he would handle the problem @: @"@ on va voir ! @"
it was on 8th . on 9th we spent the day there . on 10th , people among them munyakazi , came shooting into windows .
they shot tear @-@ gas into us in such a way that some babies died . there were many women and babies . we were then packed like cassavas or beans into a daihatsu pickup .
once on the pickup , i realized that my eldest child who was five was not there .
i insisted to go down and take my child .
i went down and looked for my child . once i found , we came together . when i arrived i found that people on board were being beaten with guns .
i remember that there was an interahamwe who moved off a priest 's motorbike . general munyakazi shot at its tyres and said @: "@ have you come to take off priests ' property ? @"
he showed me where to stand if i was hutu . when they were distracted , i went back into the house . they carried those people away and none of them was seen back .
general was there . that is what i had to say . thank you .
may you come back so that we may ask you ?
do you remember the number of the people taken away ?
they were about 300 . their names are too many that ...
who do you remember ?
ladies such as donathile ; immacule , vianney 's wife , there were very many . i knew all of them ....
introduce yourself first
my name is nyirinkwaya ......
raise your right hand and swear @: i ...
i nyirinkwaya geoffrey ,
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
tell us
i will n't say a lot . i will talk about some places evoked by people before me @:
because it was a place where they thought they could be safe . we arrived and spent four days there . i do n't know the dates . you may ask munyakazican because he participated in attacks and entered there .
we spent about four days . on the second day , young men who were there , we thought of establishing self @-@ defense system against interahamwe
so that they might not easily invade .
the formed self @-@ defense group was made of albert , the chief ,
gihana , makombe , and others whose i do not remember names .
the group was so strong that we beat the first interahamwe 's attack . at the second time beat them as well .
we were no longer afraid .
we hanged on the entrance wall and the following one the timetable for watching in turns to ensure everybody 's security .
after being severely defeated , the interahamwe went to resort to a higher security level . you know well it was headed by the very munyakazi who even headed the following attack . this shows he had been called upon by them .
when they came , they were with this man , renzaho tharcisse , angelina and many others i do not remember well .
people who are here know and remember them .
we went and approached our chief aside and let munyakazi , renzaho and others get in . they passed through between cela buildings . you can see the corridor yourself
they went past the first house , reached the second which was seemingly a chapel , where some were hiding .
others were in a guava garden . they told all people to come to the upper side .
munyakazi himself gave the order of closing the upper path . they started cutting down the bush on the upper side in order to see who might be hiding there .
we gathered . everyone was taken from the hideaway . renzaho said @: "@ there are now only tutsis . shoot at them @"@ .
this one said to wait lest there should be hutus among them . i ask him to remember ; he said that instead of being killed together they should be killed according to their residence places .
"@ muhima here , kimicanga , upper kiyovu , lower kiyovu @"@ , he himself pronounced those words .
he said that people should be killed . he used those words .
all people gathered according to their regions or sectors of origin . i , my two elder brothers , my cousin and few other people did not have any group to belong to .
renzaho asked @: "@ where do these belong to ? @" we answered @: "@ we are visitors from kibungo .
we do not have reason to enter any of the groups . integrate us wherever you like . you may kill or save us @"
the mother went down to call her husband where he was hiding behind a cupboard . no sooner had they arrived than this one and his men took them and killed the whole family there .
that one started killing people like that at everyone 's sight with a cruel torture in cela
someone called .... has been asked and did not dare say it but this man in front of you headed the attack at cela .
for the sake of reliable information collection , in case he feels i am not telling the truth , i would beg him to come and say for example : @"@ this and this is not true or i did not arrive there @"@ ...
he was fully there ! he watched the death of people , he gave suggestions holding pistol when the interahamwe were doing their best to exterminate people , tutsis .
just after degode , wilson , gihana , vincent who was a judge were killed ,
this very man ordered that the people gathered in sectors and cells be taken away to be killed .
munyakazi himself , as you see him in front of you , wore his trousers far below the waist , very proudly , believing himself to be the almighty
and my cousin they worked together thought that because renzaho was from kibungo , he would save them . so they went to him .
they went to that side . i and my elder brother stayed with this man . there was also another called antoinet . they told us @: "@ join those interahamwe @"@ .
that was actually a way of delivering us to them . fortunately , we went through the entrance of cela , we went and arrived among displaced people at sainte @-@ famille .
when we joined those displaced people who were in sainte @-@ famille , they all moved away from me because i was easily remarkable . i mean ... among the wanted .
both tutsis and hutus left me alone on the yard so that i might be caught .
i thought that instead of betraying others i should stay and be taken from there .
it was about 10 or 11 a.m. people were being taken away one after one , slowly by slowly . i was still with my brother .
the following day , i was the only one to survive among the security group . others were killed in my eyes like yours who did such a work .
they called @: "@ nyirinkwaya @"@ ... first they called albert @: "@ is albert around ? @" he was n't . "@ gihana ? @" he was n't .
then they called my name
i thought @: @"@ this is my end now .
let me just go @"@ . i put off my coat and my watch ; i gave them to my elder brother so to keep them and i decided to go .
luckily one of the interahamwe , faustin , said @: "@ we have absolutely killed all these inyenzi ! @" they called another who came after me on the list . his name was makombe . he is also here right now , he can give you his testimony
he was the fourth to be called and i was the third . because they had just thought we all died , we survived that way .
this man munyakazi , himself , headed the attacks at cela . he is responsible for the death of those people . absolutely ! i saw these things with my own eyes . i even have more .
there are men namely rutabana who said that he killed people at sainte @-@ famille . yes , he [ munyakazi ] once came and found me sitting where i used to sit -@ people moved any time i would sit near them @-
i was sitting like this . he held the coat i was wearing like this , and told me to go out . all people murmured @: "@ the guy is finished now ! absolutely ! @"
at that time i decided to go to cook porridge where the interahamwe often passed so to be caught from a public place instead of betraying others .
we want you to be brief
raise your right hand and swear @: i , your name
i , munyankore martin
swear to god
swear to god
that what i am going to say is true
that what i am going to say is true
tell us
she came to me and asked @: "@ why have n't you joined others to bury our enemy ? @"@ i answered her @: "@ he is not my enemy @"
she asked again @: "@ do you mean you will n't come ? @" i answered @: "@ definitely ; i will n't @"@ .
she told the cell leader @: "@ i do n't want to see this man when i am back @"@ . i got arrested . there was a soldier who was a friend of mine . he took me back when we arrived at six @-@ heures
after taking me back ,
please martin , we would like to go straight to .....
i am almost on it . i will n't be too long actually . so the matter was closed .
martin in 1994 after the death of habyarimana the killings started .
i had a son , kagame who was already murdered .
we went to sainte @-@ famille . munyakazi and minuar were there . they said @: "@ because people have come to join inyenzi , let 's make a list of those who are joining the government 's side and those on the inyenzi 's @"@ .
they told us to write our names and the side we wanted to go to . some refused . i told my colleagues that it probably intended to abduct us .
during the two days i had been abducted twice and people with me had paid for my ransom .
one gendarme once took me and told me @: "@ for this time , come @"@ . i asked him @: @"@ where are you taking me brother ? @" he replied @: "@ you already know where you are usually taken @"@ .
i thought that was actually my end .
people gave money . some of them are even here . on that day , the lists arrived back from minuar . munyakazi had been with the father all the day
talking . they said that people should be observed and put into their categories ; tall ones ... the young priest father munyeshyaka -@ i do n't master his names ! sometimes i am likely to ....
okay ! then father munyeshyaka with this man said @: "@ follow this order ; separate tall people from others @"@ .
on that day , they had been holding a meeting all the day . father munyeshyaka came wearing a bullet @-@ proof holding a pistol . when he was celebrating the mass and moved like this the pistol fell down .
when it fell down we wondered @: "@ who is this guy reading the word of god with a gun that that has started falling down ! will n't he shoot at us in the church ? @"
i had been there for few days . i had failed to arrive before . finally minuar said that the lists had to be drawn again and that selection would take place at the football playground
arrived outside .... by the way ; i had five children , mine and my sister 's , who had just died . i was with this man and the other lady .... odette .
they said @: "@ make sure munyentwali does not escape . can you imagine someone who called his son kagame ? can you imagine that ? he even refused to go to rwigema 's burial saying he was not an enemy . by the way , you , sector councilor , why have kept such a person till today ? @"
it was on the playground . i was about to get on the truck . this man and munyeshyaka refused absolutely . it became a great dispute . finally , minuar took me away by force .
those who stayed at sainte @-@ famille were killed after we left . i was at kabuga . that was my testimony .
we were together for thirty minutes during the dispute with minuar when i was getting on board . how can he be denying all these things ?
he was preventing you from getting on board ?
he and munyeshyaka . they said that i had to stay because i was not on the list . they checked the list and found out that i had a different name . i had my identity card with me . they refused saying that i should wait for my turn and i could be alive till that time .
i had already been abducted for five times . people paid for my ransom . i was only abducted by gendarmes . no interahamwe did .
you can go
say your name first !
i , nkusi antoine swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
what i am going to say about munyakazi is true .
on the 7th we escaped to ..... we spent many days there . i will n't say much of him .
my colleague already said it and we were together
we were even in the same group
but we were dispersed by this man and his men .
and nyirabagenzi . they were always together .
we were hiding and had been gathered together , this man observed
and realized that people of his ethnic group would also die with us in case we were all killed .
he said @: "@ put them in groups according to their cells of origin @"@ . it was done as such .
some were packed into the car . among those rwanga and his children .
he is responsible for all of that because he did it there . after some time we left the place
covering our heads with mattresses . some went to sainte @-@ famille .
fortunately we arrived at sainte @-@ famille . he was always there .
to show us their bodies so to worthily bury them . that 's it .
thank you ! my name is safari , rugenge sector ,
nyarugenge district , kigali city . what i have realized about this man , munyakazi ....
i , safari hamoud , swear to god that what i am going to say is true
what i have realized about this man , munyakazi is that he is contradicting himself
as far as 1990 and 2005 are concerned .
one might say he is adjusting his position to vision 2020 !
though he has been denying the red car , he actually traveled in it in 1994 .
he looked out of the window and told them @: "@ what is wrong ? there is no shit here ! @"
the interahamwe answered him @: "@ we have no tools @"
he replied @: "@ how come that you do n't ? @" he looked out of the window again and talked to the gendarmes in the boot .
he told them @: "@ provide them with tools @"@ . they immediately gave them grenades . i wonder how the shit had to be removed with grenades !
was that a wheelbarrow to remove the shit ?
after being supplied by him , they entered my aunt 's house where i was staying .
they met me the first . they told me to stand on my knees . they told me @: " say your last pray because you are going to die ! @"
i stood on my knees and say my prayer in arabic . they said @: "@ this one is talking to kagame in their language @"@ .
i did not know our father and i mixed it with hail mary .
another called david , beat me with a machete in my back .
the interahamwe called maroc saw me and remembered that we used to play together at kimihurura .
he said @: @"@ this boy is not an inyenzi . we used to play together at kimihurura .
i never saw him involved in such things @"@ .
he held the grenade given to him by munyakazi . he told them @: "@ if you kill him , i send you to hell with this grenade . i swear ! @"
they were frightened and left me . i do n't understand why munyakazi is standing here
and denies that he travelled in the red car , that he supplied the interahamwe
i was born in 1949
cell of birth ?
muyange cell . i am going to give you my testimony
raise your right hand and swear
i , mukangarambe domithile , swear to god that what i am going to say is true
the testimony i want to give to you is that this man munyakazi ... first he held a meeting . he was with odette .
in the meeting , they told people to destroy tutsis ' houses so that their sons might have steel sheets to cover their houses .
after the meeting people came downhill . there was an old man of my neighborhood called charles kabendegeri who
he pointed at me and said @: "@ it is as if traitors who are here have not heard what the gendarmerie commander has told us @:
that we must get rid of these traitors @"@ . something else i want to say about munyakazi concerns the people he is denying .
i mean one hundred eighty @-@ six of sainte @-@ famille
they were put on minitrap 's truck .
they drove them down to kiyovu .
munyakazi was in a red car though he is denying it .
he came with a driver from the gendarmerie called murindwa
who was my neighbor . he arrived asking whether there were not tutsi shit .
they turned back the truck . the car of this one followed it . he was asking @: "@ is n't there any shit here ? @"
others could reply @: "@ when we kill , we immediately bury ! we do not need help ! @"
who said that "@ when we kill , we immediately bury . we do not need help ! @"@ ?
the interahamwe who were there . murindwa also said it .
he told them to get on the truck and he followed them . only he knows where he carried them .
i saw him again when the gendarmerie headquarters was captured by inkotanyi . he came to see murindwa and told him to go and carry soldiers
having lost their legs . those who were dead were carried to gisenyi to be buried .
i saw him again coming to murindwa 's house . he said @: "@ i think the inyenzi are beating us now ! @"
i can n't imagine why he is defending himself whereas he used to come to people 's homes to hold meetings .
i did not even know that his name was munyakazi .
he used to come with nyirabagenzi and others to hold meetings .
i can n't imagine why he says he was not involved in killings
whereas he is the one to have sensitized people about the presence of inyenzi !
that is what i had to talk about him according to what i saw .
let 's start by gisimba damas
my names are mutezintare gisimba damas son of gisimba and mukamanzi dancile
be brief . you only have three minutes
briefly , i met him during the war .
i was at nyamirambo , in my orphanage
there were many displaced children because there had been an orphanage for a long time .
many children having lost their parents escaped there . there are even those who were killed there .
the war was very cruel ; the interahamwe often attacked us but failed to harm us .
try to be quick , mister gisimba
something important i did is that i hid people
the operation to displace people was carried out by major karangwa
he and about four gendarmes took us from nyamirambo .
we went to saint @-@ michel . once munyakazi came there .
he came , observed and did not say a thing .
we were hosted by father karibushi , the then parish priest .
he had first hesitated and i told him @: "@ these are displaced people of mine . remember the vow you made to god !
all people are your sheep . these are mine i put within your hands .
they are yours as well @"@ . i did not see him anymore . soldiers abruptly got in .
i resisted because i could see that they wanted to trick me in order to kill them .
i could n't see in lycee notre dame anything that would separate me from the children .
i went on tricking them till they were all confused and gave up .
during those days we arrived , interahamwe killed none of mine or displaced people .
no one was killed by interahamwe at saint @-@ michel
do you mean that no one died at saint @-@ michel ?
no one died when i was there . we stayed there for very few days ,
then inkotanyi found us there on 4th and many soldiers were escaping on the 3rd .
i found rpf soldiers who wore differently .
they saw me , called me and asked me who i am . i told them . they told me to go back
that 's fine . we only wanted to know whether people did not die there or ...
do you have any other information to give us ?
no people died there !
introduce yourself
my names are gatete francois . i was born in kibuye . i am the son of gashonga and mukabashinga fayini .
i , gatete francois , swear to god
i will talk about what happened in1990 because i do n't know much about 1994
i want to talk about the former prefect of kibuye , donatien
who , he is telling us , was among the officers he commanded in ruhengeri .
he is saying that he got the information that kabera assiel and mp donatien ruhima
were wrongfully accusing him . i am talking as someone who fully knows him @:
major general sitting here behind .
those two men were misfortunate and beaten
at nyamirambo stadium . he wanted to evoke them because of what he did to them .
assiel i have just evoked died of wounds . he had been shot at there at nyamirambo .
he was cruelly tortured . maybe someone will talk about it .
he and others with him only took porridge . once , this man and his group of
interahamwe and gendarmes prohibited that they be given the porridge anymore .
they could put off their shoes and take the porridge with them .
i ensure you , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel ,
that only assiel himself would tell the munyakazi 's deeds if he was alive .
fortunately for him he died . assiel 's death shocked me . he pitifully died .
because it was a pitiful one . we people from kibuye , have not understood it yet .
there are different rumors outside there . fortunately we 've just had one to ask .
kabera assiel died with rotten feet because of major general munyakazi !
donatie was his brother .
i would like to let him know that kabera assiel 's father and donatien 's
parents are our family members . so , saying that people from kibuye .....
i would like to ask gacaca courts to study the case of 1990's survivors
who were here at nyamirambo , who were beaten and tortured .
i may only tell you that we have failed to understand kabera assiel 's death .
but now that we know he had been told that there was someone secretly hunting him ,
that he [ munyakazi ] jailed donatien till he was shot at without having given such a testimony at least ,
that we did not know how he was shot to death , major general shall have to pay that . we will go to all tribunals to accuse him of that !
my names are rwanyange robert , my father is rwanyange aloys and my mother marie .
i , rwanyange robert , swear to god that what i am going to say is true .
people have been talking about the colonel 's actions . we were at lycee notre dame de citeaux .
the place has been evoked many times and was one of places he had to control .
we went to ... on april 30th 1994 ,
those who were lucky to survive , we went to hide in a small forest that was there .
around 10 or 11 , munyakazi with gendarmes came to lycee notre dame de citeaux .
they called people and some including me kept hiding .
some women were discovered where they were hiding because it was very near .
after some time , munyakazi could even call @: "@ show yourselves ! show yourselves !
i am lieutenant @-@ colonel @"@ . we had not even recognized him before .
those who thought we would get killed if we showed ourselves , we stayed there .
he knew that people were killed and told us @: "@ do not worry , your people are safe @"@ .
they had been taken through one path that goes down from lycee in order to be killed somewhere else .
they told him @: "@ we know they died @"@ . he replied @: "@ do not worry ! nothing bad happened to them ! @"@ .
i knew that they were dead . so , i would like to ask him to tell us about their death .
that is all of my testimony .
what are your names again ? how old were you ?
a list of people who died at lycee is available .
i wonder if i could have it . they were about 18 when getting registered .
what is his name ?
abel
what about friends ?
mwumvaneza , kagorora andre , a lady called grace and many others .
there was rugaba as well .
many people were taken from there . i would like to learn about our people 's death in lycee
my names are jean bosco . i was born in former gishoma commune
tell us your parents ' names first .
june at saint @-@ paul . when inkotanyi came to take people over there i was unlucky to stay there with other few people .
we stayed there with someone whose deeds should be highly exalted !
his name was leonard . he was a watchman at saint @-@ paul . i remember that , once interahamwe attacked saying they wanted people who stayed there ,
leonard put me into a hole . he told me that he thought i would be killed by this one .
i was saved by him . he was a watchman . many people know him .
leonard could tell me everything because i could not go out .
on 20th , it was said that gendarmes who guarded saint @-@ paul would no longer stay .
they would be transferred . by the way , i stayed because someone
he was with ... you have heard of him .
he had told me not to move because an order had been given ; to kill people who shifted from saint @-@ paul to sainte @-@ famille .
i stayed there that night . interahamwe kept coming to rob in saint @-@ paul
because people had left rushing and lost their stuffs there .
i was there every single night they came for robbery .
once i went asleep
and around 4 a.m. bullet shots awakened me ;
people of sainte @-@ famille were being killed .
i could only see him in a car . i had never come close to him .
on 20th , when we were ordered by interahamwe to go to sainte @-@ famille ,
munyakazi joined the interahamwe who stationed on saint @-@ paul yard .
there was a barrier set by the interahamwe near a kiosk that was there .
they wanted to kill me there . i felt some courage and thought to beg this man 's help ;
i said @: "@ i am innocent . you should rather be fighting inyenzi who are at kicukiro and elsewhere
but not be killing hutus , your blood , at sainte @-@ famille ! @" he said @: "@ watch out guys ! this one was in the car . he never got off ! @"
he asked me @: "@ hey you , are you hutu ? @" i answered @: "@ yes i am hutu @"@ . he asked again @: "@ where do you come from ? @"
"@ i am from kimbogo ; bucyana and bigoli were from our village @"@ .
the two communes , gishoma and kimbogo were very close to each other
i said the two men were my uncles . this man ordered to release me .
the interahamwe accompanied me to sainte @-@ famille .
i thought @: "@ if i reveal my names and origin , i will get killed @"@ .
what i thought was actually true . i went to sainte @-@ famille and took the name of ntezirya .
republican guards could sometimes come there and say that they were sent by their chief . i never knew who it was .
i saw the republican guards coming to sainte @-@ famille but i never knew what they were coming for ;
and saved us . that is what i can remember about munyakazi
lycee notre dame de citeaux @: on april 30th 1994 , the day this man has just evoked .
it is true that extremist soldiers who were in staff headquarters went to lycee notre dame de citeaux
because they were supposed to control the area . a battalion was appointed to control the area . what he said , that nuns called father karibushi on phone is true as well ;
they told him what was taking place . karibushi called me because i controlled the area of saint @-@ paul cathedral .
you should also tell us who participated in those attacks and killed people , sir !
i told you they were soldiers from staff headquarters as well as the interahamwe . they went to take people who were here on april 30th ,
1994
those nuns were actually attacked by soldiers as i said it . i left muhima
to lycee notre dame de citeaux . on that day , i met the nuns and i gave gendarmes to them
i ordered captain ... to appoint gendarmes to protect lycee notre dame de citeaux .
i was just asked where those soldiers and interahamwe took them . i do n't know .
they called me for help and i helped them . i guess there is nothing bad in it .
as far as the attack at cela is concerned , i think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ?
he just said that he arrived at cela on april 7th .
what about the attack of april 22nd ?
people who were at cela moved to saint @-@ paul center and we protected them there .
do you agree that there are those who survived at cela and moved to saint @-@ paul where you protected them ?
yes i do agree that there were people who escaped from cela by jumping over walls . however , i did not head that interahamwe 's attack . that is all i can add .
what do i think about the red car all people have been insisting on ?
i think i even started with it , saying that i never travelled in that car !
i never travelled in that car at all as people are saying .
i absolutely reject that i travelled in that red car . never !
maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel munyakazi !
during genocide it was used by others but
you had yours somewhere not far !
the car never got to ... i never travelled near it .
never ! concerning the groups that killed people in kigali ;
they were many . there were interahamwe as we 've been saying . the last one has just evoked republican guards who used to come where he was .
there were even many intelligence agents employed by other authorities .
so munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes !
you should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel !
had the groups entered saint @-@ michel cathedral , i would tell you their names .
but the other area was controlled by nyarugenge territory company as i have already told the court . the groups were mrnd , cdr under the staff command
who abducted people ? those groups of killers must be responsible for it . i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , was not commanding those groups .
the accusations about what happened at saint @-@ andre brought against me are all wrong as well .
the accusations are wrong ones . i never arrived there . i only arrived at father 's house . i was with major ngirabatware .
after the killing of eight brothers , father blanchal called ngirabatware asking him that we might go to carry brothers who were with him .
we first went to saint @-@ michel cathedral . we then went to carry them . we brought the first group to saint @-@ michel cathedral .
you may ask father blanchal and those brothers .
i never headed any attack against saint @-@ michel or his parish
please sir , remember your duty was to protect the population and i can realize that you mainly concentrated your efforts on priests and brothers .
why did you forget other people who were being killed because of their ethnic group ?
we actually saved many people . the only problem is that even someone i carried in my car denies it when he arrives here !
however , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned .
i am telling you that all priests who were in kigali are alive .
all priests and brothers who were in the area of plateau are alive
no one died and all were saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi but once you save man and he comes here to accuse you as i have just seen it here .
please sir , you have seen yourself people who have been here to say something . they have not been appointed by the court . we do not even now them .
in addition , you asked to come and give the testimony on your own initiative and the administration only convened people
we have come just as court agents to listen to your testimony . our questions are based on what people have said .
we want to ensure you about that .
there are a lot of things about the meetings you held in rugenge . so , ...
the meetings , going outside and say there was no shit , supplying killers ... can you imagine as an authority having gendarmes under your command ! ...
concerning destroying houses in kigali , i think you can see it yourself that areas controlled by gendarmes were safe . saint @-@ michel cathedral was not destroyed ,
sainte @-@ famille was not , saint @-@ paul was not
hotel mille collines was not as well . saying i sensitized about destroying houses is just a lie .
those of saint @-@ paul , sainte @-@ famille ... you know it yourself and all people do . why did you deploy your men there ?
was it to protect houses after having failed to protect people ? i would like you to explain it to us .
the group under my command protected people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . you should ask me to explain what happened there if any problem arose at saint @-@ paul cathedral or sainte @-@ famille church controlled by gendarmes as i told you .
nyarugenge territory company , kigali formation and interahamwe attacked the institutions .
someone also o evoked kabera 's death . i did never participate in his killing .
i did not evoke him before because on march 1st 1995 ,
he and others were at saint @-@ paul ... at lycee ... saint @-@ paul center ... sainte @-@ famille church ... with mp rugema . it was in that time people say i took 13 people and carried them in a pickup . they even published it ; i read it . people from kibuye even established a commission
which had to investigate about those men 's rumors . i already explained it . but i tell you that i am not among people who shot at kabera .
thank you mister president , thank you all gacaca court panel members . i have asked to speak as one of the people who were at cela . i arrived there on 7th .
my names are kanzayire bernadette . i am not giving a testimony . i want to have some explanations from our brother general munyakazi .
as it was said , i was at cela . on 22nd , the place was attacked and all people escaped to sainte @-@ famille
and saint @-@ paul . i lived in all those places . munyakazi said that he was in charge of the mobile group .
he also said gave some orders to gendarmes who were at sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and elsewhere .
he said that he gave orders to territory company men because their commander could not be there .
e member of audience this means that those men were just executing orders . i think that general munyakazi should be responsible for everything they might have done since he had taken the responsibility to gave orders to them .
furthermore , in his testimony he did not say anything about the areas of rugenge and muhima .
he only talked about saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines . i have wondered why he has avoided talking about sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and cela .
from caritas ' stores . however , why did n't he help him when saint @-@ paul was attacked ?
he should have helped the only priest we could find because others were hiding .
he would have helped us more like that . i would also like to ask him to tell us what he did when he went to saint @-@ paul @: to get food or whatever ...
what he went there for ? did n't he get any information from gendarmes who were there about people who had been killed there ?
he was called for help but i heard that he arrived after people were already killed .
in 1994 , young men were taken from rooms where they had escaped .
the young men were about 60 . they were killed near the place . lieutenant @-@ colonel knows it but he did not tell the court .
how did he consider that , as someone who had given orders to gendarmes ?
mister president , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca panel ,
what did he do mister president ? thank you !
remember that this is not a party so that we rejoice and clap our hands ! we only thank one for his good deeds .
many people died at saint @-@ paul and i think you already know that
remember you were an authority ; you had men , equipment and weapons to stop killers , who by the way , were not as trained as your men
as far as preventing such catastrophes and lay people having been accidently armed ! you should also tell us about arming the population by the way !
there were many unities . i am going to pass through them as follows @: rwandan army staff with generals here and then ;
gendarmerie staff which was in kigali city ; kigali operation command ;
there were also .... a lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned ,
sorry to interrupt sir ! the question was about saint @-@ paul attacks
and sainte @-@ famille . among your responsibilities as an authority , you had the ability to stop the attacks and save lives of civilians
who had escaped there because of their ethnic groups . we want you to tackle that issue .
i am almost on it . there were twelve gendarmes at saint @-@ paul and twelve at sainte @-@ famille .
there is one who said that people were abducted from saint @-@ paul in the eyes of gendarmes . what were they doing then ?
i told you that the .... entered to abduct people .
i think that the abductors of people from saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille should be asked questions on their own because i was never told that such @-@ and @-@ such went to abduct people .
i would know it if they did it at saint @-@ michel . you have realized that the areas i controlled never experienced such problems .
and sainte @-@ famille to see our gendarme who had died during an attack
at saint @-@ paul . i also told you that i went to saint @-@ paul center after ... i was at hotel de mille collines .
what about those who were at sopetrad , former sopecy i think ?
there were battalion 61 gendarmes at sopecya .
no gendarmes with villagers there ?
i mean those who were with villagers on the barrier at sopetrad .
no , there were no gendarmes there from sopetrad to poids lourd road .
this was guarded by battalion 61 .
we have wished to have the long report so that we may learn more about this matter .
we do not want to this to be too long and boring . he wants to say something before we close this cession . can he ?
but he should be very brief .
i started by introducing myself . i entered esm in 1973 .
when those events broke out , i was lieutenant . the genocide of tutsis started in 1959 .
the genocide of tutsis was planned and implemented by the government of rwanda ,
the governments of rwanda till 4th 1994 @:
from 1 st 1990 till 31 st 1994 .
i was a state employee .
though i was not involved in genocide or any other crimes , i , major general munyakazi , do apologize
for having been employed by the criminal government and governments that killed more than one million people in 1994 and that now i am being accused of those crimes .
in february 1995 , in front of you all ,
i decided to separate from the criminal government that had exiled to zaire
and still planned to invade rwanda in order to resume the genocide of tutsis .
on march 1st 1995 ,
considering what i said on radio rwanda , some thought that i was for the interahamwe 's side .
national gendarmerie and all those services i was reported to investigated and found out that some accusations were faked .
i thank the government of rwanda , the government of national unity
that reintegrated me into rpa and appointed me brigadier commander in ruhengeri and gisenyi . in gisenyi , together with other soldiers , i fought against ex @-@ far and interahamwe
who were planning to resume genocide in rwanda .
rpa beat the interahamwe and ex @-@ far soldiers once again in such a way that they returned to congo and we shall always win !
since november 2002 , i am the second division commander in byumba ,
kibungo , and umutara . together with other rdf soldiers we maintain the population 's security .
i also thank the government of national unity that appointed me rwanda 's representative
for having ranked me colonel , brigadier general ,
major general , what i had never thought of in my life .
panel member please sir , would you say it in the report ?
panel member ladies and gentlemen governmental authorities who have joined us in this cession , next time we shall resume the case of muvunandinda bernard
panel member and try mugisha andre . we hope you will come .
panel member we invite especially people who may have testimonies and offended parties as far as this case is concerned .
panel member another communique is that trial proceedings take place at the sector 's office .
panel member the office of sector 's gacaca court is established there .
this is the 30th of march 2004 , and we are at yves ' house in kicuciro in kigali .
and this is yves .
perharps you could tell me your name and your age .
my name is yves and i am turning 23 years old in august .
yves , how many were you in your family before the genocide , living here ?
before the genocide we were a family of six people living here .
we were four children , my dad and my mom .
and after the genocide ... how many of your family members were murdered during the genocide ?
three of us were left after the genocide .
both my parents and my big brother were killed during the genocide .
could you tell me what are your first memories ? if you were to think back to when you were a child , what is one of the first things that you remember ?
the thing i would remember is maybe the way we would all be together , chatting .
my father used to make us laugh very much .
he was very funny .
he used take us for a ride .
my big brother also used to make us laugh so much when we would be just the children .
how would you describe your relationship with her ?
what did you do together ?
she used to pull me aside in the bedroom and give me plenty of advice about life in general .
even before the genocide she used to tell us that anything could happen , we could find ourselves orphans as they could both die in a car accident , or something could happen to them .
so she would tell us how we needed to stop being childish and grow up , to be hardworking and to be able to take care of ourselves in case we were forced to .
she would give me advice so i can become a man .
tell us about your father .
you said he was a funny man . what things made him funny ?
he was very talkative .
wherever he was maybe in bars with his friends they would be making jokes and when he would come home he would make us laugh as well .
the one thing i always remember is that , every evening , we used to wait for him to come home , even when it was very late because he used to amuse us a lot .
he used to promise us to take us for a ride or give us gifts or money to buy sweets on our way to church .
we always waited for him to come home before going to bed .
if we went to sleep without seeing him , we would find him in his bedroom very early the next morning .
tell me about your big brother .
my big brother was very quiet .
people did not even believe he could talk .
he never used to talk when my dad or my mom were there because he feared them .
so he would act like a very quiet person or a grown up in their presence .
but whenever we would be on our own , with maybe other children in the neighbourhood or from our school , he used to be so funny .
he loved funk music , dancing and movies very much .
in school he was liked very much because he was calm and he loved people .
did you all enjoy music together ?
yes because he used to teach me and tell me what was on fashion .
he loved to read and to listen to the radio .
he used to teach me how to dance in the bedroom . he would show me how to dance and i would imitate him .
tell me , when you look back and remember your family , what is it that you remember ?
happiness ?
warmth ? fun ? what is the strongest memory that you have ? love , care ?
i would say there are two things .
as far as my mother is concerned , i remember very well that even before the war she was once took me to the bedroom and told me that there was a war going on and no one knew what was going to happen .
she told me that they might die or anything could happen to them , that we needed to be strong . it was as though she knew she was going to die .
i remember how she used to pull me aside and tell me , "@ you 're the oldest @" and yet i was n't , i had an older brother .
she would always want to talk to me .
she used to advise me on how to behave , to love people .
as far as my father is concerned i remember how he used to take me out with other men and buy me ‘ brochettes ’ .
my mother even used to get angry with him about it and she would ask me why he was taking her child out at night .
i myself liked it very much , being with my father made me feel invincible .
he also used to tell me to take interest in his things and to take care of my sisters .
during the genocide , what is the memory , which is the strongest , the most difficult for you to recall ?
the thing that hurts the most as far as my parents are concerned is the way they died .
i was told that when they came to get them , my mother had been sick with malaria , she did n't have medication and she had been shivering and throwing up the whole night and they came that morning .
my big brother was moping the floor and listening to the radio even though they were hiding .
what hurts the most about my father is that they shot him five bullets and he was there agonizing for two days with no medication .
he was just there and there was no enough medication .
two days later when he started to feel better , they came back and finished him .
it hurts me and i always feel like it would have been better if he had died right away without going through so much pain .
those are the two most painful things .
where were you at that time ?
we had gone to my grandmother 's place before it started .
they said that here in kigali there was no security and the best thing to do was to split into two and maybe some of us would survive .
i was in gitarama at my grandmother 's place ; it is called igitwe .
how did you find out about the way in which your family was killed ?
they killed them very badly .
before then , they 'd make them walk around for maybe five kilometres , they were about a hundred people and they were shouting at them and beating them up .
the way they died is also something that hurts me a lot .
even the day they killed them , they still run after them , beat them up and insulted them .
they pleaded with them to let them live but they refused .
i think it would have been better for them to die straight away , on the first day .
what was the relationship between your dad and that soldier ?
were they good friends ?
all i can say is that my dad did not have any enemies .
he did not have any problems even with the soldiers .
people in this area liked him because he used to help them out with the problems they 'd submit to him , he used to give them a ride the days he 'd have a car and they days he did not have one they would walk up to the taxi together .
he used to buy them a drink when he 'd have money .
even soldiers did not have any problems with him ; in fact some of them were his friends . he was in good terms with not just the soldiers but with everyone else .
if you saw your dad with that particular man , what would their relationship have been ?
friendly ? would they drink beer together ? would they work together ? would they sit and talk ?
what was that relationship like ?
all my dad 's friends were people he used to meet with ; he met some of them at work or some in bars or on the streets .
he worked very hard and he was very intelligent and the people he used to work with liked him .
his friends in bars were people they used to buy each other a drink and he used to make jokes together .
even the man who betrayed him was his very good friend .
even the people he used to meet elsewhere liked him because he was always ready to help .
our family members used to always come home to visit him or ask him for money or to simply seek advice from him .
there were always people here in our house .
do you know how your mother died precisely ? did somebody tell you ?
as i told you it was on the morning of the 27th , two weeks after the genocide started . she was sick and feeling weak , she sat there for about 2 hours and some people were begging them not to kill them . they were about sixty people . they got her to lay face down the floor and shot one bullet in her head and she died .
from where you were in gitarama , did you see the killings taking place , not of your family but ... ? if so , what did you see ? how did the killers go about doing their work ?
i saw many people being killed .
i remember in particular this man who was found by the interahamwes from his hiding place .
some had clubs , others machetes , they run after him for about five minutes before they caught him .
someone beat him on his head with a club as i was watching .
he did not do anything ; he just fell down and died right away .
the other thing i saw is this girl who was also killed very badly .
they found the place where she was hiding also and run after her .
she was left there agonizing for about thirty minutes and i was hearing everything .
i saw her dying but i did not have the strength to approach her , as they were still standing next to her , laughing , happy to have found a prey .
how did you feel ? what was your predominant emotion at that time ? what was your main feeling at that time yves ? how were you feeling inside ?
i was still a child but inside of me i was very sad .
i was also scared but it reached a point where all the fear went .
i reached a point where i felt like i did not know what was going on , or where i was .
seeing a human being killing another one or running after him or her .
seeing them agonizing or having wounds all over their bodies because they cut them down is something i was not capable of grasping or fully understanding .
i was so miserable ! there 's a day i kept feeling very sad without really knowing why .
i felt very uncomfortable , very confused despite the fact that it had been a good day as no one was chasing after me .
i wrote down the date and i later on found out that it was around that time that my family was murdered .
i had spent the whole day crying without really knowing why .
it was quite a peaceful day as no one had come where we were hiding on that day .
but on that day i was not at peace at all , i kept thinking about home , about my brother .
i wrote down the date and kept the peace of paper and memorized the date .
later on i found out that it was the time it happened .
when did you find out about your parents and brother ?
when did you find out what had happened ?
i was told about it after the genocide .
i was so convinced they were still alive ; i had convinced myself that they were not dead .
i learnt about it later on in august . the people who knew what had happened did not know how to tell us , as they did not know how we were going to handle it .
one day my sister and i had a long conversation and she told me what had happened . it was in august , when the genocide was over .
i did not know where they were and we spent some months living on our own without any family members .
could you describe for me something that you saw during the genocide that really stays in your mind that you can not get out of your mind ?
the thing about the genocide that i can never forget is first of all the fact that my parents were killed .
the ways in which people were killed , and yet they were innocent children , innocent women , innocent parents , is also something i can never forget .
jumping over dead bodies , not being able to sleep , having to steal a jacket from the dead all these are things i can never forget .
i can never forget .
i can not go to bed without thinking about them and remembering how they were killed , or without thinking about other children who died or other people i knew . it is not something that i can ever forget .
what does it mean to be a survivor ?
what is the consequence for you as a person ?
surviving taught me the value of life .
when you escape death , when maybe someone was about to cut you down and does not do it and you 're still alive the next day , that is when you appreciate life .
you then realize that your life or other people 's lives are of great value .
you understand that everyone gets affected by things just like you do .
i now think twice before i do something bad to others because i know it hurts others as much as it could hurt me .
it taught me respect for both my life and for other people 's lives .
how were your parents buried yves ?
i would say that they way they buried them did not please me .
in the rwandan culture , when someone dies , people come and mourn with you .
they killed them and threw them into some garbage , so to me they were not buried .
that is actually one of the things that really hurt about the genocide .
i wish we had at least buried them as a family .
i would n't say that they were buried because getting somebody 's body and throwing it anywhere and yet they were some respectable and innocent person is not a burial .
it is so wrong !
can you tell me where you found them and when you found them and how you found them ?
people had seen them as they were at the neighbours .
even my sister who was with them saw the way they killed them .
he showed me the place and we decided to exhume them as the grass was growing over it in order for us to bury them in a better way no matter how hard that was .
at least we buried them the way everyone else is buried , in a way that honours them .
yves , do you think you can forgive the people who killed your parents and your brother ?
it is very hard .
forgiveness is not easy .
i can not just say that i can forgive the person who took my parents away , the person who made me the way i am , who made me to be different from other children , without the affection and the presence of my parents .
forgiveness is not easy and it is not something i could do on my own .
it is already hard enough to forgive the person who killed other people apart from my parents .
forgiving my parents ' murderer is a lot more difficult ; it is something that would require that i think about it for a long time .
do you feel that justice has been done for you and your family ?
justice ?
since i do not even know where the person who killed my family is ; maybe he is somewhere in jail ... to me , it is like nothing has been done as far as justice is concerned .
when you see someone who killed your family members being condemned for something like five years , you know that , sooner or later , the five years will be over and then he will be released .
being imprisoned is a punishment yes , but personally justice has not yet come my way because i have never seen it .
they have never judged the people who killed my family , so that i maybe say that they were condemned to death or to life imprisonment .
therefore , i do n't consider that as a punishment , actually i wonder which type of justice that is .
neither have i ever analysed it to see if it [ justice ] has been done to me .
i once saw one of the people who were present and who were happy about it even though he is not the one who killed them .
what did you say ? what did you do ? how did you react ?
i did not have the strength to talk to him .
i saw him and i was so overwhelmed that i did not know what to say .
i felt like maybe if i had talked to him , i could have said or done something wrong out of anger .
i chose to leave . he was going to be questioned in gacaca court .
i did not have the strength to even approach him and ask him something .
there was nothing to talk about , he knew who i was and i also knew him .
should i have greeted him ? i did not know what to do so i left it there .
do you think we learn anything from the genocide ? is the genocide useful in any way ?
personally the genocide taught me the value of life , it taught me to appreciate having parents .
loosing them is what makes you realize the importance of having them .
the genocide taught me respect for other people 's lives as well as respect for my own life .
that 's it !
yves do you think the genocide is possible again here ?
i think it is impossible .
from what i see i believe it can never happen again .
when i look at the way today 's youth really fights against it all and the way they really want to fight it and remember it no matter how hard it is , and when we look at the consequences it had on us , i do n't think it is possible !
i think it is impossible !
and as we were saying , we need to do all we can for it not to happen again .
are you just being hopeful , or do you believe it ?
i believe my future will be good ; my desire is to be responsible for my life and to be able to help others the way we used to be before .
it will take a good education , which is a must for one to be able to have a good life and to be able to help out others .
others who are poor and whose lives are worse than mine .
i believe i will soon be able to help them out with the little i will be having .
i believe the future will be better than the last ten years have been .
what do you think rwanda has to learn as a country ? and how is the best way to do it ?
rwanda is a small , beautiful country and i believe all rwandans should learn to love each other and to help each other out .
they also need to always remember what happened and to try and love each other and to help each other out .
because for all this to happen , people did not love or respect each other .
nobody respected other people 's loves .
it will take a lot to make it happen as each rwandan has his or her own problems ; if people were understanding what challenges we go through individually , we would be able to help each other more effectively .
what 's the most difficult aspect of being a survivor ?
the thing that constitutes a challenge in being a survivor is remembering what happened to you .
sometimes as a survivor you can remember so many bad things that it destroys your life , it stops you from doing anything .
you can change to become a very wicked person because of the things you saw or the things you went through .
being a survivor can make life very hard as i said because of what you saw .
what you saw might change the way you look at people and it can even stop you from loving anyone .
your love for people can be completely destroyed . you get to see so much evil that you do not fear anything anymore .
even afterwards , life becomes so challenging that you can not achieve anything in life .
you sleep and you 're woken up by nightmares of people with machetes who want to kill . or you remember the child you saw being killed .
that 's the thing that i think can be such a challenge for the survivors .
it affects them for the rest of their lives .
you said that your mother gave you advice on how to behave when she is no longer here . how have you done that ? what 's the advice that she gave you and how have you done that ?
maybe i can talk about how she told me how i should behave in her absence .
she told me , "@ you should love people and always think of living with people peacefully . @"
then i wondered why she told me that but later on ; when she was no longer there , i thought about it again and i realized how important it is .
i always think about it and try my best to live in good terms with everybody .
even when somebody hurts me , i try not to focus on that , as it is something that has to be there .
i try to love people and to understand people and what kind of challenges they face in life .
it is something i try my best to be able to put into practice .
you 've been working on the project in gisozi .
why ... ?
because the gisozi project is ours and we need to be the ones to do it .
if i do not do it , who else will do it ?
not everyone is capable of doing it .
spending all your time looking into the lives of people who died and looking at their pictures is very sad .
but i do so and i do it with all my strength because it needs to be done .
so that even the people who want them to be forgotten will have failed .
i think the day the project is completed it will have a lot of impact .
it is very helpful even to us .
the day you will want to remember your friends or your family , you will be able to go there .
that 's why i give myself fully to that project because it will be of great help .
it will even show the international community that the genocide actually happened .
thank you !
is there anything that you feel you should say that i have n't asked ?
i do not have much to add but the only thing i can say is that life after ten years is a very difficult life .
some people think that the genocide is over and there 's absolutely no problem .
in fact it is now after ten years that some people are starting to realise the consequences of the genocide .
some people are getting to understand what genocide is . people are still hurting .
when someone tells you that they have been unhappy for ten years , they mean it .
life ten years later is a tough one and this is still too soon , we still have a long way to go and despite the fact that those who did it do not want us to progress , we will try and move forward .
and i believe god will help us to do so and to be able to help one another .
the survivors do not live in good conditions , the orphans have a difficult life and they need other survivors to be able to share the challenges they go through and also the victories , the way out .
i think us survivors need each other .
very few people who are not survivors can actually be able to help out a survivor .
whereas a survivor can encourage another one better , as he or she is the one who can relate to what they are going through and who can show them that is it actually possible to overcome .
sometimes hearing about the challenges other people go through makes you feel like yours are less important .
it instils some strength in you ! that 's my opinion !
my name is murengezi wilberforce .
i am 58 years old .
wilberforce perhaps you could just tell me , how many people were in your family before the genocide ?
there was my wife and i and our five children .
and how many of your family are left after the genocide ?
i met my wife a long time ago when we were still in secondary school ; we went to the same school .
we fell in love then . after high school , we were engaged for four other years before we got married .
then in 1971 , we got married .
therefore , she was not a girl i just met and married but we were together for a long time before marriage .
even our parents knew each other because they were both pastors in the episcopal church in rwanda .
so we spent thirty @-@ three years together .
sorry that was n't true ; by 1994 , we had been married for twenty @-@ three years .
we had two sons and three daughters together in those twenty @-@ three years .
tell me about your second child .
my second born was called jean @-@ claude .
he was a very tall guy .
he was in his 6th year of secondary school , almost finishing high school .
he was a very quiet guy .
he liked listening to the radio news , which used to make me predict that maybe in the future he would become a journalist or a politician .
there 's nothing much i can say about him because he was not very talkative .
but he loved to listen to others talking .
there 's nothing more i can say .
when i was leaving , i called him and told him to be the one to drive the car when they go to a place where they were planning to go with his mother .
the last thing i told him was not to drive too fast and to be careful on the road . that 's all i can say .
tell me about your third child .
she was a girl called kayitesi claudette .
she was also in her last year of secondary school .
she was not very healthy but she was very bright in school . i thought she would have a very good future .
as any parent i wanted the best for her and since she was very good in science , i thought she was going to be a medical doctor .
what about the fourth born ?
my fourth child was francine ingabire .
you have her on your photos .
she loved her sister claudette very much ; she loved to swim .
she was always there to talk to us after work , she would chat with us and ask her what we needed .
not many children do that but she would come and ask us if we wanted a drink or some water or tea .
she was a child who cared a lot about her parents .
perhaps more than her older brothers and sisters did .
what is your special memory of her ?
yes i do believe in god and i still work for him until this day .
i am not a pastor like my father but i do what i can .
i love to sing and i lead some children in a choir .
i do it because i guess there is a mission that god left me to complete in my remaining lifetime .
can you tell me how your wife and your children died ?
i was n't there like i told you before .
but celine my daughter who survived told me some of the things .
also some neighbours who escaped death by hiding and fleeing told me about it .
we were living in kicukiro .
on the first day they came to ask my family , "@ who is murengezi ? @"
they told them i was not there .
they shot my wife on the feet and said , "@ we shall come back . find him ! @"
they did not come back until the 8th when my family went to hide in a convent which was in the neighbourhood .
on the 10th , they came and told them that everybody should go down , as they wanted to check their identity cards .
they stood next to a roadblock and took them to a hole nearby , one by one .
some were shot dead , others were killed with a hammer , and some others were hacked .
in fact , someone told me that my wife was last taken as she was limping and they shot her inside the hole where the others were .
the hole is still there ; we have constructed it .
about a hundred people in our neighbourhood died and we buried them all together in the same grave , which we built up .
there were other people in my house apart from my wife and my children .
the people who were working for us were also there .
there was a lady , a friend of ours who used to work for us . she had stopped working for us as we got for her another job , she happened to be at home on that day .
they checked her id and found out she was a hutu and they told her to leave .
she was helping out my wife who was wounded and she told them she was n't going to leave and they could kill her if they wanted .
so they murdered her right there next to my wife .
because he was tall , claude , according to what his sister told me , was beaten with a club on his head and they threw him inside the hole .
after hitting you with a hammer or with something else , then they would shoot you in order to stop people from making noise .
some of the survivors told me about a soldier , i do n't know his name , who came and told the interahamwe to make sure they [ victims ] do not make too much noise . @"
do it as fast as possible , do n't give them time to beg you to stop ; after beating them with a club just shoot them .
we do not want people 's bodies on the street as satellites are watching us . @"
i was told this by my neighbour who managed to hide , his wife was also killed .
the truth is that i did not see any of this ; it is my young daughter celine who told me about it .
i do n't know if it is god who sent somebody but a soldier came and said that all the young children should go back to the nuns ' home .
celine was only nine years old then and so she went back to the nuns ' home because that man told them to do so .
the other thing that happened is that her mother gave her the car keys and told her to give them to her dad [ me ] in case she would be lucky to see him again .
but she never gave them to me because they were running and even the car was ...
what happened to francine ?
about francine ... i do n't know anything about what happened to her .
her younger sister does not say anything about her although she saw many things happen .
but she just told me that they hacked her with a machete .
i do n't like to ask her too many questions , because i know she does not like to talk about it .
sometimes when i ask her something she answers , but she is unable to have a long conversation about it .
what does it mean to be a parent who has lost his wife and his children ?
at first , it felt like it was a nightmare but as time goes you get to realize that it has actually happened because you do not get to see them anymore !
sometimes i talk to them at night as if they were still around !
it is a big problem because it can never disappear completely .
god blessed me with another wife and two more children .
you can never completely forget , especially at this time of the year you think about them and remember them .
you can never be the same person again , your character and your whole being change . you can never forget ; it is impossible !
after living the family you lived with for twenty @-@ five years , i have told you that i met my wife in my childhood and we grew up together , we got married and we got kids and suddenly it was all gone .
sometimes you wonder why you survived !
it is a very tough question .
because , for one to be able to forgive , you first of all need to know whom you 're forgiving , you can not forgive if no one asks you to forgive him or her or when you do n't know who it is you 're forgiving .
or maybe when nobody has come to ask for forgiveness so that you can at least acknowledge that they were going through some sort of madness .
the word "@ forgiveness @" is a tough one .
but i believe if someone would come to me and say , "@ i betrayed you , i murdered your wife , i murdered your kids @"@ , i would forgive them .
i 'd also become a murderer if i killed them .
i would truly forgive them but the question is who to forgive .
who is it ?
not all hutus killed .
therefore you can not say that you 're forgiving the hutus .
you need to know who did it and then be able to say that , so and so did this to me but i forgive him or her .
as a christian i know it is written , "@ forgive others as i forgive you . @"
therefore , as a believer i truly believe it is possible to forgive but you ought to know whom you are forgiving .
so if they came before me and asked me to forgive them , i could do it .
that 's the way i can put it . but the condition is that they would say it .
you can not forgive in general . who is it you 're forgiving ?
i think that is what we lack here in rwanda , that someone would come and acknowledge that they betrayed you , that they killed your people .
if it were the case , people would forgive .
very few people acknowledge what they did and you wonder if these people killed themselves , if they just happened to die .
it is so obvious when you compare the number of the victims to the number of those who acknowledge being the perpetrators of the genocide .
the same people who were our neighbours .
i 'll give you the example of one of my neighbours called simbizi , there was one house between his and mine .
we had known each other for a long time .
when they arrested him they asked me to come and identify him .
when i got there they asked him if he knew me , he said no !
you see how difficult it is !
someone we used to live with and spend a lot of time with , his child used to come home and share meals with mine and he said he does n't know me and yet we were neighbours !
despite the fact that we were neighbours , he said he did n't know me .
that shows how much forgiveness will be difficult as long as rwandans will not tell the truth about what they did . otherwise , forgiveness is for sure the ideal thing to do .
so is justice possible or not ?
do you feel justice has been done for your children ?
so far , no ! no justice has been done so far !
in my opinion , not yet and i believe even others feel the same way .
because what justice can be done to somebody who wiped out your children , all your family ?
what do you gain when they are imprisoned for five , or six or ten years ?
what punishment is that ?
justice will be done according to the laws of the country , but many will never be known and that is a very big issue because many have fled from where their former residence .
they now live in places where they are not known .
or maybe they are known but nobody has the courage to report them for fear that they might take revenge afterwards .
it is a very big issue in rwanda . it will be very difficult unless they ask for forgiveness and confess their sin and acknowledge them .
how does it make you feel personally that you were n't there when your family died ?
i got sick , with a weird sickness i had never heard of before .
my whole body was itching and i was scratching myself all over .
i went to see a doctor and they could n't give me any medication .
the psychologist told me that it 's ok to cry when i feel like it and that i could do it as much as i wanted maybe when i am alone .
i was in nairobi , kenya then , all by myself .
during the day i used to walk around and spend time with others who were in the same situation .
but almost every night , i would remember everything and i would feel like i did not know where i was .
in reality , apart from my close family , i lost many other relatives .
my big brother who was also my neighbour , his wife and my father , some children who were living with them , you know the way the african family is , were also all killed .
there was my brother @-@ in @-@ law and his wife and their six children who had also died .
my father @-@ in @-@ law and my mother @-@ in @-@ law also died .
it felt like you were left completely on your own .
john is the only one i knew who was still alive because he was studying abroad and we used to talk on phone .
at that time i did n't know that celine survived , i thought she also died .
so i felt like there was no one left , either on my side , or on my wife 's side .
we were lucky to later on find out that two of our relatives survived as they took refuge at mille collines hotel .
also two of my wife 's sisters survived .
so after the war , being able to find out that some people were still alive was very encouraging and motivated us to want to continue to live and give your best .
especially because somebody needed to look after the children who survived so that they could study and live a good life and achieve something .
how would you like them to be remembered ?
especially on the days that were made for remembrance , on the 7th , the day of commemoration is a day one gets to remember them a lot .
even though we remember them anyway , that day is a day you share with other rwandans in doing so and it helps us to think together and look for a way for this never to happen again in rwanda .
and that it should not happen to anybody else worldwide because it is terrible !
i also enjoy looking at their photos .
my sister who was living in kinshasa , congo drc had many of their photos .
she is the one who gave me even the photos i showed you since the house and everything in it was burnt up .
so i sometimes sit down and look at them and i remember !
i think about them and wonder how the children would be today , how their mother would be ... it is something i remember very much .
nobody can stop you from remembering your people who were so much part of your life .
even though some people do not want us to remember or to talk about it , we can not forget them .
we will always remember and even our children need to be told about it .
perhaps our biggest mistake was that we never believed it could actually happen .
but now we know it is possible , we are aware that people can betray others and wipe up entire families .
it is something we need to fight against in our thinking and this can be done through teaching and also in fighting against it with all our strength .
but i believe that the younger generation and the youth , if they keep on teaching .... educational method is the primary idea .
after all , it was through education that everything came up .
therefore , education is what will take it away .
nothing else can !
finally what is your ... how do you feel about the future ? wilberforce , who are you today and how do you view the future ? are you optimistic ?
are you faithful ?
how do you feel ?
ha ha ... !
[ he laughs ] in the beginning i told you that i am a man of god . i have faith that things will be good . i trust in a better future for our country .
the future of our country will be good ; but for it to be good , we will need to work towards it .
if we do not work for it , it will n't happen ; but if we do , our future will be good .
it is not only murengezi 's responsibility or the government 's responsibility .
all rwandans need to understand that if we want to build a better future and to avoid what we went through in the past , we will have to work on it .
things will never happen miraculously .
that 's all i can tell you .
tell me about your mother .
describe her for me .
my mother was tall and brown ; she had soft hair .
she liked dressing in skirts and shirts .
that 's what i can say about my mother .
she was a very funny person .
but she could also be a tough person !
this is the 30th of march 2004 , and we are in kigali , kicuciro .
and , we are talking about beatha .
beatha , tell me about your mother .
umh ... my mother was called uwimana devote .
she was very brown and tall .
she was a very funny person .
but she could also be a tough person ! she loved everybody .
sorry , please tell me more about your ... tell me about your first memory of your mother ...
it was on christmas time .
i used to go to church on christmas and they used to buy us new clothes .
so i would be very smart in church on that day and i would always find nice food at home .
i used to enjoy spending time with her chatting in the kitchen .
what was special about those ocassions ... on that ocassion of christmas .
everybody used to go to church on that day , even the people who had not been to church in a long time .
and it was the day we 'd eat special meals .
and the other thing that made it special was that many families used to gather together on that day and share drinks , different local beers and several others .
i forgot to ask you a basic question at the beginning . can you just give me your name and age ?
my name is uwazaninka beatha , i am twenty @-@ four years old .
can you tell me about ... when you look back in your family life , what were the things that were important to you as a child ?
the most important thing to me ... something that was special for me was being with my family .
i felt very strong , i felt like even the thunder could not harm me , being with my family made me feel very safe .
being with my family gave me "@ moral @"@ .
it made me feel like there was no problem . i felt very strong .
tell me about your grandmother .
what are your memories of your grandmother ?
what happened to my grandmother was ... she was killed in 1987 .
it was on the eve of 1988 so they came and killed her .
she died a painful death .
that is what happened to her .
i was seven years old then .
can you maybe just tell me in one sentence how your grandmother was killed ?
umh ... umh !
she was hit with a hammer in the head and she immediately died .
then they pulled her out of the house going to throw her body .
but , they dumped her somewhere i used to play during day time .
what are your feeling about your grandmother when you remember her ? not what incident , but when you remember her as a person
eeh ... i feel so hurt whenever i remember that they killed her at a time when we were planning to shift and go to live in uganda .
i always feel like if she had n't died , i would n't have seen the genocide and everything else that followed . we would have been outside [ the country ] .
her death had many consequences on my life [ in the long run ] .
can you just tell me ... tell me what ... maybe what ... tell me what happened to your mother ?
my mother they ... on the 14th of april 1994 , that is when she was killed together with many others among our neighbours .
they threw them in the river nyabarongo after they had hacked them into pieces and cut down their thighs .
that is what i know that happened to her .
were you with her ?
i was not with her . it was during easter holidays .
the war started while we were n't together .
how do you know what happened to your mother ?
on the 15th , as i was walking around the nyamirambo market when i met a man who told me how she died .
he was from our home .
later on , after the war , it was confirmed to me that what he told me was the truth .
do you know who killed your mother ?
from what i was told , they came in a big group of interahamwe but the man who killed her was called rwakatsi .
he was our neighbour .
did you know that man ?
yes , i knew him ... we were neighbours .
can you say it in one or two sentences ?
they did so many things .
they killed many people , in many ways @: some were immediately killed ; some women were raped before they killed them , and some were crucified on trees .
it started way before , in 1990 and the killing increased in 1994 .
in 1990 they were already teaching them how to kill , as they were preparing the genocide .
if we had known that the interahamwes were going to kill that way , we would have fled before , we never thought it would reach that extent .
people were murdered in many different ways .
can you just describe for me their attitude when they were doing it ?
they had various attitudes as they were doing it , some were laughing , they were very proud of themselves as they thought they were working for the country , others had an expression of anger in the eyes .
however , in most of cases , nobody was paying attention to their attitude as by the time they would reach you , it would feel as though you were already dead .
you would feel like you had no life left inside of you .
so they were coming in whatever ways they wanted to .
they had the power .
can you descride for me that story you told me before where you saw a woman and her daughter being raped ?
i did not actually see them but i heard them .
they were raping them some where down the place where i was hiding .
it was a daughter and her mother .
the daughter was about fourteen or sixteen years old .
it was a big group of interahamwe in nyamirambo .
i put some clothes in my mouth to stop myself from screaming so they do not find me . that 's all .
i did not see them ; it was dark , at around two o'clock in the morning .
could you just describe that scene for me , because ... it is quite a difficult scene ? where were you at that time and how did you know what was happening ? could you just describe that for me ?
i was coming from mumena ; it was at night .
i was going down to nyakabanda .
i kept bumping into dead bodies of people who had just been murdered .
i knew what was happening because from where i was , you could tell what was being said and what was being done to them .
i knew they were going to rape them with nothing else in exchange . i t was not as though they had paid any cows as a dowry for them .
i can not describe it to you , unless you had been there yourself .
i felt the pain probably more than they did ; it was as though it was being done to me .
i even saw her picture recently .
she had a twin sister .
i saw it and i was reminded of what happened but i did not talk to anyone about it as i felt like no one was going to feel it the way i did .
it was ... i felt the pain probably more than them .
can you describe to me what was perharps ... the most difficult experience of being on your own during the genocide trying to survive ?
i would n't say that everybody was evil but the majority of the people were . if only few were wicked , it would not have reached such an extent .
i would say that 5 % were good , the other 5 % was neutral and the 90 % remaining was evil .
how would you describe the ... if you had one sentence to say what happened in this country , how would you describe it ?
was it evil and hatred ? was it madness ? what happened ? as you were trying to survive , what was going on in your mind about what was happening in this country ?
i did not think about it then but when i reflect on it today .
i would describe what happened in 1994 as though rwanda had gone down to hell or moved to a different planet .
rwanda was silent . i do n't know how to describe it .
imagine people being killed day and night , minute after minute .
no one intervened or did anything ! the whole country was silent and was busy doing something so wrong !
it was as though we had moved to a different planet . even the entire world was silent as though nobody knew us .
it was as if rwanda had been erased from the earth .
the things that happened are difficult to believe if i can say , they go beyond what we can humanly comprehend .
it goes beyond what one can imagine .
tell me about yahaya .
yahaya is ... i would say that he is a good person because few people did what he did .
he hid over 30 people .
he saved me ; i am sure that interahamwe was going to kill me .
when i run to yahaya 's house while fleeing , he welcomed me into his house and stand by my side .
and i did n't have many people sided with me then .
that 's why i think he was a good man , a righteous man . he did it not even so much because he is a hutu .
he told that interahamwe that he will answer to god the blood he had shed there the previous day and mine as well .
so he did n't even do it in the name of being a hutu but he did it for god . i think he was a righteous man .
tell me about surviving ; what was it like to get through the genocide and find that you 've finally survived ?
after the genocide , it still felt like hell .
there were dead bodies all over the place , everywhere you passed , you 'd see corpses .
i remember seeing a baby that was breastfeeding on its mother 's dead body and i did nothing to stop the child , as i myself felt so confused .
i did n't know what was going on .
surviving that time felt like walking through some bush after it has been burnt .
i felt stupid , as though i did n't know anything .
would you finish the last sentence ?
we lived in saint @-@ andre [ secondary school in nyamirambo , kigali ] for about one week .
i went to see my mother on the 5th no on the 6th .
when i got there was n't a single living .
even the birds were silent .
there were no mice around .
in a word everything was silent and you could only see insects flying over the corpses .
the other thing i recall is meeting a lady who used to be our neighbour ; she was wearing my mother 's clothes .
i came back here to kigali and when i got here i stayed with a certain family that had just come back from exile .
staying with people i did n't know , who were even sometimes speaking a foreign language , was also very hard .
the other thing that was so difficult is that they did n't totally trust me .
as a survivor i could have been with the interahamwe because to them all the tutsis had died .
that was also very hard ; it was even harder than being a survivor because those you stayed with did not believe that you were a survivor .
what was the feeling inside ?
i do n't know what i can compare it to . i can not really express how i felt . there 's nothing i can compare it to .
you reach a point where you feel like you 're nothing , you 're just there and days pass but you 're indifferent to everything .
you 're living a life you 're not used to .
in short you feel so useless .
i remember one day even saying that i should have died , as the dead at least were silent , they were fine .
my thinking was that living a non @-@ sense life was worse than being dead .
my perspective of life was different .
my opinion then was that living was worse than dying .
can you forgive people who carried this out ?
umh !
[ she smiles ] that 's a tough question . i can not forgive . forgiveness is from god .
i am only human ; i am not some sort of air .
all the pain i encounter in life does not leave room for forgiveness .
the life we live in today ... you see the good and that reminds you of what happened .
you see the bad and it also reminds you of what happened . even when you get a big house or a lot of money , you have no one to give it to or to share it with .
you get a big house but it is empty because no family will come and visit you .
so when you think of forgiveness ... maybe you can forgive because there 's nothing else you can do .
and if you do not forgive ... the killers were about 90 % ... it would kill you . you would get a heart attack and die .
you just look at it and leave it .
have you ever met any of the perpetrators who you recognised and know ... or having met anybody who was directly involved in killing members of your family ? if you have n't how would you handle it if it happened ?
i do not know the people who killed my family because i was not there .
i probably meet them without knowing they are the ones .
but the man who was in the group pf the people who killed my mother is there . when you meet them you just buy them a drink or something .
there was a time i met a killer at the taxi park in town and instead of him being the one to have a problem , it is me who had one .
i felt so shocked , my heart stopped beating . i sat down , as i felt dizzy .
i can not tell you that i thought of forgiving them or even of taking revenge .
i was terrified .
i had goose pimples . i can not tell you that i forgave them or anything else , when you meet them you almost loose your mind , you can not think straight !
has justice been done ?
it is tough question because i feel like instead of it being called justice when it is not justice anyway , it would be better that they just let them go free .
that 's all i can wish them . because i would not wish them to be thrown into the river the way they threw my mother into the river .
my mother was drowned into the river together with my uncle , my grandfather and many other members of my family .
therefore throwing just one person in there is useless .
the other thing is that the government takes care of the prisoners ; it has to feed them and provide healthcare for them and they are many .
it would therefore be better to let them free and maybe to sensitise them every month or so to help them become human again as they had probably lost their humanity .
how can you kill the neighbour you used to exchange cows with and share a drink with ?
it 's not normal .
it shows that rwanda was lost as i was telling you , because no one heard its voice then .
we were somewhere where no one could see us .
what i can say about justice ... unless .... even that would not be enough , even if they killed them ... but it does not sound fair to me when it is called justice .
knowing that somebody killed other people the other day and they say he 's an adult !
were the people they killed not adults ?
or saying that they were children !
do children kill ? they do not !
why were they not children while killing ?
let them free them , which is what will make more sense to me . let them come and live with us .
can genocide happen in rwanda again ?
i do n't think so , it can not happen again .
because personally i do n't have a desire to kill in my heart .
if the people who are being released today are going to be sensitised and if remembering what happened will be part of our lives , if there will always be a place where anyone even children themselves can go and acknowledge that it actually happened , and that it was wrong then i do n't believe the genocide will happen again !
what do you think about the future ? ... can you describe for me about the consequences of being a survivor ?
the consequences of being a survivor are very many .
when i look at us the survivor of the genocide , some of us survived without really surviving .
some women who were raped are living with hiv @/@ aids , some survived but they have no one to talk to , that is another type of death , those are some of the genocide consequences .
the other thing is that you can never live a full life again , you live half of a life , and you live a life full of questions , of uncertainties , of maybes .
maybe it is going to happen again , you 're never at peace within your heart .
that 's what they call trauma .
you constantly are traumatized .
your life is incomplete .
for example sometimes i can be walking in town and i look at crowds of people and i see their bodies lying down , as though they were dead .
i look at somebody and i imagine him or her dead .
even me myself i sometimes imagine myself dead .
not so much because i think of death , i am still young , but because of the many people i saw being killed .
those are the consequences of surviving .
you do not look at people and see life in them , you see them dead instead .
how do you want genocide to be remembered ? what is the right way to remember genocide ?
the way genocide should remember ?
i think we should not only remember the genocide every year but also in helping out the survivors .
because remembering what happened only once year does n't really benefit the survivors much .
we should remember it every year , everyday because they do remember it every day , not just once a year .
on an international scale , we should remember the genocide in helping out those who lived through the genocide , the survivors .
we could remember them in teaching the children about it because as far as we 're concerned , we 've already been destroyed .
we need to teach the next generation about the genocide , the descendants of the hutu , the descendants of the tutsi , the descendants of the twa , all need to remember that the genocide actually happened .
it needs to reach a point where those who need to understand where their fathers are faulty understand it , as well as those who need to understand the way their parents were victimized .
in conclusion we need to make sure that even the child who will be born tomorrow will know that what happened in our country was wrong .
do we learn anything from the genocide ?
i feel like beatha today is ... i am not afraid ; i am not worried .
because where i am at today , i do not wish for genocide to happen again . so i am not worried because i am one of the people who say that the genocide should never happen again .
the other thing is i have faith in a better future .
i believe my children and my grandchildren after them will have a good life apart form me who has already been destroyed .
my children will still suffer the consequences of the genocide but their children in the following generation will n't .
the third generation will not live out the consequences of the genocide .
the second one will for sure but the third one will not .
so i look at the future with hope .
my name is uwimpuhwe alice . i am 20 years old and i am from tambwe commune , in tambwe sector , in nyamagana cell .
that is where i was when the war broke up .
both my parents were there too .
in fact at the time , when the war started , i think i was a little bit grown up , i used to see people coming to dad , talking to him , threatening him , saying that they would kill him .
they were mainly our neighbours .
it seemed as though they were in some sort of conflict . they were not friends .
as time passed , i saw the war really spreading , we run away .
i was still with both my parents then .
my dad was killed two days later .
they came home , a man called kayishema took him away , and he never came back .
we do not know what followed until today .
we were rescued with my mother and brothers and sisters , some suggested that we look for a way to go to burundi but when we reached the boarder , we were told that it was too late .
no more crossing the boarder .
therefore , we failed and came back .
on our way back , they wanted to kill me before anyone else .
fortunately , there was a certain man who implored them to let me go with him because i had the same name as his daughter .
he wanted me to go and help his children as a housemaid .
that man was called kayigamba , i still remember him .
he was going to shoot me with an arrow .
my mum begged him suggesting any possible arrangement rather than killing me in front of her .
the man felt sorry for me and he later on took me to his home .
my mum continued her way towards ruhango as she knew there was no other way .
she was not among those who came back . maybe she died by the roadside .
neither her nor my brothers and sisters survived ; my two cousins and i are the only survivors in my family . i am the oldest one .
we met the dad , but he was living together with another woman [ stepmother to the girl ] and she had sons who were brothers to the girl .
her brothers wanted to kill me , but their father stopped them because he loved his daughter so much . she was his first @-@ born .
he said "@ you can not kill this girl in my presence .
if you want to kill her , call my daughter because she is the one who brought this girl here and kill her in my daughter 's presence . @"
the old man was called benjamin .
i lived there for a while with another kid who was brought there by his father to benjamin .
her dad told benjamin that as he was his best friend , he should take care of the child -@ she was his last @-@ born .
look after her , take my cattle and everything , but keep my child safe .
then benjamin came and told us @: that child and i , she was called gakecuru .
he said , "@ i am taking you to be killed . @"
then i frankly told him that he could n't take me . then he told me that if i did n't believe him , he would take the young girl first , to show me that he was serious .
he took the young girl and she was killed .
when he arrived at home , he told me that i was the one next .
i told him to kill me himself instead of delivering me to the perpetrators ; he used to say that he would let the perpetrators kill us so that he would not be responsible .
i convinced him to take me back to the grandmother 's house where i was before maybe i will spend one night .
that is what i told him .
[ benjamin ] the old man gave me his son camakoma to escort me across the river and we went back to where i had been before ; i could n't even remember the place well , i searched for it and i found it .
when we arrived there , the grandmother told me that i could n't spend the night in her house .
at sunset , she threw me out .
she asked me to go and look for another shelter . then i realised that it was not safe to stay in a region i did not know and that i could not hide anywhere because i did n't know where to hide .
in fact she took me to a certain place but i did not trust her ; i thought she would send me perpetrators to kill me .
i decided to go and commit suicide . i threw myself into a river , yes i did .
but the river refused to take me . you know , it was full then as a result of the rainy season .
the river threw me at the bunk .
it was coming to morning as the day starts dawning when the river rejected me ; i could hear birds singing .
i went back and knocked .
she told me that they came looking for me and they never found me where she had left me .
"@ i was around . @" i said .
but then i spend the night with her daughter . the following day we went to gather groundnuts from the grandmother 's field .
at night she suggested to her grandmother to let me sleep inside their house instead of going back to the bushes .
she then promised to take me to the chief of the attackers , emmanuel , the following day so that the chief decides what to do with me .
we went to emmanuel 's place and she said , "@ this girl is from ruhango , i caught her while she was passing by . @"
the man asked me , "@ are n't you a tutsi ? @"
"@ my god , i am not a tutsi ! @" i denied .
"@ are n't you a tutsi ? @"
he asked me again . i said , "@ no , i even do n't agree with what the old woman said about me .
the truth is i was living with my grand mother in butare ; however , my mum had re @-@ married in ruhango .
but i am not a tutsi . @"
he said ; " it is obvious from your looks . @"
then i said i am not a tutsi at all .
but that man did not believe me and he decided to put me on hold before killing me .
they did not kill me that night . in the morning i went back to the so @-@ called grandmother .
she refused to receive me pretending that she did n't want me to be killed in her presence .
then the girl told me we should look for other alternatives .
then i asked her where she thought i could go when her dad had chased me , where she expected me to go .
the man called kayigamba whose daughter was my namesake said ... by then , the attackers were having several meetings .
in fact , in bugesera people had started fleeing .
i went to a place called migina .
there came a man called shiriduwi , i am not sure if it is shiriduwi . he came , pulled me from the roadside where i was sitting with the girl and then asked me what my tribe is .
i kept quiet .
i had nothing to say ... there was another man called biya , who was a young brother to the doctor in that area .
they both knew me very well .
at that time , they were in a meeting and when they came out , they defended me . they said i am from their family .
that 's the way i survived the attackers .
he [ bayi ] told me to go home .
then i told him that i have no where to pass in order to reach home , he then asked his father to take me home because his father had a motorbike . he left for his home and i went to my home too .
he walked away and i also walked away with the old man . we walked for about one kilometre [ 1 km ] and then the other guys [ attackers ] followed me because they wanted to kill me .
some of them said that they would be in trouble if they touched kayigamba 's child meaning me ; because kayigamba was a strong and respected man at the time .
they asked the old man ; "@ are you taking her to kayigamba 's home or to your home ? @"
then he replied that "@ this is kayigamba 's child , i am taking her to kayigamba because he asked me to take her to him .
i went to kayigamba 's home and spent another week there .
there came another man called emmanuel . he was seeking for a place where to hide and then he found a place around kayigamba 's house in a sorghum field .
there was a big tree around , which looked like a guava tree .
he climbed the tree but unfortunately , kayigamba saw him and asked him to come down the tree . later he killed him from the same sorghum field .
we fled together .
but because i was not the real daughter to that man [ kayigamba ] , he would make me carry a very hot pot on my head .
every time , after cooking , they would ask me to carry the pot so that we continue our journey .
we would walk and after some distance , they 'd ask me to go fetch water .
i remember i walked up to rusatira , those ends of butare .
i realised that i was n't going to cope with the situation for long because i joined their family when they used to eat maize paste everyday .
it is made out of maize flour mingled in water .
that is the only food that could satisfy the family .
i was put in charge of grinding maize and separating the fine flour from the big particles .
therefore , i would grind the maize until my hands got swollen .
however , that never stopped me from carrying the pot whenever it was time to move ahead .
it was my daily job .
when we reached rusatira , the nkotanyi came .
however on the way , the perpetrators would kill some of the people who had fled with them . sometimes they would stop and abuse me .
then i decided to stop and go back where we were coming from .
i said to myself "@ there is no difference i may still die . even though i go keep going with these perpetrators , they may reach some where and kill me , i can not change much to my fate . @"
i used to fetch water .
one day , as i was planning to go fetch water , abayi came and told me ; "@ alice , get out ! @"
i went out .
then he said , "@ i know you very well , you are a tutsi .
you will not continue to stress us out for so long .
i was suggesting we kill you and then we proceed our journey without you . @"
i knew there was nothing to lie about because it was true , he knew me .
therefore , i simply kept quiet .
but my hands were swollen and then he asked me , "@ what happened to your hands ? @"
i told him that i was grinding maize grains and then developed corns in my hands , which turned to be boils and later on the boils busted .
then he told some men to take me and kill me .
but there was a dispute among those men because they could n't decide who would kill me .
that was in rusatira .
one of them told me to go after that .
i left them and went back .
i would avoid using the main road and would go through the bushes instead .
as i was walking i met some people whom were said to be the inkotanyi . they were collecting children and that is how they got me too .
then we were taken to butare .
we lived there until when i started thinking "@ well , i am here but how come none of my family members is here ?
does this mean no one survived to come and get me out of here ? @"
i lived there for some time and then ... later i saw my cousins .
they were younger than i was and they were on their own . therefore , since there was no good life where i was living and yet at the same time my cousins were getting spoiled on the roads , i decided to leave the place and join them .
i was the oldest , life became very hard on us .
i started that life of being in charge of the whole family since i was the oldest .
"@ i am now talking about life after the war . @"
we went to a certain man called papa alisa .
we told him , " as you can see how our home was destroyed .
there is no house left . if you did us a favour and got us a shelter , it would be very meaningful to us . we are the only ones who survived , we will never burden you as far as food and other needs are concerned .
if you got us shelter , it would be of great help to us .
we shall look for means to get food by ourselves . @"
we would endlessly sit in that house and sometimes we would even sleep without eating anything .
today , despite all the time gone by , we still sleep hungry sometimes .
unless ... my cousins and i go to school but on our return when on holiday ... unless someone feels sorry for us and gives us two kg of beans , and another one gives us one kg of cassava flour ... we normally find a way to survive on what we 've got .
occasionally , when it 's time to live school we worry thinking about where to go as we dread going back to our so called home .
life where no one comes to say hi , sometimes we do not go to school . at my age i would have finished high school if it were n't for such problems .
sometimes i stop because i have no means to go to school .
however , sometimes we were lucky to go to school and the times we were n't , then we all just sat home .
in short , life is really hard .
i did not go to school last term because of similar problems .
until a few days ago i managed to go to school for this current term however , life is still too hard .
it 's difficult to get a job . nobody can employ me yet .
of course i can never work as a housemaid because i can not stand that job .
i can not work as a housemaid where every one insults you or people do to you anything they wish .
well , the man helped us with his house in 1997 until when he told us that , although his house was very small , he would wish to get a small amount of money out of it .
be it 3000 rfw or 5000 rfw in case he repaired it .
he said that it would be of use to him .
i went to see another old man who was a hutu and told him ; "@ mzee [ old man ] , you used to be a friend to my dad .
since you were friends , please get us a small house we promise to never disturb you .
get us a house of one bedroom and a living room , even if it only has a bedroom without a living room we will survive it , we will hung curtains in the room to divide it .
fortunately the old man gave the house to me . it had a single bedroom with a small living room . it was his servants ' house .
after some time , the old man said that we should at least give him 1000 rfw .
i told him that sincerely speaking i could not get that money .
"@ you know the way we live , it is your wife who sometimes helps us , " i told him .
people would look at us and feel ashamed because i never used to ask for food even when we were starving to death . we would never beg food from anyone .
i never go to someone and say that " i , alice , am hungry . @"
i just keep silent until when one can tell from my appearance that i need something . because the majority of people listen to your problems yet they are not going to help you .
i stopped going to school because there were no people in this world to help others in need .
i dropped out of school for a whole year until a few days ago when i realised that i am risking stopping my studies , and then went back at school when the term was coming to its end .
i went to school very late .
i used to study in kanombe .
coming to school here to kigali with transport problems , going back home yet there is nobody to find there , plus several other problems ... therefore , i decided to study from there ... where i would walk in case i had no bus fare .
i asked for admission in the school and i was accepted .
but i still had more needs ; i wanted someone who came help me with let 's say ; washing soap , which coasted 50 rfw , or maybe to give me some colgate .
you know what ?
when one is new in a school , it gives a wrong impression to begin with asking anyone for a colgate or soap yet you are new in the society .
it is a problem .
after being late for two weeks , i can not tell how lucky i was and a certain lady come and asked me @:
after dividing the soaps and colgate , i told them , "@ you see we have got something to use at school but we have no ticket to take us to school . @"
one was going to school in nyanza and the other one was in shyogwe . i asked the first one if he @/@ she would walk up to nyanza ? @"
i said that personally i could carry my bag on the head and walk till i get there .
no matter how long it would take . "@ since you are too young , i said , you should go by the roadside and get a ride to nyanza and the other one to shyogwe .
that is exactly how it happened .
afterwards , i decided to go and see claire the following day .
claire and i went to the same school . hoping that she would get something to give me .
i boarded a taxi and went there .
first , i went to get permission from the school director [ headmaster ] he immediately told me "@ alice , you will not sit for the final exams . @" i asked myself why ?
i believe you understand how problems kept piling , up all at once .
then i asked him " why sir ? @"
he replied , "@ you came very late after i have already taken back the forms .
and since i took the forms , there is no alternative , you will study but you will never sit for the final exams . maybe next academic year ... @" i got so disappointed that day .
i imagined spending days in class yet i were n't going to sit for exams .
then i asked the headmaster to let me go back home but the headmaster said no !
i again asked him to let me go back home , once again he said no !
i got annoyed and he realised that i was .
the following day i went to him again he refused .
the next day i told him that i needed permission to go and tell people at home about the situation . headmasters never know student 's details he thus gave me the permission .
i said to myself , i have no home to go to .
i better go to the examination council and ask if i can not sit for exams . that is the decision i myself made .
i decided to go to the examination council and ask why alice in particular would not sit for exams .
the thought of repeating the whole year ... can you imagine ?
at the same time i would think about my life and finally i decided it impossible .
at first going to school was very hard for me .
i borrowed 1500 rfw from a fellow student .
i told her that if all goes well i would pay her very soon .
i did n't know where to get that money but i took it because i needed bus fare .
then i went to the examination council yesterday and explained to them my problem .
at the council they easily understood my problem . they gave a call to my headmaster and reminded him about alice 's case .
they asked him to fill the form on my behalf and take it to the council for me .
then i left that place .
in the evening i decided to go and see claire as i had planned prior .
she asked me to go back the next morning that there were some people who wanted to know about life of children who take care of themselves . i told her that i have no problem with that .
i know the experience of living alone .
i would have left yesterday for school because the headmaster said that i should go back to school .
that is what he said on phone .
in a word that is how my life is , i am half alive , half dead .
from school i do n't expect to find anyone home .
i do n't even think having someone visiting me ; let 's say an aunt visiting me , i do n't have any aunt , i do n't have any uncle , no one .
as you see me standing here in front of you , i am the oldest person of the family that survived .
because of all that , i wish there were no holidays at all .
i suffer a lot on holidays .
i get several problem i can not solve .
nowadays , telling a rwandan about the problems i face is just a ... they would just talk about your problems all around .
one has to come up with a decision .
we live in that small house suffering .
if anybody feels sorry for us ... life goes on .
how many were you in your family ?
we were four children .
and how many of you survived ?
how we lived together ?
well , when i reached his home , i was never treated like a home child . he took me to be like a housemaid .
every night i would go to hide somewhere in the bush and in the morning , they would pick me up .
in his home i would go to harvest coffee .
we would take the coffee to the machine for grinding .
sometimes i would go to fetch water for cleaning the coffee .
most of the time , that would be my work in his home . i guess you know that by then it was harvest time . for coffee as well as for other things .
they used to give me a lot of work because i was vulnerable .
we would spend the whole day in coffee plantations and take it for grinding .
from there , i would go for water .
i would not use a normal can ; i would use an old can to fetch water and i would bring water with it .
i would bring half can water .
not a full one .
i stayed there .
then that man came and told me ; "@ let me tell you young girl , i got you from your mum .
and i do n't want your blood to be counted on me .
therefore , i beg you to go .
it is up to you to look for a way to ruhango , i do n't know if you can guess the right way . @"
i told him that i did not know where to go .
i assured him that i did n't know where to go .
but there was a certain child who lived in that family ; the wife of that man was that kid 's aunt .
that child seemed to be wiser than i was ; she even looked older than i was .
then i decided to ask her to do me a favour ...
to escort me and show me the way because i did n't know the way .
then that kid escorted me up to a small route . but there was some place i remembered , where we once passed with my mum . it was at my uncle 's place . he was my mum 's cousin .
the first time i passed there , i was with my mum and she said ; "@ i am going to find means of how we would go to burundi because there 's no other alternative . @"
but as i told you , she stopped on the way .
then i went on and ascended the hill .
then i decided to pass at my uncle 's place expecting to find somebody .
when i went there , i found no one .
the grass had grown everywhere .
"@ where will poor alice go ? @" i asked myself .
i would aim from where i was standing and look across the hill but i would not find any place that i knew .
believe me , i did not try to commit suicide only once , i did twice .
slightly below that home there was a river .
i do n't remember what it was called .
near their home , the river was approximately there [ she 's pointing ] and they were living somewhere like here [ as she 's pointing ] . near the swamp .
then i said to myself ; "@ i am going to throw myself in this river . @"
i threw myself in the river and simply drunk some water and found myself the other side of the river .
when i was young , i used to hear that when you commit suicide and you have money , you can never die .
i had 1000 rfw in my pocket .
"@ maybe it is the reason why i can not die . @" i thought .
then i put that money aside and then went back into the river .
i still did not die . then i left the river .
that is how i left that man 's home . he was called kayigamba .
would you remember all the people you met during the genocide if you saw them today ?
yes , i know them .
do you know anything as far as their lives are concerned ?
well , kayigamba is imprisoned .
but i do n't know the prison where he is .
i heard that abiya who was a doctor is now in kenya .
that is what rumours say . he went with a girl called grace . grace was a girl we were hiding together in that home .
he used to say that he was trying to save her and later make her his wife .
then they went together but i have n't heard more about them .
in the orphanage .
actually , even though i was considered to be living in the orphanage , i would n't feel at home .
is n't it ?
i knew i would one day leave the orphanage .
otherwise there were n't many problems . however , for me to decide to leave the orphanage , there was a certain man who was called ... i do n't remember his name . he was some kind of director .
one day ... i had a big scar here on my ankle , where i was speared .
then he would ... by then i was too slim ; i looked very weak .
then he said to me , "@ look at this disaster ! @"@
. the director , said that .
otherwise , i was fine and i was with other children .
i could eat , sleep , you know , we would get all things plus clothes .
my problem was the man called kayigamba .
then i decided to leave the orphanage .
i told them that i wanted to leave the orphanage .
i said i would live the way god wished .
i preferred working for someone as a housemaid to being abused by someone .
i think by then i had completed my primary studies .
then i left the orphanage .
then you left the orphanage and decided to become the head of a family .
how old were you ?
i probably was 17 or 16 years old i think .
the children you were looking after , what are their age difference ?
the oldest is 18 years at the moment ; she is in secondary four .
her young sister is in secondary two now .
do you still live with both of them ?
i stayed at home and wrote a letter on my own .
i took it to him but his wife did n't know how to read .
he read it and called me and asked me ; "@ alice how do you feel ? @"
meanwhile my cousin asked for an exercise book , and he told her that there were no books .
that he did n't have money to buy books .
some other time another event happened ; he had other two girls that he had brought ... he used to work from kigali ; he was a businessman there in the commercial street .
but he would come home on fridays .
he took his daughters to the tailor and made them good clothes then for us he bought us very funny clothes .
he put those clothes in the closet and called me .
he said to me , "@ look into that closet there are some clothes , check if they suit your cousins and you . @"
i rushed to the closet and saw the clothes but when i compared them with the clothes that they had given others , they were incomparable .
well , i used too be so mad ... i thanked him .
i told my cousins never to wear those clothes .
we decided to give them to the housemaid .
he brought us three funny skirts and three undefined t @-@ shirts , i just thanked him and told him that we had not yet reached the extent of wearing such things . @"
we gave them to the housemaid .
she wore them and one day , his wife saw her wearing the same clothes . she immediately reported us to her husband . "@ they never wore the clothes you gave them .
instead they gave them to valentine [ housemaid ] . @"
then he called us and said "@ really ali ... !
how could you disobey me yet i brought you here ? @" i replied that it was n't the end of life .
i told him face to face ; "@ you brought your children tailor @-@ made clothes and brought us undefined clothes .
when we decided that we would never put them on , we decided to give them to valentine . @"
then i decided to leave that home and joined a man called papa alisa . we told him those problems and he allowed to live with us .
meanwhile i said bye to the other man . by then i was in secondary one .
then we started living alone and he started saying that we got spoiled .
i said no problem , watch us and see if we would ever mess up on the streets .
we lived there and never stepped in his home .
but i am sure he never saw us in very bad conditions ; we never got sick of jigger .
we sometimes used to get soap and wash our clothes . he never caught us looking bad .
later he came to us and said , "@ even though you left us , you can come and pay us a visit . @"
well , when someone told me something like that , in my heart i despise them , wondering why i should visit them then i say yes knowing very well that i would never appear in their homes .
that is how my life went on .
when you are with your cousins , i guess that sometime you talk about life ... what kind of advice do you give them ? what do you talk about as far as your life style is concerned ?
as the oldest of all , i first calm them .
i assure them that things will change for the better .
i convince them how the future will be good and how we are going to get a better life .
so i go ahead and tell them @: "@ although we have no job now , in the future we will get one , we are studying and we will get jobs afterwards so the future will be good .
i believe god is with us , if we behave ourselves then the future will be brighter . @"
therefore , we keep up our morale like that .
even when we have n't had dinner we just keep morale . however , sometimes we feel discouraged .
when one intentionally decides to skip dinner , they find it easy but when one misses it simply because there is no food , it is very distressing .
the kids ask me @: alice what should we do ?
yet , i myself have no choice .
so i also ask them , "@ you are now mature , why do n't you tell me what to do ? look !
there is no food in the garden , of course i can not dig because i do n't know how to , neither do you .
so , what can we do ?
all we can do is wait and see what happens . @"
i want to assure you of this ; we get what we eat by luck , when someone gives us about four kilograms of cassava flour and maybe we had a kilogram of beans then we slowly eat that one kilogram of beans with those four kilograms of flour and some vegetables .
[ here in ruhango there is a lot of cassava flour ] that is the situation we are in .
i would like to ask you another question that is hard to answer but please , try and do .
do you remember the people who harmed you ? can you tell them to us and what they did ?
for example @: you can say so and so did me wrong yet he or she could have helped me .
oh . in my life time .
well , the fact that i remained without a family , i can not blame anyone .
everyone is concerned only with his or her own familly .
nowadays , we have all changed as rwandans , the one who could help you as a survivor tells you he @/@ she is as well .
i confide in you and you just answer me that those things happen .
this has happened to mebefore ; i approached somebody who i thought could help me , but his advice was that he also studied in similar struggles . @"
that i should also bear with it because in the future i will be fine .
and after telling me all that , i asked him @: "@ you actually know me and there is nothing i am hiding from you ; in fact you knew my family .
how can you be the one to tell me to go to school without a pen or anything ? @"
i asked him if he has ever seen a person who goes to dig without a hoe .
"@ can n't you get me even a pen that costs 50rwf or even a kasuku [ the cheapest exercise book ] ? @"
so he told me that @: "@ it seems you have come to give me problems and yet i have n't solved mine . @"
from then , i remember it was in 1998 , i decided never to tell anyone my problems .
i sat down and decided to pray to god .
i decided that if god found it worthy to help me , then we would get help .
if he did n't then ... of course god knows why we survived among all those who were killed , it was n't because we were so precious not even because we were holy .
therefore , i believe god knows us and he is watching .
instead of telling a son of man who will not help me and who may even laugh at me , i just keep silent .
there is a time i reach my worst moments where i think about working as a housemaid for someone because i do n't think there is any other job that i can get .
but later , when i think about waking up at 5:00am and all those struggles , i say no !
i can not work as a house girl yet we used to have them at home .
i think about such things when life has become very hard on me .
and my cousins can n't stop asking me what they should do , but i keep on telling them to calm down that the future is promising . instead of telling people our problems , we simply sleep . at times it 's not only a problem of food ; finding firewood can also be stressful . because you need firewood or charcoal to cook , a jelly @- can of water costs 20rwf therefore , be it water or any other things , life still becomes so hard .
i would like to ask you as a child who lives alone and as a child who has a lot of responsibilies , we all can see that it was n't your own choice , it is because you lost your parents when you were very young and in turn , you were left with responsibilities .
what main challenges do you have as an orphan who is responsible for other children ?
my major problems ... well at my age , i am supposed to be having someone to care for me . i am not supposed to be asked about the salt at home , soap or anything else . so , when i see all that ... any way i have a way i bare with it . sometimes when i have so much problems i fail to get sleep and spend the whole night awake and maybe sleep in the morning . sometimes i have wondered if a person has two hearts because , there 's always a voice that consoles me telling me do this instead of that . if it was n't that , i would have done something wrong that would give me more problems . and i do not want to become the talk of town , people would laugh at me which i basically avoid . therefore i keep quiet and see days passing .
what else is a challenge to you ?
you told me that getting food is the first problem .
do n't you have any other problem ?
well , getting food is very hard but still , even going to school is another problem . one can ask "@ how ? @" let me explain . one can go to school because the brother or sister prepared something for him or her but poor alice , i simply go without sufficiant school material . well , like other students i go to class but my heart is ever wondering , "@ after school how will we go home and what will we find there @" while others are happy to go home . first of all , we do n't have a house , it is just going round asking for shelter and many other problems . especially me as the oldest , it affects me so much yet i have nothing to do .
given all your problems .
do you find it possible to reconciliate with those who caused them to you ?
i mean the killers who murdered your parents and caused you all these responsibllities at an early age .
but if a person who committed a crime against me asked me to forgive him when he is really sorry , i can forgive him , but since i do n't know him , my heart is divided on the issue .
tell me !
what would you do ?
would you forgive him or ... sincerely if i knew him and he was ready to ask for forgiveness , i would forgive him .
and if he were not ready to ask for forgiveness , then he would continue to serve his sentence .
normally it is a said that ; he who killed using a sword should die by the sword , but since that saying was not obeyed then i can just forgive him .
i would like to ask you another question @: what advice can you give to ... well , it is true you have a very big problem in fact a heavy one however , there are children who have the same problem as you and they are many . you who have the problem of looking after orphans yet you are also an orphan , there is a kind of life you know and you know how to survive through it . what kind of advise can you give to people with such problems ?
are you talking about orphans or any other people who have such problems ?
orphans .
what advice can you give them , so that they can be able to lighten the cross they are bearing ?
the kind of advice i can give to orphans who are taking care of themselves , due to the loos of their parents during the genocide is @: first of all they should be appreciative . they should be happy with the kind of life they are leading , i know is it not the best life but they should have a positive attitude and never mind a lot about the worldly pleasures . they should focus on what is ahead .
for example @: i am a student , i have to be happy with being a student and be happy even though i had nothing to eat for dinner .
if i was not contented with what i have ... i believe you know what most children do ?
they get to the streets and misbehave , why ?
because they are not happy with what they have , they say ; "@ i am an orphan who has no one to listen to my problems @" so , they go to the streets and involve themselves in prostitution and end up getting infected with hiv @/@ aids which in now an epidemic .
but if you are happy with the little you have and are content with who you are , the rest will come slowly .
what advise can you give to your fellow rwandans since , as you can see , your testimony will be kept ?
remember that we said we are going to keep your testimony in the "@ national archive @" it will be well kept and you will see it .
if you are lucky to one day have kids , they will be able to see it , plus those you are looking after .
all will be able to listen to your advice , which , you have given based on your lifetime experience .
what other advice can you give that will be of help to those who will listen to your testimony ?
well , if all rwandans were united , we could find a way to prevent genocide from happening again in rwanda .
we should be united and love one another .
i believe you have noticed how wars have been intervening but lucky enough they are stopping .
in fact there is peace and security .
the main problem i have or even others encounter nowadays is the problem of surviving .
those who are well off spread rumours of wars .
but poor alice how can i know about such things yet i am struggling for something to eat for a day ?
i believe there is nothing more .
my name is uwamungu jean de dieu .
my dad was born in butamwa , which is currently in kigali city but used to be in rural kigali province .
currently i live with my uncle in kiyovu .
where were you born ?
i was also born in butamwa , but i did n't used to live there .
the war started while i was at my grandpa 's .
where is that ?
in shorongi .
that means that everything that happened found you at your grandpa 's ?
no .
most of the things happened when i had left .
i immediately escaped .
what was your father 's name ?
dad ... ?
he was called gatsimbanyi emmanuel and my mum was called niragire laurence .
how many were you in your family ?
they were six , plus me we were seven .
and how many survived ?
i am the only one who survived .
does that mean that they all died ?
all !
besides those who were not around .
the only reason why my uncle survived is because he was living in exile ; he was n't in rwanda .
where were you living ?
we were living in butamwa .
in which year were you born ?
i was born in 1985 .
so how old are you ... ?
19 .
tell us about your life before the genocide .
how were things then ?
life before the war !
i did n't like living with my parents .
i only wanted to live with my grandfather ; my grandfather was the person whose company i enjoyed the most .
i reached an extent of refusing to go to school just because i wanted to stay with my grandpa .
i moved in with him and we lived together .
when my parents realized that i did n't want to live with them , they let me go to my grandpa 's .
i was happy because he had cattle and i would spend the whole day with him grazing the cows .
later , he started to narrate me stories of the past . sometimes he would give me examples of some of our neighbours who were still alive .
he told me how in 1959 they would come and loot their properties ; take their cows , kill them ... kill their cows , sometimes eat them or take the rest .
but during those days they did n't used to kill people , it was rare .
he used to tell it to me live ... !
he also gave me another example of a man called nshaka who was our neighbour and i think he was arrested after the war and released because he was aged .
there were other children at grandpa 's ; they were his sister 's grandchildren . therefore , they were his grandchildren too .
they are the ones we used to be together .
only one of them survived , the rest died .
we used to play together on the streets .
what i talked about is my life before the war .
i did n't know much , i was simply interested in grazing cows , eating and playing on the streets .
q ...
yes .
i remember it was in 1991 ... between the year 1991 and 1992 .
i was coming from grazing the cattle , i remember i had fought with nshaka 's kids who were also looking after cows .
when he asked me why i fought with them , i told him they had hit a cow with a stick in the ears .
and when they hurt the cow , i had to fight them .
we never used to hit cows ; we would just caress them while saying soft words and the cow would go where you want it to go .
we never used to beat them because almost all cows were peaceful .
so , when i faught and after telling grandpa all that , he decided to tell me all about his past .
i did n't know it then .
he gave me another example of how one time they came to loot them and they refused to live the house .
the same nshaka was leading thea group of attachers and when they reached our home ... i guess he told me that it was in the year 1973 ; they came to my grandpa 's house , grandpa told them that he was not going to leave the house .
"@ maybe you burn me inside @"@ , he told them .
therefore , they took away cows and his harvest since he had refused to get out of the house .
they did not burnt him , they just left him there in the house and took everything .
from then , i started developing hatred towards them . i started hating even the people who were looking after his cows .
i would n't want to come close to them and whenever i would see their cows , i would feel like hitting them to death .
when was that ?
it was around 1992 .
why would you do that ?
i ... i loved my grandpa so much , i can not explain it .
maybe because he used to give me total freedom .
there was a place that used to be close to the main road , i used to like sitting there at the road .
and again he would let me graze the cattle while at home they would want me to just sitting there .
yet there were no kids to play with .
generally , i used to like my grandpa 's place . i was happy there .
your grandfather died ?
my grandfather died .
from your point of view , when do you think change occurred in your life ?
when did you notice the changes ?
i ... normally i did n't ... whenever i would see such things , i would never understand what it meant .
because i used to enjoy it myself .
whenever i would see the militias coming ... we never used to call them interahamwe .
there were political parties such as m.d.r but at the time , in shyorongi commune , i only knew of m.r.n.d. because i would hear them animating , singing loudly ... it 's only in 1993 that i understood they were political parties and why they were created .
when i would hear of inkotanyi , i thought of them in a negative way because i believed what was said about them .
i was not aware of what was coming next .
in 1993 my grandfather told me they might have resumed their mission , the one they had in 1959 and 1973 . @"
i would think that ... he did n't think people would kill others .
we thought it would be as usual ; taking cows , looting properties , demolishing houses and that would be all .
i never thought that the things that took place here in 1994 would happen . i was really surprised .
i did n't have a clue .
how did it start ? how did it start in 1993 ... ?
in 1993 in shyorongi , i was ... we were living in one part ... it was like one part of the cell .
all our relatives were living in that area .
there was a road from gisenyi and ruhengeri going to kigali .
people would pass waving flags , seated on top of mini buses ... in our neighbourhood , there never used to be much people ... the only people that used to be there were that old man 's family .
that old man also had a very big family .
if one said that there were only two families in that area , one would be almost true .
almost everyone was related to that old man called nshaka and the rest were related to my grandfather .
that was the only type of people you would find there .
which cell was that ?
it was called nyarurama .
... then later , i would see people going to shyorongi stadium , which was called nyakabingo .
even people from other sectors would go there and dance and drink and then later they would go home .
me too , i would go there to dance because i used to like it .
although i would go to dance , i could see that some people in my family were not happy with it .
i would sense something but it would be so unclear to me .
later in ... 1993 when i really knew what political parties were . the year was ending , i remember i was in primary three and that is when i quit school .
i just stopped studying .
i remember there was a war but the war had n't reached our area .
we used to hear that there is a war in ruhengeri and byumba .
why did you stop studying ?
well at school , even my teacher was my relative .
but i used to hate being beaten ... one time i went to school late , and when i was caned i just walked out of school and to hell !
i did n't see any importance of studying .
even my grandpa had never gone to school and when i told him about it , he never had any reaction .
therefore , i stopped studying .
from then , i did n't go back to school .
i went back to school only after the war .
did you go back in 1994 , immediately after the war .
no . i went back in 1996 .
q ...
i went there ... i completed primary during the school year 1995-1996 .
why did you go back to school ?
they told me to go back to school because they realised that there was nothing else i could do with my life .
i was n't mature enough to look for a job .
i just went to school up to now .
tell me how the war ... how did you face 1994 personally ?
well , when the war started ... personally i used to like soldiers very much .
but ... during the first months of the year 1994 , i had an uncle , he was my mum 's brother ; he was a son to the big brother of my grandpa [ in kinyarwanda , cousins whose fathers are brothers are considered as brothers and sisters ] .
he had joined the inkotanyi army .
many people used to come saying , "@ in your family , some people joined the inkotanyi . @"
even me , whenever i would hear of inkotanyi i would imagine that they were very bad people .
generally , i would hate the inkotanyi so much .
due to the way they would talk of inkotanyi , i also would believed that inkotanyi were very bad .
one night we came back and while i was sleeping with my grandpa , i asked him , "@ why are we hidding all the time ? @" then he told me , "@ you remember what i once told you .
they have resumed it , but this time it is even worse . @"
i immediately understood that the looting of people 's properties , the killing of cows and the destruction of houses was about to happen .
well , around the 12th of april ... my uncle [ mum 's brother ] had married a hutu lady ... her brothers took her with her kids and said that the rest should be killed .
they took them all on that day ; a troop came and took them all .
i left for butamwa at home .
i left thinking that maybe things were safer back home .
but when i reached there ... i was shocked . i did not find a single person there ; the house was widly open with no one inside .
it was around 6:00 o'clock in the evening , i looked for them but i never found anybody .
as i was still ... i went to grandma because it was not far from there but when i reached there i did not find anyone neither .
i went back home .
since it was on the hill , i had to descend .
i heard people , ... people who were maybe from attacking some place ... maybe they were across the hill ; i could n't tell where they were from .
they came running ; i heard a crowd of people and it was getting dark .
when i heard people making a lot of noise , i climbed a mango tree and sat there .
they came and went around the house and entered inside but they did n't find anybody .
then they started saying , "@ they 've gone to hide , they will come back in the night or maybe someone else has already taken them . @"
from then , i got the confirmation that my people were still alive .
then i thought , "@ they have n't died yet , maybe they are hidding somewhere . @"
as i was still in the tree , at night , at about 7:30 p.m. ... i got hungry and started eating mangos .
when i finished the first one i grabbed the second one .
i suddenly heard someone coming through the banana plantation .
immediately i ... i left the mango waited to see who it was .
the i found out it was grandma .
therefore , i came down the tree and greeted her .
she was very surprised to see me alive .
and she told me that , even the others were still alive .
then she took me to ... there was a place where they used to mine cassiterite , in deep holes and that is where they used to live ; they would spend the whole day in those holes and come out at night when they were going to sleep .
after showing me where they were , we went home to sleep at night .
the following day , as we were preparing to live at 3:00 ... in fact , we used to go home to sleep at 3 a.m. and then at 4:00 a.m. we would go back to the holes to hide .
immediately they found out that we would hide and come back to sleep , a very big group of killers came , the people who were in that attack were our neighbours , we were living in the same cell .
they came and shouted .
they surrounded the whole house and soon after all doors were open .
dad slammed the door and locked it , they hit it hard and it fell inside ... i had a sister who had been born lame .
dad asked her if he could carry her , but she refused .
and when she refused ... they had ordered us all to get out and while dad was still arguing with them , they beat him up and he just carried the kid on his shoulders .
i was holding a mattress on the head , when they started pushing us forward , saying they were taking us to kill us with others .
they asked us to choose between putting us in a bus and taking us to arusha .
that is what i heard but i did n't understand which bus they were talking about .
i thought it was a normal bus but i checked around and i did n't see any .
well as they were still talking , putting people in front , i slightly bent .
i was very small , it seemed like i was sleeping under the mattress .
then , i sneaked away and left the mattress there .
they thought i was under the mattress .
i went and hid in the bushes around and when they checked below the mattress , they did n't see anyone . however , they did not mind much about it , they just got confused and left .
until today , i do n't know how they were killed .
but i am sure they all died .
they took them and then ... in my mind , i could n't think of nothing , neither could i feel anything .
while i was hiding there , [ i can not find the right way of describing how i was feeling ] i sat and thought for a while ... it was around 11:00 a.m. i got out of the bush because there were dogs passing all the time , trained to search for people during the day .
i went into a certain hole where we used to spend time and in the evening , at around 7:00 p.m. i left the hole .
the i thought , "@ if they took my whole family at home , maybe at grandpa 's they are still there .
maybe they hid and came back to sleep . @"
when i reached there ... i was very dark almost in the morning , it was at around 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. i found nobody at home [ his grandfather 's home ] and the house had no doors left .
i looked for people but i could n't find anyone .
i checked at the road ... i went to look for them at the road but i did n't find them .
i met soldiers walking around .
there was a lady called francoise who lived in shyorongi . she looked older than her age .
a certain soldier asked me , "@ are n't you francoise 's brother ? @"
i said "@ yes i am . @"
then he took me and said that francoise was his friend .
he took me and then i went to live together with the soldiers .
later , all the soldiers who were there were taken to jari , where there is a radio antenna .
i continued to live with soldiers but i had never seen people being killed ; i thought it was just chaos and that things would change with time .
the following morning , they brought other tutsis people ... the first person i saw being murdered was a lady whom they got and cut with a bayonet ; they cut her neck open and blood spread all over .
i was so scared ; it was my first time to witness murder .
i had never seen her before .
she was living in jari but up to now i do n't know her name . i just saw her there but i still remember her today .
the war went on , the soldiers were fighting against the inkotanyi in the hills .
meanwhile , the interahamwe would take local people and kill them in the camp just where there is a football field that used to belong to the state police .
one evening some cooking oil was brought for the soldiers .
then they said that , there is no logic in eating good food while their father has died [ president habyarimana ] .
then they filled several drums with oil and put them on fire .
then they would choose the short tutsis and dump them in it and burnt them alive .
i was terrified !
therefore , i decided to move forward , towards where the war was taking place .
when i got there , i did n't know how to move on my stomach like i would see others doing ... when i saw some of the people i was with being shot dead , i decided to go back .
when i got there there , i found so many kids who had come from their homes in the neighbourhood to join the army .
then some interahamwe came to investigate on all the kids . they picked all the kids , me included .
since the soldier [ who had taken me there ] was there , he talked on my behalf telling that i do n't come from that area when they were almost taking me .
then some people said that i was born there , that they even knew me .
i remember there was a certain interahamwe who said that he knew me that i was kayiranga 's son but i did n't know who kayiranga was .
he told them that they got me from byumba when the inkotanyi had killed all my parents , and that the refugees had taken me there .
immediately they took me out and took the rest of the kids .
one kid escaped them but unfortunately , he took off through a place full of land mines and they killed him .
and all the rest were murdered .
then i left ; there was a small court that was next to the camp before you reach the antenna .
all the people who were caught were burnt there ; they would pour petrol on them while they were standing and they would burn them .
that was the place where they would train interahamwe how to use guns .
they ordered others to use pickaxes . next to that place is where the local counselor was living ; we would call it ‘ at the counselor 's . @"
but i did n't know him ; i just used to hear that it was at the counselor 's .
they made people dig holes ; once one would dig a pit of his or her height , he or she would enter into the hole and they would just put soil above when someone is still alive .
meanwhile , some hutu kids who had come from byumba accused me of being a tutsi .
i overheard them saying they were going to call the interahamwes to come and kill me . they went to call them [ the interahamwes ] at night .
in fact , i overheard them saying it through the window .
i immediately run away and when i got in the middle of where the inkotanyis and the soldiers i was with were fighting , i sneaked inside the house of the ‘ counsellor ’ of jari .
when i got inside , there were dead bodies all over the place , that 's where they were keeping them .
since i did n't have anywhere else to go , i hid in the middle of the corpses .
when they came , they could not see me .
then they closed the door and went . i spent about 4 hours lying down with those corpses .
then i decided to leave the house after realizing that it was calm .
i stayed in the area where the soldiers were fighting . i would hide at the frontline .
and that is where i was staying .
there was an old woman they had refused to kill ; i used to see her whenever we would be going to harvest fruit , maize and sugarcane .
i would always take some to her before i would take them to the soldiers .
they ended up killing her two days before we left the place .
in that area the inkotanyi had blocked the roads used for taking food to the soldiers in the camp .
when they realized they could no longer get any food or bullets delivery , they decided to leave .
the following day , we spent the whole day without hearing any shooting until 8:00 p.m. when they told us to leave .
as we were going the soldier who had taken me with him had a bag full of money .
he said he was taking it to francoise ; i mean the francoise who lived in shyorongi .
since he had a gun , he went in front of us then i followed him .
we bumped into the inkotanyis and he was the first one to be shot dead and everyone else was killed .
i looked around but i could n't see a single living person , they had all died .
therefore i sat down to try and pull myself down as i did n't even know where i was .
then ... as i was still sitting at the roadside , a military lorry , which was taking water to the camp , came .
they saw me sitting there ; they asked me why i was sitting there yet they had sent me a while ago .
then a certain soldier got out and told me to enter the car . that is how i escaped them .
then in the morning they came and said that my whole family had died and that i was a tutsi too ; they were wondering why i joined the army .
when they found out details about me , i escaped them and joined the refugees .
when i reached there ... because i had refused to join the refugees whose origin was shyorongi , i joined those from byumba .
when they started asking me where i was coming from , i told them that i was coming from byumba and that the inkotanyis had killed both my parents using clubs .
some women liked me very much and treated me so well .
then i joined the refugees who were heading to byumba .
i left with the refugees from byumba and some time later , i met a man from butamwa who said he knew me but i denied it .
he insisted saying @: "@ are n't you gatsimbanyi 's son ? @"
"@ which gatsimbanyi ?
i do not even know me ! @"
"@ are n't you from butamwa , in ruriba ? @" "@ not at all ! @"
i went on denying it .
then one of the ladies who was with me defended me and explained to him that i was from byumba and that both my parents had been killed by the inkotanyis .
they all believed it was true and they treated me as their child .
we went on together ; i think we reached the boarder together .
that is where i lost sight of them , they disappeared from the crowd . i continued walking with people i did n't know , i did n't know where we were going , it was my first time to take that route .
when we reached the way ... in the camp , i was sitting by the roadside and there passed a lorry carrying water .
i drunk a bit of it but it tasted too salty ; i had never taken salty water before .
i developed stomachaches and got diarrhea . it was a red cross car so when they noticed that i got seriously sick , they took me to their hospital .
later they asked me where my family was and i told them they were n't there . @"
a certain man came and asked me about my family , because he looked ugly , i told him that inkotanyi killed them all .
he then added my name on the list of orphans and they took me to the orphanage at ndushu , in goma @-@ congo drc .
i lived there but later i left .
i wrote a letter , which i sent through the red cross to my aunt who was a teacher here at muhima .
she replied me and sent me a picture .
they took me there and i started studying .
throughout , i had never told anyone about my life or about what i went through ... in addition , no one had ever told me that my family was killed .
therefore , i disappeared again and went there during day time to verify myself .
when i got there , it was even hard to find the way as almost everything had been covered by grass !
i just went back home but i never told them where i had gone , i just told them that i had gone to play .
so , i just sat there at home .
my uncle was in exile and later i even saw my aunt [ my father 's sister ] who was married to a congolese .
i lived with them until i completed primary school and joined secondary .
i passed well primary and joined a government school "@ byimana @" in gitarama .
it was the first time i was living around people of my age .
besides , we were almost all knew each other because the majolity had come from the same school .
of course some were younger than others . one day , one of the boys in my dormitory insulted me about my mother .
when he did , i did n't feel anything at the moment , i just laughted .
but at night i thought about it , it was as though my brain was widening ; i recalled the past , i thought about my current life and i started asking myself why or what i was struggling for .
i thought , "@ i have no sister , no brother , i have no father , no mother . @"
i did n't see why i was studying !
i remember that time , i never slept and the whole day i was thinking about that ; i did not study that day , i was in class but absent minded .
i remember i spent about three hours out of class ; i was chased out of class because i was n't taking notes .
when i went to bed that night i could n't sleep , i could n't talk .
they took me to kabgayi hospital but it was all in vain .
they took me back home ; at the hospital they said i did n't have any problem .
i spent six months without talking , i was used to communicate through writing .
that is when i was taken to the trauma centre .
i even started to work with esther who was with avega .
i was able to talk again six months later and i went back to school .
but i shifted from byimana to apace .
the situation continued like that up to when they [ trauma centre ] advised me to be in the habit of talking to my friends and telling them my story , vice @-@ versa .
i usually do n't talk , not even to the members of my family ; but this is because they have never seen a war . there is none i can say that he or she knows a war .
none of them has ever seen a person being killed .
even the few who have seen dead bodies just saw them on tv .
that is the reason why i believe there is nobody i can talk to about such stories because i believe they do n't know a thing .
that is the only reason .
there is apoint you mentioned that you joined the soldiers . how much time did you spend with them ?
i stayed there for two days .
i just wanted to see the way they used a gun ; i enjoyed it .
when i reached there , i found out that some people had been commanded to kill others .
when i thought that they could even attack my grand father 's place , i immediately left .
at your grandfather , did they know where you were ?
i did not tell them anything , and when i came back they asked me where i had been , i told them but they did not say a thing .
q ...
i left that place knowing there was peace at my place , i knew that one day they would kill us because of the way they were moving with their machetes , they all had new machetes .
nshaka was the one to keep the machetes .
so , they used to pick them up from his place .
his sons , his younger brother 's sons [ nephews ] and his older brother 's sons [ nephews ] were all killers .
that is when i realized that the situation was similar everywhere .
how did you go , in a car ?
no , i left by foot .
i left early in the morning and reached there at around six or seven in the evening .
were n't you afraid of walking or there was a way you would hide ?
at that time there were many people on the road screaming while hunting for people but i did n't fear anything at all because i could walk anyhow and no one stopped me , though i feared roadblocks .
when was that ?
i used to think about the way i was living , i was staying with my aunt [ my mother 's older sister ] , they were n't real sisters but their fathers were brothers .
he had two children and one was abroad .
whenever i would compare the way they study and the way i study , i would find my studying useless .
i would go home for holidays and when the others would come , they would be received in such a warm way !
it would leave me wondering whom i live to make happy and who could ever make me happy !
there was none and this really troubled me a lot .
because i had no one to talk to and whenever i talked to anyone it was just the usual things but i could n't talk about things related to genocide because of being traumatized and in case i talked it was only lies , i never felt like telling anyone the truth .
did you start talking at the trauma center ?
i started talking from then , but at first i used to use a pen and later they told us to stop writing and they started persuading me to try and talk .
at times they also would tell me to start doing sports .
i over practiced sports , which has caused me backaches , though i think it may be because of the beatings during the war .
basically there are things i would n't feel like revealing and i could only answer what they asked , in case they would ask me about the war , i would briefly reply and keep the rest to myself .
when did you start telling it all ?
it is this year that i started talking about it ; i recently said it for the first time .
even right now as i am talking , there are some information that i skip , because there is much that i forgot .
even writing was n't easy ; there were some information i wrote and sent it to mudende [ adventist 's university ] .
the first day i wrote two pages , hoping to add on the following day .
when i sat the following day to continue , i had a lot to write but it was not flowing in order .
therefore , i decided to leave everything and get a whole day to prepare it .
that day i wrote eight pages .
and from that day on , it is when i started talking about it ... writing about it .
and the reason as to why i was trying to do this is because at the trauma center they had advised that in order to overcome it i must try and talk it out or even cry .
but in my whole life i have never cried .
instead of crying , i can n't talk .
whenever we go to gisozi , while others cry , i just can n't talk anymore .
that is why whenever i go there ; i get someone i can keep talking to in order to avoid loosing my speech . but still i find myself quiet .
i live with my dad 's younger brother .
recently i was asking myself if my uncle understands the seriousness of genocide ; i wonder if he does n't know the heaviness of genocide or if he has a different perception about the genocide ... i do n't know .
currently ... i do n't stress myself with studies .
because whenever i read a lot , i find myself in a position whereby i can n't talk .
afterwards when i come back home he shouts at me .
saying that i should get 70 % not the 50 % i manage to score .
i have never told him ... i guess he does n't know my past and how i survived .
by the way , if he knows my story , he knows just a little bit of it .
that is when i started realizing that keeping it silent is being stupid .
therefore , i decided to start writing .
and when i am able to get the counselors from the trauma centers , i tell them some things , which relieves me .
even now there are some things you skipped ... is there some information that you did not tell us ?
yes , there are some things that i did n't tell you .
there was a time i stole a gun the time i left jari .
they found me and i was beaten .
when they asked me , i told them that i just wanted to hear how a gun feels like .
however that was n't my real intention ; i wanted to take it and use it to kill the old man nshaka . and i was ready to face any punishment .
but i was so unfortunate because i did n't succeed .
generally that is what i can tell you about the genocide .
why ?
i believe a woman might waste my time .
she might make me unhappy .
however , i believe if i am lucky , i 'll come across one whose parents were killed in the genocide .
however , i think it will n't be possible because all those orphans of the genocide will be married before i will be in position to marry and those who may be still single will be too old for me .
i would n't want to marry someone who does n't know anything about the genocide . and when we will be living together and i see all his family members visiting us , it may confuse me . in the end i end up not thinking of getting married though at times i consider getting married so that i could have a child to replace those who died and to restore the memories of those we lost .
what would you like to do ?
i think after completing my studies , i 'll be self @-@ employed .
i want to make a project and it will involve agriculture and cattle breeding , which will be based at my now deserted home .
that means that you want to study agriculture ?
i can not study agriculture because i am studying accounts .
i think i will do "@ management @" at the university .
but if i get a chance to study agriculture , i will do both since i feel i have it on my heart .
when you think about you future family , what do you think genocide will mean to them ?
i have a problem with people saying that genocide survivors deserve justice . for example butamwa where i come from , i returned there for the first time when i was looking for an identity card . i got there when there was a case in progress . i attended it even though i really did n't have it on my mind and i have little interest in court proceedings . i stood up and told them that i also wanted to accuse some people , they all laughed and asked me if i had come to look for compensation . i told them that it was n't what had taken me there . then one of them asked me to introduce myself because i had forgotten to do it at first . i told them both my father 's and my mother 's names and after they knew them , they apologized and told me that by that time i was young and they did n't remember me .
afterwards the judges told me to see the prosecutor and tell him to make me a file .
when i reached there , i found that he had written most of the things , although he rewrote them again .
then he said that the court would call them , since most of them were not imprisoned .
and one of them was a local leader who is not imprisoned up to now .
they told me to come back that wednesday at 9:00 a.m. i used a bicycle i had and while sloping down on my way back i was stoned by people i did n't know .
therefore , i decided to go back .
when i looked back , i saw a group of people running after me .
i went off the bicycle and started running , leaving it behind .
luckily i saw a vehicle and stopped it .
i told them my story and then we went back , picked my bicycle , but the people who were chasing me were nowhere to be seen .
since then i never went back to follow up with the cases and in fact one of them was freed claiming that he is innocent because all who were accusing him were defeated in court .
but personally i never went there and never even bothered to follow the proceedings .
most of the killers are still free in butamwa and one of them is a local leader , up to now when i want to look for farg documents i no longer go to butamwa instead i go to shyorongi because i also know the place very well .
how many times have you gone back since the war ended ?
that was my second time .
which means i went there three times . the first time i went to see if there was anybody who survived as i believed they were still alive yet they all had died .
the second time i had gone to look for an identity card and that is the time when i found a case .
and the third time is when i had gone for a reply because they had asked me to go back on wednesday .
however , i never followed it up , i just came back .
when did you come from zaire [ congo drc ] ?
i left zaire in january 1995 .
for how long were you there ?
i spent there about five or six months .
q ...
it would sound childish if someone said that the elders should be removed from the world .
because if the old people were taken away , there would remain only children , which is not good .
for a better future of rwanda , they should educate the coming generation .
because as they study and you give them a lot of examples , they understand better .
however they can even be the first ones to disobey .
but when they have heard about it , they are far better than those who never went to school .
i guess they are the ones who should be sensitized . instead of teaching people how to forgive only , they should teach them the origin of everything , and the cruelty of it all .
then everybody will feel concerned in stopping such acts from happing again .
how do you think you will train your own kids ?
if i will be lucky to have children , i would n't want them to live that kind of a life .
because i believe that if there is anything i have to do for them first , is to teach them about those things .
i also believe that , even if i am very rich , a housemaid will n't be the one to take care of my children .
i think their mother and i are the ones who need to raise them . in case their mother will be working , she shall quit her job and first raise up the children .
that is why i earlier told you that it would be difficult for me to marry due to my confusion .
telling my wife to stop working and raise a child will n't be easy and that 's why i told you i would n't want to marry .
q ...
my name is bukumura egide , i was born in 1979 , that means i am 25 years old .
i am a second year at k.i.e ( kigali institute of education ) .
i am currently living in kicukiro with my older brother .
that is about me .
which course are you taking ?
i am doing science .
i am doing ‘ biochemistry ’ and at the moment , i am in the second year at the university .
what were the names of your mum and dad ?
my mum was called mukabera astheria and my dad was called rwicamafigi medal .
which born were you in your family ?
i was the last @-@ born .
did you do what rwandans usually say ? [ rwandans believe that the last @-@ born leaves excrements in the mother 's womb . ]
indeed i did ... it is just that nowadays it does not exist anymore and it 's become difficult to determine who is the last @-@ born .
and what about your elder brother whom you are living together , which born was he in your family ?
he was the first @-@ born in our family .
where were you living before the war ?
before the war , we were living in bugesera .
by then , bugesera was in kanzenze commune .
tell us about your childhood , how you lived .
okay ... i may not be able to tell you what i went through in my mother 's womb , but from the time i was born , they used to tell me about my childhood .
well , i was the last @-@ born . it is said that last @-@ born children always stress their parents ; they easily fall sick .
i was told myself i used to be very sickly .
people would run around looking for medicine .
i also heard that my mum died when i was very young .
i had not yet reached time to join primary school .
but by then , my dad was still alive . therefore , we lived with him .
he always used to draw me near him wherever he was and wherever he went .
sometimes he could even take me at his working place because i was too young to be left alone and also , he was the only parent that we had .
so he had to look after me , take good care of me and so on . when time came to go to school , he took me to school like other children .
then in 1994 the war started and by then i had n't joined secondary ; i was still in primary .
i remember i had sat the national primary leaving examinations p.l.e. by then primary school would stop at the sixth level .
level 8 had been removed . therefore i was waiting for my results but unfortunately enough that is when the catastrophes of 1994 started .
i guess you too can imagine how my childhood was .
when you try to remember between 1990 and 1994 , when did you realize that there was a problem ?
yes ... long ago in rwanda , that is before the war ... especially those of us who went to secondary school we used to study the history of rwanda .
we were taught about life in rwanda before the coming of the whites , after the coming of the whites and life before the war meaning how rwandans leaved before the war .
during that time , the hutu were on power .
even before the war , they were the ones in the leadership of the country .
their main goal was to teach how tutsis were bad . generally that was the main lesson . people were first shown how the tutsi used to lead during the monarchy .
then based on that , people were convinced on how bad the tutsi are .
i could give you an example related to this @: they used to count the number of the tutsi in class , i would be asked to stand up in class .
sometimes there was only one or two tutsis in class .
i felt so ashamed and i 'd easily ask myself many questions .
i remember my dad used to work in a place called ririma , he was working at the ririma prison .
i lived in ririma when i was young .
then in 1990 , 1991 and 1992 a rumor spread that inkotanyi troops had invaded the country .
i heard that in our home village [ nyamata ] people 's houses were being burnt . the burning of houses used to be the first sign whenever there was a problem of tribes in this region . then the same acts started in ririma too .
normally in bugesera , it seemed as though people were bewitched .
even when they heard that people were being killed ... i was lucky because i was living at the prison and the supervisors protected us . there were times when at the ririma prison everybody was scared that the inkotanyi troops were coming to take control of it .
i remember that time we spent the night outside ; we could not sleep in our houses . then the local people started killing each other ; we could hear that hutu are killing tutsi .
i was so lucky to be protected , by then i was at the prison , and nothing bad happened to us .
later things cooled down .
we heard that nyamata people hid in the church .
however some were killed on their way to the church but those who managed to escape and reach the church were protected .
after sometime they all went back to their homes , most of them found their houses burnt .
some people had already been killed , those who went back home could help each other and construct huts [ rwandan traditional houses , made out of sticks and grass ] .
generally in bugesera we were always ready ; we knew we were being hunted and that at any particular time , we would all be killed .
i had never seen hutu in good terms with tutsi . they were like leopards and ... or cats and rats all the time . that is how i could compare the two clans .
when did you realize it was a big problem ?
well , all problems began in 1990 , 1992 .
but it was in 1994 when i realized that any tutsi was in trouble . in 1994 the situation got worse .
i remember my dad had retired several years before and we were living in nyamata , which used to be called kayumba sector .
in nyamata i saw the real change that had occurred ; that is when i opened my eyes .
because from the year 1990 to 1992 , it seemed as though we were blind ; those days , we could flee and just go to the commune or to churches and the priests could protect us and then we could go back to our homes .
therefore , we never thought it was a big problem .
but in 1994 , i finally accepted that the facts the way they were .
that is when the councillor who was also a tutsi held a meeting and said , "@ i am no longer invited in meetings that are held on behalf of the government .
therefore , i do n't attend government meeting .
but be ready we are in danger ; stop that habit of fleeing towards the commune or to nyamata church .
this time the killings will start from those areas . all i can advise you , is to be ready and face what is going to happen here . @"
because he was a leader , he had spied and got that information .
"@ all the plans for killing that are going to take place are made in the nyamata commune , in churches ; they all have the same plans @"@ , he added .
he warned us that no one should make a mistake of going to the former hiding places .
i learned a lot in that meeting . normally when a leader says something of that sort , it means that he is sure of it .
then i grew up in my way of thinking and was so scared .
that is when i really saw how much i was vulnerable .
was that in the beginning of the year 1994 ?
in the beginning ... at the beginning of the genocide and the massacre , it was in april , the early days of the month .
i began with the information concerning kayumba sector or bugesera .
i mean i am starting from what took place in nyamata , kanzeze because in those areas there were so many tutsi .
whenever there could be any conflicts in the country , people in those areas could be in for it ; houses were burnt , blood was shed , in brief those were the target areas for genocidal acts .
so , what happened , first there was what one could call ‘ hunting ’ , the following day , one could see at the hill ... [ i have failed to get a better way of giving you examples ] normally there was a hill where we lived , that hill was called kayumba .
then there were other hills called murama sector , mwogo sector and muyenzi sector , which sectors surrounded kayumba .
and tutsis resided in kayumba more than in other sectors .
then in the morning , one could see houses in flames and one would wonder .
but the grown ups would vulnerably nod and say that there was no alternative , that we were going to be exterminated since they [ hutu ] had started with their habit of burning houses .
the counsellor once again warned us from fleeing towards nyamata .
instead , he advised us to go to the boarders of those sectors and our sector .
by then habyarimana had not yet died .
so , the counsellor advised us to go to the boarders between our sector and the neighboring sectors and prevent our sector from the interahamwe who were coming in .
there used to be few hutu in our sector about two or three and they even left later on and joined other sectors .
then other tutsi who were in other sectors came to our sector kayumba .
therefore , kayumba sector became a sector of tutsi only .
what came next is that we started patrolling at night in our sector .
there was a clan in kayumba sector , which was known as abamere which i am a member of .
this is a clan that used to own many cattle in the whole of bugesera @-@ kayumba .
people in that clan used to be good at using bows and arrows . therefore , we could guard our sector by moving around in our sector .
at different boarder with other sectors , there was a swamp .
this swamp separated our sector from other sectors . i remember i was young but i could carry a machete . we were told that one should carry whatever weapon they could get .
sometimes i could get stones and we could descend down the hill and patrol the whole night .
that was before habyarimana 's death . the perpetrators would attack our home village but we would defeat them and send them back . and then habyarimana died .
it was on the 6th at night .
that night i had gone back home at around half past seven in the evening .
someone standing in our home compound could see the airport 's security lights [ kanombe airport ] .
therefore , while we were milking cows , we saw sparks rising above the airport and suddenly joined up in the air and ignited .
then , objects in flames started falling downwards , which from a distance looked like a polythene material falling on the ground .
those who were grown up like my cousin who was quite intelligent and who had gone to school said , "@ this is not a sign of peace . @"
everybody around said so .
then we went to bed and in the morning , the news that president habyarimana 's aircraft had crashed and spread all over .
eh ... what happened next ?
all the evil plans that were in their hearts were put out in open .
i have no words to explain this ... they [ perpetrators ] started hunting people in our sector ; we had protected our sector . we could go to karambi swamp where we could meet the attackers .
those attackers could come while producing musical sound by the use of some local musical instruments made out of horns called amakondera and get in murama .
i wonder if you can imagine ... just put yourself in my shoe at that time and try to think about being attacked by people from all the neighbouring hills , all together for one hill .
playing those makondera and dressed in banana leaves .
that is how they became interahamwe [ people united with a common purpose ] and surely , they looked wild .
so , they came playing the makondera and whistles with so much courage .
we could just be standing in the swamp , cursing or calling one another saying , "@ try and come here . @"
they [ attackers ] came and stood on that hill at the other side and we were standing on our hill on this side .
then they started stoning us , shooting arrows , and we also did the same in turn .
they used to come in a smaller number than ours , because for us the whole sector could gather yet for them , some would come while others would not .
therefore , we could put together our stones and stone them at a go . slowly by slowly they were defeated and went back running .
a day would end like that .
the following day they came back . they came down the hill still playing the makondera .
this time they brought some things i could n't identify ; they were holding things burning with flames .
that was so scary .
those flames looked like the torches that are always lighted when a team wins a match . the attacker were holding these flames while wearing banana leaves , i was a young boy who used to like joining others on the field .
i would carry stones and we met them in the swamp and fought ; we shot each other until when they were forced to run back while no one had been killed in our group .
on the third day , that is when they realised that we were serious .
therefore , they came down the hill like they used to and we too did the same as it had become the routine .
inside our hearts we were confident that we shall conquer them .
we had decided never to let interahamwe kill us cruelly . so they tricked us by coming down the usual way and very close .
then we started shooting arrows as we used to do and all of a sudden , we heard them shouting with guns .
i ran and seriously ran .
i ran beyond a place where there used to be rocks .
the local counsellor had ordered people to remain in their homes . he had said , "@ nobody should leave their homes and people should stay together . @"
therefore people gathered together on one hill , which was kayumba hill .
that place was bushy and stony and crowded with the people who had gathered there , children , women , and cattle ... generally that is the place where we had camped .
some people would go home and prepare food in secret and bring the food to people in the camp where we were .
later on , the interahamwe spread into the camp and killed so many people ; women were killed , old people , children ... tutsis died on that day .
i remember that is the day when my uncle 's wife was killed .
the majority of the tutsis from kayumba died from there .
the interahamwe poured in those innocent people and killed them so badly .
i continued to nyamata centre but the counselor had warned us from going to nyamata centre because all the plans of violence were made from there .
but most people never agreed with him , because on my way i was with tutsi refugees who were fleeing with their cows and belongings and when oasked , they could say that they were going to the commune or to the church [ nyamata church and commune are next to each other ] .
therefore , people would say that they were going there to seek for protection .
in people 's mind , the church and the commune were always secure .
i also went down the hill .
deep in my heart i was saying i would n't go with all these people .
therefore , i took a short cut through the center [ through the nyamata market ] . i passed between houses and entered a certain house where they used to sell local beer .
that house looked like those houses in the city slams . i found people inside who were also hiding .
they were breathing deeply but when i realized that they were tutsi , i joined them and took a sit .
i remember that time almost half a liter of sweat came out [ of my body ] .
i laid down and first took a rest .
but i could hear gun shots towards kayumba area .
later i woke up and we slightly opened the window and piped outside . that is the time i started seeing people 's blood .
i saw people being hacked .
well even before , people were killed but because i was running all the time , i never observed it clearly like then .
i would just run for my own life .
so , as we piped , we saw someone who was being killed with a machete . that was in nyamata town .
whenever he would try to stand up , he would be slashed then he would fall down again , he was slashed until he died .
they were playing on his mind asking him , "@ you cockroach where were you going ? @"
i was silently listening from that house .
later on , they started using the term "@ to work . @"
the interahamwe could pass through the center saying , "@ we are going to work @" [ implying that they are going to kill ] . they started searching house by house in nyamata center .
they searched all around and they burnt houses or shops that were owned by tutsis in that area .
shops were burnt , one after the other .
i said to myself , "@ i do n't want to be found in this house . @" then in no time they had reached gahima 's house .
[ gahima was the president of pl in bugesera ] .
his house was very beautiful but it was burnt to ash . it was ignited and i saw its flames . the interahamwe burnt house after house to the point where , in the end , they were going to reach us .
but i did n't want to wait to see the interahamwe getting me alive and see myself dying a painful death .
i decide to die running .
then i reached for a spatula [ made out of wood , about two meters long ] that was in that house , which they used for stirring while making the local beer .
i held the spatula across my shoulders and tried to get out . when the people who were in the house saw that i was going to get out , they stopped me .
"@ why do n't you stay here , do you want to die from outside ? @" they asked me .
i excused myself and told them that i was not going to die inside a house , to be burnt in the house .
then when i refused to stay , they tried to hold me [ to stop me from leaving ] and i hit the door open and i left .
immediately i hid behind the houses .
but when someone is meant to die or if death is on the way , it is very hard to think straight .
while i was behind the house , i decided to join others at nyamata commune or church .
other refugees [ tutsi ] had already left ; it was only i left behind .
i waited for the situation to calm down and then later i walked slowly with my spatula without fear in order to give people the impression that i am an nterahamwe .
i looked very serious and passed behind the houses . no one talked about me , i just walked firmly and reached a place called kajevuba formally , it was known as gatare .
through gatare one just ascends the hill and reaches the commune . i was trying to get to the commune . before i reached the commune , i saw a roadblock just ahead of me .
at the roadblock there was a policeman .
normally during the days before the war , policemen used to have wooden guns , but that policeman had a scary gun .
holding my huge spatula i told the policeman , "@ i want to go the commune @" [ i was desperate , i knew in all cases , i would die ] .
i did n't care about the way i was saying it .
the policeman asked me , "@ you want to go the commune ?
wait , killings at the commune have not yet started . @"
then i realised that people at the commune were going to die in the meantime .
then i told the policeman , "@ okay , i will go back and wait . @" then i understood the logic behind sending people to the commune .
i went back but i was wondering were i would go .
so , i looked for another shortcut that would lead me to the commune .
i crossed through that place called kajevuba and as i had made two steps , i found the interahamwe who were forcing a lady to open the door of the toilets in which she was hiding .
" open the door you bitch @"@ , the interahamwe were shouting at her .
and she was pleading for forgiveness inside the toilet saying , "@ please forgive me . @"
because i had already bumped into them , i could neither run back nor continue a head .
but my heart told me , " be strong and go ahead . @"
therefore , i went ahead and joined the interahamwe . i still had the spatula .
in fact , i was the first person to bang my spatula on the toilet 's door so that they would n't know me .
i said , " bitch , you have to open the door . @"
while we were banging the door , i realized that in case they got her and killed her , they would realize that i am a stranger and they would know that i am a tutsi then i would be killed next .
then i said loudly , "@ men , i need to pee . @"
so i pretended as if i was going to pee behind the house and i took off .
from then i never thought of going to the commune again .
i went down to my home village that was known as karambi .
then night came .
the crimes were taking place in broad daylight .
when night fell i left after watching those people kill the girl .
i came back and found a girl 's dead body in a nightdress .
maybe she had been awakened ; who knows .
it seemed like she had been killed several hours before because by then her body had started to swell . then i went to a nearby place called gatare , where i hid in bushes around and took a deep sleep .
i woke up at around eight in the evening ; at such an hour , there would be no noise , which implied that the situation has cooled down .
at that time , there would be no noise of the shootings .
therefore , i went up in kayumba where i was going on my way home .
i suddenly heard a loud noise of grenades and shootings in nyamata . there was a lot of noise at around eight in the evening .
"@ they are dead .
all those who went to nyamata , this is the time for the killings in nyamata . @" i said to myself . i ignored everything and went towards home . it was almost eight thirty in the evening .
i passed by my home compound but i did n't want to enter inside the house . i was afraid because there was no sign of life ; nothing indicating if there was anyone .
i feared to enter . what if i bumped into interahamwe in the house , i thought .
i passed by the house and went on .
on my way i met some boys who had survived [ they did n't go to hide at the church ] .
we greeted each other and chatted a bit about how they survived and then i told them how i was afraid to enter in my home .
"@ i just heard the calf crying but i never heard any human sound . @" i said . i asked them to remain with me .
so , we remained together and went away .
how many were the boys ?
did you ever get to know what happened to your family members ?
no , the last time i saw my family is the day i said we are finished .
i never heard of them again , later i heard the news from my cousin , that they were alive .
at night interahamwe would go to their homes to eat what they had looted .
they would slaughter our cows ; eat our meat , singing loudly .
we could hear them from a distance at the top of the hill where they would be dancing and celebrating their victory . that was the time we could get some kind of peace while the perpetrators were singing .
we would get together and talk .
however we could n't talk like the way i am talking ; we would simply whisper to each other .
"@ hey , what about so and so , is he died or ? @"
whispering . morning would come and we would go back to that bush and sit .
but we would not simply sit .
we stayed there while watching the attackers . the interahamwe would come through this way , and us would go through the other way . we would always be behind them .
except for those who had been hacked and survived , they would go in the swamp and hide there [ as they were wounded ] .
the interahamwe were still working on the hills then .
sometimes they could chase us the whole day and we would spent that day running .
we were lucky if it rained because interahamwe would stay in their homes , then we would go out of our hiding place .
it was terrible .
i remember one day a boy called rushonji and i and other boys ; we were eight in total . we walked down to the swamp to hide thinking that at least we could rest from running that day . we hid in groups of two to avoid being in a big group . before we entered the swamp , we would cut banana leaves to spread them down where we would sit , but that did not stop us from getting wet . at around nine o'clock , we heard the attackers coming to the swamp . there were other interahamwe who were up on the hill to watch people who were hiding in the swamp , then they would shout directing the others about which side we were hiding . within a short time they were near us . they were six interahamwe and we were two , the other boy and i , one attacker had a sharp metal , others had machetes and another one had a club .
they asked us " what are you doing in this swamp ? @"
we said , "@ nothing . @"
then one man from the attackers whose name was mapengu stared at this other boy and said , " i know this boy " of course he knew him because he used to be their house boy before the war .
then he said , "@ young boy , do n't you have money ? @"
then they grabbed him and started checking in his pockets .
they found 80.000 frw .
they were amazed .
they almost fought over the money but their leader stopped them and took the money and said , "@ i know he has some more . @"
they searched in ( mugondo ) the short he was wearing beneath his trousers and got 5,000 francs then they started discussing among themselves what was going to be the next step .
some would say , "@ let us clear them off @" others would say , "@ we have taken a lot of money from them .
let us leave them they will be killed by other groups . @"
their leader told us to remain where we were then they immediately left i had an elastic watch that my sister had given me as a souvenir and because i was frightened i called them back and gave it to them .
then they left .
while they were leaving they saw two other people , i had already told them that we were ten .
then they met two others , these two were not given a second chance ; they were chopped like firewood .
when one 's bone is hacked , his bones sounds like a wood that is breaking .
we heard those boys screaming , "@ ahhh..yiiii @" and they [ interahamwe ] were saying , "@ get out . @" finally they were killed .
after killing them , they continued going , talking loudly .
after a few steps , they met other people and killed them ; they killed everyone in the small groups we had been with .
at half past five or at six , the perpetrators stopped the killings and went home .
the other boy and i went back to check on the small groups of people , the first two people were dead and the other one was on the verge of death his head had been hacked and the brain was spilling and his breath was coming in spasms , we took the banana fibers that we were sitting on and covered their body , as a form of burial .
we continued ahead and found another group ; in this group they were all dead .
in the last group there was a girl whose brains were out but she was still alive .
she told us something that i can never forget ; she said that she was so thirsty , that she wanted something to drink .
but water in the swamp was extremely dirty ; we were urinating , shitting in the swamp .
we told her to let us get out of the swamp .
then that boy whom we were together carried the lower part [ legs ] and i lifted the upper part .
we crossed the swamp but all the way we would cover the dead bodies of our friends . that was all we could do for their burial .
then we reached the side of the swamp where we found a small pond and in that pond there was a piece of calabash [ in the rwandan culture , it is used for drinking water .
] we were so lucky to find it there .
we gave her some water to drink and poured some in her head , but you could clearly tell that she would not survive .
yet we were also fighting to save our own lives .
there was no way we could keep on moving with her in such condition .
we therefore told her to make an effort and crawl up the hill , so that she does not die in the swamp , and it was the time to go and look for sweet potatoes .
she asked us if she could go to nyamata hospital but we told her that it was more dangerous .
she thanked us and prayed for god to bless us . we left her lying there .
but i am sure she died because she was in a very bad state .
we went on with our daily routine .
we got our sweet potatoes and went up the hill for our usual night meeting place . when we reached there , we found some others who had survived .
of course we started asking each other , "@ where is so and so ? @" so that we would know the number of those who died .
there are times when we would be like 10 and there would survive only 3 .
like the 8 people whom we had hid together , we gave a report that they had been murdered .
we reached in karera . it was around three o'clock in the afternoon . we had reached the beginning of a corner and then we heard people talking from the other side of that corner . our hearts started beating very fast ; we thought that they were going to kill us . that boy was a born again christian , i told him that we should run but he told me not to worry that jesus would protect us , he had a bible in one hand , i really do n't know how i snatched it from his hand and hid it beneath my sweater and tucked my sweater in .
they immediately appeared from the corner .
they were five in number ; one had a sword and the rest had machetes .
they stopped us from a distance and asked us , " where are you from ? @"
we also asked them in return , "@ and you where are you from ? @"
i remember it was moonlight they came a little bit closer and checked on us ; my friend had a very long nose , so they said , " check this one .
these are inkotanyi . @"
they ordered us to sit down but i immediately pinched him .
deep in my heart , i had a feeling that i should run rather than sit there and die such a death .
then they started raising their machetes .
i looked behind and swiftly run .
one interahamwe chased me , you can imagine a grown up man chasing a young boy , and of course he was faster than me .
we ran the whole road when i saw that he was about to catch me , i entered into the millet plantation that was nearby .
in the millet plantation , i could n't run properly .
i slipped and fell down and he got on top of me .
he wanted to hack me but he missed because he hacked when i had already moved .
i kept on rolling , and then he hacked me on the finger and behind the knee .
he repeatedly hacked .
i would put up my legs and scream for forgiveness , by chance i reached the terrace , which enabled me to be on my feet again , i saw bush of thorns and jumped inside , passed through and sat behind .
that man feared to follow me because of the thorns .
then he said , "@ tomorrow is yet another day . @"
i remained seated and then he left me there . i heard the other boy screaming , begging for forgiveness .
they beat him saying , "@ where were you going you inkotanyi . @"
they repeatedly beat him i believe he died there .
i did n't know that i had been hacked .
the wounds were still fresh so i could n't tell .
therefore , i sat there and when the other perpetrator [ the one who hacked me ] saw his companions , he shouted and called them .
just below where i was , i heard people shouting back , "@ calm down , calm down . @"
then i whispered to myself ; "@ i am dead . @"
but god made me strong and i remained seated .
"@ calm down , calm down . @"
several voices from all corners calming him .
the number of people had increased considerably as they came to see what was happening .
i was praying thinking i was dead . all those people met at the main road and then he told them that there was one inkotanyi in the bush . he suggested that they enter the bush but some people who had just woken up said it was okay , that tomorrow was another day .
they were trying to discourage them from entering the bush .
i was praying to god to continue helping me all through . then he said , "@ please , it [ inkotanyi ] has entered in here ... i even hacked it with a machete , it is even possible that it is now agonizing ... @" then his friends said to him , " if you hacked him , then why what are we doing here ? @" luckily i saw them leaving . even the others went back to their jobs ; the place suddenly became very silent , you could not even hear a bird singing . then i came out of the millet plantation and ran . i run , run and run . i increased the speed thinking that someone was behind me . i could not even feel pain because the wounds were still fresh . i was about to reach nyamata , but again i changed my mind because i feared some interahamwe who had been patrolling that night . i returned to the swamp but i was too thirsty . i drank a lot of muddy water until my stomach was full .
then i went on and reached my home sector and crossed the road . i was trying to go where i had left the others in the bush where we used to meet . but meanwhile i saw something very bright and it was at night ... i do n't know ... many people said they saw it as well . it was very big shaped like a snake . it passed through the sky leaving every part of the sky very bright . then i thought that i had once again been found out . i ran and ran until i reached the place where i had left the rest . they almost ran but i whispered to them that it was i. they asked me about the boy that we went with ; i told them that he was dead . we sat down we could not sleep because we were always ready to be attacked . we would simply doze .
therefore , i , egide spent the whole night without knowing what was going on .
i remember i was dressed in trousers but i was bare feet . until morning , i was n't aware of the wound i had on my leg .
but i had noticed about the finger because it was too loose .
i realized it when people asked me why my trousers had a hole , which is when i realized that i was hurt .
i began to limp , then and there ; i had it rough .
i began to hide in the swamp like others ; we would hide in the swamp because that is where we could easily hide from the attackers .
whenever we heard attackers coming in the swamp , we would sink in the muddy waters .
you can imagine sinking in that water with wounds all over .
at night i would limp slowly by slowly ... there was an old lady whom we were hiding together , she could squeeze some herbs and apply them on my wound .
that was the medicine that was available .
time came when a person from our village came and told me that my older cousin and his other two brothers were still alive .
the three brothers were all alive .
after killing him they realized that he was alone therefore , they came back to look for other people .
i was limping but whenever i would hear attackers , i would become very normal .
my leg would just straighten out and i would run .
some of the attackers saw me and ran after me .
we ran , ran and ran .
that day the attackers really chased us , i remember stepping in a hole and falling down and i kept on rolling until i was on my feet again .
we had said that we would not get used to the situation , but eventually we got used to running because running was part of the routine .
life went on like that , killing was the in thing ; i remember there was a certain man whose name was ruhorahoza he was a chief during the monarchy .
he was a very tall tutsi ; they crucified him by the road and said that he should be a reference in the future .
meaning , those who would want to see how tutsis looked like in the future , would be shown that body .
in other words , interahamwe thought that no tutsi who would survive . their mission was to kill every tutsi in bugesera and leave one man who was handicapped but survived the nyamata killings .
he was called bahimuza . he was terribly injured at nyamata but he is still alive .
that whoever wanted to know about the history of the tutsi in rwanda would see that man .
that is to say that the interahamwe wanted to wipe out all tutsi .
sometimes i could meet people who had escaped from nyamata church .
they could tell me how the interahamwe killed people ; the interahamwe would take a baby , holding it upside down and showing it to its mother , then they would swing it and hit it on the altar .
people closed their eyes from seeing that act .
that was the opening of the killings .
before they threw grenades on the people in the church , they took a good @-@ looking gentleman and ordered him to lie on his back ; they stubbed him in the chest and blood oozed out .
that is how that man who survived nyamata told us .
after stubbing him , the interahamwe went out of the church and started throwing grenades to the church .
then they entered and started looking through the dead bodies to see who was still breathing .
someone hid under the dead bodies .
he came out after the interahamwe had left and started running with others who were trying to hide .
is he still alive ?
yes he is still alive .
he is now in bugesera in nyamata . so , we went on with our life of hiding .
there was a man called batanga paul , he was an interahamwe .
he had a gun with the mission of killing all young men who were left in that area .
yet the only cultured boy left in that area was my older brother .
because he was educated .
therefore that man was given a mission of finding my brother dead or alive .
then at around seven o'clock in the evening ... we used to go to the destroyed houses at night and cook from there .
because we thought that at night , there was no interahamwe who could attack us .
then that man called batanga came with that group called "@ the irresponsible ones @"@ , two family units to make a deadly group .
they entered and asked , " where is gendaneza ? @"
he immediately threw a grenade and started shouting .
they surrounded the house where the old men used to be .
in the same house , there was my brother in @-@ law 's kid called innocent .
they burnt the kitchen where they were ; the kitchen was made out of grass .
so , they just ignited the kitchen stopping them from getting out .
they were burnt alive .
life continued like that . we kept on hiding from them , some died , we would be attacked and we kept on hiding .
some out of our group would be killed .
but my cousin had a small radio called mera .
he used to walk around holding it in his hand but he would hide it in a bush from the public .
the rest of the day we could spend it running and at night he would listen to the news .
the batteries were not yet discharged by then .
we used to have those weapons expecting to use them to protect your life .
however not every one of us still had them .
but we borrowed the weapons from the people who still had them yet they were afraid to join us .
we left when we were about 24 in number .
we all knew each other because we were following each other in a line . there was a group , which left before us and after sometime , we heard that they were thrown in nyabarongo river .
therefore , most people would be afraid to go because , even those who left , did not survived .
no one had ever left for somewhere and got there ; they would be killed on the way .
people would wonder if those who went to burundi stopped running .
were n't they killed on the way ?
generally there were some people who were afraid of moving .
they would prefer running around in the neighbourhood to dying on their way going somewhere . therefore , they would stay behind saying ; "@ we are used to running and we survive by chance .
it is all the same , we can go and die in a place where we have never been before . @"
at around seven o'clock in the morning , we got up and agreed with each other that we must defend ourselves , no matter what would happen , we should fight .
we decided we were no longer going to run .
we used to run because we were at home ; we knew the hiding places , and the best bushes .
but then , we did n't know the place . the place where we were going was new to us . and we did not know where to run and hide .
we decided not to run even if we met the attackers .
we decided to fight for our lives . and even if we all died and there remained only one of us , that person was asked to die like a man ; fighting for his life .
we walked down the hill towards the valley . it was around seven o'clock in the morning .
through the swamp we reached the banks of river nyabarongo . we walked for three nights and three days .
at daytime we would hide .
and at night , we would walk by the riverside .
we walked for a long time and finely reached a place where rpf had already chased the interahamwe .
after chasing them , they went and camped somewhere in a very big banana plantation . the banana plantation was very bushy ; we walked holding one another 's shirts in order not to break away from each other .
you can imagine a line of twenty @-@ four people through a bushy plantation .
at some point we saw fire and asked one another , "@ what is the fire about ? @"
no one knew .
so , we went ahead and passed through the camp of interahamwe , but we saw it was only children and women . we passed through the camp and did not talk them .
we were still holding each other 's shirt .
we continued until we reached the other side of the river and then walked by the riverside .
it was almost coming to morning around four o'clock .
then the last person on the line looked back and saw a woman who had followed us all the way , when he looked clearly at her , he found out that she was interahamwe .
then that woman also noticed that we were not her people .
she went back running and called others .
they came shouting and , remember we had agreed not to run but we forgot and got scattered ; we were traumatized .
then we hid separately in nyabarongo river .
one had to lift the head out for air .
when you heard a person coming then you would sink in the water for a few seconds , and then if there was nobody nearby , we would put our heads out .
that was our way of hiding .
the perpetrators chilled and moved around the riverside but they did not see us . it seemed like god was with us .
then they got tired and left .
it was getting dark . so , for about an hour we started searching for one another .
we whistled our names because that was our sign .
everyone was around .
we held each other 's shirts and walked on a line again .
after that place , we did not meet other hardships in other places .
it seemed to be paradise .
because we could n't understand it . it was too unusual for us to move without hiding .
therefore , we moved ahead and night was falling .
we also found that unusual .
we continued walking the whole night and when it was almost dawn , we did not hide instead we continued to walk .
at around four o'clock in the morning , there was nothing moving .
[ of course at around four in the morning some activities take place ] . but that time there was none .
around four thirty there was still no activity or action [ openly taking place ] .
at around five in the morning , there was not a single activity , not even birds singing .
on the other hand , at around six in the morning , we started seeing cows without a shepherd ; we were surprised .
we continued to walk but later on we had a problem of how we were going to cross nyabarongo in order to go to juru hill .
then the young boy who was leading us who knew shortcuts told us that river nyabarongo branches off somewhere .
and he assured us that he knew the place .
but to reach that point , it would require another whole hour .
we walked and reached that point and then he dived in .
the water level was up to his chest and yet he was tall .
they had to put young boys like us on their shoulders .
we crossed it without any one shouting at us yet it was daytime .
normally we were used to walking at night when nobody at the hill could see us .
but this time we decided to walk and climb the hill .
we got out of the river and went up the hill .
we had spent three days and three nights without eating .
we walked up and came across a banana plantation , which belonged to tutsi people who had fled their properties .
the bananas were ripening and we were all grabbing them ; those who were tall could grab a banana from up high and those of us who we young like me would pick the ones that were falling .
others went to a cassava plantation .
all that time there was no distraction , no one shouting , eh ... it was unbelievable .
that man had taken up the responsibility to be our leader ; he stopped us and asked us to continue our journey .
we never walked in anarchy , we walked in a line .
then we reached near the main road but the same man who was like our leader told us to wait before we crossed .
he advised us to hide in the banana plantation and let him go to spy the situation .
he had a spear .
he told us that , if we heard him scream we would know that he had been caught , which meant death .
therefore , we should run away .
he went and reached the main road .
he looked ahead of him and saw nothing .
when he looked behind him , he saw a soldier wearing a cap .
he was a tall man wearing a yellow t @-@ shir with inkontanyi uniform trousers .
he was wearing gumboots with a piece of cloth tied to his waist .
then the soldier told him that he was of the same side with him .
and then the soldier asked him to go and call the rest who were hiding .
so , the guy left but doubting his coming back .
he thought that the soldier wanted him to bring those who were hiding with him so he could kill us together . but he did not fear much so he said maybe he is an inkotanyi .
so the guy came and told us the whole story and then he took us to where the soldier was .
imagine a line of all the twenty @-@ three people plus him making twenty @-@ four .
as we had reached there , we saw almost a battalion that was hiding in the same place where we were .
we could n't tell where they were from .
they just surrounded us .
we were trembling and thought that our death had come .
in our hearts we were cursing the guy that he had led us into death .
then the soldiers started to ask us where we were coming from and where we were heading to .
we told them that we were from bugesera .
until then they had n't told us that they were inkotanyi . then they asked us again , "@ how are the people who remained behind ? @"
we told them , "@ everything is going wrong ; people are being killed , others are injured .
generally the situation is too bad . @"
then they asked us to calm down , "@ we are on the same side . @"
they told us .
then they started to ask us about a lady who was living in our village bugesera . they said that she used to visit them in mulindi .
we told them that she was still alive but the perpetrators had cut of her leg .
then one of them said that before the end of the day he would have reached there .
we were so happy and we started talking loudly and we forgot about the tactic of whispering .
we started to laugh and became generally happy .
we told them that since we have seen them , no one else is going to kill us unless they killed us themselves .
suddenly they stopped us from shouting .
they said , "@ listen ! @"
we heard gunshots not far from where we were .
then they told us to stand up and hide in the banana plantation .
then we saw a line of about 200 soldiers passing on the road where we were .
they were lifting heavy weapons .
then we joined the line , we were shown a house where we were going to be living , and they asked us to eat .
they said , "@ even if it means to eat man 's flesh we shall bring it to you but make sure you eat . @"
then we became so excited because our life had improved .
we had started getting food , some of us who had gained stamina asked to join the rpf .
in brief that is how life went ... i even lived in the refugee camp shortly , it is the nkotanyi members who took me there in juru .
later they took me to nyagasambu , where i found several other refugees [ i could call them survivors ] .
we stayed there for a while and after i joined the rpf army and i became a soldier .
during that time , people were very hostile ; sometimes i wonder and ask myself what had happened to the hutu .
i can not imagine how they were thinking during that period .
i wonder where their hearts had gone . someone reaching a point of getting hold of a machete just to hack his fellow human being !
after the genocide i thought that i would never talk to a hutu for the rest of my life .
i hated the hutu so badly . i knew they were real enemies .
and every time i would see a hutu , i would almost be traumatized . whenever i would see a hutu i would wish them death .
in brief , that is how i lived during the war until i survived .
when you were in the banana plantation , how did that gentleman come to you and convince you that he met a soldier and he is asking him to take all of you to him ?
he came shaking and he looked so afraid .
and then he said , "@ i was told to call all of you .
but i am not sure if the guy is an inkotanyi .
in case he is one then we will have survived and if he is an interahamwe then we will die .
but come , let 's go . @"
we followed him but we were afraid .
then we were asked the questions i told you above , and then they told us who they were . after which , we felt at ease .
you were living with your family at the market centre , do you know what happened to them ?
q ...
we were taken to join the army in nyagasambu .
i found my aunt and my younger cousin whom i survived with called rwikangura john .
we started a life of looting .
we would sometimes go to villages and loot .
there were some people who lost their lives then .
sometimes the interahamwe would see us . we were so lucky to survive . later on , there came a soldier he had the rank of a captain .
he asked if there was any person who wanted to join the army .
i joined the army without telling anyone because i would be asked so many questions .
i only let know my cousin .
i did much training , although i did not go to the front to fight .
but i joined the unit that was known as the "@ general headquarters @" which was concerned with gathering the wounded people , supplying bullets and food .
that 's the role i played in the army and how i can not tell you how i left .
it is my secret .
why did you join the army ?
there are about three reasons why i joined the army ; the first one was the bad impression i had of the hutu .
i felt like the war would never end .
therefore , i had to join the army and get trained and maybe own a gun so that in case i was attacked , i would be able to fight back and then go and save others who were still being killed .
i had left them behind .
secondly , i wished to be a hero .
i wanted to save those who were still being killed , well i had left them behind but i wished to go back and save them .
thirdly , i joined the army because the life i was leading in the refugee camp was horrible . therefore , i decided to join hoping to find a slightly better life .
given the life you experienced , where do you think rwanda is heading ?
are you asking me rwanda at large or you are asking me the political point of view ?
i am asking you in general .
generally , i have come to realize that rwandans are wise people .
we are wise but hypocrites .
if rwandans were open to one another , i mean they can be honest towards each other ; the future of rwanda would be good .
in my country rwanda there are honest people , however there are also others who are still greedy .
if you critically observe rwanda , you will find that rwanda has a good vision .
the only condition is that some of its people do not become selfish .
it has been happening , people who put their personal interests forward .
sometimes i say they are selfish .
q ...
sometime ago when i was still in the army , i was asked if i could accept to be taken abroad and get my scar removed but i refused .
i told those people that my scar would stay as y souvenir of the genocide , because i personally do n't find it easy to forget the genocide .
never .
i want to appear in the history of rwanda .
i will never forget what happened to me and i will tell it to my grandchildren and my great grand children . whoever will generate from my family will have to learn that genocide is very bad .
i will expose what was in it [ genocide ] .
the way i am now giving you this testimony .
do you believe that consequences of the genocide will affect your offspring ?
it will affect them because already now i became the person responsible for survivors by the time i was in a school in shyogwe in gitarama .
i try to listen to the children and to understand their problems .
someone did not see what took place during the genocide , for example the people who came from the neighbouring countries and who did not see what happened besides hearing it from people .
well some of these people say that they want to join the survivors association .
some join and sometimes get traumatised after hearing people 's testimonies within the association .
that is a simple example .
but i personally if i get my own children , i will tell my children the stories of genocide and show them the consequences of it .
i will show them my scar of the 1994 genocide .
i know it will be hard .
but my children will have to keep it at heart . but i am worried because there are some people , the hutu for example who will keep on harassing my kids .
but i really wonder if they will one day feel free to live with us with no worries ?
i find it impossible , i do n't know how i can put it .
is there any particular message you would like to pass to the world at large especially to those who will came across this testimony .
a message i could give out ... well there is a certain man who told us that in israel there is a house , which stands as a genocide memorial centre . [ rwanda is trying to do the same ] in the memorial centre , there are 60 million candles , which are always lit and each candle represents a person who died in the genocide that took place there [ holocaust ] . and on every candle , there is a name of the victim . which implies that , every person who died in the genocide was taken into consideration and still counts . it is in that case that i appeal to all rwandans at large to fight against those who deny that there was genocide . therefore my message is forwarded to the government ; i will excuse myself because i am going to talk about the leaders of this country . to me it seems to be a big problem ; leaders always talk about reconciliation yet they can never come down to us ; people like us we know much about the children 's testimonies but since these leaders never come down to us and hear that message from low class people , or see those orphans ... most of them [ leaders ] get about 300,000 rfw or 400,000 rfw but you can never catch him [ a leader ] take the initiative of taking an orphan , instead he selfishly keeps that money . this is the message i can give to the leaders . leaders should reduce the words they speak and put what they say into action .
money has no value if you do n't use it appropriately .
but sincerely if you are a nationalist and you really need reconciliation among rwandans then show that love , take in the orphans who are starving out there , who have no school , take them in and raise them in your home .
let 's not be selfish .
rwandans in general , we should love one another that is how we will be able to develop our country .
i like our president because he loves his country and the people in the country , which i find very wise .
may god bless him . i wish he works together with people who love the country and the nation at large , and then our country will develop .
to love the people who love their country and rwandans in order do develop it .
the message i can pass on to all rwandans is to love one another and strive for the improvement of our country .
the other thing is and i will not stop repeating it , anyone who denies the genocide should be opposed .
thank you .
when they came home to kill , they were very many . some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons .
so they came home and found us there .
we were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else .
therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together .
so it happened but ... well , i managed to escape .
they came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people .
soldiers came first and then the interahamwe followed .
they [ interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] .
they used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ .
then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... i am the one who came out of there alive .
it was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many .
as i was lying down , i stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . there were only floods of blood .
but because by then i was ... well , i had become numb ; i could n't think of doing anything at that time yet i needed to find my way out of that place .
it was n't easy to leave that place because i was difficult to find space where to step .
well , i hid myself and i was lucky to see a new day .
that is when i got out of that place .
i thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing i was waiting for .
then i thought , " let me find a way of protecting myself and see if i would survive . @"
i escaped them . even those who came later ... in fact , i left a green shirt where i was shot ; i was at the back .
so i left my shirt there and the following morning , when some people came to loot , they realized that someone had managed to escape .
they tried to look for me but they could n't find me .
they even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed .
but i did n't hide near there , i continued fleeing .
it was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing .
i looked for a way of going to e.t.o [ a technical school in kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because i had no one to help me [ get there ] .
i tried all possible ways but i failed .
then i started moving around .
however i thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died .
i continued doing that and the war went on , the 1994 war .
i would pass through dead bodies , people who were terribly hacked and could n't do anything for themselves .
i had also been shot on the back but i would try and walk .
i remember the shootings took place at seven in the evening .
later after the shooting , i tried to get out of the fence where we were but it was a problem to me as they had destroyed all the behind passages .
they blocked the way out so that they could see anyone who would try to jump over the fence .
they waited and realized that there was no alive , then they told each other , "@ you can now enter and start looting . @"
that is how i survived and i was taken to the hospital .
i was treated because i had been injured .
but they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound .
in july , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating .
then f.a.r.g [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school .
we started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools .
so i managed to study but because i had a problem with my arm , which was due to the wound where i was shot at the shoulder , i was not very okay mentally .
life went on like that .
they were other children who survived .
we used to meet there and talk about what happened to us and to our people during the genocide .
but days were very bad during that period .
no one was able to ... imagine one killing a person who is not fighting back .
it is a big problem ; killing someone who can never fight back , it is like killing a lamb .
the killer was capable of torturing the victim as much as he wished .
fortunately , the war ended .
life went on as it used to be .
well , life was still very hard but peace was certain . the rest comes slowly by slowly .
from then up to now life is going on fairly .
well , people get problems like health problems and others but one keeps trying to look for a living .
we believe that it is god , who knows .
when we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that god played his role .
because human beings would never manage it without god 's power .
now that you have told us about your life in details , i would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ?
eh , my dad was called macumi francois and my mum was called umulisa odetta .
and how many were you in your family ?
we were two ... three kids at home .
we were all boys .
they all died and i am the only one who survived .
among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ?
i am twenty @-@ five years old .
before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ?
if it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ?
yes it used to happen especially within families .
some people were victimized in that way .
our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift .
i remember how my family was tortured and we had no security .
my father used to work in exile ; he used to go on long trips and then interahamwe would attack us at night ; they would bang on our door ... but we would be patient because the same people we were supposed to report to were the ones to initiate everything .
i guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it .
still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ i got such and such problem . @"
but since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do .
we definitely used to get such problems . in fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . but they never did any harm to us .
you told us some of your family members would be forced to shift .
do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ?
where did they go or where were they taken ?
yeah ... okay , there was ... well i can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in gikondo and in kinazi before .
when they left kinazi , they went to cyangugu .
they made move to cyangugu and then they came back here in gikondo .
during the time when people were suspected to be traitors , there is one of my relatives who was beaten up to the extent that he died after going crazy .
his name was francois .
he died in the genocide in gikondo , an area where there used to be a terrible interahammwe called ‘ congolais ’ [ congolese ] .
his mother [ francois ' ] was called nyinakazi w'inyezi [ meaning ‘ mother of inyenzi ’ ] in gikondo . the genocide found them in gikondo .
their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work .
whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to inyenzi .
and whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from inyenzi .
they would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . one could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family .
it was well known that there was a tribal war between the hutu and the tutsi .
and you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home .
do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a tutsi ?
well , he was not harassed because he was a tutsi but because he used to say things the way they were .
another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an inyenzi .
he was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort .
the place where we lived was located in a very bad area .
you have probably heard of a place called ‘ camp butaro ’ .
all the refugees who came from ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area .
could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... what was his behaviour ?
the times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ?
tell us in brief how he used to handle it .
in fact what he was accused of , he was accused ... first of all he was someone who ... did not like the ideas of jealousy or of ethnic or regional segregation .
secondly , he was not afraid of saying the truth , he did not fear anyone and he could n't support anyone he would see doing something wrong .
never !
so , they thought he was against them . they would say , "@ why is it that when we tell him our ideas he never agrees with us ? @"
what made things worse is that whenever he would go away on long trips , he would bring us tapes of inkotayi or kayirebwe 's video tapes .
so there was always a question mark .
he was victimized because other hutus would say , "@ this is our fellow hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @"
he would tell them , "@ this is not the way things should be . @"
could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that habyarimana 's plane crashed ?
i remember i was revising my lessons and my mum was cleaning up my young brother in the sitting room .
my dad owned a small bar where he was sharing a drink with other people , and then we heard that habyarimana died .
i could tell that there was a change on my parents ' faces .
by then we were young , and although they would not tell us exactly what was going on , i could feel the tension in my parents and in everyone who was at home .
tell us in brief ... from where he said , "@ let 's flee . @"
what happened later ... if you remember the dates or if it was two or three days later ... up to his death , what happened ?
i do n't remember the days but i know we were ... yeah , what happened in the meantime .
the morning after the plane crashed , i remember he tuned in radio muhabura to listen to news at around five in the morning .
then some man called evode called , he was my brother 's godfather .
as they were talking he told my father how things were , he said we had no way to flee before it 's too late .
secondly , he said that those who could have helped us were too far .
there was no way we would walk up to c.n.d ; it was impossible .
he tried making phone calls ... people who were outside the country would call him asking about the situation in kigali .
they would say ; "@ we have heard that habyarimana 's plane was crashed , how are things there ? @"
we were waiting to see what would happen because they had forbidden people to go out of their homes .
nobody was allowed to go out of his or her house . but the wise men had already sensed what was going to happen next .
meanwhile he received several phone calls from inside and outside the country , people were asking him how the situation was .
he would tell them , "@ i am at home with my family but we do n't have a way out .
people are being killed in front of my house , things are horrible here . @"
a certain neighbour whose wife was my mom 's sister .
his wife was pregnant ; she was carrying twins . he had several other brothers .
they were all together in the same house .
then my dad told him , "@ instead of ... there is no way you will hide your wife , you 'd better bring her to my home and leave her there . then the rest , everyone should find his own way .
whoever will survive will tell the story . @" that is what happened , they brought he home and others started fleeing in different directions .
as people would keep on coming to hide at home , the interahamwe would also plan how to attack us .
although they were making plans , they were also afraid that my dad would fight them .
indeed he tried though he failed ; they were very many .
they first shot our gate ; it was a very big gate , they shot with so many bullets and it never fell down . they fought to open the different gates around the fence for two days in vain .
it was one day in the evening when they finally decided to climb up the fence and get inside the compound .
for two weeks things were still the same ; phone calls time after time ... in that area where we were living , others had already fled .
people 's houses were being burnt and people were being killed .
generally there was no place to hide .
two weeks later ... they came to kill us ... on a friday at around 6:00 p.m. i do n't remember well the dates but i am sure two weeks had passed .
that evening they entered our home .
they jumped the gate and shot the front door and it opened .
then they all entered inside the gate but we had locked ourselves inside the house .
they ordered to open the door but my dad said , "@ whether i open or not will n't make any difference , they will still shoot the doors and open them by force . @"
that line of people ... it was the people who were inside the house and the ones inside the compound .
they had sought refuge at home .
my dad would call people and tell them that in case things got worse where they were , some should come to his house while others flee to other areas .
he would warn them from fleeing in a big group saying that , in case they ambushed them , they would die in a big number .
"@ send me the ones i can hide and tell the strong boys and girls to flee in separate directions . do n't let them flee in a big number . @"
he would tell them .
he never thought that such a thing would happen . mostly , he felt pity for the children and the women who were n't able to run .
he thought such people would easily be killed .
at least a man is capable of fighting or running .
even if they are shot while trying to run they can keep on running only if they are not fleeing with the rest of their family .
they got us out of the house . we were very many forming a rank and they took us outside .
they would shoot every person to get out , i was the fifth person to be shot .
after shooting me ... they shot me while i was trying to escape ; i was sitting somewhere where there was a drum supported by stones .
around there , there was a small door , which they [ militias ] had shot and it was open ... the militias entered in a big number and i could see that no one was standing at the door .
as i was trying to stand up , he shot me here [ he shows ] and i fell down .
when i fell down , maybe he thought i was dead . he skipped me and shot those who were around me .
at the end one of them said , "@ this is not enough , open a grenade . @"
they opened one .
i even still have its scars somewhere here ; i have two fragments inside ere .
as they threw the grenade , i was also hurt but it just felt like an injection so i ignored it .
i thought in case i breathed , they would hear me .
therefore , i remained in the floods of blood and kept quiet . my shirt was full of blood and everyone who was lying on top of me had blood all over .
i just kept quiet . and then they threw another grenade and some of them walked over people 's bodies stabbing them with knives .
i did n't notice one who wanted to stab me .
fortunately he missed and hit the ground on the grass instead .
i sensed that it was me he wanted to stab . he again raised up the knife and stabbed me on the shoulder . when he saw me bleeding , he thought we were all dead .
therefore , they left .
i was watching them as they were leaving .
i rose up my head a bit but everybody was silent ; they were all dead .
i stood up ... one thing i remember is the way i entered the house and picked up the blanket ; it was raining and the blanket was very big .
therefore , i covered them and covered myself with a loincloth , which belonged to my mum .
i had lost my mind ; i would wonder if i should get into the house and sleep .
i was confused . sometimes people cry but i did n't have tears to cry , not even a drop .
instead i would think about what had happened to me and i 'd suddenly feel so confused .
yes ... my mum was also shot .
she was a "@ born again christian . @" she liked praying so much ; all i would hear her say was , "@ jesus christ @"@ .
and my brothers were next to each other ; they were made to sit in a line like this ... i heard people screaming besides .
i remember my aunt ... there was no other way but if i had had help , she would have survived .
she died in the banana plantation but i too was helpless , i could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant .
for her she still had some strength to breathe .
there was nothing i could do for her , myself i had lost conscience due to what had happened to me .
i left her after she had breathed her last breath . by the time i left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead .
they shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here .
my brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head .
there was a big stream of blood .
but when you left , you never got a chance to know that ...
i never got another chance to know what happened next .
i came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up .
and i found only corpses lying in the compound .
i tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide .
they helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ...
by that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ?
by that time , i could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing .
i could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing .
things like that .
were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ?
i was n't able to do that .
you see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal .
we did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony .
we just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil .
then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else .
from the time you left your home .
when i left home i continued to walk .
but even as i was going , there were some people who were behind me . they tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving kicuciro for gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there .
therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me .
they found out that i never went there .
after the struggle , that is after meeting the inkotanyi i told them [ inkotanyi ] all i went through and where i had been .
they helped me as much as they could .
they asked me , "@ how are you ? @"
i told them that my problem was the injury i had .
they could see it had rotten because i never used to get treatment .
they treated me and later asked me to go home and start looking for a living .
my current life ... well i can not say that it is very good but still i can not say that it is too bad .
when there is peace in the country and one is able to sleep peacefully , then life goes on .
after you met the inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ?
whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ?
what happened later after they left me , i went to kicuciro .
there is someone from my family who had survived but i never knew ... when the war began , i guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them .
therefore , i thought they had all died .
i went to remera near iamca , where kie [ kigali institute of education ] presently is .
then i met a certain man who had come from uganda ; he knew my family .
he took me to school in uganda . i studied there for a while and came back to rwanda .
i registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . that is how things used to be .
i would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on .
i finally got used to it and started living a normal life .
i would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened .
one can never forget what happened but life has to go on .
did you manage to finish school ?
i used to have a problem of headaches .
i would be attentive in class but all of a sudden i would get terrible headaches . another problem was due to my arm ; it would hurt me so much and i would n't ...
you said you suffered a lot .
but you never explained very well to us how you suffered .
eh ... the way i suffered ...
what happened in your life in general ?
not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now .
what has been the most challenging thing ?
loosing both my parents ?
well ... first of all i started another kind of life , which i was n't used to .
because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living .
i entered another life that i was not used to .
living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something i needed .
those are the things that would disturb me .
the fact that ... those are things i noticed .
the way i saw people dying and the way i was skipping corpses , people i would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me .
until when i met the inkotanyi .
i remember there was a man who lived here and we met at sainte famille .
he assured me that he was going to save me .
but we reached somewhere and i noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . i escaped him and run away ; i escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where i went .
i saw different things in life .
i saw people suffer .
i saw how after the genocide orphans got problems , i included .
i got used to a different life style .
god helped me now i am used to the new life style .
there is a saying that , "@ akabi ntikamenyerwa nk'akeza . @" it means it is more difficult to get used to bad things than to good things . but later you get used due to the situation . yeah ...
life went on like that ... i would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could .
until i got totally used to it and i grew older , which made me so happy .
in your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ?
something that takes away your joy .
what hurts you most whenever you remember it ?
living without my relatives ... no family , which is the most important thing ... living without anybody to tell my problems .
sometimes i say , "@ i could get this or that in such a way , but since there is nobody to help me , what can i do ? @"
then i remember that , i could have been with my parents or relatives and they could have helped me in such a time .
however , it does n't discourage me . secondly i am hurt by the kind of life orphans lead yet they were n't meant to live that way .
especially when they are three or four orphans who can not help one another .
it is a pity .
well ... even if you are an orphan , life has to go on whatever the case may be ...
yes , that is true life has to go on . and it is still going on .
what advise can you give someone like you who passed through such hardships and who experienced a hard life ? those who lead a life like yours ?
the advice i can give them ... first of all i would encourage them to have morale .
they should know that in life such things ... well , such things happened because people had become wild due to bad governance .
another advice i can give them is to use their time efficiently .
if one has a chance to go to school , he or she should study .
if one gets a job then he or she should work .
or if there is someone who has a farm with destroyed houses , he or she should try to build there his or her own house and put there his or her own family when they get an opportunity to do so .
any one who has a chance should use it well .
that is the advice i can give them .
if you admit that you committed a crime then your punishment would be reduced or ... whatever the case , the truth would be revealed .
maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't .
but they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood .
after they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier .
but since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... i think they should just acknoweldge what they did .
what message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ?
the message i would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading .
there are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh !
but the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully .
the only advice i could give such a person is to kind of overlook what happened and go on with life .
he or she should look for a living .
he or she will later find out that everything is possible . however , such a person will never forget what happened , that is impossible .
but he or she should just find a way to ignore it and look for a living because that is how life is .
because even those who were killing us never knew that we would survive .
to them , the fact that we survived is unbelievable ; imagine killing about a hundred people from the same family and one survives .
they never knew it was possible but god proved to them that everything is possible .
umh ...
what do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ?
i appreciate that ceremony and i find it very good .
there is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten .
that is impossible .
it is a good ceremony because ... whenever that period comes , people always say , "@ at such a time , disasters occurred in this country due to this or that reason . @"
that act of commemoration for those who died in the genocide ... constitutes an example to other nations ... it gives an example to other countries and they get a chance to judge that what happened to our country was terribly wrong and should never happen again .
i find that ceremony very important because it helps people to predict our country 's future and it helps us to avoid its reoccurring .
today you are leading a life that is different from the one you would be living if your parents were still alive . you certainly desire a better life .
whom do you think should play a role in improving your life and for you to get peace at heart ?
saying that one has a role to play in it ... f.a.r.g tries its best to help some of us .
the fund tries to advice those who are leading a difficult life about how they should behave in such a situation .
i believe in life it ’ [ s important to ... not that we should wish for things we will never get or let someone make promises they will never fulfill ...
i believe reconciling all rwandans would be a very big step forward .
when you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts .
it is time for every rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country .
they should love each other as rwandans .
rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country .
conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation .
there is no interest in conflicts .
instead , i believe reconciliation based on principles for developing the country would be a big step forward for a better life .
i believe they should first understand clearly how important reconciliation is and what an important step it is .
in your opinion , do you find it possible for rwandans to reconcile ? and if it is impossible why is that ?
in my opinion , reconciliation among rwandans ... well , it is possible but it will be a long process . but in the end it will happen . it is even taking place nowadays .
today people do interact yet they belong to different ethnic groups .
they talk with no problem . they visit each other . and when it 's time to share , they share .
but it is possible it is on its way ... and personally , i think those who do n't want to move forward and make that step are fools .
because there is no way one will live alone in this world ; there is no way one can decide to live with only one ethnic group .
it is impossible .
if you feel like living with only one group of people , then even governing this country will become a problem .
that means that all rwandans would n't be able to live with each other .
it would be like going back to the time of conflicts when people would kill others without any reason or because of what you own or because of your ethnic group .
it was said that due to your ethnic group , you were not allowed to pass in school . to me , that is nonsense .
it can not contribute to the development of the country .
some people would always put forward the issue of ethnicity .
i have just understood that your parents were from different ethnics groups . how do you feel about it ?
to me i do n't feel anything ... saying that so and so is from this or that ethnic group ... even the genocidaires killed some people who did not belong to the ethnic group that was hunted .
they were victimized because they had positive ideas and they did n't believe they should hack the mother of their children just because she is of a different ethnic group .
some did it in the name of taking up a challenge .
they would say , "@ so and so has killed somebody 's family , therefore i also have to kill a certain family . @"
just because somebody killed they also had to kill , which is so stupid .
you just mentioned survivors who say that , "@ hutu killed my people . @"
do you personally believe it were the hutu who did you wrong or do you believe it were the tutsi ?
which of both sides do you blame ?
i believe it was the hutu who did me wrong because no tutsi would have come to kill me .
first of all , there was no way tutsi would come to kill me since we had no problems with each other . secondly there was no way they would find the courage to kill us yet they were also hunted .
i guess you understand that they had no possibility of killing me .
but since the hutus had the power and the ability to do anything they wanted , they are the ones who killed .
there is a certain program for gacaca courts , which is meant for punishing the criminals .
what can you say about it ?
in the name of revealing the truth about the genocide and bringing reconciliation among rwandans , what is your view about gacaca courts or how do you understand it ?
what do you think about it ?
the way i consider the issue of gacaca ... well , something i always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to arusha .
it was important to let the other perpetrators be judgeded from their local courts where the local people have access .
because ... for example if someone killed in gikondo or remera and he is imprisoned in muhima ; there is no way someone from muhima would accuse him without knowing him .
therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted .
i believe it was a very good idea .
because if they had not simplified it in that way , maybe it would be more difficult to judge them .
but when they take the prisoners in their respective provinces , communes and cells , it facilitates the judges who examine their cases .
and it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts .
there is no way you can witness someone whose trials are taking place in nyamirambo when you are from gikongoro .
it is hard to get means of transport or accommodation ... i guess the idea was good .
so that the defendant are judged and punished for their crimes .
it is unbelievable that a neighbour could actually have the courage to kill his or her neighbour ... that someone would come to your place and kill your whole family when you used to go to the same school with his children or when your families intermarried , or when they used to pay you a visit when you threw parties at home .
i believe gacaca is very good idea .
what do you think of the program of getting prisoners to say the truth about people 's death and ask for forgiveness ?
what i can begin with is ... the message i 'd like to give is @: when we were young , we used to talk to our grandfathers and they would tell us about the 1959 war , the 1962 war and what took place there .
now in our case ... the 1994 war particularly terrible .
people were killed in an extremely horrible way .
i used to hear that in the past they would kill women and children ... i am not sure but it was something like that .
but this time the whole family with its offsprings would be killed and completely finished ... such things ...
it seems like what happened will never be forgotten .
because even my children will one day ask me , "@ dad where is our grandfather or our grandmother ? @"
in that case what i would tell them is "@ your grandparents died at this period , when conflicts rose in the country and some people hated others based on their ethnic belonging or on their honesty about their [ political ] opinion .
others were victimized because of their families ... it went to an extent of families killing each other because of grudges already existing within them .
i would explain to him how things were , how people hated each other in 1994 .
i would tell him how they killed his relatives simply because of their ethnic belonging or to their honesty about their [ political ] opinion .
then i would advise him not to ever follow such ideologies especially when based on people 's ethnic groups and never to give importance to such ideas .
that is the first thing i would warn him about .
i would explain to him that the reason he does n't have grandparents , is because of the hatred somepeople developed towards others .
i would tell him how there once were conflicts between two ethnic groups and as a result , people hated one another and killed each other .
i would want to try and teach him the truth .
so that he may never be affected in his life as grown up . i would encourage him never to believe in such ideas .
i would tell him that his grandparents were killed either because of the ethnic group they belonged to or because they were supporting a certain ethnic group .
i would tell him so that he grows up knowing what happened . and the point would be to avoid him wasting his time doing the same thing .
in the past while you were still with your parents , you saw the government , the political parties and the development that were in the country then .
what do you think is the future of this country when you consider its past ?
our country 's future ... well the first thing i am thankful for is the government of unity ; it is trying to bring back rwandans into transparency .
they also try to find a way of punishing those interahamwe who did those things [ killed ] so that it all comes in the open ... in the future there would be no more bad spirit among rwandans .
things like hacking one another or killing one another .
therefore , i believe the government played a great role and now the country is developing ; new houses are being built , there is a change in the governance .
generally , things are changing for the better .
according to me , as years go by , the country will farther develop .
is there anything you would like to add on the testimony that you are giving us ?
it could be a message or anything you would wish to say as a conclusion .
i think that is all .
my name is clemence uwamahoro .
i was born in kibuye in a district , which was called mabaza in sector called rubengera , in kibagiro cell .
i am 21 years old .
well about the testimony of my life before the war , i was with my parents , my relatives , and my family at large .
then time came for me to start studying .
the war started while i was in primary four and from then , we started having hardships in our studies .
we would be asked about our ethics , they would come and say , "@ tutsis stand there and hutus stand here . @"
but on my side , i never knew any thing .
i remember sometimes they would ask me and i would tell them that , "@ my family belongs to abanyiginya ... @" [ a clan ] i could n't understand what they meant .
but my teacher knew my dad , so he would go and ask my father and then he would know it from there .
otherwise , all the time he asked me , i never used to reply him a single word .
because in my home , they never used to brief us about where to stand in case they asked for tutsi or hutus to stand @-@ up .
therefore , things continued like that and it never took long , i shifted from the first class to the second class to the third up the fourth .
i remember it was in the first term in april .
i remember one time when habyarimana had died ; he died on the 6th of april 1994 .
but on the 7th that is when i knew that he was died yet others knew it earlier .
we were seated outside the house with several other people who were wondering about the president 's death .
and after some time , we saw across in mushubati and other areas , houses burning .
we were many people seated outside .
and , immediately we saw a very big group of attackers coming from bandamiko they were the bakiga , who lived just across .
they were with a certain man who was called fayineto ; he was our neighbour .
he was introducing them the areas , which were mainly occopied by tutsis .
they passed in the midst of our group and said , "@ there is a big number of tutsis living in this area ! it is only the tutsis covering this hill .
therefore , once you are done with those areas in the valley , you will come and do a good job here . @"
then they said , "@ it must be the tutsis who killed our president .
therefore , they must n't live . @"
then the former burgomaster of mabana district ; mr. bagirishema ignace came .
he was moving in a car speaking loudly using a microphone , he was saying that , "@ all tutsis wherever they are should come up at the district 's offices in oder for them to ensure all the tutsi 's security at once . @"
because they had started burning from all sides except our home village . however they would begin from the valley and come up to the hill slowly by slowly .
they had burned all those ends of mushubati , gihara sector , and they were proceeding towards rubengera .
therefore , after realising that houses were being burnt , yet someone was anouncing that all tutsis should seek refugee at the district 's offices where they would offer security services to all of them .
we all went to the district ; my father , my mother and families all of us we left for the district .
when we reached there , there were many people , it was on the 7th of april .
morning come , which was on the 8th of april 1994 but people continued coming in big numbers .
then bagirishema the burgomaster went on and said , "@ since several people are still coming , yet the bakiga are coming from up there with a plan of killing you from here .
i guess the best idea is to carry your properties and babies , and help those who can not walk , up to the stadium .
since it is a big place and well fenced , it will be easy to protect you as required . @"
truly at the district it was not secure because it was an open place with people coming in big numbers , others were on the road ; some would come with all their belongings ... so he said that we had to go to the stadium where we would all be protected .
geneerally it was the safer place where no one would attack us and be able to do any harm to us .
as soon as he had finished saying so ... people were still coming in big numbers and others were leaving .
we were seven children and home ; two girls and five boys .
i was the fourth born , the first three were boys .
so one of them said ... he was called epa ... epaphrodite dushimimena . he was a bit old ; he was in senior four [ secondary ] .
he said ... but dad had told us that , we should all go to kibuye because there was no other alternative . @"
then epa said , "@ i will n't go to kibuye to wait for death like a dog , follow all these people ... i have to go back home and rather die there than taking a journey to kibuye . @"
so , he refused going and went back home .
then my other brother called aimable with pacific whom i followed , they followed him and they were taken to ... there was a certain man who was a family friend .
he was related to the burgomaster and they were living in the same gate .
that is where they were taken .
then my sister and i , we were taken to ... there also another lady , to whom my mum was a godmother . at times we would live together .
we were taken to her home and we stayed there .
the remaining two who were the youngest , stayed with mum and went to the stadium with her .
after we left , they also left and when they got there we were informed .
the other one went back to the abandoned home ; it was already demolished though they had n't burnt it .
we stayed there and we did n't what had happened .
we thought that those who went to kibuye are going to be protected and after some time , we would join up again .
because they had sent us in a home that was well off ; ‘ people who were related to the burgomaster ! ’ we thought we were really safe .
so , we stayed there on the 8th/04/1994 .
and , in the evening uncle gasasira brought all the cows , which were at home in that home where we were .
then he went back .
but before he left , he told us that , "@ several people are still coming in kibuye but they are all worried because there is a rumor that they are going to kill them .
there is a possibility that we will never see each other again . @" be said bye to us and left .
we stayed there and suddenly there came a group of attackers saying [ they were singing ] ; we have wiped away all the people who were in the stadium in kibuye .
they are all finished .
maybe those who remained in their home areas are the ones who have survived and we have to search for them seriously .
we shall use dogs to hunt them so that no one stays behind . @"
apparently those who went to kibuye were the old people and they had killed all of them .
they had set roadblocks on every entrance and exit of the stadium .
no one was able to get out ; whoever would need to pass they would hack him or her .
after hearing that ... since i was the eldest to my sister whom we were together , i realized things had worsened .
then i wondered , " since they have killed them , where are we left ? @"
then , the owner of the home where we were living .
after hearing that he said , "@ all in all they will come back for you @" his name was munyagishari .
he continued , "@ among the people who are most wanted in rubengera , there are three men . those three must die ; "@ gahizi is among them . @"
my father , he was called gahizi evariste .
then he went on mentioning the names ; "@ karungu is one of them and leonard . @"
leonard was my father 's colleague ; they were teachers in mushubati .
"@ whatever it takes , they must die . they will even come to kill you in my eyes . @" he told us . we could n't understand what he was taking about .
therefore , we sat outside with other kids .
when we had that all those who went to kibuye were killed , we knew that we are the next to be killed .
and , whenever we would try to enter in the house , that man would tell us that , "@ remain outside because they will come to check in the house .
and in case they found you inside they would kill me not leaving you , and demolish my house .
therefore , keep on playing with other kids outside they will n't know you . @"
and then certain group of attackers went to karungu 's home .
karungu had also refused to leave his home so he remained there in ndara where he lived just across a place called gacaca .
and when that group past , there was some lady called seseko , who knew our family .
then she said , "@ the man who lived here was a good friend to gahizi .
he used to look after his children and now i guess his children are in his home . @"
as soon as she had said so , they past where we were seated with other kids .
then she said , "@ this kid resembles the mother so much ; she ressembles dativa . @"
then she came close to me and said , "@ show me your hands ... smile for me ... @" she said that tutsis have a dark gum , long fingers , their ribs have a special shape ... the she asked me , "@ you must be gahizi 's child , do you disagree ?
i just kept quiet .
"@ look the way she is proud ... anyway , let 's go to work first ... @" it was a very big attack of about thirty people .
i only knew seseko plus a another man who was called byiringiro ; he lived in kigabiro .
those are the people who seemed to be so active and they were the leaders of the whole group .
then they said that , "@ let 's go , we shall work on you when we come back . @"
therefore , they continued their journey towards karungu 's home as we stayed there .
therefore , when munyagishari heard that , they would come back and destroy his house just because of gahizi 's children [ us ] , whom is keeping , he told us that , "@ find a way of leaving this place and go somewhere else .
look your father is dead , your mother is dead too , your brothers none is alive ... @" it was around the 10th of apri 1994 .
then we left his home after telling us those words .
i told my young sister that , "@ let us just take the road and go because there is no where else we can hide . @"
where could we hide ?
"@ dad i dead , mum is dead , no one is alive .
are we going to stay with this people ? can we live with them ? @"
in my whole life , it was my first time to feel a lot of pain within me .
i never knew how to cry neither did i know malice .
generally , i never knew ‘ suffer ’ i just got confused .
when i saw all that , i said to myself , "@ this is how i will die . after killing this cow , i am the one who is left . @"
after taking the cow , they said that , they should n't find us in that home when they come back .
they had taken one cow out of the five that were there .
"@ if we find then here , we shall slaughter them in your presence . @" they warned him .
my sister told me that , "@ look at how we are going to die ! @"
so we left ... he told us [ the man were we were living ] "@ please help me and leave this place .
look for somewhere else to go because i do n't wish to ... you have seen how they have killed that cow .
definitely that is how they will kill you . so please i do n't want you to die from here .
they would rather kill you from where i can not see you than in my presence . @"
therefore we left very sure that we were going to kibuye .
we were ready to go to the stadium walking .
saying that if we met some perpetrator , then he would kill us and end the story like it happened to others ; we had forgotten about their stories , we had that they died and it was over .
we were left no where .
so we went through some place called gacaca ... in gacaca .
there was a short cut to the main road .
then we saw a group of attackers who were coming from ... they coming saying that , "@ even those who had remained we have completed them . @"
one would say , "@ i have killed the family of so and so .
i looked for them and killed them because they are the ones i never liked most .
we never used to talk and heart was never happy with them . @"
then another one said the same story .
and then another man said , "@ in gahizi 's family though i never saw many of the members ; i did n't see gahizi .
but the wife died .
that is the only family i killed . @"
he was imitating how he hit them using a club , saying how he was cutting them with knives .
"@ but i did n't see all their kids . @"
he added .
when i had him saying that , i told my sister that , "@ i do n't know your idea but i suggest we sit here so that they find us and kill us from here .
hope you can here that they are very many and there is nothing left .
we are not even left anywhere . @"
across the road there was a sorghum plantation , we were still in the shortcut almost getting to the main road .
as soon as i heard them saying those words , heart charged ... i can not explain how i felt .
it was beyond my understanding .
then i said , "@ i am going to sit here . let them kill me from here , i will n't walk anymore .
they should find me here and kill me . @" it was around 1:00 ... "@ i can not continue walking , how can one land in a group of such people ? @"
i would imagine them killing us like they killed the other cow ; cutting a finger , a leg ... i said , "@ i will not move further . @"
then i sat down .
i sat in the sorghum plantation next to the road .
then i laid down , "@ if they find me lying then may mistake me to be a corpse . @" i imagined .
i decided that it was better to lie on road maybe one would hit me accidentally and then i would rest .
because i would imagine living alone in this world and i would find it very hard to understand .
i got confused with a lot of sorrows .
then my sister told me that , "@ let me tell you ... @" she was called dudu as nickname but her true name is uwumukiza grace .
she said , "@ listen , clemence .
if you decided to stay here , i will not stay here with you . @"
she is so brave .
she told me that , "@ i have accepted dead , i will meet them and proceed to the stadium . perhaps i would meet there at least one person from home then we would continue together .
but you with your cowardliness ... i can not stay with you because i can not die seated just watching .
so , i sat and imagined , "@ well , i am incapable of landing in a group of those people . @"
i was tall and slim .
my sister was fat and short .
and , wherever i would pass they would shout at me saying , "@ look at that snake ... @" all kids we would met they would say the same thing .
but my sister they would n't recognize her .
therefore i asked her , "@ did you hear what those kids said ?
they said that , [ look at that snake , where is it heading at this time ?
and now you are telling me that we go and meet those people , how do you think they are going to kill us ?
and in case they killed me first , how will you handle it ? definitely you will dye of sorrows .
i will stay here . @"
it was in the sorghum plantation .
then i decided to lay in the way so that they come and step on me or hit me at once rather than being killed with torture .
therefore , i came down the hill and laid in the way .
then she said , "@ bye ... i can not dye just seated here . @"
immediately she left .
that was the last time i saw her , [ it was around the 12th april in 1994 ... until towards the end of september , that is when i saw her again ] she just left me and said that she could not sit and wait for her death .
i laid in the road .
i guess there is a way that one dies due to fear , to the extent of not feeling anything though being hurt to death .
because you are already dead .
therefore , i laid down and i was taken by sleep . by the time i woke @-@ up it was about 6:00 p.m. in the dark .
i looked around and found out that i was in the sorghum plantation on the road .
"@ how is it possible ! @"
i wondered . i looked around but i could n't see doudou .
"@ this is my death . @"
i looked at the place where i was and compared it with the life i led before ... i sat there till around 6:30 p.m. it was in dark .
i started imagining my childhood life , my school life , and how far i had reached .
eh !
my father , my mother , my brothers and my young sisters , all i have lost them .
i imagined all that and got confused .
i started searching my family members but all of them were killed .
i was left alone .
so i could n't understand it .
then i woke up and asked myself , "@ what can i do ? @"
i thought about going to the stadium but it was impossible , then i thought bout going back to the other family where they had chased me but still it seemed impossible .
then i said , "@ i wish dogs would come and eat me , because i would die and there would be nothing much left to worry about . @" i failed to find a decision .
later i decided to follow some small route that was in the sorghum plantation .
i was hoping that i would attackers , who would be looking for survivors to kill them so , they would kill me .
i decided to keep walking aimlessly , wherever night would find me , i would sleep there .
i did n't want to hide myself anymore .
then i stood up and started moving .
i walk a distance of about a kilometer ; i would walk though ways where i would meet people hunting others .
because i wanted to die .
i did n't want to people to ever see me in exile .
while i was still moving , i met a certain man called alexis .
he was teaching me in place of my mother because ; my mum had injured her leg . therefore , he replaced my mum .
so when we met i told him that , "@ please help me and kill me . @"
i pleaded .
then he said that , "@ how can i kill you ?
i killed too many people and i will kill more but i can not kill dative 's child . @"
but i insisted , "@ please kill me .
my mum and dad are dead ; all my three brothers are dead , and my young sister desperately went to attackers now they killed her .
i am the only one left and i am left nowhere .
so please , if you like me , do me a favor and kill me . @"
we had met from somewhere in the sorghum plantation .
and he was holding a glittering knife , which was dropping blood . it seemed like he was coming from killing someone .
but i kept on asking him to kill me in fact we fought for the knife .
i begged him ; "@ i am left no where , please kill me .
this is the worst death . the best you can do for me is to kill me . @" then he said , "@ sincerely bebe !
i like you and i used to like your parents .
but i can not kill you though i killed so many people , and i am still killing others .
the people i have killed are uncountable and i will kill other more .
but i can not kill you because i can be accused of your blood .
i knelt down and begged him again ; "@ you would be of much help to me if you killed me . please i am begging you .
there is nothing i can offer but god would reward you for that . @"
he looked at me and said , "@ no !
i would never commit such a sin . @"
"@ but you already committed it , because you killed others .
but now i am begging you to do it for me . @"
i said to him .
then he said that instead of killing you , "@ let me show you . @"
but i told him that , "@ wherever you may take me , it would be the worst death for me .
the best you can do for me is to do something that would end my story . because surviving alone in this world ... look i will never stay there where you are going to take me . @"
he took me to his home .
they were living in gacaca and when his mother saw me , she shouted and said , "@ look at the other snake !
where are you taking such people ?
just do me a favor and take her out of here ; i do n't want her here ... i do n't want her ... not at all . @"
their home was situated just above the road and then , a group of attackers was coming from the other side [ below ] of the road .
then she said , "@ let me call them . they will kill her and she will be a gone story . i can not let my house accommodate such a snake . @"
then he held his knife on his mother and asked her , "@ mother , you know that you produced me , is n't it ?
i am your first born .
but as i killed so many people , i will kill several others .
and you can be among them .
watch this kid as you watch yourself .
the day i will hear that she died , that is when you will follow her . @"
the old lady said , "@ you rather kill me but i can not live in the same house with a snake .
impossible ... how can a person live with a snake ? @"
the old lady rolled herself down .
the son warned her , "@ i will kill you !
i will kill you myself . @"
"@ you rather kill me but it is impossible . @" immediately she rushed to the door and shouted for help , "@ help me ... help me .
i am attacked by snakes . @"
as the neighbors were still preparing to intervene , the son grabbed her and held her mouth and then pushed her under the bed .
"@ can you hear me ?
i said i will kill you . @"
he told the mother but she refused , "@ maybe you kill me but it is impossible .
do you want the interahanwe to come and demolish my house and kill her and then kill me later ?
will it help you to remain alone in this world ? @"
then the son told her that , "@ those are totally different stories .
you are talking about me staying alone ? besides giving bath to me , there is no other relationship that is between you and me .
i am just warning you about that kid , and if you make any other noise ... @" he went on , "@ anyway , i will cut off your arm , then your leg ... you will die in slowly when you can not even call them anymore . @"
immediately he removed his knife from it 's pocket and held her like this ... he was going to cut her leg then she screamed , "@ please forgive me ! @"
the attackers were still looking for that person [ me ] , but they did n't find anyone . therefore , they proceeded .
in was the same night and they never used to search a lot at night .
therefore , in the morning , alexis had of course left for work .
when he came back he told his sister who was called therese ; she never used to go out of the house because she looked like the tutsi .
she was tall and slim and wherever she would pass they would attempt killing her .
they would let her go after mentioning her brother because he was known as a colleague whom they worked together . so she would come home after they released her .
then the brother told her , "@ therese , you have to stay with this kid . she should never fail to get water for bathing or food to eat .
you should be together wherever you may be . @"
her sister agreed .
she took me to the bedroom , washed me , and gave me food to eat . then i slept .
at around 11:00 o'clock , the other old woman came [ the one whom we first lived together ] she coming looking for us from every where because she was told that , "@ gahizi 's children died from some place . @"
she heard it from the people who passed us from where we were seated . they imagined we later died .
therefore , those people went straight to that old lady [ the mother to munyagishali ] and told her that , "@ the other kids who were here , must have died .
because we saw them while we were passing by and in a few minutes we saw one lying down and the other one disappeared .
maybe she died somewhere else . @"
then the man told me that , "@ young girl , get out of my house .
when he told me like that ... it was about the 20th ... then i said , "@ fine . @"
the 20th of april ... ?
yes . 20th of april 1994 . that time things were hot even in may . "@ get out of my house and find somewhere else to go . somewhere very far from here . never think about coming back here . @"
a certain man held me by the hand and said , " come here , you must die like others . @"
there was a way they used to shout when they saw a person .
and then all of a sudden i had people shouting .
when i reached at the road , i realized that it was n't me instead , it was another man who was called rukemasibe . he was a teacher and they had revealed him .
"@ we have found rukemasire . @" they said .
the kids they were together , some were hacked but they were still dying ; they had n't died completely and they were taken on a wheelbarrow to a certain pit hole to be dumped .
there was a certain pit hole in gacaca just behind the commune 's offices .
and , all the people who would be hacked but not dead , they would carry them on a wheelbarrow and dump them in that pit .
but there was a trench of water and it was during a rainy season .
therefore , water would run through that trench to the pit hole .
then i told that man , "@ please kill me , but kill me at once because i do n't want to be like those .
look at how they are !
they are going to be dumped in the hole while they are still alive ... @" some never had legs , others were seeing ... machetes , others were bleeding .
they would be carried on a wheelbarrow because all their joints were not functioning and they would be dumped in the pit hole .
then he asked me , "@ have many brothers did you have ? @"
i replied him that , "@ i had five brothers but they are all dead . @"
"@ what if i save you ? @"
he asked me .
then i told him that , "@ that is not the solution .
i believe that , the answer to the problems i have now is death . therefore , just kill me .
my younger sister was killed too , i am the only one still existing . @"
he was a mukiga man ; he did n't even know my home village yet all the people who lived in our home village knew us very well .
"@ what was the name of your father ? @"
he asked me .
he mentioned names of people and mentioned gahizi and karungu .
he said , "@ there is one called gahizi , and another one called karungu and another one called leonard ... they were teachers .
is he among those ? @" i said , "@ yes , it was gahizi and he died but i am begging you to kill me please . @"
then he asked me , "@ there must be a reason why you survived while the rest of your family members died . how do you expect me to kill you ?
me too i will n't kill you , go and die in the hands of someone else . @"
he threw me like that .
then the other killers came .
then one of them asked , "@ what about this one ?
why are you tossing her from one person to another ? @"
after asking why they were not doing something with me , one of them explained to him , "@ this kid her whole family is dead and no one can tell about her past .
all her family died ; both her parents died , all her family members were killed from the stadium , and her brothers were all killed .
she is the only one who has remained . can one kill such a person ? there must be a reason why she does n't die , who knows ?
better leave her . @" then that man said , "@ to hell !
if you have failed to kill her , me too i will n't kill her . @"
they left me there . and then i went back to the other home . those perpetrators were all from the tribe called bakiga and they wondered why i was going to that home .
"@ maybe those cows in that home belong to her family ! @"
they were guessing .
and then added , "@ let us go and ask that man to give us a cow in order to leave him with the kid . @"
they came and took another cow but it was still the same way ; one would hack and the other one would take another part till when the cow is finished .
sometimes they would leave part of the cow on the ground and go .
then i asked the old man in that home , " since the cows are over , what will you give out next time they come ?
it should be me . @" then he said , "@ definitely that is why i told you that i do n't want to see you here anymore . @"
"@ so , what can do ? @"
i asked him . then i got out of the house and said , "@ well , i have to leave ... @" i decided to start moving in open .
i did n't care about who i would meet and what he would do to me . all i was avoiding was staying in that home .
i saw how he would bribe them with a cow every time they came to his home , till when all the cows were finished .
there had remained two cows , now the two cows were also taken .
therefore , since the cows are finished ... definitely he would not accept to remain with nothing .
he also used to move ; i could not see him at home , he would come back in the evening .
ever , he would go and come back in the evening .
i would say , "@ they will kill me next . @"
but i would imagine how they killed the cows ... in fact that is the only reason why i never wanted to stay there . i would imagine it is would be same way they would kill me .
i told him that , "@ now i have left . @"
then he asked me that , "@ please go and never think about coming this way .
hope you can see that next time they will demolish my house . @"
i told him that , "@ do n't worry , i am going . @"
again i sloped down .
but some times i wonder , i think that is god works ; i always say that if the sorghum plantations were not there , no one would have survived among those who survived in rubengera .
i left that home . i lived in the sorghum plantation for days .
at night i would go and drink some water and then come back and sit some where in the sorghum plantation .
i would see everyone passing , the attacker , although i would notice them . they used to be mixed up with the bakiga from up there .
i would see seseko ... that lady who was called seseko was the common figure , maybe it was because she was the one i knew before .
i also knew dushimimana , they passed by ... night would fall .
i would sit and watch .
they came up with a new system of hunting people with dogs , after realizing that people no longer live in the house .
they would send dogs in the sorghum .
truly , most people survived from the sorghum plantation .
lets say one would walk a bit trying to change a position or when one is tired of either sitting or sleeping .
then we would separate the sorghum plants slowly and we would move without shaking .
because it was in the valley , they would stand on top of the hill and see shaking sorghum plants .
immediately they would send dogs and blow whistles .
and , maybe it would show signs of raining .
whenever it would rain .
i would fell relieved , because i used to know that no one would hunt me from the sorghum plantation , while it was raining .
maybe they will go to homes but no one can allow to be beaten by rain just looking for me .
suddenly , i heard ... i was trying to shift from where i was , because it was very close to the road yet groups of attackers were still coming from the stadium .
therefore i decided to extend upwards because i was afraid of dying while i was watching .
i said to myself , "@ i better expend a bit and in case they run after me , they will find when i already fainted . @" so i changed the place and went a bit up . suddenly , i heard whistles .
"@ there is somebody there . check in all sides in the middle of the plantation . the plants are moving , there must be people . @"
they finally died while still tied together . how i saw it ... they were lying down in the road with their intestines tied together ; they were dying .
then i saw another group of attackers coming from the stadium and i said , "@ how am i going to die ? @"
i could n't imagine how .
then i decided to go back to the other family in gacaca in the other man 's home . but i would imagine going back there yet all cows were finished , i knew he would handle me to the perpetrators .
he wanted some profits out of those cows .
because he looked after them and cared about them all the time . then i said , "@ if i go back , he will handle me to the perpetrators .
then they would kill me in the same way . @"
days had gone ; it was about mid may .
i took sometime imagining how i would go back to that home but finally i decided to go back in the sorghum and sit .
it was in some trench and they had lied grass [ vetiveri ] on top of the trench .
therefore , i sat in there up to night .
i spent almost three days in there .
it was very silent because those days it would rain a lot yet they would n't go out for people while it was raining .
therefore , after those three days i stood up and walked in the sorghum plantation again .
what time was it ?
it was around 3:30 ... i lost my understanding when i fell down .
and in the evening ... yes it was in the evening because it was dark , that is when i gained consciousness .
i did n't know where i was ; i felt like i was coming from very far and i would n't imagine what had happened to me .
then later i started recalling what had happened , all that had happened to boniface ; how he was killed .
i began wondering if i was dreaming or if it was real . i spent a long time thinking about it .
and a round 11:00 p.m. in the night ... but they were still blowing the whistles ; they would retrieve someone just next to me , then retrieve others the other side .
i would hear others shouting only once and for all .
then i said ... i would imagine how i would die ... i would thing of anything i would use to commit suicide and i would see that it would n't kill me .
i would think but find no solution .
i did n't know what to do .
i remained seated all night through , until when there was nothing moving anymore .
morning found me in the sorghum plantation alone .
but i was affected by only one thing , ‘ thinking too much .
’ then i would recall the memories of the place where my brothers passed .
then i said , "@ i should sit up and try to see that place . @" then i would compare my passed life with the life i was leading .
i was only remaining with death .
i went to the road and sat there . while i was sitting there , i the burgomaster passing again .
on his pick @-@ up behind , there were people saying that , "@ we have finished all the tutsi , they are all dead .
the rest you should work hard rewards are awaiting . @"
i saw a certain policeman in that car , who reminded me of that time of searching for traitors ; during that time of searching for traitors , the burgomaster was searching in our home area .
he came to my home by himself yet it was the policemen who were supposed to do that .
but he said that , "@ i ... @" he went to my grandmother [ my dad 's mother ] ; her two kids were living in kigali .
therefore , the burgomaster said that , "@ there is no way this old lady would be ... @" she was a very old grandma , she could n't walk .
so he said , "@ there is no way this old lady would be having children living in kigali , and have no gun in her house .
i will have to check her home myself . @"
he entered in the house himself while the rest remained outside .
his car was parked at home like this with many policemen around our home .
the burgomaster said , "@ i have to search in this old woman 's house and gahizi 's house by myself .
because you can not search them as i may wish . @"
therefore , he searched in the houses himself . he entered and ordered every body to get out except my grandma .
"@ you will remove everything and i will check by myself .
because i am sure you have a gun .
" he told my grandmother .
then she asked him , "@ my son , as i am can i have a gun ?
as you see me ... which gun would it be or from where ?
how would i hold it or use it for ? @"
the burgomaster seemed to have enough respect and honor to enter the old lady 's house and go under the bed by him self .
i was living with my grandma but he chased me out so badly and said , "@ i must remain with this old lady alone . @"
then he checked . we followed them when they left but he never found anything .
then they went to my home and when they reached there , still he entered and checked ; he through everything up and he was with one policeman to unveil things for him .
they looked around the house in the gardens but they did n't find anything .
then after they got into their cars and left .
later they met my dad and told him that they found a gun in his house .
they showed his a pistol they had . "@ we found a gun in your house . get into the car . @" they commanded him .
but my dad told them that , "@ you can kill me but i can not agree with you .
let 's go and you show me where you got it and how you got it . @"
the burgomaster said , "@ i got it and it is here .
let 's go you have to be arrest and get out rubengera . you must have been having a gun . it should be there . @"
then my dad told him that , " that is very impossible .
i will n't get into your car . @"
the burgomaster insisted , "@ you will enter it unwillingly . @"
but dad refused ; "@ i can not get into that car . @"
then he started working towards home and then the burgomaster said to him that , "@ though we did n't find it ... though i am telling you that it is here yet it is not the one but you should be aware that you will never stay here .
you have to join others . @"
dad ignored him and continued to go .
i recalled all that after i saw that policeman who was with the burgomaster when they were checking at home .
in a moments time after the car had passed , i would see how they were catch people and killing them .
on one would get a person and kill him ; let 's say hit him or at once with a club .
they would cut off a foot first , then hit him or her with a club , and leave him or her still alive .
they had clubs of this shape ... they used to call them ‘ ntampongano y'umwanzi .
’ they were spiked clubs , with nails and if they hit it on the leg , there would remain holes on the leg .
and , if they hit it in the head , it means that , the bone would be crashed and one would keep bleeding .
but one would n't die , depending on which part they hit .
therefore , whenever i would see how they kill people , i would just tell that i would die a painful death and i would immediately move .
i immediately stood up and started walking around in the sorghum plantation . that time i was not meeting people anymore instead i would meet dogs .
whenever they would see plants shaking they would send dogs .
so i would faint and wake up the following day in the morning .
and , i would neither tell where i was nor what had happened . that is how days would go by but if there were no sorghum plants , i wonder what would have happened .
i guess none would have survived .
from then , people stopped coming instead they would send dogs .
then i got so hungry but i did n't know what to do .
there were no other crops rather than sorghum . therefore , you would imagine eating grass , which was impossible .
after all , thoughts about food would come to your mind only when you were resting , which was for a small time . most of the time one would n't feel hunger or ... we could n't drink , that was out .
then i left and said to myself , "@ what if i go back to the other old man 's home ... maybe they stopped because i no longer see attackers moving . @"
therefore , i went there .
but days had passed ; it was around early june and they had remained with two cows .
i stayed in that home after two days and nights , in a certain morning ... very early around 6:30 a.m. it was slightly dark though there was some kind of light .
then i had a group of attackers knocking on the door .
"@ munyagishari , in your house there are gahizi 's children . and since they are here , we can not do anything before we wipe them away .
and , in the whole of gacaca , you are the only one remaining with people , all others died . @"
they told that man ; munyagishali . they were talking while standing outside the door . so , he took me behind the house .
they started checking in the main house yet i was in the small house behind the big one .
later they left .
"@ we shall come back in dawn while we can see clearly . you will n't lay to us anything .
we shall look for her and in case we do n't see her ... we know you still have their cows .
they will also be taken . @" they said .
therefore , i saw him coming and behind him there were about fifty people .
then i wondered , "@ pastor ! @"
i went and greeted him though , he was looking at me so badly .
as he was walking , he was carrying his small bag of bibles .
he used to walk with that bag so , i saw him .
"@ what is between pastor and this whole group of attackers behind him ? @"
i was outside but i swiftly entered in the gate .
" it is over now .
i am going to die . @"
i told verediane , the girl whom we lived together in that home .
"@ all i used to say was just what i thought , but now i am going to die .
can you imagine i have seen the pastor kanani coming here !
he is coming here and behind him there is a big group of attackers .
do you think there are other people whom they have come to kill in this area ? @"
i said to her .
but she told me that , "@ just be strong .
although there is no one else here , the god that protected you all this time will protect you now . @"
i said , "@ no , i do n't want to survive .
in fact let me get outside but , since there is pastor they may not kill me because he knows me . @"
then she said to me , "@ you never know , he may be the worst of all .
just stay calm . @"
but i said that i would n't hide myself .
"@ i will in the open . @"
umh !
suddenly i heard people knocking .
the whole group of attackers came running behind the pastor .
they had clubs , sharp sticks ... then i asked myself , "@ fifty people have come to kill only me .
how will they kill me ? @"
i could not understand it because i had seen how they killed several people in several ways depending on ‘ who was who .
’ ... some would be cut fingers , other would be cut feet .
then i would wonder , "@ all these people ... ! @" they seemed like a whole market .
they were saying , "@ some kid from gahizi survived and she is just in front there . @"
"@ is that true ? @"
i would ask myself but i would never understand it .
"@ all these people for me as i am ... @" i would look at myself and could n't believe it .
"@ all these people with pastor leading them ! @"
i would not believe it .
but i refused to enter in the house .
i wanted them to kill me so that i would rest .
"@ they should come and finish me , maybe you would get a chance to sleep . @" i told the girl .
as i was sitting there , pastor kanani came ; he was holding his bag .
then he told the old man , "@ we heard that in your home , there are gahizi 's children who survived , now these people are on my case .
they said they must kill them or take gahizi 's cows , which remained here . @"
the old man said , "@ i told you that there is no child here . come in and see . @"
but he imagined and said , "@ i do n't want them to demolish my house .
because , they will still kill the child after demolishing my house .
after all , this has lasted for so long ; they took all the cows just because of the same kid .
and , now they are still looking for her .
in case i do n't give them the kid , they will demolish my house and if they demolish the house , even the kid will die . @"
therefore , he told them that , "@ come into the house if you get her , then you will take her . @"
they all entered in the house . fifty people in one house .
some climbed on top of the house others looked around in the sorghum and coffee plantations , they checked everywhere and said , "@ we must know the kid , who is here .
we know there is one . @"
they were informed by the kids we were together ... those kids went saying that , "@ one kid died , the one who is tall and slim and resembled her mother , is the remaining one .
she is and the old man 's home .
we have been together just now and then , she was called to go and eat but she is there . @"
pastor said , "@ she was with other kids out there in the past few minutes .
i saw her ; she was just seated there with other kids and entered here while i was seeing .
bring her out and do quickly . @"
i would be a bit afraid but on the other hand i would say , "@ yes let it be over maybe all the worries will be gone .
i will never spend more days running or wandering in the sorghum plantations .
i will never ... umh ... it will be over and that will be it . @"
therefore , they all went out and sat at the slop waiting for me to get out ; the road was on slopping up to our home .
therefore , there was a steep slop so , they all went and sat there . ‘ it was similar to how jesus went before pilato .
’ i came out and saw the whole line .
about fifty people sitting and me standing in front of them .
the other feeling of joy for death , turned into a problem .
i said to myself , "@ i alone ? @"
i would n't believe it .
i was so afraid and said , "@ will i survive this point of time ? @"
i sat down .
then i told that woman ... [ she was normally called mama vincent .
] "@ mama vincent tell me , look at all those people .
my dad and mom are already killed . doudou and epa all died .
no one is remaining . @"
however my uncle and aunt lived these ends in kigali , but i never thought about them .
i considered only those whom we were together , after all they were the majority but they had all died .
in addition , no one had survived in kigali .
i told her everything .
i told her ; "@ imagine how they killed boniface , i was watching ; they pierced him from the ribs and some things came out , then they tied them with the wife 's .
and then after they [ perpetrators ] asked them to stand up and stop them from passing .
well , tell me how are they going to kill me ?
i am alone but look at all those people @" i was so afraid and sat there .
she came and pulled me and said , "@ stand here . @"
though i would n't believe it ... it was a problem to me .
i stood in front of them , trembling and feeling weak due to fear .
i would imagine how i was going to die ... killed by hundreds of people .
i would look at myself and see how small i was and compare it with all those men carrying several weapons , then i would wonder , "@ how will i die ... ?
how will i die ? @"
i would imagine one taking out my eye and another one doing other weird thing to me ... then i would wish that , if it was possible ... i used to watch films and see how people who die being shot , die in a nice way .
it is just a single shot and one dies straight away without a clue on what happened .
therefore , i would look around and wonder , "@ is n't there someone with a gun to fire me with just a single bullet now ? @"
i sat down because i had failed to stand due to fear ; i was shaking so hard and i would fall down .
therefore , two of them came and made me stand . one held here and the other one held here .
then they said to the old man , "@ mr. munyagishari , you have been telling us that there is no gahizi 's child here . so , tell us the background of this kid .
tell us all about how you got her because we know that in your home there is no child who ... you have never had a child who looks like this in your home . @"
then he replied them that , "@ this child is my wife 's niece . @"
"@ who is your wife ... is your wife a tutsi , a hutu , who is your wife ? @"
they asked him .
then he replied then that , "@ my wife is a hutu . @"
"@ so , if your wife is hutu , how is she related to these children ?
look at how she looks like , see her height ... @" they asked him again .
they would straighten my fingers and observe my nails . then his wife said , "@ this is my cousin 's daughter and ... @" she was trying to show them that his cousin was a tutsi but they never shared parents .
therefore , they went and took out another cow .
and kill it in the same way .
critically , their major concern was n't killing ; they were more interested in eating .
so they took out the cow and killed it like they killed other cows ; cutting off horns , ears , until when it falls off .
and then everyone would take what he managed to cut . they would cut they would piece with the skin on .
and , one of the attackers , after others had left with the meat , he told the old man [ mr. munyagishari ] that , "@ let me give you some piece of advice , with this child , in the end all things that you have ... all their cows , everything will get finished .
and the end will be her ; they will kill her .
find another way or let her go and be killed with other perpetrators .
and after she dies , no one will come to you again because you have been giving out things as to bribe for her . @"
then the man said , "@ that is true . @"
immediately he threw me out of his house and said , "@ look for another place to hide , i do n't want to see you here . @"
i said , "@ it is okay . @"
after he told me that , immediately i left and stayed in the sorghum plants in a trench .
it would rain but i would enter in the trench and whenever it would shine i would sit in the sorghum plantation .
dogs would come and i would faint because of fear and i would come back to my senses when they had left .
i wonder why they never bit me .
the war stopped before someone 's finger or any dog 's teeth neither touched me .
i was alone .
about two days later after that cow was eaten , that when the other old lady came to look for me .
[ the wife to munyagishari ] she was looking everywhere in there sorghum plantation because , i never used to go very far .
because if i walked very far , it would mean crossing roads . and if i crossed roads , i would have met people who knew me who would kill me so painfully .
i continued walking and reached the other pit hole .
i heard people talking from inside the pit .
i asked myself , "@ should i get in ? @"
i never peeped inside because it was across the road but on the roadside .
i imagined that in case i peeped in it , i would also go inside it and i would die with suffer yet that is what i was avoiding .
i went and sat in the sorghum plantation .
in the evening ... it was already dark in the evening .
i heard someone who was walking slowly and talking to herself .
it was the other woman , she bumped into me and said to me , "@ listen , they have planned to come and kill you and demolish our house .
so , i will take you somewhere very far from here since it is at night .
you will stay there and luckily enough , they do n't know your family . @" [ it was near gitesi in a different district ... near the stadium . ] and when the war chills a bit , you shall come back and we live together .
me too i said there was no problem with that .
therefore , we started our journey in that night at around 7:00 p.m. it was dark .
we crossed and went to gitesi .
she was taking me to her eldest daughter who lived there .
when we reached there she spent the night there and left the following morning .
when i reached there , i surfed terribly .
i even wished to go to the sorghum plantation but i could n't see it .
she had old children whom we were of the same age .
we were of the same age with her first born because we were both in primary four by then .
she treated me like a maid in her home though in my whole life i did n't know such a thing .
i used to shower , eat and sleep nothing much .
i asked her , "@ digging ... ?
fetching water ... ? @"
then she said that , "@ you will be fetching three jeri cans of water . @"
i told her that , "@ that is impossible . @"
i would imagine how i never knew how to carry even a small jeri can , and just conclude that it was the worst death i would ever experience .
to me , it worst than the time i was alone without anybody .
i would remember that even at home i never did such work .
so i told her that , "@ i will never do that work . @"
then she bet , "@ you will do it . @"
however the first days i did it ; she would wake me up in the morning while others were sleeping and take me to the stream to fetch water with a big jeri can .
i told her that i could n't manage the big jeri can .
so , she gave me a smaller one .
i would keep fetching until when i fill three jeri cans .
and then after , we would go together in the garden to dig .
she would dig as i am sitting , and later she would say , "@ i am fed up .
you can not work anymore , so why am i keeping you ? @"
those days she would n't give me food .
she would let me eat only if i fetched water , allowed to go digging and look after .
but it reached a point and i told her my mind . that time she had sent me at the stream and it had rained .
therefore i slipped and fell in a water channel .
that is when i said , "@ this is the worst life ever .
i am doing things i never did at home ; i never fetched water , i never woke up at this time . it is my first time this to happen to me .
i have never dug before ; i never eat because i did this or that work .
though i fetched the water i was not allowed to shower on it . @" i had because like a slave ; i was like a servant who does n't have rights to work freely .
i thought about it and then told her , "@ listen to me , " that is after i had left the stream .
i told her that , "@ in my life as long as we still live together , i will never wake @-@ up to go for water or go digging again .
you would rather chase me . @"
though i told her like that , i asked her to be letting me sleep in her house .
"@ and if you refuse , i know i can not fail to get where to sleep .
even where i was i would sleep well . @"
it hurt her so much and then she asked me , "@ is that what you have said ?
you are in excess of all things ? @"
eh ... i would remember how i never eat , how every thing was a problem ; it was only stress and worries .
i developed some kind of desire of committing suicide and i would ask myself , "@ how can one commit suicide ? @"
then i would remember what i used to watch in movies , how one can use a knife to commit suicide or hung himself or herself to death .
and then i would wonder , "@ where can one do it ?
in fact , how can i start it or who can help me ? @"
i would not understand it .
therefore , i died of sorrows .
i would imagine all the work i do without any appreciation ... well , she would leave her food , but at least say ‘ thank you ’ or ‘ do n't worry ’ or say anything in a nice manner .
she would tell me , "@ get out , where is the water ?
how come things are not like this or that ... ?
why do i see some weeds there ... ? @" weeds ... ?
i would n't understand her .
"@ i told you that i will never do that again .
if you want you can chase me out of your house but i will never go digging or doing this or that . @" i would tell her .
she was mistreating me but hiding it from her husband .
whenever her husband would be around , she would be a good person and sometimes say , "@ hi mahoro , how are you ?
how do you feel ? @"
i would be confused and ask myself , "@ but why ... ? @"
another time she would be hash to me . then i imagined that there must be a reason why sometimes she acts so nice to me and another time she ... i started things that i was the one with a problem .
i thought it was me who would cause him to talk in a bad way .
then i asked her , "@ beatrice , why do you talk to me so badly ?
what did i do ?
"@ it seems like you do things you do n't want to do forgetting that you depend on me . @"
immediately i told her that , "@ that has got nothing to do with it . @"
i was open and told her , "@ you know my home , you know how things used to be .
i had never held a jeri can before or dug .
but even though i did , you can teach me .
mean while talking to me well is enough .
not coming to me and begin ordering ; do this or that and when i finish you do n't give me something to eat .
well it is okay . @"
i tolerated it in those days because some days she would talk to me well that was if her husband was around .
whenever we would go to dig together with her husband , she would say to me ; "@ mahoro sit a bit and look after the baby .
do n't do anything else . @"
but whenever the husband would be absent ... i do n't know what he used to do somewhere he would go and come back after a couple of days . she would time when the husband would be away and then torture me horribly .
then i told her that , "@ i will be fetching water one with a jeri can .
at whatever time vi will be coming back , that will be it .
but i will be bringing a jeri can of water here .
about digging , at least you will be digging and i will be weeding . @"
i had totally failed to learn dig ; i would aim higher but still the hoe would n't penetrate deeper .
therefore , she told me that , "@ i have agreed with you on that . @"
when she realized that i was getting used , she asked me to be using a big jeri can .
well that was okay with me ; taking a jeri can only ... i would take it , but there was pipe in place where i used to fetch water .
it was between gardens on a hill that one would see people digging .
though they never hurt me , they would look at me strangely .
then i would imagine , "@ these people may betray me ; they may go and tell the other killers that they saw a child who looked like this or that . @"
i thought they would go and say to them , "@ it is our first time to see her in this area though she must be living around . however we do n't know where she lives . @"
therefore , i allowed to be going to the garden .
but whenever they would come , i would bend in the ... i would remove the grass from the garden .
and if they found me at the stream , i would bend in the water pretending to be busy fetching water .
and after they would leave , i would also stop .
and later i would go home .
i would go home in the evening and whenever her husband would be at home , i would feel like am a child too ; we would chat and he would calm me , "@ you have to be strong , if your father and the rest of your family died .
it is over and over so you have to be strong .
we shall continue to live with you @" he would tell me .
he was called damien then i told hiim that , "@ it was impossible . @"
i told him ; "@ how can we live together ?
i can not manage waking up in the morning and go for water then go digging yet i do n't know how to dig .
and in case i do n't do it , i do n't eat . and if i do it i will injure myself because i do n't know how to dig . @"
then the man asked me ; "@ do n't you eat ? @"
"@ me ?
never !
i eat rarely only after i did that work . i did n't dig to her desire , then i do n't eat . @" i replied him .
i did n't feel like doing it .
but i had started walking in the road and it seemed to be safe .
i would not see people even if i walked for the whole hour .
but as i would be walking , i was very desperate and i did n't care if someone decided to kill me .
but i would imagine the other death of working for someone who does n't appreciate and it would go beyond my imagination .
i told him openly .
then he said to me that , "@ do n't worry , i am going to ask her and find out how the situation is .
she supposed to handle you like rose ... @" [ his daughter ] "@ you should be going to fetch water together , if it is time to dig , you should go and dig together .
you should everything together . because in september if they go to school you will also go . @"
to me that sounded impossible , "@ going to school ! @"
when was that ?
it was in the late june ... in fact the month of june had ended , it was in july .
because i would hear people saying that , "@ there has remained one month or one and half month for students to begin studies . @"
only a month ?
no .
i would imagine it but i could n't figure it out .
"@ how can i go to school ? @"
everything i would first think about it in advance . before , whenever we were going to begin school , everything would be new at home .
"@ so , what about now ?
will i start studying and in the evening go to dig ... ? @"
i would ask myself but i could n't understand it .
i never used to think about such life or believe in it .
he told and i chilled because he had told me good news . at least he was sympathetic with me , so it was fine .
he used to make me work but at least somehow i see that he would sympathize with me due to the agony that i was baring within me .
but it was okay .
therefore , "@ i told him that it was fine . @"
he spent some long time at home ; he spent about a whole month at home .
then said that , "@ you all have to go together for water and come back together . @"
we would go in the morning ; if it meant early morning , we would all wake up and the wife was there . but we were not on good terms with the wife .
if it were digging we would all go .
they would dig because they knew how to dig .
as for me , i would pick up all the grass and later , we would sit and chat up to mid @-@ day then we would go back home . she would stay at home preparing some food .
and he would say , "@ you all have to sit here and share with no quarrels . @"
then he ... during that time i would n't see any problem ; people would move freely . people would come and we talk , i mean people who would come to visit that family .
they would not talk about anything like war stories .
therefore , i started getting a feeling that the war stopped .
i felt like i should stop hiding myself .
people had started cutting the sorghum .
therefore i said , "@ since they have cut this place , there is no other place remaining .
i will be walking in the open and if they are to kill me they should kill me . @"
so ... a month before students went back to school , damien travailed .
he used to go up country ; i do n't know what he used to do there .
therefore , i said , "@ since he has left , i am going to die .
i am going to die a horrible death . @"
so i decided not to stay in that home .
"@ i would better go @" i decided .
it was supposed to be a journey from gitesi to mabanza in some place in rubengera at the other man 's place .
[ the place where i lived at first ] .
it was a long journey about three or four kilometers on a road .
then i said , "@ let me show you ; i am going to leave gitesi and go to rubengera .
i will go back to the other home and if i reach there before anyone tries to kill me , that will mean that i will never die . @"
because i was supposed to go through the other road where i used to pass hiding .
so i started my journey . she had sent me to go digging .
therefore , i went with children and when we had reached some where , she called them saying that , i must stay there alone .
"@ really !
i stay in the other garden alone ?
why does n't she do the same things when her husband is around ?
" i wondered . immediately i took back the hoe and gave it to the kids and i told them that i have left .
"@ where are you going mahoro ?
came back we show you . @"
they said to me .
[ they used to call me mahoro ] i told them that , "@ no , there is nothing to show me , i have gone and if they kill me , that will be it .
and if they do n't kill me , we shall meet some other time . @"
then he told me that there somebody who told him that she is alive .
so it became another problem and i said , "@ think person is a killer , he is the one who will kill he ; he who is mocking me saying such things .
other people would tell how people died , "@ it is over all people died , you have to be strong though you survived alone . @"
but how could he come saying that so and so is still alive yet i was very sure they died ?
then i told him that , "@ never tell me that anymore . @"
then he left , he was a neighbor to that family . time passed before he came back to tell me about it .
in july ... i remember it was in the late july , i had n't known that my sister was alive .
we had separated in the 10th of april 1994 , that time we saw a group of attackers .
the time she decided to go to them so that they should kill her moving rather than dying sat .
i stayed there in that family and there was no problem i would get out by then .
i would go at the road and come back safe .
i would see children from that family but i would n't see any of the people i used to know .
so it became a problem to me .
so i asked myself , what is all about such life ? i would try to see the future but i would just go beyond my understanding .
therefore i decide to stay there . the old lady told me that i wait in september i would go to school .
but i would not believe it ; "@ i will go to school ? @"
but still i would remember that at home , my father used to like children who liked studying .
and indeed we liked studying .
both my father and mother were teachers .
therefore they would say that , "@ you must study ... you shall study till when ... @" and we were many kids at home .
mum would tell us that , "@ all of you must study ; you will go secondary schools and complete university .
even though we miss salt at home , you will go school . @"
and surely i wanted to study and go secondary schools ... and reach university .
therefore , i would think , "@ where will be living while i am studying ?
whom will i be with ? @"
so i would not understand it .
i would go through all those things .
then i told her , "@ it is okay i will go to school . @"
i knew that i would go to school and maybe meet other people and get to know each other .
i would say that , if i am the only one who survived in rubengera there must be another one who survived from mushubati .
"@ there can not miss someone who survived in other areas like kibirizi or somewhere else . @" i would say .
"@ even though it would be one person but there is no logic in remaining sat at home . i must study , it is a brilliant idea . @"
and i would immediately think , if i reach in school ... before we used to reach school and as we would be entering [ it bothered me too ] we used to enter in school and they would call upon the tutsi , we would stand up when we are about three .
in the following class we would be ten but now they will call and it will be only me .
and so they will start saying that , "@ we study with only one tusti . @"
so it would bother me but i would try to avoid such thoughts because it was the only life i had to lead .
i knew my life was school life .
i had to complete primary school and pass it well so that i would get a school where i would live always .
and i would stop living in outside families .
i would go to a school where i would stay and live with people i never knew .
i started aiming at that goal and i felt like it was the best one .
i went to school .
eh !
at break time they would make fun of me .
even those we used to talk together , they would avoid me ; they would behave to me as if i was a stranger .
was that in september when the genocide had stopped ?
it was after the genocide .
but still moving ... unless i was going to school with other students ... that time people were still hiding ; no one would move out yet these ends things had settled without any problem .
us we were still hiding .
whenever i would not be able to get people to go with or come with , i would find a way of coming back in the dark at night .
you were still living in that family ?
i had never had of them ; not a small thing ... never . not even a thought .
maybe they had reached but never came to the village . maybe they were all around in town . i never though or had about them .
even those we lived together i can not say that they knew about them .
because they used to here that inkotanyi were n't people , that they were animals , which had big ears with tails .
they never knew they were people .
by the way , there is a time they ... when they reached at some place called ku giti kinini ; that is where there is a center in rubengera next to the commune .
they used to say that they saw the inkotanyi ... that they saw an inkontanyi 's car passing .
therefore , they would say that , "@ we saw them with big ears with ... @" umh , generally i would think they were animals .
i did n't know anything but i would wonder the kind of death i was going to die and i would not understand it .
i never thought that the inkotanyi would come for the rescue of those who servived .
it never crossed my mind .
on the first day i went to school but i would see fellow students avoiding me .
during break time , i would see some passing by me and talking about me .
i would try to talk to one but things would not work .
they all looked afraid of talking to me .
so i would sit alone at aside .
the teacher would ask me , "@ why are you sitting alone ?
what are you doing ... what are you thinking about ?
come and play with other kids . @"
and i would say , "@ no i do n't want . @"
sometimes i would go back home at around 10:00 .
break time would reach and then other students would get into groups then i would remain alone . therefore , after a small time i would go home .
then during that time there came ... there was a certain lady we were neighbors . she was selling clothes ; she would come these ends of nyabugogo to buy clothes on wholesale and sell them in kibuye .
my aunt lived in muhima and sometimes she would come ... and they knew each other .
so one time they met from nyabugogo .
that lady who used to buy clothes from nyabugogo knew that my sister survived .
my sister was living in some home where she had gone ... she met some people who were at the stream harvesting sweet potatoes .
that woman was a tutsi ... she took her home and my sister told her all about her .
then that lady hid my sister in the house but her husband was not aware .
until september that is when we met .
as she got out we immediately saw each other .
but her husband never knew about it .
it was a very big house and therefore , she hid her somewhere in the house and warned her elder children that , "@ nobody should ever open this room . @"
and even her husband would never come to the room ; he used to go and come back deep in the night .
he would come going to bed directly .
whenever she would want to go to the toilets , that woman would send the kids somewhere and obviously the man would n't be around . therefore , she would go to the toilets and then come in quickly .
she stayed in the house all the time .
no other person knew that my sister was in their house except her elder son and daughter plus her .
only the elder children .
they were the only ones who knew that there was some one in their house .
even the husband did n't know .
but the other woman , who used to purchase clothes for sale , knew about it because she was the one who referred my sister to go and look for gatabazi 's wife wherever she was and she was also a tutsi .
"@ go and tell her your problems maybe she may give you shelter . @" she recommended my sister .
therefore , that is how she came to know about it .
she was the one who sent a message at munyagishari 's where i was living saying that , "@ there is a gahizi 's child in gatabazi 's home in gihari .
the one that resembled her father , big in size and dark .
i wonder her elder sister is maybe she died . @"
and , by coincidence i was alive .
then i told them that "@ sara is telling lies ... she is lying ... she is lying . @"
but she said , "@ i am very sure she is alive and in fact i will go to visit her tomorrow .
and if i see her i will come to confirm to you . @"
she left and the following morning she came to tell me .
"@ do n't worry , she is alive . @" she said to me .
umh , "@ is that possimble ?
you should come and take me there . @" i told her .
the following day she came back and took me .
we crossed some river called ntaruko . the other side of the river was gihara sector and when we reached there , i saw her .
it was like a dream ; i can n't say that we greated each others , neither did we ask each others about what we went through .
we were simply crying by looking at each others .
i would look at her and ask myself , "@ is she the one or it is her ghost ?
someone who was bitten by dogs ?
someone i saw landing in the attackers group and being taken by the attackers ?
someone i heard stories of her death , how can she be alive ? @"
it was unbelievable though we were face to face . it was like a movie that lasts too long ... yet nobody was talking ... we were talking within our thoughts .
it was beyond my imagination and so i got confused .
but because she did n't want the head of the family to know about it ( the husband of the lady who saved her ) and the same lady who used to purchase clothes for sale , had already known that our aunties were alive .
they were two aunts and they were living these ends .
therefore , she told them that , "@ keep hiding her , if i get their aunties i will tell them and they will come for them .
but continue hiding it from your husband so that you do n't get conflicts together at the last moment .
he may even decide to chase her yet she has no where to go . @"
then she came and i immediately went home .
the man had come back so i went back in gacaca where i lived .
and , that woman too left .
and when she came to purchase clothes , she met our aunties and then she told them ; "@ do you know that your two kids survived ... ? @"
but thought it was impossible ; "@ is there anyone who survived in kibuye ... ? @"
to them it sounded unusual .
but she convinced them , "@ it is true at kibuye some people survived .
they never went to the stadium ; they just hid in the neighbor 's homes ... and today they are alive . @"
but they never agreed with her .
therefore , she told them that they should sometime come with her and see where we lived .
she told them that one lives at gatabazi and another one lives at munyagishari 's home .
munyagishari is the one we lived together and they already knew him .
after visiting my sister i returned home and went to school .
after two days i went to school but i would come home at 10:00 a.m. as usual .
however when she told our aunties about it , they immediately boarded and came over .
they came ; it was my aunt and the husband to my other aunt .
they came to gacaca they knew the place .
when they reached at home they told them that i had gone to school .
therefore , they decided to come to school yet i was on my way coming back home , because i was used to going home at break time .
there is a way you see something and become stiff ; i was walking home but even though i was walking , i was careless of what was around me .
i would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how i was going to lead it .
it seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part .
therefore , we met as i was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) .
i used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . because i would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me .
i would talk to no body .
so i would feel like life has stopped ... so i would finally go home .
as i was going home , we met next to the commune .
they were coming to see me at school .
it was an extraordinary experience ; it was like similar to the time i saw my little sister after five months of not seeing each other .
each one thought that the other one died .
therefore , i was shocked and stood like a tree .
so i ask , "@ aunt , is it you ? are you the one i am seeing or it is somebody else ? @" she replied that was the one . "@ are you aware that doudou is alive ? @"
i asked her once again .
she replied me that "@ doudou is alive and i know where she lives . @"
therefore , we never reached at home where i lived , immediately i took her to gihara where doudou ( my sister ) was living .
it was on the 1st of october in 1994 .
generally , right from april life seemed to be a terrible struggle ?
from april to september life was a terrible struggle .
well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ?
when the war siezed ... in july , august the war was siezing ... in fact , in july the war was beginning to sieze .
i was living with that family as somebody who was hiding . i was living in gitesi at her daughter 's home .
and due to the way they would treat me , i mean because they hid me i continued believing that they were still hiding me .
i never knew that outside the situation improved .
even the time i left their home for munyagishari 's , i still believe i was going to hide . however , that feeling started disappearing when i started going to school .
i could go at home with out any problem , i could eat , there is nothing i was obliged to do .
i wouuld wake up the following morning and again go to school . then i would come home at 10:00 a.m. depending on how i would be abandoned .
how could you find your relationship with munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? how was it ?
after the genocide , we continued to live with that lady .
definitely her father was not happy at all because , we survived but all properties were taken from him ; the cows were gone yet he was considering them as a profit .
some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream .
one could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper .
and from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him .
the cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most .
she could remember that i need books if it was time for school .
do you meet often ... is there ... ?
i have never gone back to her home .
since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ?
no !
is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ?
it is not because i do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means .
does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ?
since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 .
has your property been destroyed ... ? are there only ruins left ? ... has it ...
yeah ! the doors were still having the same color . you could also see that some of the bricks were from our house .
let 's think back a little bit on the period during the genocide .
you spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside ... can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ?
the days that i spent outside ... it 's about a week .
in fact , if the perpetrators were to come three times in a week to look for me at munyagishari 's place @- for example , if they came on monday , i would n't have to be there on tuesday and wednesday !
otherwise , they would ... so they would n't get me whenever they would come .
then , theyy would just come back after two days but the issue of their come back was just about cows though they would pretend that they were looking for someone .
everytime i would be aware of their arrival , i would gao and spend some days in the sorghumfield .
it is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield .
can you tell me about the time that you were chased from munyagishari 's place ?
i would just go till ... so many times , one would feel like the doors of death were locked up for him @/@ her as he @/@ she would look for dying ... the next thing was just going back home and flee again in case the perpetrators were back again and so on ... that 's how life was like .
i mean all the time right a fter being separated from your sister ... was it like one week or ... how many weeks did you spend outside ?
we stayed in the sorghumfield from april to july and for me , there was no other hiding place .
everytime i was chased from where i was living , my refuge was in the sorghumfield . there was nowhere else i could go !
how was your life like before the gebnocide ?
tell me a bit about the way your family .
did you have many cows , how was your relationship to your relatives ... ?
ten years ago , i was in the 4th class of primary education and my younger in the third one .
after the war , i went back to school and completed the primary level as long as my younger sister .
thereafter , i completed secondary school .
today , my younger sister is in senior six . i lived with my auntie by then till now .
of course life is not the same , it is certainly different from the one during the genocide but it not the same as the one before the genocide .
are you hopeful about future ?
in fact , i 've been through all the types of life @:@ good life , normal life and bad times , the future ... now as i have grown up , i think @-@ unless i trouble myself like if i remember things that can mamke me act negatively . it is something that happens to me often , i remember that one time as i was going at secondary school , it crossed my mind ! i felt ... there was even a time when i could think being traumatised because i could n't bear sitting on the same desk with a hutu student or sharing a meal with him @/@ her or using the same bucket or ... for me he @/@ she was kind of pariah , a pariah and i could n't talk to them . however , after a certain time i was no longer behaving that way . i just do n't remember how i changed , maybe it 's gob because i , personnally , did no effort . i was used to be lonely wherever i was and there was none for me ... i was feeling like the only solution was to die because otherwise i would suffer for always . but today , i thank god because i feel free and i am positive about the future if god continues to be with me .
were there times during the genocide where you could feeling like you would better die than ...
yeah , very often ! that was the best solution for me .
does life make sense for you today or you wish you would die ... what 's your impression about life ?
being alive for me is very different from dying .
of course i 'm human and i do n't rejuice everyday but neither do i feel bad everyday @-@ those are two facts about which we can n't anything about .
on the other hand , when i imagine myself dead , i fell like ... oh !
dying is good !
it 's good because you rest .
i think that if it happened that i was dead , today i would n't be worryinng about people because i may meet someone in the street and start questioning myself about him .
when i see that he is not very confortable when we meet , i start thinking that maybe he is the one who killed my people or ... i just become inquisitive about him .
all this makes me belive that if were n't alive , i would n't have all those problems , i would n't think to do this or that according to the situation , i would just rest .
that 's how i think it is .
the programme that the government has adopted is to emphasize on the fact that people have got to live in a new way .
what do you think about gacaca and the system of releasing prisonners who have handed themselves over ?
can you tell me what you think about unity and reconciliation ?
so , in my opinion , releasing someone just because they admit what they did , releasing a hundred ... a hundred people ... i think it 's a way of simplifying things .
i do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be .
we should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time .
some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail .
at the end of it all , we realize that 's how things work .
after genocide , the country had to face the problem of orphans ... what do you think of the way the current government takes care of orphans ?
do you think it is enough ?
what do you think of the way you 're treated by the rest of the society ?
do they pay you a visit ... ?
i think they really give their best because right after the genocide , no survivor ever thought they 'd one day go back to school or that they 'd even beneficiate from any medical care .
today , we have the funds of assistance to genocide survivors , fonds d' assistance aux rescapes du genocide ( farg ) in french .
it helps in paying survivors ' school fees .
survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from .
i am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness .
there are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today .
the government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... i think it 's good .
you have been an orphan for quite a long time despite the fact that you 're an adult today ... do you have a message to give to other children who survived the genocide the way you did ?
in fact , the most important thing ... well , it 's a personal comment but it is a difficult life that requires patience and perseverence .
it is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that .
i have had the grace of knowing god and i know he can do anything !
i would therefore tell the survivors that it is god who protected them during the wat , nobody else did !
i would invite them to live a prayerful life because without him , no one would be where they are at today .
through prayer we find a certain peace that helps us to accept what happened and we understand that it had to happen that way .
and also that god is not unaware of what is happening to us .
but it 's only when one undertands the importance of prayer that we can be able to reach such a conclusion .
on the other hand , orphans are confronted to various problems , they are n't stable and ... they do not understand that things come and go .
some of them behave very badly without realizing where the money for the education comes from .
they do not ask themselves how things would be if they were n't the way they are .
it is very clear that some students are n't serious about their school work at all and yet it should be their number 1 priority .
my message for them is to be aware that they are orphans and that they should n't so much count on the families with which they live .
whatever they do , they should n't forget that they are orphans !
they should n't forget where they are coming from because the moment one recalls where they are coming from , their behaviour gets better .
this testimony will be watched by many people , maybe even by your grandchildren .
i would n't want to let you go without giving you an opportunity to give a message to those who will watch it , something that 's on your heart .
this is therefore the opportunity to tell us what is on your heart and what your wishes are .
thank you very much !
the message i would like to give as i said from the beginning is a message of love , everyone needs to love their neighbour wherever they are .
i am convinced that if everyone had shown love for one another , what happened would never have happened .
no father would have killed his own children !
there was no love at all during genocide .
everyone is supposed to love their neighbour as they love themselves .
i know it is not easy but at least we should make some effort !
because when you love your neighbour as you love yourself , you will never think of killing him or her or of making him or her into an orphan but you will have compassion for them instead .
you would want to put yourself in their shoes , you would think of a situation where you get sick and there 's nobody to take care of you ... so all i am asking is that people love their neighbour as themselves .
it is very difficult especially for orphans and for those who lost their loved ones ... it is very difficultn for someone who is n't ‘ saved ’ to ... to understand that there 's nothing good in revenging .
it is true that your people were killed but it is over !
i am not saying they should forget , i myself can not forget , it is something that will always be part of me .
and when one remembers how it happened , it becomes ... depending on the period in which we are , things are the way they are .
we should n't forget what happened because remembering , looking at where we are at today and being able to that despite everything , there 's some improvement .
because that period was part of another life .
today , we 're in another life .
the life in which we were and today 's life ... we need to think about it but that 's not a reason to cnstantly live in the past without thinking of anything else .
yes , we need to remember , just like it is impossible to forget that we were born and that we shall die one day .
but thinking about it ... we need to think about it with the intention to show gratitude to god for what he did , by looking at where you came from and where you are at today , gratitude for the fact that you have reached the time in which we are living today .
i believe there 's nothing wrong with thinking about it as long as we are not living in the past .
we need to think about it in the sense of ... yes , to think abou tit . and also to have love and to be able to forgive .
personally , i have completely forgiven them !
i have forgiven them because i know they did it because ... i know they did it ... but maybe as they say it themselves , they were only tools in the hands of someone else or some other power .
personally , i do not understand how a human being healthy of mind can attack another human being with 2 ears , 1 nose , legs ... just like him or her .
a human being like him or her !
and they take a machete , hack him or her down and see blood shedding ... it is beyond understanding .
personally , i do n't think that person did it by himself or herself , but they were used by satan to an extent where i have forgiven them all , it does n't matter whether they have asked for forgiveness or not .
what happened happened and it is true that i can not forget it .
for those who are still in school , i would tell them to seriously study and to prepare themselves a better future .
it happens at times that they want to behave in a certain way depending on the town in which they live or which school they go to , but it should n't be the case .
a child should not forget what is behind maybe just because he or she is lucky enough to live with a well @-@ off family and thus behave as though he or she should n't live in a certain way .
i guess that is enough .
my name is umulisa marie @-@ claire .
before the war we were living in kamonyi district in gitarama province , in a sector called murehe .
when the war was about to start , i was n't so informed about it but there was multipartism and i would see political parties having conflicts ; mrnd and mdr .
that is what i was aware of .
habyarimana died later on died . i remember we had a councillor called iyakaremye emmanuel .
he came at home and asked my dad in which politial party he was .
my dad replied that his political party was in his heart and that it was n't necesary to tell it to him .
a week later , some people from different neighbouring sectors came to our home sector .
they had come to kill the tutsis , and when they reached home , they took my dad away .
they asked him to give them money .
he had 30,000 frw .
therefore , he gave it to them and came back home .
two days later , it was on a sunday and we had gone to church .
when we came back , they came home and called my dad .
all of us were in the compound and they told dad that they were going to kill all of us .
they took all the cows that were at home and ate them but they never killed us as they had said .
after about a week , the war broke up into the whole district .
i remember they came home one morning .
they knocked at the front door .
my mother and all the kids who were at home skipped the fence and only dad remained there .
there was a millet plantation behind home and we just hid there .
we did not recognized any of the people who came home , we only managed to identify two of them .
one was called karamage and the other one was called minani .
they came and took dad to a certain center that was around .
they made him sit there and beat him .
i heard that they did not kill him on that day .
we spent about two days in the millet plantation .
then they came back at home , but dad was still alive ; they had n't killed him yet .
a day later ... we did n't know where dad was . in the millet plantation where we were , behind home ... we were with mum and the rest of my brothers and sisters .
we were five children .
the boys left us .
i remained there with mum and my older sister .
in the evening we went to a certain hill in our village and hid in a cave .
and the following evening we left and mum took us to our nieghbours .
when we reached there mum asked them to hide me as i was the last born .
they told my mum that they were not allowed to keep inyenzi .
we immediately went back to hid in a millet plantation .
after about two days ... mum suggested that we go to a church and hide there .
when we reached the church ... it was around 10 o'clock .. we entered in the church and spent about three days there .
after three days they came to get us and led us towards the river .
when we reached a certain center , we were stopped and they wanted to remain behind with mum and told us to go back .
both my sister and i refused to leave our mum behind .
they started beating us and since we were young kids , we agreed and left mum there .
we went to another neighbours ' house .
both our families were friends , so my sister and i decided to go there and when we reached , we hid behind their home .
as we were still hiding , we saw one girl and one boy members of that family and we called them . we thought they would be merciful and hide us in their home .
so we called them and when they came they asked us , "@ how did our people [ the hutu ] leave you ? @"
they immediately took us [ my sister and i ] to some interahamwe called byemayire , who was a terrible killer .
they took us there so that byemayire would kill us .
fortunately , byemayire was n't around .
they procceeded and took us to a nearby center , hoping to find there some other cruel interahamwe so that they would kill us .
when we reached there , two men were hesitant , "@ we can not kill these two kids ; their father was a very good man and he helped us out several times . let them go and be killed elsewhere . @"
therefore , we left . but the boy called minani and his sister yansoneye followed us saying that they were going to show us to interahamwe in order for them to kill us .
when we reached a place called musenyi , i failed to walk because i was very tired .
minani then hacked me on the leg and said that i sould hurry .
though i was hacked , i still we continued to walk ; i was n't too weak to stop walking .
as we were slopping down the hill , still in my sister 's company , they called some people who were down at the river and told them that they had brought them some inkotanyi , to get ready .
therefore , they continued to slop down with us and when we reached the river , my sister was forced to carry a tree trunk and they made me carry two stones , then they dumped us in the water .
we spent two days in the water . we found ... i found myself in the sugar cane plants that were around and my sister came out from the other side of the river . the waters threw us in two different areas .
that was after two days and i was in the sugar cane plants but i did n't know where my sister was .
i had last seen her when they were trowing us into the waters .
i remained in the sugar cane plantation naked ; i did n't ... i came out of water without any cloth .
some of our relatives were in runda ; an old lady who was my mum 's aunt .
but i did n't know the place very well .
they dumped us in the river from a place called iraro and we came out at a certain place called kamuhada , at a brigde that is between kigali and gitarama .
then when night fell , i went to some hill called kagina .
it was in the middle of the night , at around 1 o'clock in the morning .
therefore , i walked and walked .
it was almost morning , at around 4 o'clock in the morning that is when i reached to that home .
i went and knocked on their door .
they had n't seen me in a long time . they opened for me and i found my mum already there . and when she saw me , she was filled with sorrow .
then she asked me , "@ where is your older sister ? @"
i told her that by the time they drowned us , we were together but i do n't know what happened to her later .
therefore , my mum and i stayed there and two days later , my older sister also came .
my mum asked her how she came .
she told her that she was coming from somewhere across the river , in a place called nyagatovu .
the three of us remained together .
actually , the man in that family was not being hunted .
he was the one to hide us and his wife was an aunt to mum and she was also among the group of hunted people .
since her husband was a hutu , he was not threatened .
we all continued to hide there ; my mum , my older sister and i. later ... it was in ... it was still in april in the middle of the war .
then in may , the man [ husband to her mum 's aunt ] said , "@ i do not want to be accused of being inkotanyi .
all of you go . @"
he told his wife if she believed she had to continue hiding us , then she should leave with us .
i stayed there without knowing where the others who were with me had gone .
the war went on and at some point they began shooting .
the inkotanyi came to runda while i was there . during the time of shootings , we all fled together .
i thought of staying in the house alone and thought it would be hard .
we again crossed over to a certain place ... runda was next to taba and taba was my home village .
we passed there and went further .
we reached a place called kanyinya , where we found a roadblock .
at the roadlock they would stop people and look into the palms of kids who were not yet able to get identity cards .
when they looked into mine , they asked me , "@ where do you come from ? @"
i lied to them and gave them wrong names of my parents . then they let me go .
we continued our journey and reached nyabikenke and bulinga . we went through all those areas .
when we reached gisenyi , we turned back as it seemed like the war had calmed down .
we went back to ... to the place where i was during war .
since i was alone , i went back to ruda .
the war had stopped then .
i found when the old lady was still alive but the old man had died .
we went to a camp in ruyenzi and camped there . after some few days ... i thought that maybe someone from home may come to that camp , but no one came .
i just stayed there with those people .
in august 1994 ... i remember we had gone to church , when i came back , i found my sister there .
it was like a big miracle to me .
before greeting her , i first asked her ; "@ are you still alive ? @"
she said , "@ i am alive . @"
then i asked her , "@ you did n't die ?
or am i just talking to a ghost . @"
she said , "@ no , it is me , i am still alive . @"
"@ where were you living ? @"
i asked her .
then she told me that she ... she went to musambira , where we had family members and continued to hide .
later she went to zaire [ congo ] and came back .
therefore , we waited to see if mum or other people from home would come but none turned up .
we neither know how people from home died nor where they died except dad who was killed at a certain center where they had taken him .
that is where they killed him .
then the war stopped .
from august 1994 to january 1995 i continued to live there where i was when the war stopped .
my sister and i continued to live there together .
they somehow wanted to make us their slaves ... the war begun when i was in primary four .
then they stopped me from going back to school .
though my sister was n't so old , she was slightly wiser than me .
then she asked , "@ how shall we live this kind of life ?
they can n't allow you to go to school ; neither did they allow me ... all they wanted us for was to collect grass for their cows , to dig , to fetch water , generally to do all the domestic work .
that was what they expected from us and to them that was the reason why they were taking of us .
my sister left me there .
the burgomaster of our home area was a genocide servivor too .
therefore , my sister went to him and told him what was going on .
then he asked her , "@ what can i do for you ?
you are still young ; you can not live alone in a house .
and even if you did , what would you survive on ?
you have no one left in your family that could maybe protect you in your life . @"
then my sister told him , "@ instead of continuing to live the way we are living , we 'd better live in a house alone . we do n't care if it means dying . @"
by then there were interahamwe 's houses , which were empty ; the interahamwe had fled .
he gave us a house .
then we started living in it .
that was in 1995 , i went back to school but my sister was confused about what to do .
we both went to school at the same time for as hort time .
later on in 1996 , the burgomaster got her a job as a taxe collector .
so , when she started working , i was able to continue school .
in year 1997 , i started secondary school and my sister continued working until the year 2000 .
i was in secondary four when our mayor was changed .
they brought another one who was not aware of our life conditions .
they stopped all employees who did not have diplomas and my sister was among them .
i was in secondary four when she left work .
fortunately , farg was founded .
therefore they would pay for my school fees but as far as domestic needs were concerned , we got a lot of problems .
we were not living in kigali then .
we were living in gitarama at the farm .
our farm was well treated since my sister was working ; she would employ people to work on it and we would live on its harvest .
at first when she had just left work , havests from the farm continued to feed us .
after some time , there was a new policy that was put forward ; everyone had to give everything that did not belong to him or her .
therefore , we were asked to live the other house .
when they took us out of that house , life became hard .
it was as though life had stopped .
but my sister tried to contact farg and then farg considered our problem .
and they would give us 20,000 frw per month .
then in the year 2001 , which is when we used to get the funding of farg ... my sister too ... i was in secondary five .
my sister realised that her life was also getting worse because she never had any documents [ diplomas or certificates ] .
the war began when she was in secondary two .
then she told me , "@ you have reached in senior five and you can see that farg is helping us ; they provide us with school funds , transport and other school expenses .
it is a high time i also went back to school . @" immediately she started looking for a school and started studying as soon as she got one .
farg continued to help us until 2002 when they [ farg ] gave us a house in the kimironko residences , which were constructed for children who live on their own [ orphans ] .
we started living in that house .
later farg was decentralised and they stopped helping people .
when they did ... i had finished my studies before they stopped helping us .
then i got a temporary job in ibuka . i worked and the money was helpful . my sister was actually able to get some of the school material she needed .
then the job stopped and life stopped too .
now i can not tell you hoe exactly life is , all i can say is life is really hard on us .
when one has a problem , he or she tries to bear with it because there is no one to solve the problem for you .
today my older sister is in senior five .
i was lucky to succeed and get a diploma .
however life is currently very hard .
well , i can not say that we are desperate ; we always try to be serene and look for a living .
sometimes we meet good samaritans who have pity on us or remember us and say , "@ i will help these kids in such and such a way . @"
and when you do n't get such people , life still goes on though in such a misarable way .
it was river nyabarongo .
we were drowned my sister and i. we did not come out together .
i came out from this side of kamuhanda and she came out from across the river in a place called nyagatovu .
that is where she came out .
did she tell you how she crossed the river in order to go back to where you had come from ... i mean where you all saw each other again ?
yes she told me .
she walked up to the road that goes to shyorongi and then continued up to the brigde that is between runda and taba .
then she went to the house of the old lady whom we were related ; she was my mum 's aunt .
you talked about some interahamwe who were prisoned , like minani , yansoneye and others .
do you remember ... or do you know what happened to them ?
because , i believe it is minani who cut your leg ...
umh !
after the war , we met the so called minani ... well , when we came back , we went to see our farm in the village .
we found minani there .
when he saw me , he was filled with fear .
then he said to me , "@ i know i betrayed you , i hacked you .
and while doing so , i did not want you to live anymore .
what can i do to make up for what i did to you ? @"
i just told him , "@ there are laws that will punish you for the fact that you never wanted to see me alive again . @"
we went to report him at the district and he was arrested .
he later on died in jail .
his sister too was arrested and she is still in prison .
she is in gitarama prison .
but minani died in prison .
what about the other interahamwe ... you never know they may be the ones who killed your parents or your other relatives .
do you know anything about them ?
in the group of attackers who first attacked our home , the person we managed to identify was karekezi .
he is the one who took our father away .
and since our father left , he has never come back .
but i do n't know if he is the one who killed him or his companions because they were very many .
but he is the only one i knew in the whole group of attackers . he is called karekezi . he is the only one whose name i knew .
undefined
i do n't know about that .
i do n't know if he actually admits that he killed those people .
but when you try asking him , he says , "@ i killed a lot of people and i can not tell the exact number , all i know is that i killed so many people . @"
did he come to apologise to you ?
no he 's never come .
well , considering that , what do you think of the gacaca court ?
what i think about gacaca court ... people who killed had a goal in doing so .
therefore , when someone comes to me asking for forgiveness because he killed people , my people ... they killed intentionally with all their hearts ... therefore , the law should punish them according their crimes .
there is something that is often talked about , something concerning unity and reconciliation .
to somebody like you who was hurt to that extent and who is still suffering the consequences of their deeds even today .
do you find it possible ... or what is your point of view ?
personally , as someone who lost everyone and is now living miserably , i believe those who killed should be strongly punished in a way that would affect them .
so that they also feel how wrong what they did is .
because i can not say that ... that they should kill them too .
it 's not my place to say so , it is the role of the law , and i do n't have that right .
but personally i would suggest they kill them .
but as far as the law is concerned , they should be given punishments according to the crimes they committed .
well , when a person experiences some things the way you did and then lives the way you are living due to his or her past , he or she gains some life experience .
therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ?
could you explain about it ?
as a person who ... someone like me who got several problems .
the way i understand the genocide ... there is a time you think about all the things you went through and try to compare it with the life you are leading now ; then you come to realise that there is no difference between your past and your present .
and when thing are like that , you just try to ignore it all .
because if you can not find a way to ignore it , you might end up on the streets , crazy .
this would only contribute to making happy your enemies . but when you try to be still and not let even a single person know what you are thinking about . you just have to calm down and think about the future .
we only know the past ; we do n't know the future .
we can only wait for the future , if it happens to be good , fine ; if not too bad .
in life it is important to wait for what 's ahead of us .
there is something i would like us to talk about more specifically .
you see you are a person who experienced tough times and you have seen a lot of things .
however , all was as a result of the loos of your parents due to the war .
do you remember how things were before the war ? can u tell us about it ?
how were you living ?
would you please tell us about your life at home before the war ?
before the war , we were five children and i was the last @-@ born .
we never used to have problems at home because both mum and dad were working .
for sure , we never had any problems .
sometimes there would be problems out there but it would n't mean anything to us because there used to be people to look after us .
but after the war ... my sister and i ... yet we were the youngest ; all our elders were gone .
even though the war stopped , not any family member was left .
maybe we could be telling them about our problems .
those who survived only are those who can neither support themselves .
therefore , if we compare this life with life before the war , there is a very big difference .
because nowadays i may be having a problem but i can n't find anyone to tell it about .
for example , i can spend two days without eating , yet before the war , i had never spent even a single day or an hour ... every time i would feel like eating , i would eat .
but now i can even spend three days and remain silent .
because there is no one i can share my problem with .
life after the war is very complicated . mathematically , i would say it is not even a quarter of the life i was leading before the war .
i noticed that the most special person in your life after the war is your sister .
what can you tell us about your sister ; how old is she and what are her plans ?
although she is not too young , my sister is also young ; she was born in 1981 .
but her life is also horrible .
at this time she should have been able to do something with herself .
but because she did not have anyone to push her so that she studies on time and complete her studies , her life seems to have declined instead .
when she realised that it was just the two of us who survived and yet she was the oldest , she had no other alternative but to leave school so that i would go to school .
she went back to school after farg was founded ; that is after farg had agreed to help us monthly .
but before farg came , she had sacrificed herself so that i also get to some grade .
up to now , she has n't completed her studies .
normally at her age , she is not supposed to be in secondary school but that is where she is now ; she is in senior five at the moment .
and whenever she comes back home [ from boarding school ] , she finds several problems .
and me who remained behind , she finds there is nothing i improved because i have no job , no one to protect me , so that i also can help her .
she comes from school and goes back into the miserable life that she left behind .
is there any message you could give genocide orphans ?
especially those that take care of themselves or even to those that are looked after .
those young kids should have a way they should behave ...
the piece of advice i would give them is , "@ never long for luxuries because they can turn out to be so dangerous . @"
if they can appreciate who they are , be it those who are in families or those who are looking after themselves ... it is possible to live in a family and yet live in torture .
if you are not too patient to live with them , is when people start saying you are a spoiled child .
and after misbehaving , she or he may suffer the consequences such sicknesses .
therefore , all i can advise them is to look at everything before them positively ; be it good or bad .
it will all contribute in building a better future .
you know this tape is going to be watched by many people .
your own kids or even grandchildren might one day watch it because it is going to be well kept .
do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ?
anything you may need to talk about to rwandans at large or survivors in general .
you can say anything ...
the advice i can give to the genocide survivors ... let 's talk about the genocide perpetrators ... well , we try our best to talk to them but however much you may try to talk to them , their hearts seems no to be at ease [ ubnormal ] .
there is no way one can kill your parents , kill you entire family and you remain like a tree [ indifferent ] , and then expect to talk to him or her nicely .
well you talk to him or her but your heart feels like a stone .
the advice i would give the genocide survivors is ... they should n't always carry that burden .
they should n't let themselves be stressed by the killers .
instead they should try and ignore those feelings and kind of renew their hearts , i mean they should have a heart of stone .
they should try to ignore what happened to them .
in fact they should try to talk to those who hurt them and listen to their opinion .
i believe when someone hurts you and do not react with anger and you talk to them instead , the person will never be at peace , they will always fear you .
that 's my advice .
what about children ?
well , concerning children , i can not ... the advice i can give them is , though there was a war , the future will make life new .
because if you tell them the history of the war , or tell them those bad stories , they may grow up without enjoying anything in life .
they may mature up with a belief that what will happen in the future will be the continuation of what happened in the past .
therefore , i would reassure them that what happened will end .
the future will be very good , unlike what they went through in the past .
that is the advice i would give children .
considering the problem of foreign countries that deny that there was genocide in rwanda , do n't you have any message to give them ?
foreign countries ?
the problem is foreign countries believe that there was n't genocide in rwanda .
unless i get ... a leader from a particular country that denies that there was genocide in rwanda .
then i would convince him or her that genocide did take place in rwanda .
and if necessary , i would take him or her to those places where they exhumed and reburried those innocent people who died .
i would make sure he or she gets to see those remains of people and show him or her all those who were handicaped due to the genocide until when he or she ... understands that genocide actually took place in rwanda .
because most countries can not imagine how someone can hold a machete and hack his or her equal .
what do you plan for your future ?
what is your plan for the future ?
what i plan for life , though i experienced a bad life in the past , i still have hope that things will change .
i believe that all this that brings me down , problems ... living wthout someone to confide in ... yes i know i will die without ever getting someone to tell my problems but remember , we only remember our problems when we get into hardships .
therefore , if one tries to get ride of hardships , slowly by slowly the problems will also reduce and finally one will forget about them .
i know you can never completely forget but the burden is lighter .
and i believe my future will be very nice .
do you have any additional messageto add to your testimony ?
my name is olivier ruyenzi , son of venuste karasira and of speciose mukakarangwa .
i was born in 1984 .
after habyarimana 's death is when ... two days later is when we went to eto school .
we found the unamir soldiers there .
we went there at around 1 p.m. when we got there , our houseboy went back home and when he got back , he told us our house had already been burnt .
we continued living at eto , many of the people from kicukiro , the neighbourhood where we lived .
people came to eto hoping that they 'd survive .
a few days later , on april 11th , 1994 is when the unamir soldiers made an announcement from the un saying that they needed to leave .
they left with all the white people and the catholic nuns who were working in a convent that was there .
but before they left , they told us that they were leaving ; so we were aware if that fact .
some tried looking for ways to leave with them but it did n't work out .
the interahamwes were around the fence of don bosco high school at eto , surrounding it .
they got in as soon as the unamir left and started killing . a group tried escaping towards amahoro stadium but you understand that some were killed at eto .
as we were heading towards amahoro stadium , some were killed on the way , in the kicukiro neighbourhood ... when we got to ‘ sonatubes ’ , there were some gps [ the presidential guard ] and a few interahamwes , they gathered us all in one place and got us to sit down .
we heard that the inkotanyis were seeing us there at ‘ sonatubes ’ but did n't have any means of getting to us .
as we were there , they could n't figure out what to do with us and that 's when they told us to continue walking towards nyanza .
we left , some soldiers were walking ahead of us and some behind us and we were in the middle .
we walked straight towards nyanza , those who were tired died on the way .
if somebody recognized you and did n't want you to escape him , he 'd take you with him ... and so on .
we found a roadblock with interahamwes at nyanza and they decided that 's where they should put us , given that it had been decided that kigali city should be kept clean and that they should stop killing people on the streets .
it was dark and it was raining ; they got us to sit down and started throwing grenades at us , people were falling all over .
a fragment hit my head and i felt very weak .
when they got a shortage of grenades , they started shooting until bullets got finished as well .
they then told the interahamwes who were there to get in there and look for the people who were still breathing ...
where did the grenade hit you ?
on the head [ he shows above the ear . ]
they started throwing grenades ... i mean , after the grenades and bullets got finished , the interahamwes started killing those who were still breathing .
by then , i was no longer with my parents , brothers and sisters .
but i was still with mother then .
i was still very young and she kept urging me to remain silent .
an interahamwe came and realized she was still breathing .
he hit her on the back with a hammer and she was pregnant ! she was in a lot of pain but she did n't die right away .
another one came and hot me with the side of a machete but it was n't very painful compared to the pain caused by the fragment of grenades .
the following day ... all this happened at night and i can not recall exactly what happened next but i was told that dad had n't been injured !
so he looked for us and took us not far from rebero where the inkotanyis were .
the inkotanyis found us the next day .
others came ... we left for cnd in a daihatsu full of casualties .
they kept on shooting at it as it was surrounded by inkotanyis .
when we got there , the casualties were taken inside where some doctors took care of them .
more people came to seek refuge there , the ones who had not been injured brought themselves .
many bombs were being thrown there .
three days later , at around 6 o'clock in the evening , they decided we should ... the non @-@ injured had started walking towards byumba at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon .
the roads were safe , the non @-@ injured went by foot and the casualties were driven there .
by the time we were leaving , i did n't know where dad was . he 'd been shot at the hand .
i only was with mother .
we did n't know in what conditions my younger brothers and sisters were at that time .
when we got to rebero ... that 's when we met with dad at the byumba hospital , near the catholic church .
neither did he know where my sisters were which is very understandable .
then ... but soon after we got there , we saw one of my sisters who was 2 years old then .
she had been hit with a club on the head and she was with some of our nieghbours .
there was a military camp nearby and the soldiers used to bring us food at the hospital .
mother was in a very bad shape as she was pregnant and dad 's hand was almost being cut off .
there were some white doctors and he told them he did n't want it to be cut off . he could speak english as he had gone to school .
but there was nothing else they could do and they ended up cutting it off . they were treating people very fast as there were so many casualties .
so when we found out that his right hand had been cut off and we did n't know where all my siblings were , we started seeing how hard life was becoming ... a few days later came some white people , we were with other kids from our neighbourhood and they wanted to take us to italy .
since those kids were the most injured , they took them first .
a few days later ... as dad was getting better , we thought of going to uganda as giving birth in those conditions was going to be too hard for mom .
we left for uganda and when we got there , some relatives of ours who lived there welcomed us .
a baby boy was born a few days later .
the war had ended by then , dad went back to rwanda to check how things were and he came back and told us the house had been destroyed .
we had some neighbours with whom we shared everything who had been killed but their house was still there .
him and i came back to rwanda but mother , the newly born baby and the child who had been hit by a club remained behind .
they later on joined us there and we went back to living a normal life although they were still shooting here and there .
after sometime , we moved back to our own house .
we were living near the kicukiro health centre and we knew the nurses there .
they introduced to us some italian doctor .
him and another doctor called paul got for us visas and dad and i went to italy for treatment .
they operated my head and we came back .
he ... we came to find my younger sister called diane , she was fine and had only been injured on the head , she has a scar on the forehead .
we kept looking round and asking about my older sister and we found out that she 'd been killed .
she had gone to visit my godmother during the holidays and they all were killed apart from the elder child in my godmother 's family .
so they 'd been killed and when we found out , we organized ourselves and made some sort of a souvenir ... a way of commemorating their death .
we ... my parents also inquired about the rest of our relatives and found out that only my dad was still alive and his younger brother who lived in uganda and his sister who lived in butare .
how many were they before ?
they were five and 3 of them remained .
in mother 's family , no one survived .
not even one !
no one of her relatives survived ... so life went on ...
the flag used to go up every morning and everyone would stend still until it reaches up and then go about their activities .
at that time , it was n't easy for her working in such an atmosphere , they 'd first put up the flag before she could get inside the school courtyard .
they 'd even spit on her face and such things ... there 's a time they attacked us at home , they said they were searching for a gun , affirming we had one but they could n't find one .
they thought there was ... before they imprisonned the ‘ spies ’ , dad 's younger brother who used to come home was suspected to be an inkotanyi ... he passed away .
they thought he was an inkotanyi and they used to think we were in contact with him .
they 'd even come to cnd ... they used to send people to come and check if we had any contact with him but they never found out ... but in reality , we were in contact with him ... they were very suspicious about us and that 's why they 'd always burn our things .
how was it at the time of multiparty system ?
before the multiparty system ... i mean after , when the cdr , mrnd , mdr power propaganda started ... it started mostly when the inkotanyis came to cnd ...
how was it ?
they first attacked the house , they come and search for things , they 'd come about twice a weeks ... that 's when we started fearing ... they were ... they 'd get everyone to sit down in the sitting room ... they 'd come , search around and go back , having found nothing .
how were they when they 'd come to you ? ... what did they used to say ?
they used to come in a group , saying that tutsis were n't trustworthy .
they were suspecting us to be hiding people or maybe to be in contact with the soldiers who were at cnd .
you told me your mom was hit by grenades ' fragments ... does she suffer any consequences today ?
abari bari mu kigero cyo ubu turimo nibo babaga babasigaranye akenshi . most of people knew each other then .
i can not recall their names but they looked familiar although we did n't know everyone 's name ... they were people who lived in the same neighbourhood as us and so we knew each other .
we even used to play football together despite the fact that they were older than us . the ones who had our age today were the ones to ...
how many choldren were you in your family before ?
six children .
six children .
only florence who was my older sister .
do you know how they were killed ?
she is the one who died ... she had gone to visit her godmother in gikongoro where she was killed with the children of the latter .
what do your parents do today ?
as it was happening ... how can i explain it ? ... as a child , i used to think that 's just how things were .
i am not saying that they used to just kill people but as time went , we saw things getting worse ; you could pass by somewhere and witness somebody being taken away to be killed in the open .
so it was ... it was beyond what one could handle , you 'd reach a point where you 'd become insensible to what was going on .
i t was so much that it was as though one had stopped being human .
how did your wounds come to heal ?
we were treated in byumba but they did n't heal right away as they were infected .
but after some ... when i was in ... the war started when i was in primary ii and when i was in primary iv is when those italians took me to italy twice for a check up .
the first time i went , i was operated and then when i went back they did a check up .
a bone near the brain had been affected by a fragment and they removed it and said it would get back into place as i was still growing up .
we agreed that i 'll go back there after 5 years if necessary so they can implant an artificial bone .
who are those white people ?
what were they here for exactly ?
they are doctors who had come here to help out .
one of them is a priest and the rest are doctors who had come to visit the kicukiro health centre and to see what had happened in rwanda and know more details about it .
how was byumba ?
life in byumba was like ... it was like starting in a new life .
apart from the pain , from seeing some people crying , others dying due to the wounds .
it was a new life after the shootings , bombings , screaming ... it was like going back to a normal life .
how do you compare it to life before genocide ?
he fled with other people but we do n't know who they were , we even tried finding out who they were but we never found out .
even the godmother 's daughter who survived does n't know exactly what happened ... she just remembers them leaving , each one in their own direction , she was behind and she never saw them again ...
do you find it easy living with the people who betrayed you , how do you handle such a thing ?
living such a life is of course affecting us in a way but we need to endure life and accept reconciliation as they say .
but ... life goes on despite the scars that are obvious to everyone .
they also see them and it certainly affects them as much as it affects us .
do you think unity will be possible ?
it will be difficult to see it happen but it will come with time .
as people will get to give out their testimony or get to tell what happened to them in public , they 'll feel released .
i believe we will one day reach unity .
how do you think unity could be built ?
the advantage of unity ... meaning that he 's the one to make the first step .
you consider his attitude , the way he usually behaves ... he should be the one to make the first step .
he most probably will be thinking that you 're still holding grudges towards him .
when you 're still bitter towards him ... he comes to you and tells you in details everything he did and says how sorry he is about it all .
he is sorry about it because there is no way it would leave him indifferent and if he were n't , then he would n't come to you .
from the heart , you 're then able to tell him that it is okay and even though it will n't resurrect them , at least he 's shown you that he 's become human as opposed to before when he was inhuman ; then you ... you can be united without a problem .
but unity will not automatically come , it will be built with time as you talk and keep seeing each other
how do you feel about the future ?
suspicion will go with time .
but there are some things you simply can not erase from the heart , some people do n't believe we should live in unity , they can not erase it from their hearts but it will come slowly .
it 's been ten years since genocide happened in rwanda ... what changes do you see ?
the way things were in 1995 is not the way they were in 2000 .
everything was still very fresh on people 's minds in 1995 ... you 'd see somebody and immediately suspect him or her of being something else ... but as the years go by and things happen , as life changes , the way we think also changes as we learn new things .
maybe at first i had a problem wih going back to school , i kept remembering wherever i 'd be , while sleeping , walking or sitting on my own and that was a big issue .
but today , we talk about it for example in aerg .
survivors exchange ideas and share each other 's experience and it removes a certain weight and one feels lighter .
you start living with others in harmony .
how do you see rwanda 's future ?
we have the vision 2020 but again ...
what kind of a country do you think the future generations will be living in ?
before i even talk about that , i 'd like to say that today 's rwanda is very different from the way it used to be .
before , only one part of the rwandan population could express themselves freely , while another one could n't .
but today it seems more open to both sides as long as there are no divisional ideas into it .
before , there was so much division , people 's ethnic groups were written on identity cards but today it 's stopped .
about the way i see rwanda 's future , when i look at the things that used to be and that are no longer there , i believe things can only get better .
our children will go through the country 's archives and find out how things used to be and they will want to understand why things were that way .
they will also see how things have improved and maybe say that then , things were on level 0 and will maybe be estimating them at +15 or +20 .
do you believe there 'll be development ?
i am a student and i can go forward through my studies or in the area in which i 'd like to pursue my education .
i study computers .
i have just finished secondary school and i am going on with my studies .
a job is something you have to look for , it does n't just come to you .
then life will be good , no one wants to live a bad life .
many people will watch this testimony , probably among them will be your future children .
what message would you like to give to those who will watch it ?
the message i 'd like to give them is to look for the message that 's in it when they watch it .
that 's the message i 'd like to give them ... i 'd to encourage them to think it through so it never happens again , to keep it in their hearts so that the same thing does n't happen again or we find ourselves in the same situation all over again .
i 'd encourage people to think through the different things they 'll see on different recordings .
how would you describe rwanda ?
rwanda is a country inhabited by people called rwandans .
people who have had different lives ... their problem is that there are tribes among them and some of them started killing each other , it 's been acknowledged that genocide occurred .
genocide happened against the tutsi tribe just like there was genocide against the jews .
the tutsis in rwanda were genocided .
but now it is coming to an end as rwandans are reconciling .
what do you call genocide ? what proves that it happened according to you ?
genocide ... genocide happened ... because one does n't want the other one from a different tribe to be alive ... from the tutsi tribe , he or she does n't want him to be there , he or she does n't consider him or her as a fully @-@ fledged human being .
his or her only wish is that the other person would get out of his or her sight and this happens through killing the other person , as that would make it possible never to see him or her again in his or her entire life .
anything you 'd like to add to your testimony ?
i 'd like to add that i believe unity will be attained in rwanda in this generation .
my name is ruhurambuga marcel .
i was born in a place formerly called mukingi commune , but now known as ntenyo district in gitarama district .
we were eight brothers and sisters in my family .
during the genocide four died , which means four others remained ; two sisters and two brothers died . and there are two two sisters and two brothers who survived in the whole family .
the first born was a girl ; she was then married .
then the second and the third born were boys , i was the fifth born .
our first born was called mukayiranga rose and the second born was called burabyo gabriel ; he died in the genocide .
the third born was called rudahunga michael ; he also died , then mukakimenyi marceline who died also .
my father 's names were hategekimana gakuba .
in brief , the genocide in the gitarama area did not start in the last days .
because i remember how habyarimana 's plane was crashed on the sixth at night , and we got the news in the morning of 7th .
our district was neighbouring that of kabagali , previousily known as masango .
many people used to pass by coming from kibuye heading to kabgayi . sometimes they would pass by home and we would give them food .
the massive killings in our region started on 21st of april .
that was when the killings started and many people were fleeing from kibuye .
i remember some people used to go for patrols and some of them used to ask my elder bothers to join them in the tour of duty .
therefore , they would join them and make rounds .
later on , the people who used to call my brothers for patrols were mislead by the counsellors and the bergomaster who was called nsabimana basile and they stopped making patrols and started burning people 's homes instead .
about my family , we lived in rutagara sector in bamagayo cell .
we were the only tutsis who lived in that cell ... my father was the only tutsi who lived there .
he was the only one who remained there in 1959 ; all his brothers fled but he remained there because he was studying .
and then when he completed his studies he married and ended up the only tutsi living in the area [ where we were born ] .
the genocide started but our neighbours confused us ; during the 1959 war , when my dad came from school , he found when all his brothers had fled .
grandpapa was already dead ; that is what we have been told as their story .
it was their hutu neighbours who came and took him up ; they looked after him , built him a house , gave him back their cows and and when he reached time to marry , they got him a wife .
in other words , they were like his parents or his only relatives .
they were the closest people he had .
he always used to invite them on all special occasions .
after they married , they had eight children , still in the same cell .
we neither had an uncle nor an aunt in that area .
the closest relatives we had were in gitarama towards the town called karama in shyogwe .
others lived in kibungo where they resided after surviving the 1959 war .
therefore , when genocide started in 1994 , thing happened the usual way .
be it the hens we owned , be it the cattle , be it the rabbits , all our livestocks were taken by the neighburs as they normally did whenever there was a war .
they gathered everything and said to us , "@ do n't worry , nothing will happen to you . @"
they divided our livestock between themselves ; some took two cows , others took three , others took goats and we saw them take everything with our own eyes .
some took hens ... they just took anything they came across .
they moved us with the intention of hidding us but they were n't sincere .
tutsis would come from kibuye fleeing towards kabgayi and we would see them living but we stayed in our neighbours ' homes .
things continued like that until around the first dates of may .
i remember a certain boy who was our neighbour but who had joined habyarimana 's army , he had been shot on the elbow .
his name was shyaka the son of nsengiyumva innocent . and then he came and said , "@ you have n't yet killed nicolas ? @"
[ nicolas was my father 's name ] they all went crazy , i think they killed him in the beginning of may .
i do n't remember the day neither the date but he was the first to be killed .
they got him but they first took all of us .
by the way , i think i am mistaken ; that boy shyaka found when my father had already been killed .
then he said , "@ how could you kill nicolas and live his children ? @"
he went on to say , "@ it 's impossible . @"
in the beginning of may , they took all of us with dad , saying that they were taking us to the district , at mukingi commune .
at the commune they would put people in the buses and take them to kabgayi , i do n't know what used to take place there at kabgayi because i never went there .
they took my dad and mum and my young brother who was called serubibi guido and my sister mukakimenyi marcelline .
they took them saying that they were taking them to the district 's offices .
somewhere on the way , they put my mum aside .
one of the militias made my young brother escape through the millet plantation that was around because he was aware of what was going to be done to those people .
later his companions looked for my brother , a certain man who was nicknamed nangwahafi samuel , his real name was ntezimana samuel , looked for my brother asking , "@ where did guido go ?
where is he ? @"
but they never found him .
when we were exhuming and re @-@ burying his remains from that bush , i realized that they stoned him to death , because we found stones on top of his head and his skeleton was tied up with ropes .
the following day at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon , i was attacked in my hide out at munyawera 's home .
there lived a man called katabandama eugene in the neighborhood but he did not know i was hiding around there .
it was very cold ; i went and climbed their fence very slowly before they woke up .
i went into an ‘ umuvure ’ [ a traditional thing used for making banana wine with the shape of a boat ] and entered in the cow 's manger in which i found kept manure and used it to cover myself .
maybe someone saw me .
i do n't know what happened ; i just saw people searching in that house and later came to find me .
i remember i was wearing a yellow dress ; so they took me out of the manger .
it was shyaka and a female interahamwe called mukakare , shyaka 's brother called aphrodis munyanziza plus many others whose names i did n't know .
they made me stand out of the manger and took my clothes off .
however , they left me with my trousers and a shirt . my mother was also around but like in the previous instances , she was not harmed .
she was just left to live in misery and trauma for loosing all her family .
they took me ; whipping my legs all the way and took me to a place called kabuga where i was subjected to the worst torture you can ever imagine .
they beat me up , spat in my face , and forced me to move on my knees and elbows .
in brief , they did everything they wished with me .
shyaka asked me where my brother gabriel was and in response , i asked him if he did n't know where he had put him the previous night .
"@ listen to the way tutsi are arrogant . @"
he said then he kicked me on the chest . he laid me on the ground and hit me hard on the back . he grabbed me and hit every part of my body .
i sat there and after a short while , a boy called joseph the son of murengerantwari came .
it was his father murengerantwari , who was hiding my cousin 's wife . my cousin was called bihezande he was also killed .
then those perpetrators ordered joseph to go and pick up the sorcerer that was hiding in their home . he went there and brought a lady with him .
we were made to sit there and they hit us ... and around 7:00 p.m. they tied our arms on our backs .
they used a piece of cloth that she would wrap on her head to tie her .
as for me , they used the t @-@ shirt i was wearing and passed it on the chest and tied my arms behind .
they took us to mr. silas ' ruined home and made us sit there near the septic tank , where people fleeing from kibuye were thrown after being hacked . [ the same people i mentioned before . ]
those that they would ambush were taken there .
i was the first one to be caught .
i thought they were going to kill me .
i was made to sit on top of the pit with my legs hanging over it ; i was tied up .
however no one wanted to kill me , i had been in the same school with most of the perpetrators .
therefore , whoever they would tell to kill me would go back because i would look straight in his eyes .
then another group of interahamwe came , shyaka and alex [ i do n't know his other name ] were among them . all i know about alex is that he was a son to muneza yohana [ john ] .
then alex asked , "@ look at that cretin as tall as rwigemera !
i will show you what i will do with him . @"
it was late in the evening and it was dark ; one could n't see clearly .
then he got a hammer wanting to hit me on the head , somehow i moved the head and he hit on the neck .
he hit me three times and i do n't know how i got into the pit .
i do n't know if it is someone who pushed me there , or if i went in by myself .
i only remember the moment when i gained conscious and found myself lying on my stomach in faeces @/ excrements .
it was a latrine that had already been used .
but the piece of cloth , which they had used to tie me , had loosened and my arms were like this ... i noticed that they had thrown bricks on me .
fortunately , the bricks fell on the side ; they did not hit me .
i do n't know what they did to my sister @-@ in @-@ law , whom we were together , up there .
but i guess they raped her and then she was dumped into the pit upside down while she was still tied up .
all her bones at this level [ he shows ] were broken ; her pelvic bones were crashed .
she was agonizing intensly in excrements .
i tried to come out of the latrine by stepping on the bricks . i tried to take her out of it too and removed the piece of cloth that was tied on her .
i tried to make her stand but she could n't because these bones [ he shows ] were crashed .
she was screaming a lot !
i imagined ; "@ someone screaming like this yet naked , no joints , the knee bones are crashed , nothing ... @" all her bones were crashed .
i left her because i could see she had no life yet i was also dying myself .
then i started fighting to get out of the pit .
it was a circular shaped pit and when i was almost reaching the top i slipped and fell back into the pit .
i again tried to come out ; i stepped on the bricks that they had thrown in the pit and in the bricks , there was a stick pointing up .
therefore , i got support from that stick and came out .
there was another stick that was hanging across the pit , i held it and finally got a way out of the pit .
but when i fell back in the latrine for the second time , it was because all my clothes were wet .
therefore , i removed everything and remained only in my underwear .
did you fall back into it twice ?
yes , i feel into it twice .
when i got on top , i was in dilemma , wondering where i should go .
i started thinking about the way i could go back and save the woman that i had left inside the latrine .
i thought of whom i could ask for help to save the lady . however , i could n't think of anybody who could respond positively to my request for help .
while still thinking , i heard the same group of people who had dumped us in the latrine coming back .
they were coming from a center called kabuga , in kanjevuba area area .
they came up the hill and all of them were drunk .
they were saying , "@ the people we dumped in the latrine must have died . @" they proceeded . the lady was still agonizing .
then they said , "@ we should suppress that pit after throwing about twenty more tutsis . @"
the pit latrine was about eight meters deep .
if i consider the height of the pit , i would fall back into it after climbing up approximately half of it .
looking at the way i 'd fall into it , i 'd say it was about 6 to 8 meters long .
the same perpetrators approached the pit with torches and lamps .
when i heard them , i hid myself in silas ' abandoned home .
they lit their torches into the pit and said , "@ they have surely died . @" and then they went back to their homes . i watched them going to their homes but i can n't tell what time it was by then .
however , it was around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. , about the time you hear small creatures murmuring .
the time when everything is asleep , the time when even frogs can not croak .
that lady took me to her father 's place but i spent there a few days and then i thought of joining ndongozi 's family ; the other friends of mine whom we went to the same school .
by then my injury was getting better and the swelling was reducing .
therefore i crossed the river and went there .
but instead of going to mr. ndongozi 's home , i went to his young brother 's home .
he was called ndanga aloys and he was my dad 's friend ; him and my father had given each other cows . [ in the rwandan culture , giving a cow to a person is a symbol of friendship and solidarity ] .
however , i doubted if they would accept to hide me or if they would kill me .
fortunately they welcomed me in their home and i stayed there until ... it was towards the end of may . i stayed there and left the place when the whole family was preparing to flee .
when the inkotanyi captured kabgayi ; that was on the 2nd of june in 1994 . they all fled . then they asked me , "@ we are preparing to flee , should we live you in the house ? @"
i told them it was okay .
"@ since you are living i will wait for darkness to fall then i will also go . @" that is what i told them . in the evening , on that particular day i left that house for kamonyo pascal 's home .
my sister was hiding at his place and i was sure that my brothers guido and michael were still alive .
before they left , the people who had given me shelter told me , "@ your fellows inkotanyi captured kabgayi and ruhango .
they advised me to go towards the areas the inkotanyi had already captured . they warned me of all the places where i may find the interahamwe and told me not to reach those places .
after getting those important information , i decided to pass by and see my sister and brothers so that we should go all together .
i found her and we spent the whole day together .
then around midday , habyarimana 's soldiers came from gafunzo to that home where we were and asked the old man , " we have heard that you keep cockroaches in your house . @"
"@ how can i keep those cockroaches yet i 've heard that they slaughter people ? @"
he replied them . we were terrified .
i thought this time my end had come !
the old man was talking through the window as we were just behind the door . if they had tried to open the door or break it , they would have seen us .
"@ we shall come back to verify . @" they said while living .
when they left we got out and hid in a nearby plantation .
i was waiting for the nightfall to tell my sister the information i got from the family where i was hiding concerning areas occupied by the inkotanyi .
then in the evening we went back to mr. pascal to get some food .
we ate and after eating , we started looking for my brother but he was nowhere to be found .
we asked the old man to help us and get him for us but still he could n't see him .
i told my sister , "@ you saw what took place during the day , we have to leave with our younger sister . @" she was about five years old then .
she was also living in the same home .
but the old man refused to let us take her .
he said , "@ this is a very young girl , you can not handle her .
i will stay with her and i will tell everyone that she is my granddaughter .
no one will disturb her . @"
then i told my sister that we should go and if michael was still alive , we would somehow meet .
my sister and i left .
but the young sister who was about 5 years old remained at pascal 's place .
she had been inside the house throughout , she never used to go out ; when we reached a certain place called kigarama , she got very sick .
i took her to a nearby home whose owner was called ntakiyimana .
what was she suffering from ?
she suddenely shivered . i do n't know if it was malaria or something else .
we spent two nights in that home .
he was a good man and he even brought malaria tablets and some painkillers and gave them to my sister .
after that , he directed us where to find the rpf members .
then we asked him if he knew where our brother could be hiding ; i thought he was hiding around that area since we could n't find him on the other side .
then he told us that , the boy we were talking about had been killed .
i tried to argue that he could n't be dead because i had seen him the previous day .
but the man described him for us and assured us that they killed him the day before and his body was thrown in the same latrine where i was once thrown . we were very sad .
then we left but that man also helped us by giving us proper directions to where the inkotanyi were .
my brother was also dumped in the pit upside down .
we noticed it later after the genocide , when we were exhuming his remains ; i identified his bones from the pair of trousers he was wearing during the genocide , and his legs were facing up .
we spent two days in ntakiyimana 's house then we left .
we met the inkotanyi at kazinganyoni near byimana .
when we reached their roadblock , my sister got so scared , she thought the roadblock belonged to habyarimana 's soldiers .
but i convinced her that according to the directions we had been given , habyarimana 's soldiers were not here .
then we proceeded and reached the roadblock .
i can not tell where soldiers came from , they suddenly appeared and surrounded us .
they asked us , "@ who are you and where are you going ? @"
we introduced ourselves and they started conversing with us . we told them all our experience and they really felt pity for us .
since then we lived with them and they took us to byimana where we joined other people .
frankly speaking , i never expected to find any other family member alive apart from my sister and i. even my mother ; though the killers used to live her to suffer the misery of loosing all her family members , i still thought they would kill her one day .
after sometime our mother joined us at byimana , our other sisters had been killed .
one of my sisters was hiding at mr. rutwaza whose son rusizana betrayed my brother michel .
the same rusizana is the one who asked his father to send him a girl he was hiding in his house .
our last born remained at pascal 's house and pascal had promised never to leave the girl , "@ i will always flee with her . @"
later he was attacked but we had already left for byimana . we had joined the inkotanyi way before .
when we reached byimana [ my sister and i ] with the inkotanyi , mum went to get the rest of the kids [ mukakimenyi marcelline and ingabire clemence .
] but they refused to give them to her ... and the interahamwe attacked pascal kamonyo who had stayed with our young sister . they beat pascal very badly .
and when my sister realized the way they were beating the man , she ran away .
she went to hide in the home where my elder sister was also hiding .
it became very easy for the killers ; they found them and killed both of them at the same time .
my mother continued to ask the killers for her children but all they did was laugh at her .
none of us know how they died but what we learnt later is that they took them to karambo towards mutara and this is where all the children were killed , after killing them , they threw them in river kiryango .
the same river where my father was drowned .
that is how they died .
now my other young brother is still alive and he is a student in the 5th year of secondary school . he is called serubibi guido .
after they had invaded mr kamonyo 's home , our young sister ran away and went to the home where my older sister was hiding .
but remember i told you that my sister was hiding in rutwaza 's home yet his sons are the ones who killed my brother . they took him from his hide out in their home and hacked him to death .
my mother pleaded with them to give back her our sisters but they refused and fled with them as they retreated from rpf soldiers .
when they came back we were told that our two sisters had been killed but we do n't know how they were killed .
what happened for your neighbours to betray you ? because according to what you told us , they seemed to be like relatives .
how did they change ?
you see ... even though we had lived together like relatives , it happened that way because we had no alternative . there were no other people to live with .
otherwise we had somehow noticed that they [ hutus ] were malicious earlier .
there is a saying in kinyarwanda , which says "@ you can never treat a leopard that has frightened you once before as a wild cat @" meaning that , once you are born with a weakness , you can never change .
we lived with them because we had no other choice .
but one could tell that they [ hutus ] are bad .
when the time for fleeing came ; it was too late to find somewhere to hide .
but they assured us how they would hide us and our properties ... they later said , "@ we must kill you ! @"
but even before , one could tell from the look on their faces that they were capable of killing us but we had no alternative and nowhere to flee to .
however , they had n't been able to kill us because of the custom i told you .
[ my father exchanging cows with them .
] their sons who were young and strong supported and encouraged them to kill us . most of their sons had tasted fresh blood ; they lived in kigali and some of them were soldiers .
therefore , they went ahead and killed us also .
does it mean that you had already understood that they would kill you ?
yes , they had the desire to kill us before .
they used to have some skirmishes with my father in the past ; it was clear that they envied my father for having a big land .
but they were forgetting that my dad was n't born alone ; though he then lived there on his own , he had brothers who had fled .
they would come and take part of our land without permission ; like the family i told you who were almost like our relatives , they had taken a portion of our land !
several others had built on our land ; behind our home there was a family on our land , on both sides of our home there was another family , still on our land .
someone would just come and build on our land but there was nothing we could do because the government was not fair to the tutsis .
therefore , we would just live together but it did n't mean that we were happy with each other .
in 1994 in gitarama there was a political party called mdr , how was your life then ?
well during the time of multi @-@ partyism in gitarama , mdr was the mother party to all the others .
it was the youth that got very involved .
for us , i can say we were neutral because you could n't join mdr and you could n't also show , which political party you supported .
we would just keep silent but the rest were so involved . people would rise flags for their parties ; like mdr , psd but especially mdr would be present .
we would just pretend to be absent ; that is what i would call it .
would n't they force you to join those parties ?
such things happened but we would take it lightly ; for example , stealing or cutting people 's banana plantations .
but serious torture like beating a person and others ... well there used to be some moral torture like scaring people , nocking on the doors at night .
those are the things that they would do . but to us , it meant nothing .
is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] ?
no , there was n't any other problem .
however , even what was done to us was due to out ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] it was the hutus who were doing that and we were the only tutsis who lived there .
all our neighbours were hutus . definitely one could tell they were the ones to do all those acts !
you told me that you come from gitarama .
were you born there ?
yes , but while we lived in mwendo , our home origin was in karama .
our grandfather had shifted to mwendo and we lived on his land .
he had a very large land .
the reason i am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone .
he had few relatives and therefore seemed to own a big land . he was living there with a few of his relatives .
you earlier talked about people who were fleeing from kibuye towards kabgayi .
would you please elaborate more about that ?
the population fled kibuye because their houses had earlier been burnt .
they were chased from kibuye . they used to pass through our home area while fleeing . we used to help them , as we knew we were related to some extent .
we would give them food and all we could to help them . then they would proceed to kabgayi .
most of them would n't reach their destination because our neighbours had set roadblocks .
they would kill them ; ladies would be raped and sometimes made sex slaves .
in fact the killings had started and most people would not go beyond that roadblock ; they would be murdered and dumped into a deep pit that was in this area .
very few would reach kabgayi .
for example , there were many corpses in the pit where i had been dumped by the time we exhumed them .
all the corpses were reburied together because we could n't tell their places of origin . perhaps they were from kibuye or areas around kabagari .
most people were killed on the way , our neighbours killed them . and we know them [ the killers ] .
q ...
in that pit ... while they were throwing us in the pit , the perpetrators would say they would cover it after adding more 20 people .
well i do n't know the exact number but i would think they were over thirty .
how many people were in pit the time you exhumed them ?
while exhuming ... we first found my older brother on top , then we found our sister in law .
we found them before digging deep into it . so , we went to rebury them .
i think they were about eighteen .
there were more people in the next pit but i do n't know the exact number of people who were there .
there was a certain man who was dumped into that second pit , he was called sematetu and his wife cemented the pit . we just left it that way as we did n't wanted to break the cement .
how many pits were there ?
two pits .
what was the distance between the two pits ?
about 300 meters .
people in your area would kill some people and leave others . what was determing their choice ?
actually those who killed us were our neighbours and we knew them .
not only the killers , but also those who looted our properties .
for example , i know who killed my elder brother .
where does your mother reside now ?
now she is living in ... at first we lived in byimana centre .
we no longer live there ; we shifted to a place called imbare next to shyogwe opposite to kabgayi in avega estate .
she lives with my sister who lost her husband during the genocide .
what does she do ?
nothing , she is illiterate .
before she was working in an orphanage looking after orphans but the orphanage closed and now she is just at home helping mum in the farm .
how old were your parents then ?
my father was born in 1935 that means that by then he was about 59 years old .
while mum was born in 1944 .
in which year were you born ?
he was about 21 years old .
i guess he was born in 1974 .
maybe he was 20 years during the genocide since he was born in 1974 .
q ...
we were neighbours . the distance between our homes was about 500 meters .
presently his father is under custody because he was involved in my older brother 's murder .
he was participated in the murder of my brother , shyaka , his older brother called aphrodis munyanziza , their younger brother called mukaka damascene and several others .
all that man 's family and the soldier were there while my brother was being killed ; they all participated in his death .
the time you were led to the pit , what was on your mind ?
tell us a bit of your experience .
when they took me to the latrine hole , i thought my life was over .
i had just seen and heard what they had done to my brother .
when i was on top of the hole , i was curious about what heaven looked like , that 's all i could think of .
i was wondering what took them so long to kill me .
when he snatched a hammer , i thought he was going to smash my head and finish with me .
fortunately , i guess it was by gods will ; he hit my neck instead of my head and that is how i survived .
when you gained conscious did you manage to ...
when i gained conscious and moved from the hole , i started thinking of where to go .
i looked in the north and in the south and found no direction . i wished i had died !
i thought in case they came across me , they would do worse things than what they had done to me . i thought they would first amputate me or cut my ears or fingers off .
fortunately , they never caught me again . otherwise , it would have been like dying twice .
that is waht i can call it .
you were so afraid that they would get you for the second time but you still followed them .
why were you following them ?
i can not tell . maybe it was by god 's mercy .
they really helped us yet we were n't friends .
for example , that man i was talking about , pascal ... he was my sister 's godfather .
however , we were not so close to his family . we never expected him to help us the way he did .
surprisingly those who were supposed to help us , i mean our neighbours , those who seemed to be our relatives .
they surely changed !
i would say they had always had a cruel nature , they were killers at heart and they had been pretending throughout . maybe they had been sensitized to kill for ages but they had n't got courage to put it into practice .
once such a person gets someone to motivate him to killing , he hurries up into the action .
the strangest thing is that the people we never expected to help us are the ones who did and those we thought would be the first ones to kill us were the ones to save us .
i think it just depends on someone 's nature or personality . if not so , then it is by god 's power .
i can not tell why they behaved like that .
then after the genocide you were fatherless ...
after the genocide , i was left with my older sister ; our first @-@ born . and then i found my younger sister and brother .
since i am currently the oldest son in the family , i took upon myself all the family responsibilities yet i can not even fulfill their needs .
as a result , i ended up growing up prematurely .
now i am considered as an old man at home ; i am the one who makes the decisions in the family . at my early age , i feel denied my freedom .
i do n't find time to enjoy life like i should have at my age ; things like playing around with fellow teenagers or do other fun things .
instead i spend my entire time worrying about things that actually seem impossible to me , problems of which solutions are not easy to find .
so , to you fis that an advantange or it is a disadvantage of the genocide ?
they are genocide disadvantages because whenever i think about it ... for example when i am in class ; sometimes i am absent @-@ minded , busy thinking about my problems while others are concentrating .
but if my older brother had survived , i would have relaxed a bit because he would be busy with family issues , as i also get busy with my studies .
not to mention if it was my father who had survived or any other older person in the family .
i know everything is as a result of the genocide .
i would have been able to use my time in class effectively rather than thinking about family problems while others are studying .
but now i am failing to concentrate in class and in the end i will fail in school . at the same time , i can not find a solution to my problems ; i can not meet my family 's needs .
eeh !
those are the consequences of the genocide that are affecting me .
do n't you get desperate at times ?
i feel desperate but only for the time when i am thinking about my problems . but when i meet friends i forget about it .
and then the feeling comes back during the holidays when i am at home seeing the situation in which my family is living .
i get so desperate because i see everything yet i can not improve anything .
does it disturb you to the extent of spending sleepless nights or getting headaches ?
do you ever miss your childhood ?
what would you want to be in the future or what is your goal or wish in life ?
what i wish , i do n't if i should call it a wish .
let me say first what makes me happy .
mostly it is to know that i have done something to help a genocide survivor .
it may be giving advice or helping with something .
however simple it may be , i am happy when i am the one who thought of helping and i actually did it ... i think i wish that all genocide survivors especially the young ones should be given the advantage of a scholarship because the old women who survived do not have much hope to live .
they are desperate and sometimes miserable but for us who are still young we can go to school , we can exchange ideas with different people .
also the government should continue financing farg so that those who were still kids when the genocide took place can continue their studies up to higher levels like we did .
maybe it 's difficult for us to adapt to this new life as we have the responsibility to take care of our young brothers and sisters .
that 's when we can come together as genocide survivors and help each other in an association such as aerg where one gets advice , which helps me to fulfill my responsibilities of taking good care of my brothers and sisters .
that 's what i wish for . i wish survivors would get a good life after their studies .
after achieving that unity , then we would organize ourselves and plan to do something together ; that is if we have the necessary material [ financial support ] .
what do you wish to do for your family ?
what i can do for my family ?
i am not sure , with the life i am leading now i can n't promise anything .
i hope to first finish school then look for a job and that 's when i will be able to help .
otherwise if i start promising now , it might stress me or depress me yet i will n't loose anything if i wait until i finish my studies , start working and then help my family .
what would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? what would you want them to know ?
what would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? what would you want them to know ?
when comparing the past to the present , what changes have you experienced in your personal life ?
maybe reconciliation will be possible among our descendants if we will tell them the truth and show them the right path .
however , reconciliation is impossible amongst us in this generation .
i can give an example ; someone can assure you that he pleaded guilty and accepted what he did .
but when you follow up the way he pleads guilty , you can hear him say things like @: so and so was killed by some attackers on such and such date , but i never participated in his murder .
they always plead guilty but never accept their personal role .
when someone is like that , it shows that he or she is more concerned about politics but do not really want to show his or her role .
then if such a person came to me asking for forgiveness , it would be impossible for me to forgive him or her .
they treat us like a ... i think reconciliation in our generation is very difficult .
what can you tell people who do n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ?
people who do n't agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
it depends on the context in which they deny it ; some people pretend not to know what happened , while others really do n't know what happened .
but to those who intentionally deny the genocide , all i can do for them is to take him to places like ntarama , bisesero , nyamata and other places such as gikongoro , which have genocide memorial sites .
and then after i would ask them only a single question @: "@ what do you think was the cause of their death ? was it a thunder that killed these people and brought them here ?
were they strong winds ?
were they floods ? or did they commit suicide ? @"
then i would wait to hear their answer .
they would n't get any answer especially when they are rwandans .
but if it is a foreigner , i guess he would be surprised and just keep quiet .
to someone who is still young , what do genocide memorial sites mean ?
memorial sites are very good .
because they are basics for our history . they will help us never forget what took place in rwanda . you have just asked me the question " what can you tell a person who does n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ? @"
i guess you heard that the answer was based on the memorial sites ; i told you that i would take such people to the memorial sites and ask them if those people committed suicide or if the bones are for decoration .
these memorial sites will be there for years and years .
our children will see them ; historians all over the world can come for their research and see what happened .
therefore , memorial sites to me as part of the young generation , especially as a genocide survivor , are there to remind us and make us never forget what happened .
it seems like you are fighting against forgetting about the genocide .
what would "@ forgetting @" mean to you ?
why are you really against forgetting ?
listen ... what it means to me , when you forget things especially bad things that happened to you , it means that what happened meant nothing to you . if you can forget your father 's death , your mother 's death , and your relative 's death , deaths that caused agony to the whole country [ rwanda ] , and rub out all your beloved ones from your brain yet you were left alone in this world , without anyone to talk to or to run to , to me that would be an unforgivable sin .
what can you tell those who do n't know rwanda ?
whenever i pass there , i change a bit and behave differently . i feel strange . it is as though i loose my humanity .
however , i do n't have a cruel heart , the heart to kill .
i do n't feel like talking to anyone .
i just say a prayer , no matter how short it is , i just say one word of thanksgiving to the lord .
but in case i see someone related to the militias at that time , i become aggressive .
sometimes i think of doing something horrible but because it is n't my nature i just get over it .
whenever i reach there , i remember all the bad things that happened to me and then i feel like doing some horrible acts but i just ignore that feeling because i naturally do n't have that nature .
i can never do that ...
and what do you think about the other lady ; your cousin 's wife ?
i normally do n't talk about that issue . in all the testimonies that i gave out , i never talked about her because i always get shocked when i remember her .
i always believe that i could have done something for her but i failed to it .
the way i left the pit is the way i would have got her out .
then maybe she would have been treated or something else would have been done ... but that is not what i did .
there was n't anybody to help me ; maybe if i had got someone , i would have asked him to help me save the lady .
most of the time , i dream about her and my young sister ; i always see their images .
even my two young sisters whom we do n't know how they were killed .
i always remember them .
last time when we were exhuming my brother 's remaining , we almost lost his bones among other bones [ mixed with my sister in law 's bones ] but i separated them immediately .
now we reburied them separately but next to one another .
at least now when i plant flowers on their graves , i feel better .
is this your first time to give a testimony ?
it is not my first time .
besides telling it to my friends , i have given a testimony twice before .
the first time it was at byimana where we were exhuming remainings of people .
many people were killed in that area and now we constructed a memorial site there on the behalf of the district .
i gave out my testimony the day we reburied them .
this is the second time .
the first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ?
the first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ?
how do you feel now as you talk about it ?
maybe a fellow survivor ; it is the only person we share the same problems but i can not tell it to any other person . and it can only happen when we talk and find ourselves with common challenges .
for example the members of aerg ; we sit with them and talk like friends .
freddy can testify this .
the first time we met ... we talked and we were free as though we were from the same family .
but telling it to other people or to those who committed the genocide seems too hard for me .
to you what does the term "@ survivor @" mean ?
what message can you give to the foreigners or rwandans of today or in the future ?
the message i can give them ... i would like to give a message to especially rwandans who do n't know rwanda .
because telling a rwandan about genocide is not very difficult .
although they ignore it [ genocide ] , they know about it .
but foreigners especially white people take things lightly .
they do n't consider this the way they are . but in actual sense , they shy away from the truth .
because they had cameras and some of them participated in the genocide . for example the belgians and those un soldiers of unamir together with others , they had all the information .
all i can tell them is ; when we say this , it is not a form of enjoying life .
when we say this ... consider the time i have spent here !
i am a student , i am surposed to be in class now with other students . i had to spend my time here instead of learning extra chapters in class !
i know it is very important to give out my testimony so that the whole world especially the foreigners would see it .
i think the genocide that took place in rwanda should be given its value .
although there is nothing they can do to help us as rwandans , they should just believe that there was genocide in rwanda and give it its value .
when we spend days talking about the genocide , we do n't say it for sale .
president paul kagame once talked about it . he said ; " those who say that we sell genocide , i wish they tell me how much is a kilogram or a litter of blood . @"
to you , what 's the importance of remembering and giving value to genocide ? what would you wish to be remembered forever ?
what i wish to be remembered is the massive innocent people that were killed .
now they would be helping the counntry and our country would develop like other countries .
therefore , forgeting the genocide is a big mistake . once you forget the genocide it seems like you do n't value human rights .
because you can never obey human rights yet you do n't accept so and so as a human being .
therefore , considering genocide means considering people as human beings and not animals . and respecting people as human beings .
that is all i can say .
do you want to add on anything ?
we still have twenty @-@ six minutes extra .
the additional information i have is for those who do n't know this country , a testimony to people who do n't acknowledge that there was genocide in rwanda .
what i can add on , i would first go back to the case of the survivors especially the youth because the old ones are too miserable to listen to this .
but young people especially the survivors i would give them my testimony saying that , "@ they should never despair . @"
we can not change the past .
i am not saying that we forget and reconciliate .
but we should not be taken up by out past .
but it does n't mean that we should forget the genocide , instead we should always think about it because it makes us strong .
remembering gives us power to fight against any other thing that would ever cause another genocide in rwanda .
we are the ones to give genocide its value .
if we do n't value it , no one else will .
if we do n't give out these testimonies , no one else will give them out . if we do n't fight for the construction of memorial sites , no one will ever stand up for their constuction .
it is our task to stand up for our rights .
we should get our freedom of living .
to live again .
this is the testimony i can give to the youth survivors .
thanks .
tell us your age ...
my age ... ?
i was born in 1954 .
well about the history of 1954 , i was still young , i was about four years old . i think i can only remember few things like when my family and i were migrating .
but what i remember is the war that took place in the 1961 ... 1963 in the range of that time .
even then we migrated while they were seizing and eating our cattle , burning our houses and still it was the hutus killing the tutsis .
they demolished the tutsi 's houses .
then other things that i remember well are the events of 1973 because then i was a wench .
still it was the hutu killing the tutsi .
they demolished tutsi 's houses and killed them .
some tutsis fled .
that time we fled to kamonyi church in gitarama [ in kamonyi district ] .
then they [ hutus ] said that the war should stop .
therefore , we went back to our stumbles and reconstructed the houses .
then we stayed there ... that was in 1973 .
the situation never improved , the hutus continued to mistreat the tutsis .
untill that period between 1980 and 1988 when tutsis were menaced so much by the hutus in areas like bugesera and kibirira .
generally , the hutus continued to torture the tutsis .
then in 1990 when the ikontanyi [ rpf army ] invaded the country , tutsis were subjected to serious torture ; they were killed , imprisoned accused of being traitors , others were killed , houses were burnt in all those areas of kibirira , bugesera and in the bagogwe in ruhengeri .
this continued up to 1994 when habyarima 's airplane crashed on its way from tanzania .
then they started killing the tutsis with all their effort saying that tutsis were responsible for habyarima 's death . "@ therefore , they [ tutsis ] have to pay for it , " they said .
with the help of soldiers together with the interahamwe who had been given enough training in bugesera and mutara , they were trained posible methods of killing people .
then tutsis died , they were killed ... these were the tutsis being killed .
and it was one clan killing the other .
it was a clan killing the other clan , it was n't like , ‘ a person had a grage with a fellow , ’ it was a certain clan that had been trained to kill the other clan .
therefore , one clan died .
and , they really killed them ; they killed them so painfuly with a lot of torture .
some were drowned in rivers and lakes ; others were thrown in latrines or pits .
until when the inkotanyi liberated this country and ceased the war and the killings .
and later they set up a law of arresting those who perticipated in the killings .
they were arrested ... those ones that we would see , we would report them .
but our primary desire is to see people being purnished accordingly .
a killer ... the culture of not punishing should be abolished completely . because during habyarimana 's regime no body would be punished over killing someone . a hutu would not be punished for killing a tutsi .
neither would he be imprisoned .
it was an earlier planned program and they all knew all about it .
all they did , they were prepared for it [ genocide ] , it was not a sudden event .
the most important thing is to set up a culture of punishing those who harassed others ... those who killed others .
they should be punished accordingly and in public for others to see and learn a lesson .
and another important thing is ; this history of the killings of the innocent tutsis , who died for no reason , should never perish .
not only my testimony but also everyone 's . it [ history ] should never be forgotten .
we should always remember it .
it must be written in books so that our grand children will be able to read and know what happened .
they should know the cause , who killed who ... they should know that the hutus killed the tutsis that time .
but they should punish those people accordingly so that the culture of not punishing stops .
that way , the habit of killing one another will stop .
even that one who had a thought of killing would stop because he or she knows she would be purnished for it .
i would like to ask you some few questions in order for us to fully understand what happened .
you told us that in 1959 you already existed but you were still young .
but you can tell us the little you remember about the way they attacked how it was in your area , how you fled or what happened to you .
just tell us in breif what happened during that time .
we fled .
i remember that in 1963 i was very young .
we fled after they attacked our home and burnt our houses .
we fled to a certain hill , which was a bushy .
we had a lot of cattle ; therefore we migrated with them .
however they demolished our houses though .
what was the name of that hill where you were living before migrating ?
eh ... we were living on a hill called ikibanda .
we left that place and went to some place beyond kinazi .
there was a forest called nyabusunzu . that time many tutsis gathered there because most of their houses were burnt at the same time .
they met there with their cows and their children .
some people [ tutsi ] went to bugesera and others went to sainte @- famille church .
in the past , people had been running to church on several occasions unlike in 1994 when people ran there and died from there .
even that time same thing happened and continued like that ; they attacked and killed , hit tutsis with club , some people died , and others fled to exile .
there was no other reason why people [ tutsis ] went to exile ; they were fleeing from the hutus , who were menacing them with in the country .
there is no time when a hutu stopped torturing a tutsi ever since 1959 up to 1994 .
it was always the hutu killing the tutsi .
do you know by names , anyone who was killed ? for example you can tell us that ; so and so , their houses were demolished and later they were killed ...
in our family ... ?
are you talking about the time in 1959 ?
yes between 1959 and 1963 , within that range ...
yes , some old men died .
though some went to exile and died there ; my brother died from tanzania .
he migrated to tanzania when he was already married with children . he lived there untill when he died .
and later , his wife and children came back ; they were three children and one of them was killed during the genocide from a place called mumena .
several people died ; they were killed .
and since it was long time ago , somethings are hard to recall them well .
but people died a lot .
when you ran to that hill , did you return home ?
well in 1973 , it was kayibanda still on power .
habyarimana was chief commander . i remember it was on the 28th feb 1973 , when they attacked our home village .
they burnt and killed many people .
that time they killed so many people . i had a brother @-@ in @-@ law whose shop was destroyed .
he escaped through a bush .
they tried to look for him but they never got him .
but his shop was already distroyed .
that time we fled and came to kigali in biryogo .
we spent there less that a month 's time .
then they made a patrol of capturing all the tutsis and take them to bugesera in maranyundo .
i guess you have ever heard about it ... i am among the people who were imprisoned in maranyundo .
even that time they made a patrol but it was just for getting the tutsis .
we realised it when we were in bugesera .
they came and transported us to bugesera in maranyundo in the bush .
they used trucks , min buses , and those big cars that transport beers from gisenyi [ from bralirwa ] .
therefore they gathered us there in t he muhima prison . by then it was a police . it used to be called commissariat .
when we reached in busera , they tricked us again ; they said to themselves that , "@ every department should bring its workers . @" then they took workers but only the hutu . the tutsi were left there . there were gentlemen and wenches ...
while still there ... meanwhile , you reached at some point and got married ... ?
yes , that was in 1973 . i got married in 1974 .
so you had a chance of getting children ?
yes , but one died and the father .
would you tell us briefly what happened in the period of party @-@ struggles , was your family tortured ?
during habyarimana 's party @-@ struggles ... ?
there was cdr , mrnd there was also another party , which was suppressed or discriminated against , because they considered it to be a tutsi 's party .
this party was called pl .
but the strongest and powerful parties in the country were cdr and mrnd .
we were oppressed and tortured very much .
after bucyana death , we were attacked and my husband was beaten .
they left knowing that he was died .
they robbed us ... by then we were living over there , near kabuga 's building .
but we were thrown out of our house and we started sleeping around like we did have where we belonged .
that was the beging of those tortures ; just from those parties .
for example whenever cdr would strike , people would be beaten ... i am telling you , people would die .
they used to have grenades .
therefore , they would throw grenades to places like shops where several tutsis would attend or drink beers .
for example there was a certain man , who lived in muhima and owned a boutique .
therefore , people were obliged to drink from kamanda 's boutique because if they went to cdr 's bars they would not get out still alive .
even if it were women like us , we would be so careful to buy something like sugar from there .
because if you accidentaly stepped on somebody you would be beaten .
even kamanda was one of the people who were being menaced . infact he was killed just of recent .
he was a young man not very mature ; he was n't even married .
generally they menaced people ... there is no single day when they stopped menacing people ; it is a long story .
therefore , kamanda 's shop was crached with a grunade by the cdr members .
whenever they would strike , they would kill people ; they would burn places with grunades .
never the less they would ambush people on roads . they would stub people with bayonets .
cdr was habyarimana 's political party , it was simillar to parmehutu of the past .
and finally they came to your home ... ?
and finally they came to your home ... ?
therefore , i took off throught the gakingiro road with my children .
i had a sister @-@ in @-@ law , she was at home with the kids ; the first time they attacked us , she jumped over and hid slightly below our home .
and , a certain lady who was living there hid her under her bed .
i continued and passed via the police station .
because , there at manumental ... there was a horrible roadblock that nobody would escape .
therefore i said to myself , "@ i rather pass via the police and if there are policemen , they better shot me rather than being hacked . @"
therefore , i proceeded and the policemen saw the kids .
then they ased them , "@ you kids , where are you going ... ? i was carrying another baby at my back .
so , they again asked , "@ are you inyenzi ! @"
but the kids denied that , they were n't inyenzi though the policemen were seeing them .
then they asked again , "@ is that your mother ? @"
[ they were reffering to me ] i said , "@ yes , i am their mother . @" he mockingly laughed and said ; "@ go and die from other people 's hands . @"
we continued together with the children approaching the market .
then we met young interahamwe militia who had knives ; the oldest was about 14 years .
they asked me ; " who are you ? @"
i replied , "@ i am a human being . @"
"@ listen to the tutsi arrogance !
do you think we can not see that you are a human being ? @" one of them retorted !
"@ we are asking if you are a tutsi or a hutu ? @"
he explained .
then i told them that , "@ i did n't know !
whatever you want call me that . and , do what you think is fine with you . @"
one of the young militia showed me his knife , which was stained with blood .
and then he asked me , "@ do you see this ... ?
what is it ? @"
i replied him that , "@ it is a knife . @"
"@ do n't you see the blood stained on it ? @"
he asked once again .
then i told him that i was seeing it .
he went on and asked me , "@ do you see a cross ? @"
"@ yes i do . @"
i replied .
"@ do you see others who are lying t here ? @"
"@ yes i do @" i relpied .
"@ i am going to take you there right now . @"
he assured me .
then i told him that , "@ do as you wish . @"
meanwhile , whenever you would be in such people 's hands , there was nothing much to do .
you would just become so desperate and fear would disappear . even those who died , they died strong with no more fear .
you would simply be sure that you were in the hell 's hands .
no one would come for your rescure or listen to your sorrows . one would just say a simple prayer , "@ god , take my life as you wish . @"
suddenly a certain policeman who used to come to our home appeared .
then i begged him , "@ nkyesha ! they are going to kill me with my children ... @" "@ who are those ... ? @"
he asked .
and , as he was asking , the first boy disappeared and another one followed , in no time we were left only two of us .
it was that policeman , who took me to nyarugege commune and we stayed there .
however , the next get to the commune was , seized by the soldiers [ the presidential guard unit ] .
they retreated to nyarugenge after the inkotanyi had chased them from kimihurura where they had suffered defeat in the battle with rpf soldiers .
when we reached there , we found when they had siezed that gate and the house was full of their wives and children .
i remember we were many people , who had got to seek refuge there .
some were coming from those ends of kivugiza , cyahafi , muhima ... we were very many about one hundred and eighty [ 180 people ] they refused to allow us in saying that , we should go and join those nyenzi [ cockroaches ] .
we spent three days outside the district office . in those days the militias and ex @-@ government soldiers used to come slaughter people and others were kidnapped and taken to undisclosed destination . in that period there was a seminar being conducted at kabusunzu which brought together people from all provinces , and it was by people of all ethnic groups . those of them who had national identity cards , which show that they were hutus , were given transportation and other necessary facilities . while as those who were identified as tutsis , were put in buses , and brought to the place where we were for execution .
in a group of interahamwe who came to kill us , there was a taxi driver called kadahwema , a notorious killer from gisenyi .
who wore a military uniform and was armed with a gun .
they killed many people mostly men and the rest of us were taken to gakinjiro where we were put on a line and started killing men .
after all the men were killed , our turn came .
but before they had killed any of us ( woman ) one of the interahamwe milicious from butaro said ; "@ as you are going to finish them all , who shall escort our parent habyarimana after on the day of his burial ?
i order now , do n't kill those ladies .
take them back . @"
that was how we left that pit hole with several other people we were together .
therefore , we stayed there waiting for our fate to come ; each day one would think it was the last da .
believing that if you survive at night , you would die at noon .
we lived in such dilema till when the rpf soldiers invaded and liberated us . they took us in saint andre [ secondary school ] and that was the end of war .
they stopped those killing but the perticipants should be purnished accordingly .... as an exemplary .
and secondly , the genocide history should be maintained and we should never forget .
let all the coming generations ever in life learn that "@ there was genocide in rwanda . @" they should read it from books , hear from the tales of witnesses who will be present by then , but never let the history die .
because we must keep remembering our beloved ones who died and remember what happened .
this is a story that i was told by the people who survived from chk hospital . that there were several injuries in chk that were injured like him .
that they used to only cover them without applying any medicine .
later there came another notorious killer called kamashini , who took them away .
he was the one responsible for all killings that took place at chk hospital .
so he took them to kigali military camp , where they were chopped with bayonettes and their eyes were scooped out before thier death . that is part of what i heard .
my husband is among those who died from chk and he was exhumed and reburied in rebero .
that is what happened .
and about my died child ; my baby died and it was buried in gakingiro .
it was still young fed on breast milk .
therefore , it died of hunger due to stavation .
that is all .
what about others in your family ?
another person of whom i remember , they were not living in kigali . but i remember my niece who lived in cyahafi . they were dumped in a latrine .
their bodies were exhumed by ibuka and taken to gisozi memorial site for reburial .
their remains are in their final resting @-@ place at gisozi together with others .
it is my niece and her husband and their two children .
they were dumped in their own latrine .
other people ...
do n't you remember how they were killed ?
were they hacked to death or ... ?
yes of course they are there .
they were hacked and others were chopped with knives . in fact , the one who was the chief of interahamwe in their home area was arrested . unless he admit his crimes and get released .
or maybe he is already released ... in cyahafi ... [ she gulped ] i do n't often go there .
do you have some of your family members that you managed to exhume and reburry officially ?
no .
except my husband who i knew where he was buried and went there .
i also had a sister who lived in gitarama , in musambira district . it was her husband who organised for her reburial ceremony .
others were in butare but they have n't been exhumed becausedf no one knows exactly where they were dumped after being killed .
however we know they were killed in nyamure . in nyamure district there was a big number of people who died there . i realised that when i attended a burial ceremony there .
however i can n't tell if my people 's remains were among those we buried that day .
i can n't even guess if they were in another side .
i do n't know .
you told us that the inkontanyi helped you ... they took you to saint andre but can you tell us how you left that place and your life experience in sait andre ... ?
no , i would be lying if i said yes .
but still there are some who have been traumatized and one of my nieces who is handicapped by bullets and has an amputated arm ; she was shot and she watched her arm born jumping out of her body through the muscles .
so she was also terribly affected by the genocide
do you live with her ?
no , she lives in nyamirambo at her father 's place .
her father too survived .
after the genocide when the inkotanyi liberated the country , there were several government bodies that came up , whicha emphasis much on unity and reconciliation policies .
form your personal point of view , do you thing it will work out for the hutus who perticipated in the genocide to reconciliate with the tutsi survivors ?
by the way , the issue of unity and reconciliation is not easy .
those ideas of unity and reconciliation are more like ... sincerely , reconciling with some one who killed your people , is next to imposible ; where would one gain that spirit in order to reconcile ?
i wonder what would have happened , for such people to reconcile . i can n't even imagine the beginning of all the act of reconciliation .
a person can reconciliate with one whom they talk .
let 's say ; one can tell the other that , "@ please i am sorry !
i insulted you . forgive me . @"
but i can n't imagine someone who killed more than twenty people of your family members , standing infront someone asking him or her to reconcile . how possible would that be ?
it is a problem maybe there is a way they are planning to do it , which i can n't imagine .
so , do you thing that the commission in charge of unty and reconciliation will reach its goals easily ?
you are talking about that commission of unity and reconciliation ... ?
that commission ... maybe it will succeed , who knows ?
though it will require them a lot of time . it seems too impossible to achieve their goals in a short time .
because , it is astonishing how those who perticipated in the genocide [ interahamwe malicious ] still have strong hatred and whenever they see you , they try to show you that they still hate you .
so , how do you expect reconciliation to take place since he or she , who did those things has more grievance than the one he or she hurt ?
there are other organisations concerned with the rwandan genocide , which are non @-@ governmental .
plus several other commissions around the contry like that of unity and reconciliation .
and there are also judicially commissions called gacaca . i guess , are in operation .
what can you say about them ?
do think they are going to help in purnishing those who perticipated in the genocide ?
in order for our country to experience development in the future , all rwandans should put their hands together and try to build their nation .
but this shall be achieved only if they try to eliminate the habit of not purnishing .
whoever that has plans of doing bad deeds especialy killings because it was one of the deeds that led into distruction of our nation .
should be punished in public where everybody will be seeing in order to frighten those who have the same plans .
because they will know that , if they do the same thing , they will be treated in the same way .
therefore , if they stop that habit [ not punishing ] the country will be built and will become pleasing .
therefore , in order for our contry to be pleasing , the young ones will have to continue in the line of development ; they will have to finish their studies and improve our contry .
first of all , they have to know that the killers still have the intentions of killing .
therefore , they have to first sencitize them and teach them that , they have to live with others peacefully without killing .
fir example those people in gikongoro whom they sentenced to death .
i hope they will shut them in open . and i believe that , if they do it in public , i guess in gikongoro there will be no more killings .
because no one can see his fellow being shot on a tree and then he goes a head with his wrong plans that would take him to the same tree .
therefore , eliminating the habit of ont punishing is the best . if they do so , our country will develop .
because those are one of the things that distablise genocide survivors . because when we had about what took place in gikongoro , we were all afraid .
we thought the same thing would happen to us ...
another thing i would like to ask you ; this is your personal testimony as a mature person .
and your own children plus your grandchildren will see this testimony because it will be kept in the appropriate place for the future .
therefore , according to your life experience ... the hard times you experienced , definitely there must have been a way you found yourself out of it .
maybe sometimes your parents would tell you to do this or that in order to defeat some tough situations .
in brief , please tell us the advice you would give to the young children .
especially your children and those that will generate from them ; they will be your grand children .
in general what is your advice to the children of this nation ? what should they do in order to become responsible people in the future ?
the advice i can give to young children ... first of all they should learn how to love .
the first thing id to love .
sencondly they should put much effort in education because there will be no bright future for them if they do n't go to school .
they should study and love each other .
they should avoid hatred among them in all their lifetime on earth .
because where there is love , nothing misses .
therefore , the youngones should love each other . i guess even those kids who became interahamwe ; it was due to their elders .
but if the children experiences love , and be taught about love rather than hate .
and avoid seeing their fellows and say , "@ look at that tutsi . @"
like they used to learn in the past . in the past .
tutsi children used to believe that they were ment to be menaced .
like during the genocide , some children would tell the killers that , "@ please forgive me , i will never be a tutsi again . @"
just imagine , those were very young children but they already knew that they were menaced because they were tutsis .
therefore , hatred should be up rooted and they should only keep in mind that there are only rwandans .
and , every human being has a right to live .
no one should be killed .
that is the most important thing for the young ones .
if they love each other , one would be knowing that , "@ i have to study for my own life . @"
and the other one would say , "@ i want to do this and that . @"
if he or she is good at business , then he or she should run business .
if one is good at cultivatng , then she or he should mean business and cultivate . but forgeting that habit of having second thoughts about his or her fellows .
that is my advice for children .
hope that is the advice to the children in general . now can you give any piece of advice to the children who were affected by the genocide ? what advice can you offer them about how to improve on them selves ?
in the flame of development ... children who experienced genocide were left in misery without parents .
they were left homeless , they should be strong and patience and , mind about their education .
i know there is no good life , their heads had frozen . because , when a child has no parents , life seem to be meaningless .
therefore they should be strong because there is no alternative .
if they come across their fellows with the same problems , they should befriend one another and talk about their problems .
if it is a parent , she will tell them that , "@ my children come we chat a bit . @"
ever , when you meet with people you experienced the same problem ; you fell relieved just because you found someone to tell about your problems , someone who understands it .
that is what i can advise them . children who faced that problem should love and know each other .
if they meet challeges , they should learn how to adress those problems to the older people who were once in the same situation .
because grown @-@ ups know how to comfort children . you can tell a child that , "@ be strong there is no alternative . @"
and if you are neighbours , then you try to visit each other .
that helps the children to know that there are some other people who faced the same problems like they did .
that is the piece of adice that you have passed to the children .
what about those who perticipated in the genocide ?
what message can you give them ?
the perpetrators ?
i wonder what to tell them ; i can not tell them that , "@ never do it again . @" because if they had a chance they would repeat it today .
most of them do n't even agree that they perticipated in the genocide .
they deny it yet you witnessed them doing those deeds .
therefore , which kinds of advice can one give such a person ?
instead they should repent for their sins in they feel it down inside their hearts ... if their hearts haunts them .
they should try to say the truth and ask for forgiveness as they say . they should repent before god because even those they killed were god 's creatures .
therefore they should repent before god because if they do so , they will be able to ask me to forgive them .
and i will be sure that if we met somewhere , they would never hurt me .
i just do n't know the kind of advice i should give to such people .
normally when someone ever faced such scandles , always there is an event or something from his or her past , which he or she remembers and wishes to see again in order to gain peace of mind .
for example ; in your marriage life , there were some words that your husband used to say to you and those words made you feel so good .
it maybe your children ... the one who died ... or your neighbours .
personally , what do you remember that gives a lot of sorrows more than other things yet it was as a result of the genocide ?
personally , when i get a lot of problems , let us say ; i have children who go to school , then you see them missing books , pens or a uniform ... for example , primary school children we pay their fees .
and then you see your child coming back home that the teacher has chased them because you never sent him money .
i remember ... that is when i remember , when life becomes hard .
some times i get worried , "@ what will they eat tomorrow ? what will take before going to school ?
or what will they have for dinner ? @"
then i say , "@ if they had a father , would n't have been this worried . @"
well i am not alone , it happens to every parent who faced that problem of genocide .
in order to avoid those feelings though you faced those problems .
how do you fight againest those feelings ? what do you do personally ? the reason why i ask you such questions is , there are some people who may learn from you after they have seen your testimony .
the way you stand in tough situations may be a leason to her of him .
this is what you do to avoid such feelings ; you think about the orphans around you ... in that house , there are about four or five orphans who are living togeher .
it means that , the oldest of all acts as a parent to the rest and she or he is taken to be in charge of the whole home .
then you reflect their example to your life and say , "@ how come those orphans survive ? @"
and again , you think about your fellow survivors and ask yourself , "@ how are they surviving ? @"
by considering other people 's lives , it will help you . we live together in the same residence for the survivors , but it is useful for us because we are neighbbouring each other yet we have the same problems .
therefore , you refer to your fellows and ask yourself , "@ how come they are still strong ?
let me try and be strong too . @"
that is all that can help someone .
but , if you are lonely you may spend your entire life in problems .
otherwise , when you are challeged by problems , you join others and laugh , share a drink and dedicate the rest to god .
that is what helps us most of the time .
do n't you have something to add on the testimony you have given us ?
what message can you leave for the people who will see this testimony in the future ... ?
it may be a message of comfort to any one of your wish ... it may be a testimony ?
the message i can give to all those who faced the genocide is to be strong .
though all the time we have been strong .
ten years is a big thing !
yet no one has ever run mad or looking funy .
therefore , we have to keep it up and remain strong .
because as years go by and as far as our children are growing and going to school , our problems will go on reducing .
ten years have passed and in few days to come there will be an occasion of commemorating for the ten years that have passed after the genocide , which took place in rwanda .
all other nations admmitted that there was genocide in rwanda .
does it have any meaning to you , hearing that other countries agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
i was very happy .
because some of the things that used to hurt us ... for example there are some foreigners who used to come here in avega .
and they would ask permission to meet us because they realy wanted to see those people who were victimised by the genocide .
the jews also came to see us ; among those who came , there was a lady ... i do n't remember other people who came with her but some time ago , they also experienced genocide like we did .
one of them told us that , "@ my grandparents are victims of the holocaust .
according to what we saw and heard , we thought that in rwanda we would find when people had gone crazy . we thouhght that , it would be very hard to get close to you .
but surprisingly you look good !
you are still able to wear a smile ! @"
and for sure , she was astonished .
however , there was another person who came and told us that , "@ we do n't agree that what happened here was genocide .
according to what we heard that happened here , we do n't believe it was genocide . @" therefore , that denial of the genocide would terribly hurt us because we would n't imagine why they would denay genocide yet it happened !
so what amases us is the fact that all nations agreed and realised that genocide happened in rwanda .
it is so amasing .
and among the things that keep me strong , is commomerating the genocide all the time .
have you finished ?
so they started beating him yet he was already lame as a result of previous beatings .
people used to tell us about those days but for us it was just history , we never thought of something like the genocide we saw would ever happen .
probably in the same way our children will be taking it as history .
later life went on as it used to be .
we grew up until the 1990s ... in 1992 in bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the hutu were burning the tutsi 's properties .
by then we resided in ntarama , which was out of [ ntarama ] town .
so it started from the side of ngenda and gashora because many hutus resided in those areas .
the area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration .
it was a place where they used to take all the tutsis who had migrated . they used to construct houses close to each other ; the tutsi , neighbouring each other in that area , inhabited almost all houses .
the killings had not yet started in our neighbourhood .
instead , they started from the side of mayange and musenyi . areas that had many hutus ‘ abamere ’ residing there . some of the hutus living there were locals and some had there .
we were lucky they would just stop in nyamata and did not reach our village .
but we were well informed on what was going on and the people in the attacked areas would flee from their homes to our home village .
life went though it was so tough , we always used to hear rumours of hutu burning tutsi properties .
in short , we grew up knowing that there is no sympathy between the hutu and tutsi .
we grew up knowing that hutus are enemies of tutsis . in fact , our parents used to tell us , "@ dear children , hutu are bad people .
look at the kind of life we are living and yet we used to be rich .
we used to own cattle and so many other things but now we are poor , we do not own anything . this is not the life we were meant to live .
we are like this just because of the hutu . @"
we did n't have any hope of living with the hutu in community ; i do n't know why maybe it was due to what every government that was in power subjected us to .
we could hardly believe it would one day come to an end .
we always used to wonder how it would all and end and the final answer came in 1994 .
we were at home on the 7th of april 1994 . at night we heard that the president 's helicopter had crashed .
my brother came in screaming , "@ we are all dead . i heard that habyarimana is dead . @"
i was still very young ; i was n't mature enough to understand issues concerning the war .
i carelessly said , " oh , if he is dead then we are finally going to get some peace . @"
he replied to me , "@ those are your wishes .
all i can assure you is we are going to die . @"
we kind of joked about it . the following day came but we did n't have any problems until the night fell .
the next day we started hearing terrible rumours of houses being burnt here and there .
i think it was four days after the death of habyarimana that the tutsis living in nyamata started fleeing ; you would hear people saying , "@ listen !
things are getting worse here ! we have met people fleeing their homes . @"
i wondered why but i heard some people saying that because of the plane crash and habyarimana 's death , there is no way there could be peace in the country .
people were confused ; they were moving up and down .
they would accuse each other to be cowards .
some would go to nyamata while others were coming to ntarama .
and things went on like that for a while .
in nyamata , things were getting worse as days went by . the nyamata church witnessed horrible shootings and killings .
the survivors ran back to where they had come from .
all the people [ tutsi ] in nyamata and other areashad been killed .
therefore , they started attacking the remaining areas .
so , they reached home ; i mean my parents ' home .
by then several people had reached at home because ; we lived well somewhere like ... as one could be living over there ... it is a place called kayenzi ; when you are crossing towards nyamata .
by then they had n't attacked us ; they could just pass by crossing over to nyamata .
so they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there .
they decided to try there .
my uncles and aunts with other neighbours were living across the valley so they came and scattered themselves in the neighbouring houses .
they would spend one or two days then things would worsen again .
one day , i do n't remember which day but it had been two weeks since we were in that situation and the interahamwe [ perpetrators ] had finished all people in nyamata .
they had killed people in kayumba forest and killed everyone who was in church .
they had killed everywhere else and the next place was my home village .
i remember some people saying , "@ the attackers have come through the coffee plantation @"@ , which was slightly below our home .
so i was wondering , i could n't imagine things such as killings , i though they were impossible .
people were screaming , "@ they have come . @"
and then they took off to the ntarama church through the forest .
those who were still able to defend themselves with bows and spears fought them .
at times they were able to defeat the interahamwe and they would get a rest and go back home .
the interahamwe realized that they were not going to defeat the resistors with no guns .
they said there were certainly ‘ inyenzi ’ among them [ the resistors ] .
while fleeing , the resistors used to try and fight back the interahamwe but they started loosing courage as they were seeing about ten , twenty of them being killed , they started scattering .
the strong guys fled towards gitarama and kabwayi , there remained very few and helpless people .
my brother was among those who managed to run .
he came home and told us [ that is when we were still alive ] , "@ now things are really bad .
we are defeated .
we can not defend ourselves anymore and they have killed most of us . @"
he told us , "@ they have killed so and so and so and so , who were the strongest men amongst us . @" he went on and said , " everyone should now find his own way . @"
he said so while preparing to live .
then , i asked him , "@ where are you going now ? @"
he replied , "@ we are going to look for a safer place where to take refuge . @"
i again asked , "@ will you not be killed there ? @"
he said he did n't know .
he went on and said " bye for now . if i happen to die ... and if i survive we shall meet again . @"
that was the last words we heard from him .
so he walked away and left us .
things had started getting worse on our side .
we used to be comforted by the fact that they would fight them back but they had now left us all .
at around the 10th or so everyone was minding his or her own life the day when all people went out of their homes , a group of attackers came from the coffee plantation that was in the valley below our home and everybody was gone .
i was the only one left there .
thinking i could not die , i decided to stay there .
and then my mum called me and told me that we were not going to die there alone that we should leave .
however , some elderly men and women who were not capable of fleeing decided to stay and be killed there .
we left running and reached a small forest that was slightly below our home . then we heard the perpetrators in our cattle we had left home .
they hacked them and the people we left home .
i heard them hacking them [ the elderly people they had left home ] .
we hid in a bush near home because they were already coming near us .
first they hacked the men and meanwhile , we run to the sector 's offices at the ntarama church .
but even as we were running , we heard some of them behind us saying , "@ they passed here .
there they are . @"
and others entered the bush to search for us but luckily they found properties such as suitcases , bags and many others that people had hidden there .
we heard them telling each other , "@ hey !
i discovered some treasures here . @"
so as they were concentrating on what they found we found a way to the sector in ntarama at the church and that 's how we managed to survive that day .
in fact , that was the day the war in nyamata toughened because all the survivors fled to the schools .
that is the day they killed my mum and dad and all the people who had hid home .
they killed around 20 people .
we preceded to the sector . when we reached at the sector ... at the school ... sorry , at ntarama church .
while we were at the school after 3 days , came a certain group of attackers called ‘ simusiga ’ [ meaning i can not leave him [ the tutsi ] behind ] .
it was on the 15th of april 1994 . the group of attackers came in many buses .
sometimes they used to come and when they were pushed back , they would go back saying that the inyenzi were in the swamp and that they had guns .
actually two of habyarimana 's soldiers [ the presidential guard ] had come to kill us and two of the resistors took their guns and used them to defend themselves .
whenever the interahamwe came towards the swamp they would hear the guns and then they would say there are inyenzi in the swamps .
so they went and called for the buses .
you remember the attack of nyanza ?
the buses , which came are the one that came to kill in bugesera .
that was the day i was hacked .
when those buses reached nyanza , they found that they [ the other interahamwe ] were killing people .
therefore they said , " keep on finishing the ones ; we are going to reinforce the bugesera people .
the buses came straight to the school building where we were hiding , they really killed many people only few were left .
but for us who were near the swamp , that is where they found us .
some old people committed suicide saying that they survived the machetes of 1959 and that the machetes of 1994 could not kill them .
they dived into the water and were taken away .
people who committed suicide were more than those who were hacked .
others said , "@ let us die like men .
committing suicide is a sin @"@ .
one would say , "@ lets me go and hide . @"
that day i went and hid in the bush that was near the swamp .
i ran into the bush and immediately the interahamwe ran after me .
that day it had not rained .
at around mid @-@ day , when the sun was shining bright , the interahamwe came and killed many people .
even my cousin who was slightly older than me .
but we were not hiding together ; i do n't know where she was hiding just near by , we also lost her .
i found out that they hacked me ; i did not know when i was hacked .
but i guess i was hacked at around 4 o'clock or ehh ... at around mid @-@ day .
that is when they hacked me .
then i touched myself and saw blood .
in my heart , i was wondering if it was possible that they had cut me and i was still alive .
i always used to imagine how they would one day bring a machete and hack me .
i did not know how i would react .
they hacked me on the exact day i had thought about it .
i was n't sure i should hide in a sorghum plantation .
i just kept on running .
at some point , i penetrated another bush where the perpetrators found me and started to hack me .
i finally left that bush at around 6.00 o'clock in the evening when the perpetrators were gone and the villagers going home .
maybe it was when fresh air [ the wind ] blew on me that i gained back my consciousness and heard people moving around .
unknowingly , i started calling .
but maybe those people thought that i was with perpetrators . instead of coming close to see , they ran away .
and a certain person came and said , "@ oh no , mudahogora has been hacked look at how she is hurt ! @"
at that time people were running for his or her own life .
when people would see you in such condition ... you can imagine what i was looking like , considering the way you see me now with these scars .
i looked like a dead body with blood all over in the face .
others would say , " she is taking her last breath she has no life in her . @"
i was with my sister 's child who was 3 years old and we had hid together in the bush .
when i opened my eyes , i saw the child seated besides me .
but he was not hurt at all .
actually they did nothing to him although he later on died . i was the only one who had remained with him but i could n't help him to get something to eat .
he developed anemia and died ; he was sitting with eyes wide open just besides me .
i watched him for a while , wondering what would happen to him .
by chance , a merciful woman who lived in that area came and put him on her back and carried him away .
i stayed there alone ; everyone had gone .
no one could bother to carry me out of there .
i tried both legs and found that i had some little strength left in them but they were injured .
i knew when the wounds are still fresh ; it was possible to move around .
the only risk was that i could suddenly fall due to over bleeding .
so i tried walking and it worked . you can guess that by then , the pain had not started yet so i started running following them .
i was avoiding to be left in the bush alone , so i took off .
the people i was meeting were wondering how far i would be able to run .
everybody run , i was left behind .
i remembered that when the interahamwe came back and found you still alive , they had to finish you . i survived that day .
i pulled my self up to the school buildings but all my brothers had fled to gitarama .
i was left with my older sister , the second born in our family .
the rest had been killed ... my third brother as well .
so at the school there were still some survivors .
they had seen how intense the war had become and they said that we should start sleeping in the swamp because in the school we would be found out and killed .
the often used to come to the school and break down the pots we were using for cooking and take the mattresses and everything .
when we reached there , there is a certain uncle of mine who said , "@ look how injured she is , we can n't live her alone here .
because once they find her here they will simply finish her up in torture .
so let 's take her . @" we used to have some hutu neighbours whose houses were in the centre in a place called bisigara .
when the war became tough , those people went to help their fellow hutu and left their houses covered with banana leaves on the doors .
so that when perpetrators came they would not destroy those houses .
then my uncle said that they should carry me to one house of their houses [ belonging to the hutu ] where there was a banana leaf on the door , no one would enter there .
he said god would take care of the rest .
that is how it happened ; they took me there and the rest of the people in the school had all left and went to hide in those houses that were still remaining [ the houses with banana leaves ] .
they used to sleep in those houses , although they were very scared that they might come and kill them .
anyway i do not know the kind of god that worked wonders in him ; he never hurt me .
instead he went and brought me some juice . i could not hold anything .
so , he held it for me and i swallowed big sips ; i had spent weeks without eating anything .
later he told me that he is going to get me some drugs .
three days after he left the rpf [ inkotanyi ] troops came .
i only saw him on that day , the people who inhabited that area too .
then i started wondering if maybe the people who used hide in that house saw the interahamwe entering the house .
in fact , when the inkotanyi troops came , they first passed into the swamp and told them to cross over to nyamata .
that was the reason why they never came back to those houses .
they immediately went where they were told to go .
as they were living , they told the inkotanyi that they were some of their people who are terribly injured but still alive .
they told them we were hiding in those houses .
then the inkotanyi said , "@ no , that is none of your business , it 's our work .
just do what we are asking you to do . @"
therefore , that is how they left ; i could n't see them anywhere that night .
then i said to myself , "@ all people have died . i am the only one remaining . @"
so the next morning the wife of the gardener came to me and said , "@ do you know what happened ? all the interahamwe are gone and the inkotanyi have come . @"
i said , "@ do n't say that !
everybody has died and you are saying that the interahamwe are gone . @"
then she explained to me , "@ no , they did not die .
they just took them . @"
then she asked me if she should carry me to the roadside ... because there were other injured people , who were actually more injured than me [ on the road ] .
she said , "@ you should join others and not remain behind alone . @" i accepted and she walked me to the road .
i spent the night there but they did not come that night .
however , they came the following morning at around 10.00 o'clock .
then they asked , "@ is anybody in here ? @"
that lady replied , "@ yes . @"
when they saw us they were very shocked at how injured we were . @"
she ran away because her husband 's relatives wanted to kill her .
then all the hutus had ran away towards kibungo ... kibungo sector ; i do n't know if you know it or hear about it .
therefore , that is when she came and asked me if i was aware of what had happened .
meanwhile , i thought everybody had died and that i was the only survivor .
she asked me , "@ why are you still here ? @"
"@ what do you expect me to do ? @"@
, i replied then she told me that the inkotanyi took up the rest to nyamata .
"@ nobody is remaining in this sector .
even the interahamwe are running way . @"
she assured me .
then i told her that i was not able to join them . she suggested to help me walk up to the road .
"@ the inkotanyi will never see you if you remain here @"@ , she said .
it was in the evening beginning to get dark ; it was some minutes passed six p.m. then she said , "@ i guess they will n't come at this time because it is late , but they may come in the morning .
make sure they find you there . @"
then she helped me walk up to a certain house .
in that house i found several other kids , who were in the worst condition compared to me ; some were dying , others did n't have legs and could n't move . others had started rotting from there .
in brief , when i reached there , i seemed to be the strongest around .
yet i too was already desperate that my arms had started rotting ; they were weak , i could n't lift an arm to any angle .
it took us about ... about four hours to get there .
then we heard people walking around , asking if there could be anybody inside the house .
they hit the door and came in .
they first saw me because i was the only one who was in better conditions than the others because my legs had not been hacked .
others were horribly injured . some were hacked around the neck , on the legs , on the head and the arms as well .
two of them were dying due to weeks of hunger and thirst , since those dead bodies lying around .
then he asked if there was anybody who could try and join others .
but later he realized that no one was able to walk .
then he asked me if i could try and walk but i said , "@ no i can n't @"@ .
and then he sent that lady to nyamata to bring some people and stretchers to carry us .
but when she left , she did not come back . she was afraid of her husband ; he was a hutu and a perpetrator .
actually she was praying she would find a way to join her people , she did not have anywhere to pass .
the soldiers did not spend much time there because they were looking around for those who were seriously hurt and were unable to move , and that day we spent the night there . they were meant to help the people who were in the swamp , people were asking for water , but i was not of any help to them . the following day they fortunately came to rescue us starting from the badly hurt ones . they went picking up all the casualties , they gathered all of us and divided us into different groups according to our condition . they then carried us at nyamata hospital where they were taking all casualties . when i arrived there at nyamata , we found life had changed . you could not recognize anyone ; the only person i knew was my brother but he also later on joined the army . when inkotanyi reached nyamata all young men joined the army .
i stayed in the hospital , they treated me but i was in a lot of pain because my bone was badly broken , the sores were rotten they were about one month old so they had to clean it , give us medicine and dress the wounds . then after two months we got well and i continued to live in nyamata . so many people were passing by but i could not find any of my relatives , all my aunts who were there had been killed . i started thinking of what to do , and where to go . there was one lady i used to know , she was still with her mother and brother , and then she invited me to stay with her and said that they will see how things would turn out .
we stayed together for a while then in july people started going back to their homes , i was asking myself what i would do next .
i really needed to know news from my brother but found from people that he had joined the army because he was told that i was dead .
but my aunt was also living there , my older sister used to live with her .
she died before the war , and we all went to rwampara to mourn her .
the whole family came to bury katumba , i was with my brother , but he went back and i stayed there .
i went on tuesday and the president died on wednesday .
i had just spent one night then the war started .
the whole family was there , waiting to end the mourning ... so i decide to come to kigali to see if there could be any survivor i can see since in bugesera there was none .
there was one man who had come from bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at rwampara , i found that one of my aunts was still there .
that is when i started gaining some hope since at least i was getting someone to stay with .
we stayed together until she died in the year 2000 .
we lived together until that time and a few of my cousins were also there . i was able to find some people who had survived .
my life went on like that .
i think that is all about my life during genocide .
can you continue telling us even the life after the genocide and who did you live with ?
after the war i did not continue to study .
i spent most of my time at the hospital treating this hand as it was still paining me .
dr nyaruhirira was on an attachment in south africa .
he came back and he is the one who treated me and i got well .
later on , i tried to run after the organization ‘ kanyarwanda ’ , they were the ones who had taken me there and i was operated ; they changed the position of my arm bone it was not shaped like this .
then later on , those children had no one to look after them , so that is why i did not go back to school .
q ...
meanwhile , i got a job at "@ acrg mpore @" [ it is an association ] . i was earning some little money , it was enough for me to feed those children .
afterwards their uncle who came from abroad took them .
then i gave birth to my own child , she is now two years old .
you have told us how you lived before the war , how you were treated in the society due to your ethnic or things like that ... what do you think is the difference between @: life before the war [ genocide ] and life after the war ?
there is a difference . because before the war people were scared .
wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation .
maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing .
but in general , there is a big difference .
life nowadays is not the same as that before the war .
do you try to live with all types of people or do you feel closer to certain people ? do believe you can live with all people or there are only a certain type of people you can live with .
i mean people you can discuss the issues related to the genocide .
can you discuss genocide issues with anybody ?
of course not .
sincerely , you can not discuss genocide problems ... that problem ... a problem you share with someone else , you can not talk about it with someone you do n't share it .
there are those you fell free with because you have the same problems , but ... for example @: the way i tell it to a survivor who was here in rwanda is not the same as the way i tell it to a person who came from exile .
i can tell my story to a survivor because i know we have something in common .
it is like talking to someone you do n't share the same language , it is never the same as talking to that one you have it in common ... this is just an example .
what do you think about the families of those who murdered your family ? do they try to show you any ... i am asking you this because i would like us to talk about unity and reconciliation .
is there any way you collaborate with the families of those who killed your people , to the extent where you can talk with them ?
i simply consider it as an impossible issue .
how can one reconcile with a person who ... well , since there is no alternative , if he comes to you and ask for forgiveness you may forgive him .
it is the same as those who say that , in gacaca courts people admit their crimes and then are forgiven .
but do you think they say it from the bottom of their hearts or is it so they may be forgiven ? that is why for me unity and reconciliation is impossible .
there is a new government policy of asking the survivors to go round in the prisons and sensitize the killers to admit what they did and report themselves .
do you support that idea ?
never , i can not handle it ! i can not manage to do that ; i am a 100 % against it .
let 's go back a bit before the genocide .
some people we met told us that there was an ethnic problem in schools , everywhere ; did you face the same problems ?
yes it was there and it was brought by the authorities . you could n't expect good result when you tell the hutu to stand up and after tutsi to do the same , for what purpose ?
we were asking ourselves what was all that for ?
and our parents used to tell us that they were survivors of hutu persecutions in the previous years .
they always used to complain about it .
... did you see any changes after 1990 or were things the same ?
that is when things got worse , the time the inkotanyi attacked . that is the time people started joining inkotanyi .
i forgot to tell you that my brother had wanted to join the rpf , they caught him while he was in ngenda and put him in prison after seriously striking him .
for them joining the inkotanyi was a big mistake and that would make them harass the families [ of the young people who would try to or manage to join the rpf ] .
was your family ever harassed ?
of course it changed ; for days , soldiers kept coming home investigating on dad , saying that he is the one who had sent him .
in our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by tutsi , there was no hutu among them . so these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things .
despite that , the genocide was later on generalized .
still in the 90s , political parties were created , such as cdr and mrnd ... did that affect you in your area or in your schools ?
could you explain to us ?
it was similar everywhere .
those who were n't mrnd members were persecuted but that did not stop us from being members of the parties we chose .
even though there was so much tension , we were not going to pretend and be where we hated to be .
our attitude was @: "@ if they are going to kill me because that , let it be so . @"
there was a lot of tension .
going back to just after the genocide ... what do you think of the new program that releases prisoners who acknowledge their crimes and that reintegrates them in the society ?
do you think it will help in the process of unity and reconciliation ?
when i think about that i find that it impossible .
i think it will result into something worse .
i do n't know if my opinion is similar to what others think .
when i hear that i have goose pimples all over my body ; so i try to ignore it .
can you imagine someone who has killed your people coming to live with you ?
do you think it will be safe ?
you told us that your dad was from ruhengeri .
were they neighbours with your mum or your mum came from a different place ?
they were all living together .
in fact all the people of ntarama were somehow related , they came together and lived together that way .
did they intermarry ?
yes of course , i think i 've told you about it ... i partially said it .
we were together at home and they told us to escape and leave them behind .
they did not want us to die as handicapped people ... they wanted to stay ... as soon as we left , the perpetrators came and started killing . we even heard them screaming from where we were .
did any of your brothers or sisters survive ?
i lost two brothers in kabgayi .
another one died at the front line and i remained with one ... we were two to survive .
he died in the war in congo .
we had only seen each other twice .
he was coming to see me when he died . he died straight away .
the others were killed while looking for a place where to hide like everyone else . they were hacked to death .
did you manage to exhume and rebury your people in ntarama ?
i have never been there . the day they were burying them i was here .
i knew my parents ' bodies were at home .
i went there once to bury them and i was so surprised ... it had been announced on the radio , it was in 1995 that people had gone to ntarama for burials ... when i went to bury them , i did not find them there .
people told me they had been told to gather all bodies and to put them together at ntarama ...
tell us your name please .
tell us your name please .
bad sound .
we were here .
could you tell us what took place here ?
people were killed , that is what happened here .
also there was a pit here .
later on , we found about 7 people in there .
there were other things piled on top of them , pieces of wood , stones ; there was even an axe , half of a machete that had been broken into two .
that 's probably what they used to kill them with .
where are those people buried ?
those people were taken to gisozi .
when did you find them ?
we found them in 2004 , in the month of … in january .
were you able to find out who their families were ?
my name is umuhire diane , i was 10 years old during the genocide .
we are in kicukiro , in sahara sector , the cell is niboye ii .
many people were killed here , over 500 people .
those who were on the other side were killed on april 10th , 1994 . among them are my mother and my older sister .
the ones who are in here were killed on april 14th , 1994 .
the killers had machetes , guns , grenades , swords .
they slaughtered them and some of them were burnt alive .
could you tell us who the members of your family were who were in here ?
there was mother , father and my older sister .
what was your mum 's name ?
murebwayire veneranda , dad was called hakizimana fidele and my older sister 's name was hakizimana rosine .
could you briefly tell us how they were brought down here … how they brought them here … what happened from the time they were caught until the time they were killed .
here was a rubbish tip , we had sought refuge in a convent up there .
they came looking for them there , they were about 20 interahamwes . many of them had machetes , guns and they got them to go down , they got us to go down and sit in the middle of the road .
the head of the interahamwes said they should not kill the children , that they should only kill adults .
and so after they went down , they started cutting them down , on april 10th , they threw them into this pit .
they also stole mattresses at home and in other houses in the neighbourhood , they poured fuel and burnt them .
they cut them down and threw them into a pit , and then they put mattresses on top of them and burnt them .
later on they came back to the convent .
that 's when my dad was taken away .
there were 5 interahamwes this time .
two of them had guns , one had a hammer , two of them had machetes , that 's when they took him down and killed him as well .
were they killed the same way or was his situation worse ?
first , they hit him on the head with a hammer ; they took him pulling him across the ground . so you can understand that it was as though they had already killed him .
later again , they slaughtered him , because when we exhumed them , there were traces of a machete on his head and here [ on the neck ] , revealing the bones .
so they are the ones who buried them here ?
they are the ones who buried them here .
do you know anyone else who is in here , perhaps your neighbour ?
yes , i do .
could you tell us who they are ?
there is baziga aloys ' family , some of them were our neighours , semana pierre 's family and his wife , there is also a child called mutama .
there are many in there and i do not know them all .
how do you feel when you come here ?
i feel pain when i come here . this place reminds me of the many things that happened during the war .
do you like the way this place is kept ? do you think it 's the way things should be or do you have a different opinion ?
i do not appreciate the way it is now , i do not like it .
i think they should be taken to a memorial site since this is somebody 's house anyway .
there 's nothing that shows that these people were killed during the war .
i believe it would be better to take them to a memorial site and people would visit them there .
my name is theodore bizimana .
in 1994 , i was living here in nyakabanda , i was a mature , grown @-@ up person . i was 42 years old .
could you tell us what happened here ?
what happened here goes beyond imagination .
this was a neighbour 's family .
those who were killed here were with me at eto .
they were deceived , and told that things had cooled down ... in the end , their day had come and they were killed .
they headed back home but did not spend another night alive , they were killed .
we stayed at eto and we left there for nyanza . but those who had remained behind lost their lives .
it is evident that many people were killed there . i escaped death then . those people were our neighbours .
could you tell us how many people were killed here ?
right here .
they 'd been thrown into a pit that was here .
could you please tell us how they were killed ?
they hacked them , shot them and threw grenades on them .
the pit was a septic tank ... they had planned to make it into one , but it was not yet completely built .
so they killed them and threw them in .
was it the head of the family together with his children and wife ?
yes , actually the mother was the head of the family , as the father died , of old age .
therefore , it was the children 's mother , the children and the grand @-@ children .
what happened after genocide ?
after the genocide , people fled .
when we came back from exile , we went back to our homes and we slowly found out where people had been killed . we arranged the pit , cemented it and left them in .
later on , we wanted to bury them with respect and we exhumed them and took them to gisozi , last year .
thank you .
in 1994 ... if i start telling you from the beginning ; from the time political parties rose , how roads were blocked by the militias to stop people from moving from place to place , how we failed to find way to the market places , the story would be so long and it can take much time to say all of it .
i will tell you old the events , which took place in the last week or i will begin from the death of gatabazi and bucyana , who was a cdr member .
that is when we started getting many problems .
that is when many people ( the tutsi ) were killed .
they used to get young boys who would be going to their homes and take their clothes off and force them to wear combat and boots .
they would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them inkotanyi , yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well .
then , they would be killed just over there .
a certain old man called theodore bizimana decided to shift ; he fled and left this place because of the smeil of corpses , which they used to dump in front of his home every morning .
during that time , they used to enter people 's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted @: either at night or daytime .
they could take any thing they wished from people 's houses and beat anyone they wanted to beat .
i remember sometime , it was on the hory thursday towards esther .
i was going to church and as i reached just in front , i saw a certain boy who was caught by the presidential guards .
it was close to the home of nsabimana 's sister , this nsabimana was a soldier and he had another name ; he was called castar .
around , there was a shop where they used to gather and take alcohol , there was also a certain boy , so they caught him and reached a very huge stone ; these stones used for making foundations for houses and hit it to that boy .
i sreamed but a certain old lady who was living around here , she was called dina , she was also moving in the same direction like me and besides hearing , i never knew what was taking place .
then she told me while she was pulling my arm , "@ let 's procced , it is the interahamwe ( militias ) killing the other tutsi . @"
then i asked her "@ what did he do ? @"
"@ he is accused of being a tutsi and stop talking about it , otherwise they will kill you too . @"
i procceded but i was very frightened .
however , as i reached at the corner i saw soldiers . i told them that there was somebody who was being killed .
but when they realized that he had a tutsi appearance , they replied to me in french because i had talked to them in french , so they said , "@ laisse @- le , lui il a le droit de mourrir . @" meaning , "@ leave him , he has right to die . @"
that is what that man told me . so i procceded .
and then , on the sixth at night we heard that ... hope you can see that we are neighbouring the airport .
i heard an explosion of an europlain , however we did n't know it was a europlain .
then later in about two or one hour 's time we started hearing grenades around the neighbourhood . they were terribly many and unsual in fact somewhere in the neighbourhood , someone screamed and when he screamed we heard a grenade exploded . when the second grenade was exploded , that person stopped screaming and never screamed again .
the trend continued until deep in the night at around 03:00 a.m. and we had not known what had happened .
when president habyarimana . j. @"@ ikinani @" died they cut the cabble , which supplied electricity in our area .
they cut it in order to stop us from communicating with embassies because they knew that some how we must be in tough with a certain embassy ; therefore , they knew we could call the embassy and tell them the situation around our area . therefore , they cut the cabble that used to supply up to this place .
frankly speaking , i can not clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time , there were no electric phones .
at least they would have disconnected the communication system and leave the electricity .
then in the morning we heard that the president died . we got the rumours from the neighbours because we could n't listen to the radio because we had no electricity .
they had started burning people 's houses and killing people .
they started from up there at a certain widow 's home . she was called claudette muteteri . her husband was called mutsinzi .
mutsinzi was a hutu but he died before the war .
a week before her death ... ( i had forgotten to tell you this but i have remembered as i mentioned her name ) between her home and aloys ' ( ngirabatware aloys was the president of the militias ) home , there was a field where all of us would gather for meetings .
in that meeting , it was where the security problem was mentioned .
therefore , my husband pierrot acted so brave and raised his hand and asked , "@ i would like to ask aloys some question @: the militias he lead are the ones who are killing people of this area and kill them from here . yet everyone knows that those people belong here ! do you want tell us that you do n't know where the inkotayi are living ?
they are in cnd . why do n't you find them there and kill them ?
in stead you attack this poor widow ‘ claudette ’ and menace her . @" they could never let her sleep for a minute .
everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish .
when the genocide begun , she was killed first in our area . and then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called modeste ( i do n't remember his other name ) to go and face aloys about that issue .
however , we were very worried ; we knew that no body goes to aloys ' home and comes out alive . we thought they would die .
therefore , they decided to meet him the following day .
but since my husband was the one who was brave to ask that question , as we had just reached at home tracing somewhere to sit , we saw everybody who was affected by the security problem coming to our home .
most of the people who would come were tutsis . therefore , we came up with a dicision of shifting in that same week .
my husband started shifting people ; he had a track , so he would shift people at night .
at night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas .
they begun from across there , that is where they would always attack .
we had also planned to shift on saturday ; we had got a house in kabgayi for rent .
unfortunately , that was when the serious killings begun . others had left ; it was a few families and us who had stayed .
because all our neighbours had sought refuge in our home with a belief that , since it was in a white family no body would guess they were there or bather to come .
personally i thought so . therefore , i would put them in the bedrooms and under the beds .
then us , we remained in the colidor thinking that , "@ if they find us in the colidor they would n't bather to check . @" therefore , i asked him to get out , "@ if they find you outside , they will not have a chance to enter because if they enter they will search around the house . @" i explained to him .
finally , he got out and when he reached out there , he told them that he was sick ; truly he was sick . therefore , they told him that , "@ let us go . @"
as they had reached in front , they said , "@ in this home there are traitors ! @"
but one of them said , "@ do n't search them now . let 's first go up to the end . @" he said so because the inkotanyi had already captured that area of remera at the stedium . and fortunately they did n't come home .
they looked scared and when they reached in front at the juction of the roads , they started saying , "@ among us they are traitors and suddenely the shootings from the inkotanyi increased .
therefore , they went back and said that they should ensure security right from their homes .
"@ about that home , we shall see it later . @" they said . that is how they left without searching our home . and , as he had just entered in the house , they throw a grenade to our house ; it landed on the roof , however no body was hurt ; it affected the roof only ; the roof split into pieces .
the following morning ... on friday we fled .
we saw very many people fleeing therefore ; we also decided to join them .
we were with our neighbours ; i was with my husband , my five children and one of them was a one year and two months old baby and my brother .
we went and reached those ends of rubirizi , where we found other people and joined them . we continued together up to butare . we reached in burundi on the 05th may 1994 .
however it is a long story about the experience in burundi .
therefore , we came back and reached here on the 16th july , 1994 . when i left burundi , it was a few days after the inkotanyi had captured kigali .
therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind .
but i found when this part was demolished . even the other house of ours was demolished .
so i had to ask what took place when we left . i asked the neighbours ; some were cawards and they would say the truth but today , no body can tell you what happened .
after they took off the car , they saw a pit hole , where water from bathrooms used to flow .
then they said that it was dug for the hutus so , they dicided to bury there the tutsis .
they could take their clothes off and kill them in a way that , one could n't identify them after the war .
there is a certain lady who had sought refuge in this area ; she was dumped in that pit yet she was pregnant . she had eight months pregnance .
we never knew their names or where they were coming from .
the interahamwe dumped her in the pit where she spent five days agonizing before dying . later a certain man who was my neighbour ; he lived in the house close to ours . he got a very big stone and threw it to her in the pit and killed her finally .
after some time we wanted to exhume their remains for proper reburial .
after reconstructing our house , we asked the ministry of social affairs to help us in the act of exhuming and reburying those remains of people . however , they seemed not to consider that as an agent issue yet we could n't continue living in someone 's house .
a certain relative had sheltered us but we did n't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house .
we came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there .
we would consol on ourselves that , "@ after all they are our people , we can live in the house while they are still there . there is no problem . @"
we started living in our house and four years later ... in 1998 that is when in the name kicuciro district there was a decision to exhume and rebury all the remains of people who lived in this area .
then , they came to our home too .
we first found about four skulls but when we scooped deeper , more fifty @-@ nine bodies were found , which still had fresh .
and , one could easily identify that woman who was pregnant ; she still had braids and nails .
she even had fresh and one could see that she was pregnant although her belly was deformed .
we found children 's remains inside , men and women .
one could tell women from their hair ; they still had hair .
however , we could n't tell who was who ; most people from this area , who lost their beloved ones , came here to see if they would find them .
the worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people 's death could n't tell us the names of people who died there .
among them , they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas .
however , the people who witnessed them the day they were killed could n't tell us who they were .
we even tried to contact my neighbour ( our houses are next to each other ) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim 's remains .
he stood in his home and could peep through his fencing ; he did n't want to come here .
it is hard to know the people who died here .
up to now he can not tell you the truth ; he says that he saw the interahawe so and so passing by .
people 's remains are everywhere ; just in front here , there are remains , even in our gardens they are others . there is a time we wanted to dig in our garden but as one would dig in the soil , could fine a skull .
in fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here .
i guess that it all i can say about that pit .
but i left all the weapons they used to kill them in the pit .
knives , the car chassis , stones ... all those weapons were stained with blood .
therefore , we just buried them in the pit although we never covered it completely .
as you said that it was the interahamwe who were led by aloys , who did all those deeds . which kind of person was aloys ? and , how many interahamwe ( militias ) came here ?
aloys was the president of the interahamwes . his full names were aloys ngirabatware .
he was an origin of gisenyi and closely related to the family of the ex @-@ president ; he had married mbonabaryi 's daughter .
mbonabaryi noel was habyarimana 's ( ex @-@ president ) brother @-@ in @-@ law .
he was the head of all the interahamwe of this area .
additional to that , after the genocide , in his house people found there bags of guns , bullets , corespondance documents , lists of people who were supposed to be killed , lists of interahamwe ... there were so many things .
but people who seized his properties burnt some of the things ; they never knew the value of those things .
i just got a few of the information on small papers and the little information i got , was from some body from that home who had gathered them and called me .
he told me abiout what took place there and so i rushed for the remaining information and brought it here .
could you please tell us your name ?
my name is murekatete serafina , before the war , i mean during the war i was staying here in this cell , before it was known as gasharu ‘ ya kabiri ’ ( gasharu 2 ) but know it is kagina , kicukiro sector , kicukiro district .
i was staying at my uncle 's place and when the war started , we fled , got out of the house we were staying in and went to another that was close by , and then the interahamwes came and made us walk , they brought us and my uncle was killed in a building that is close by .
they brought us , they killed some people who were with us , they were more than seven .
after killing them i escaped them , i passed between houses that are here nearby , i reached the dusty road , then i was raped by more than ten interahamwe , after raping me they spent the night with me , the next day i left and went back to my neighbourhood [ closer to where i was staying ] .
did you say that seven people died here ?
more than seven people died here .
where were they killed ?
they were interahamwe , they were no soldiers among them , they were interahamwe with guns others had tools .
how many were they ?
they were like ten , they are the ones who made us walk .
are those the only things they used to kill them , they killed them with guns ?
they shot them all , they shot them .
where did they shoot them from ?
they shot them from here in front of the bus stop sign , here at the bus stop sign , at the roadside .
we can see that it is at the road side , when you pass here do you tend to remember ?
yeah , i would really like them to , personally i would like everyone to , even though it is at the roadside to be fenced because bad things happened at the place during the genocide , people died from here , personally therefore i feel everyone should remember this place because of the bad things that took place here .
people who were buried here during the war , where were they put afterward ?
we reburied some and took them to nyanza , we managed to take my uncle where we originate from .
serafina my name is murekatete serafina , i was 26 years old during the war , interahamwe at that time walked us to this house where they raped us , i was together with other girls , we were staying nearby , they used to bring people when they are going to kill and kill them from here , just behind here there was a fence and even houses , you can clearly see that there is a farm , but before there were houses . 3 people were killed from here .
could you tell us what age group , gender , these people were ?
were they children or men ?
one was a man with a family , the other one was an old man but not very elderly , the other was also a man .
who killed them ?
interahamwe ? or soldiers ?
they were killed by interahamwe , because soldiers were rarely here , they were in republican guard barracks , others were on the other side at majyambere 's place , this place was mostly occupied by many interahamwe , who walked the peope who were going to be killed .
can you please tell us the number of the people who came for you , approximate if you remember ?
the number of interahamwe , the ones who worked down the road , are the same ones who worked even here , they were very many , they would make a big squad .
one can see that people lived here , were these people killed ?
was the house destroyed at that time ?
no , they were not killed , the houses were old and i think they broke down , but the owner is still alive .
and were those destroyed during the war ?
no , they broke down , because of poor maintenance , and caring less i think that is why they broke down
bad things happened in this place , people were killed from here , when you reach here after the genocide what does it mean to you ?
i rarely pass here , but nearby there is a short cut when i pass there , i always remember that we were once here , even in my conversations am always talking about it because i will never forget , we saw things that were not good , scary and sad things , and that is why i can not forget no matter what .
people who were killed from here , where are they buried now ?
what happened after the genocide ?
when we came back from refuge we arrived first because we had fled to indera ( it 's near ) , we knew where they had been buried , we exhumed them , we took some to nyanza but one man named raphael rwamukwaya who was staying nearby , his family , his wife was still alive and asked to bury him in her house , but after some time his wife died , the other day the authorities said that no body should be left in houses , we exhumed him and took him and reburied him in respect in gisozi .
down the road at the bus stop sign , seven people were killed from there , they were killed by interahamwe , those interahamwe killed them using guns , they buried them below the tarmac road , there was a house before but it is now empty land , there is a tailor shop but one can clearly see that there was an empty land .
how were those seven people killed ?
those people were shot , they were shot since many had guns , they were killed by more than ten interahamwe .
that place is at the roadside , when you pass the place walking or in a bus what do you feel ?
when we pass here , having stayed here for a long time , we still like passing here , when we reach here i emmediatly ... especially when i am with someone i emmediatly tell them that i lost my relatives , friends and parents here , and thus i can never forget .
personally do you feel that other people should also know about it even though it happened at the roadside ?
we are here at the rubirizi diary , byimana cell , niboye sector in kicukiro district .
my name is justin nzaramba and i am 52 years old .
i am married and i have children .
i live here in byimana .
i am here at rubirizi , a site of the killing of innocent people in 1994 .
this place has a long story .
it still has n't been possible to bury the victims who were killed during the 1994 war .
in fact , thousands of people were killed here .
the victims were from different districts such as kicukiro , kanombe , sectors such as kagarama , kabeza , samuduha ... it 's been a year that the remains of these victims are supposed to have been buried but we have n't been able to do anything because of this pit .
we tried with the people of kicukiro , kanombe , kagarama , kabeza , samuduha ... but were unable to .
over 3,000 people lost their lives here .
maybe you will ask @: where did these people come from ?
they were people who fled from their homes , some were killed in their homes .
others were found out in the bush near the rubirizi farm [ there were many cows and a very wide bush ] and then the killers used to bring them here to kill them .
they also brought some from the house of the then counselor named biziyaremye , after the latter had kidnapped them from their homes . those are the news that ... the victims were transported in pick ups and taken to the interahamwes who were at rubirizi .
they used to throw people into a big pit after killing them .
this pit is very deep . it was dug in order for dead cows to be thrown there .
it is about 40 meters long and it was n't dug the usual way .
it is so deep that it has n't possible to exhume the bodies of the victims that are inside .
we tried digging but we were told they poured acid into it .
there are even remains of cows inside !
we tried in vain and the ministry told us we shall build a memorial site there .
that way , we will be able to visit the place every year after it 's been built .
damascene rurangirwa is a man whose parents had been thrown into this pit .
he had tried to make it look better so people can show a bit of respect towards the place . he had realized that there was no other way of exhuming the corpses . he got it concreted .
later on , the ministry lent us a machine and people from kicukiro and kanombe dug it up , but they were unable to go over 8 meters because of the gas and the cows remnant ... they were at least able to exhume the remains of 8 people that they buried in respect with other bones .
how were these people killed ?
were they shot dead ?
did the perpetrators throw them alive into the pit ?
the perpetrators brought them alive to the pit , killed them and then threw them in .
some were even thrown in alive !
for example , my older brother was thrown in alive . he spent 2 days agonizing and begging for drinking water !
the perpetrators cut up his arm and threw him in mocking him and saying he should bury himself .
what about the others ? did they shoot them or did they use clubs to kill them ?
here , most of the people were killed with machetes .
only those who tried escaping were shot . the rest were killed with machetes and clubs or even thrown into the pit alive ! people were subjected to horrible deaths here and it was n't just here because there were other pits .
this pit was called ‘ urwabayanga ’ and many cows were thrown in .
i believe you saw the cows that were here . they are from a very productive race ... we were n't able to do anything about it !
there are many people here .
about how many people were thrown in here ?
the night he died .
there were people who had already sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro .
it had started way before ! people had been displaced since march 1994 . then , they 'd sought refuge in parishes .
it 's only from the 7th of april that they fled to eto .
the ones who were lucky to survive the atrocities at eto went to nyanza . when they got to nyanza , they were killed .
very few survived . there were about 5,000 people at eto .
the ones you see are those who were hiding in the hills of gahanga . some were killed and others came back . when the interahamwes got to know that these people were going to come back here , they trapped them .
it was all the interahamwes from all the hills around here .
i believe that as a survivor and as somebody who lives in this cell of byimana , you know something about the people who were dumping people into the pits .
i 'd like you to tell us about them if possible .
among the most popular interahamwes were gerard karanganwa , kabagabo , bizimungu , idi and kagarara .
in fact , there were many interahamwes but most of them did n't come back .
i think they are still in congo .
all those interahamwes disappeared but maybe there 's still a chance with the gacaca jurisdictions .
we will continue to get more information . i did n't personally see the people i told you about as i had sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro .
i crossed over dead bodies ... but some people still survived .
i heard that those interahamwes were working in association with those of kanombe who were called the ‘ zulus ’ because all these hills ... maybe it 's because i am the one giving you this testimony but there are other people who know better than i do and who even know those interahamwes .
we dug this pit ... most of the victims were from neighbouring sectors . those people know them and they know they threw them into this pit !
but the interahamwes such as kabagabo , karanganwa gerard , such as ... are known because they lived here in byimana !
i suppose that the interahamwes from kanombe are known by the people from kanombe .
over 2,000 people were killed at this pit and nearby . you can see it , some of them have n't even been properly buried yet .
you will see their remains as time goes .
we 're planning to build this place so that we can come and commemorate every year .
they were killed here in rubirizi . there was even a veterinary who was hiding with my brother . we will ask him because he saw him being taken away to be killed .
are you talking about damascene ?
no , he is called rwagapfizi .
rwagapfizi ...
yes , in those houses over there , the houses that belong to the diary . that 's where he was working .
if we agree that people were brought in pick ups ... were they accompanied by soldiers who shot them afterwards ?
the interahamwes were mixed with soldiers .
they all came from kanombe and were armed with grenades , guns , machetes , cudgels ... not the ones you sae , check on the other side .
there are others there ! yes ! human beings !
do you know a certain ndiramiye ?
ndiramiye ?
...
but i know gacaca will let us know .
there was a big road here ; the killers would put the victims together and whenever they reached a big number , they took them over there .
the victims were already dead by the time they got there .
my name is justin nzaramba and i was born here in byimana cell , niboye sector , kicukiro district .
i am 52 years , i am maried and i have children .
a big number of people were killed here at rubirizi .
they were so many that we still find their remains till this day , there are still bones all over . in fact , there were many pits in rubirizi , they served for the feeding of cows .
however , the people who were hiding in their villages ... i did n't see the ones who were taken from biziyaremye 's house , he was the counsellor . the soldiers used to kidnap them and take them to rubirizi .
among them were our neighbours , most of them were women .
there was a road from kicukiro that passed here , near this put and that went up to samuduha .
there were big roads here . the perpetrators were bringing them , killing then and then use a different road to go home since they were so many of them .
they were chasing all over !
they ... there were even trucks that brought corpses here from samuduha . there 's a man called gafaranga who told me that drivers from the minitrap [ ministry of transportation ] put corpses into the trucks and then came to throw them here at rubirizi .
how were the victims killed ?
oh !
they cut them down into pieces . very few were shot . they mutilated their victims and then got rid of them because they did n't want to see the corpses of their victims near them .
however , most of the dead bodies were devoured by dogs . they did n't throw all the corpses into pits , the rest was eaten by dogs .
in fact , some people were n't completely killed , they mutilated them and then left them to die of the wounds , after suffering greatly . they died a horrible death .
what happened here is so atrocious !
it was terrible even if it 's not spoken about as much as the nyanza and eto @- kicukiro events . there were dreadful scenes of atrocities here at rubirizi !
very few survived here ; when we consider the number of inhabitants of this sector or of the neighbouring ones , we realized that it 's very low compared to the number of the people who lived here before . most of those who live here today are new .
in addition , very few interahamwes are in jail . the rest are probably in congo .
but some did surrender themselves ; the rest are not there anymore ... in fact , mostly the kicukiro and rubirizi inhabitants lost their lives here .
obviously , if there was a big number of victims , that means the perpetrators were many as well .
i 'd like to ask you if you know some of the people who participated in those acts ... maybe they 're free ... ?
free ... most of them are no longer free . those perpetrators were members of cdr and mrnd [ political parties ] .
people like idi , kabagabo whom i told you about were driving their cars , looting and looking around for other guys such as bizimungu , kagarara ... they had given themselves nicknames but we know their names and their families are still alive !
