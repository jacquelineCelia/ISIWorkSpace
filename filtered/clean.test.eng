the tension continued in 1994 .
the genocide started when i was away from home , i was in kigali .
i had been fleeing the war for sometime then as people knew i had wanted to send my brother in the inkotanyis ' army and it was very bad being called an inkotanyi then .
i came to live with a lady called maria who was a family friend .
the war started while i was living at her house .
when the war broke up , it was like a nightmare ... it was like a nightmare because even though they used to talk about it , i never thought it could actually happen ... i did n't know people could change and become wolves .
maria told me that the president had died the previous night and that the war had started .
she told me that i needed to pack my things in the morning and leave her home .
i asked why , what had happened ... "@ do n't you know that the president died and was killed by the tutsis ?
so you need to get out of my house ! @"
i lived there with that child for about ... probably 3 weeks .
the child 's family was living not far from there , they were stil alive but they knew their last day was n't far .
one evening , micheveux told me , "@ ode , i am going to die . @"
i asked her why she was saying that and who she thought could find us there and kill us .
"@ i am smelling blood , i feel like i am smelling blood , i am going to die . @"
i told her to calm down and that she was going to be okay .
that evening , micheveux went back to her home , the interahamwes came and took them all .
they were many children in that family , about 8 of them . only one child survived .
i continued hiding in the same house but at some point there started feeling like the war was never going to end and i represented a risk to their own lives as anyone who was found hiding a tutsi person then would be tortured if not killed .
therese finally told me she could no longer hide me as people in the neighbourhood knew i was still alive .
therefore , they were looking for me .
when the war stopped , i stayed at mama sania 's for a short time until the inotanyis captured kibuye as the war had n't yet stopped there .
i knew i would one day go back there because i believed there had to be some survivors .
i looked for a job in a european project , there were many of that kind at that time .
i got a job and started working .
then i went home and there was no one , not even a single person and all the houses had been destroyed .
the people i met told me how they were killed , that 's all told me .
i came back to kigali and went back to work .
then i was told that my aunts were still alive .
i went to see them and found them , they married hutu men .
they told me that they had n't been able to help anyone survive , be it in my immediate family , be it in my dad 's bigger family but they said there could be some of my cousins and my little brother who survived although they did n't know exactly where they were .
they told me shumbusho was beaten and they left him thinking he was dead .
they said someone told them he was in the turquoise zone , among the children that were picked here and there .
i asked the auntie who was saying it if she did n't know where he was and she said she did n't have a clue where he could be .
i told my auntie called chantal that i was going to leave my job and go to look for my uncle mutabazi 's children as well as shumbusho .
i came back to kigali and resigned , but my employers were very kind to me , they said they were n't going to let me resign but they were giving me some time off so i could look around for any potential survivor within my family .
i first went to all orphanages looking for either shumbusho , either violette and claudette , my uncle 's children .
yes shumbusho and i are the ones who survived .
no , i had n't .
i went back to school later on .
no , she did because she loved god , she did n't do it because i was giving her any money , not at all !
she used to tell me to leave as she went to look for someone who would be willing to hide me but it was not because she was ignoring or because i did n't have anything to give her .
she did out of a good heart , i was n't even the only one she was helping .
she used to take food to others in their hiding places , making sure her husband does n't see her doing so .
i do n't know ... i do n't know if ... i think i no longer trust them because my dad was killed by a hutu man who was a very good friend to him , such a good friend ... we could not hide ... you know how things are in the countryside ... whenever the local wine had ripen it , we would n't hide from that man and dad could n't drink it without sharing it with him .
they were like brothers , dad once told me that karonkano 's father ... the man was called karonkano , he later on acknowledged that he killed dad and asked for fogiveness but i never got to see him , he was imprisoned and he got sick in jail and also passed away .
karonkano was like my dad 's brother , dad once told me that karonkano 's father and my grandfather had made a pact of blood .
i asked him to explain to me what that meant and he said they drunk each other 's blood .
therefore , he said they were brothers and they could never betray each other .
it is surprising to know that karonkano is the one who went ahead and killed dad ... he was among the people who killed dad .
he killed alfred my brother and he did n't at least kill him in good way ... not that there are good deaths , but he did n't kill him completely .
he hacked him on the head and on the back and was left agonizing near some hotels that are near our home ; at kuryanyirakabano .
he killed him , he hacked him and left him agonizing ... i was told that alfred would ask the passersby - most of them were our neighbours - for water ... i think he was very thirsty and he bleeded a lot ... he was still young , he was 15 .
he probably thought that despite the fact that they were hutus , they could be goodhearted hutus ... nobody gave him water !
the thing that hurt me the most is that some of our neighbours came back and buried him alive ... so living with them ... i have to live with them since that 's how it needs to be so we can build the country ... but i can never trust the neighbours the way i used to , considering them as other human beings ; the thought seems impossible .
i go home at times but there is so much fear in me even then .
i feel as though they 'd also kill me if they had the opportunity .
it 's impossible , i can not say that i could trust them again .
because if they were human beings , they would n't have killed children such as ngirabakuniz , she was so young !
i was told that ngirabakunzi kept telling them ... they told me that those who took her ... i was hurt so much to hear that she was killed by other children !
the oldest in the group that took her must have been about 13 .
she was saying , "@ please forgive me !
i am sorry that dad committed the crime of being a tutsi , but i promise i will n't be a tutsi anymore ! @"
so i do n't think i can trust our neighbours again !
i will live with them because there 's nothing else i can do about it but i will n't trust them .
that 's not possible !
what i mean is that even though we survived , we all have something that was destroyed in our mind .
there 's also ... it goes on .
they should encourage us because when someone comes and asks you if you also killed , it is as though they were killing you once again .
that 's all i can say .
the policemen ... i did n't know their names . all i know is that they were policemen who worked at the commune office . i did n't who know the soldiers were neither .
i did n't return where i used to stay , i was in school then and i was very sick . i went to hospital of bushenge .
that 's how avega knew me .
it 's hard for me to accept it but there is nothing else i can do .
this situation caused me to live in misery with no one to look after me but avega does the best they can though sometimes you they do n't seem to be very efficient .
what else can i do ?
forgiving them and not forgiving them is all the same . refusing to forgive them will not bring me back what i lost ... forgiving them still will not bring me back what i lost .
so i would forgive because there is nothing else i can do .
it makes me feel like i am not the only one with problems .
yes .
today is 5th of march 2007 i am here in kimironko at murebwayire josephine 's home .
so i was in a business and we also had a nice piece of land and cows , i was supervising all the activities at home , we were doing great .
they kept asking me about the gun but they could n't find it but they found binoculars that my husband used when hunting , he did it with priests .
as a mother i did n't believe that he was n't going to return , for two days i would prepare food and keep it in the cupboard for him .
i started crying hysterically , a white lady saw me and she came and asked me what was wrong ? i replied to her that i had been told that if i come at their office they would tell me about my loved one who is in jail .
in 1994 they say that the genocide and killings started after habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
they lie but the genocide did n't start in 1994 , if it had then they would n't have found me straight away .
they took me and the children and locked us in the kitchen with the workers and then they came back in the house and said to him
walking on the opposite hill , they were many and coming from remera with bags , so we said to ourselves that we should also flee , but the men stayed there .
i threw away the saucepan and started tying a piece of the loincloth that i had on every child so that i will n't leave them on the way .
we reached the parish , other people were in the seminary a little bit further , the head priest came and welcomed us , he lives in nyamata now .
the priests replied to him that all the people they had there were their christians and no there were no cockroaches among them and that they can n't send the people home since the threat that caused them to seek refuge was still eminent .
we did n't see any way out , there were roadblocks all over , on the 11th in the morning around 9 am that 's when the interahamwe came .
he was watching from where he was hiding . do you want to rape us and hurt us , go ahead and kill us we are supposed to die anyway , my daughters said .
they came to see who was still breathing , they had hacked everyone so they would just lift someone off the ground throw them back down to see who was still alive .
there was a garden that was in front of the praying room that had spinach and some other plants .
i said to myself that if they come to use the bathroom they will n't go in the dirtiest , i stood behind the door and that is exactly what happened .
but they did n't see him , that 's when he came where i was in the toilet and he heard someone breathing faintly like i was going to die .
but i realized that she was not alive , so i lived in byumba at a place i think that was called social .
i felt that a child would n't be able to get what to eat on his @/@ her own and hence always had to live with a parent .
we buried again for the second time .
and for that cause on our hill we buried two hundred and fifty people knowing exactly who was who because their bodies were visible and their identity cards .
the ones who killed them are the ones that caused the lies , had i been a bad person i would have probably had followed him around in anger for a long time but i said to myself that the one who killed them is the cause and root for all this .
they even accuse themselves and each other ; they displayed a lot of hate and torture that was just imaginable .
if you estimate on the few people who survived from there it 's you and that boy , it seems like you are very few compared to all the people that were killed from there .
he was a very good friend of the boy who said it his name is gashirabake , he said that when they were about to kill them he said to him , gashiraba
no one stands on his @/@ her word , the boy says that after he was beaten he ran away , he can n't really say that he saw someone kill , may be if he says him and he is there , he would also hunt him down , i do n't know .
and he would also remember to take something to revive them after they had given birth ; nobody else remembered he was a really nice man .
who said where my children were thrown , am not lying to you but my heart has accepted him in such a way that when i look at him i see the child i once saw before .
i do n't forgive those ones because i see that they are just saying it , it 's like a slogan they use i do n't have forgiveness for those ones . but if someone comes and kneels before me and says it from the depth of his heart .
i would n't even be of any use but because i see that i am living for some people who reap from me i must live and live like someone who is responsible , work like someone with responsibilities .
and only see her after the genocide when they returned from exile , all those are my responsibility to do all i can .
it means that if you know that there is an animal or beast in the forest you must walk when your ready to run away from it .
how is their life today ?
how are they doing , please give us an image of their life ?
i am very grateful , so a widow can get the medicine and sometimes not have anything to eat .
so among the few that are alive i think if they get the widows or survivors in general , they are not so many so that they can n't do something for them .
and we will continue to stand together and talk , i do n't want us to forget those who are behind us .
without remembering those he left behind , for the kids to be crying and no one visits them to confort them and teach them that tomorrow they will be men and women .
it 's true that we only remember in april , you would think that at other times we forget where they went and only remember thrm in april .
the government is the citizens , its not a ministry or the district , it is me , you and anybody else who is available and we all work together , that 's my opinion .
our government 's policy is good ; the peace government wants us all to live at peace with each other but our homes .
they were proud of having killed kameya saying that is now the turn for lieutenants inside saint paul . "@ we hope to catch them @: @" they said .
we were the ones called lieutenants .
early in morning on 15th because of a large number of people who lost their lives , it was said that a lot of them came from saint paul .
it was even announced on the radio .
the united nations peace keepers [ minuar ] came and had a small meeting with us .
they said @: "@ do n't worry , write down your names we will pick you up tomorrow . @" the next day on the 16th they did not come .
in the night , we left saint paul because we were told that we cause problems other refuges and we felt unsecured .
we wanted to go to gisozi hoping the lucky person will get there .
if it happens to be a citizen like masengo , when i arrive in the court they will come straight to the point .
they will start to say the crimes i committed and "@ your honor @" will be put aside .
in brief , this is my testimony and i thank you .
what is called ubunyangamugayo [ the fast of being a person with integrity ] it 's not an easy task .
actually the fact of being "@ inyangamugayo @" [ honest volunteer ] , you are not allowed to drink beer .
you are not even allowed to hit a child because you are an honest person .
the inyangamugayo nowadays are different from the old men in the old time that were called inyangamugayo .
these old men known as inyangamugayo were really honest .
i once heard that a thousand of them were arrested because of corruption .
i ask the government to carefully choose a really inyangamugayo .
i am sure the government is not able to look in their hearts but there are some criteria to follow .
like choosing a person who is not related to genocide , i mean the one who was not involved in any of the acts of genocide or a person related to few people , another thing not related to interahamwe .
if it happens that i am inyangamugayo and i have to judge a member of my family , i will do it in the right way .
so this thing should be followed up , also they should set the school level they must complete .
the memories i have about my father ... the first thing i remember ... he was a very quiet man ; he was n't very talkative .
and from what others say about his childhood while in the seminary school up to now , he was tolerant with all types of problems .
and he used to console others by assuring them that "@ the first thing is to have faith . @"
those are the things that remind me of him .
his being a silent person and his patience , in fact he never used to be discouraged whenever he would face difficulties . those are the things that remind me of him .
freddy did you witness the death of any of your family ? did you see the death of any of your family ... did you see any of your family being killed ? can you just tell me what happened ?
apart from your neighbour , did you know anybody who was involved in killings .. did you know ... ?
in the future ... i would n't put it as something i will do in the future since i have already started doing it .
besides , as a patriot i desire to work for my country .
i will have to invest a lot more efforts because i know many of the survivors have a lot of problems .
therefore , i am ready to work for them my whole life .
i will use my energy , i am lucky i am not handicapped .
therefore , i want to be able to make use of the luck i have in helping others .
about having a family ... that is something i always dream about and i am sure that someday i will achieve it .
by all means that is where i am heading . one day i will be able to build my own family if time allows me to . and i will teach my family what i was taught when i was still young .
my family ... we lived together with my parents , i have an older brother and i also had four young sisters .
at first we lived in bujumbura ; that is where we were born . later , we lived in kigali and finally we moved to kibuye .
tell me about your sisters , what were the names of your sisters ?
the worst thing i remember happening ... in general all that happened was very bad .
because , our relatives were killed , our parents were killed .
but the worst thing i saw was how our parents were killed by people who knew them , by their own neighbours ; people who used to come and eat home , people who were once taken to hospital by our parents , people who once lived at home were the same people who came in the attack to kill them .
and killed them with a painful death .. that is the thing that hurts me the most .
death is a common thing , but being killed by people he never thought would ever kill him !
he was good to them and everyone used to say so , but when things changed they all came to kill him .
that is the thing i remember most and that hurts me so much @: the death my parents died .
my sisters were thrown into the septic tank ; they threw them in there before they completely died , after beating them up with clubs .
they threw a stone on one of them , angelique , because she was running away .
they told them to stop making noise .
they were thrown into the septic tank and were left there agonizing for a long time .
i was fourteen years old ... almost fifteen .
forgiving ?
well forgiving is possible .
yes it is possible .
for example , personally i have forgiven . although no one has ever come to ask me for forgiveness , i forgave all the killers .
when i think about it , it goes beyond what i can comprehend .
i always wonder if they really know why they killed people and wonder what they think . then i feel sorry for their hearts , they know how they killed their own people .
and sincerely , i believe they will die of a terrible death .
because they will die with a guilty conscience , deep in their hearts they must be wondering why they killed people , their relatives , their schoolmates , their colleagues , people they were brought up together , playing football together , people they played different games together .
kids who grew up together .
personally , i believe forgiving is very possible .
not holding any grudges against them is an extraordinary gift that god gave me .
i just get confused about how to handle matters .
i ask myself , "@ what caused this ? @"
and i fail to understand the person who planned this ... but it is possible to forgive .
that 's my personal conviction .
when the genocide started were you in kibuye ?
my mother later returned looking for me , she found me , and we continued together , we slept in the forest . my mother said that she knew some congolese who taught forestry , we should get to them and they will be able to help us cross to the other side . we had many relatives who lived in congo , so we moved .
at the time we got to gatwaro forest , a lot of rain fell , there was thunder and lightning , it rained until the following morning then through the day up to three o'clock in the afternoon , we were in the forest with nowhere to shelter from the rain , we were cold , hungry and all other things
i agreed to go to the doctor the following day ; i was taken to see a doctor .
i was taken to kibuye hospital , in the pediatric department , i was going to be treated , when we got there he asked for me to be admitted ; admit this child he said ; he asked them to allocate me a bed , they also gave me a blanket , those given by the hospital , he then said , if anyone kills this child , i will kill them and their off springs myself .
they took us outside , they carried us outside ; outside the hospital the unamir also started taking people , they also took esther from that place , i was also later taken , they took us in n.t ; they transported us in n.t ; they received us and tried to give us treatment but it was difficult , if you had been hacked on the lower arm , they usually amputated through the elbow , that is how it was .
how your mother was killed in your presence or how your brother was killed in your presence , how do you feel when you remember those experiences ?
we stayed inside that church of ntarama , we managed to flee ; me , my twin brother and my other brothers .
in the night , the interahamwe attacked again and we ran into the church .
they entered and started to hacked people , they continued to hack people and my twin brother was also hacked . they hit me with a shaped wood and a hammer and threw me on top of the dead bodies thinking that i was dead .
he came first and they refused him to take me , he came for the second time it was the same .
they told him @: ‘ what if you take her , and ruin her life it will be very bad plus she is a lame . @"
so he promised that he will take good care of me .
on the third day he came back , now this time he was allowed to go with me because he kept on insisting that he wants to go with me .
on the third day , he had to fill up all the requirements and to sign .
at nyundo orphanage where i lived , they finally allowed me to go with him .
i stated with that man , he had a wife and three children among which two boys and one girl . they were older than me .
we lived together for a long time .
i went to school , farg was my sponsor and i went to study at saint andrew high school .
i completed the ordinary level and went to gisenyi . he really took care of me .
he raised me as his child . i studied in gisenyi till i completed high school , we lived in remera .
after i finished high school , i started to work at chuk , and later on i stopped .
i started to work with the wife of the man who adopted me ; she was involved in trading so we worked together . we worked together but she was suffering from leg cancer .
do you have a house ?
honourable father , what existed here before the reign of kings ?
she says that in the 7th century bc , here in rwanda , there were three kinds of people who practiced three activities @: there were people who used to hunt in the forests , there were people were cattle keepers , there were also people who were cultivators , in fact if you look carefully because there was a forest in our region , i think also in many other regions at the beginning , the first people to practice an activity , i think , were hunters .
they found that that dung was from a cow dating to that time around the 7th century .
you see that they are things they based on , it 's not to say that they were called the twa or the tutsi by anyone or where they came from .
those assumptions that they came from somewhere else tells you that where the first person came from , he can not say any other place
thank you , gihanga , being the first king of rwanda does not mean that rwanda started with gihanga .
our land like we know it from the history of rwanda which our forefathers tell us , i am not making up this history because i was not there .
i think this is something we need to let people know , this history of rwanda is recorded , the important history like i was saying a while ago , let me repeat it in brief , it is written in three places .
what are the clans therefore ?
giving an example , the banyiginya , that is a clan , amongst the banyiginya , there are the twa , tutsi and hutu .
what are clans ?
there are the bega , amongst the bega , there are the hutu , tutsi and twa .
the basinga is a clan made up of hutu , tutsi and twa . there is no tribe without those two parts .
i have not yet spoken on the hutu and tutsi , i will talk about it in reference to a man named speak but that has nothing to do with talking about blood clans .
sfrom rukumbi therefore , from ruganzu bwimba , the basinga clan never ever became queens exept nyirarumaga who we shall talk about her , is the only one who became queen , a queen who was ahelper because the mother of ruganzu had died .
you see then that the king was from the banyiginya clan , queens were from the bibanda clan , there were 10 from the basingwa clan .
when the rwandans would go to war they would bring crops which they had gotten from other places , they told us of how sweet potatoes came , how they introduced peas .
i think most of the things resulted from their leadership which better than others at conquering .
i can not explain it all without spending the whole day because there are other things which follow and require a lot of time
he is the one who reached bukavu , he reached far but he went intending to fighting then the bashi who were also called the banyabungo long ago .
there was yari gahima , he is the one who conquered those areas and others , therefore you see that if one starts to talk about everyone and what they did , it will be lengthy , i can not say it all , but you realize that they had that plan of conquering for rwanda and that is what it means , even when you look at their chronicles and think about their names , that is how they were and that is how it is in the plans .
let 's say the name rwanda , kigali and gasabo , those names are similar and all have that program .
rwanda means a country without boundaries , one can ask you that how is the rwanda abroad ?
among the 3 tribes were the twa , the hutu and the tutsi , it must have been him who brought that ideology that they do not come from the same place , and they forgot that since the 7th century they lived here and the first were the cattle keepers , one can say that the tutsi are the cattle keepers , those who were called the hutu were cultivators and the twa hunters , this is what speak said and everyone followed this
those who rejected it , who were twa assistant chiefs are known , i can show you their names .
the hutu were also many and we know them , the important rulers of the king , bisangwabyarugombibituri were hutu , and the twa were also ... , i think you heard about it .
the second thing i want to remind you of is that in the rwandan culture , i child takes up the clan of the father and not the mother 's but if you make it tribes , the child honestly had to take up the mother 's tribe as well .
they would have been another tribe called ibyima for those born into two different tribes
i think it 's a bit clear although i think the first and most important thing is that musinga was accustomed to being king , so to say that from today on wards you are not a king , you are a slave is not an easy thing .
he did not therefore take it very well because he did not agree to it to .
it 's understandable because you can not have been a leader of a country and then be told that you are not , there is no way you can agree .
that distressed him and he did not agree , secondly they wanted musinga to be baptised and yet he was accustomed to our beliefs in god and they said that it 's nonsense .
we were talking about the colonial period , we were talking about the leadership in rwanda , what it was capable of and how it benefited the countrymen , i think that is what you told us .
and even now when you tale a close look you realise that in that time there were two parts , the catholic church , the priests seemed to also be involved in those things together with those white men who came .
i think you can explain that to us as well .
those white men who included the first missionaries , are they the ones who helped so as to achieve the goals the priest had of changing the beliefs of people and baptising them ?
so as to achieve their goals , they would look for a reason in every country ; at times they used religion as a way to divide people .
let 's give an example of sudan where there were arabs and blacks , angola where it was political , that is socialists and nationalists .
so they based on religion so as to divide the citizens , or tribes like here .
they usually wanted places where it was easy to divide the people basing on their tribes and they would also have a side that could overpower the other from which they could get a majority because they always wanted to divide people .
let us talk about what was called mayaga in 1959 , i talked about the main cause , the white man bitterly hated independence while they were ruling , when the king they had put asked for independence , instead of giving power to the leaders they had chosen who were the tutsi , they found that there was no way of refusing to give them their independence without putting them against each other using tribes which they had named hutu , tutsi and twa .
they called them different tribes which were against each other .
they also said that every bad thing that happened in rwanda especially during their time was caused by the tutsi be it the caining of offenders .
all those things that happened because of the colonialists were blamed on the tutsi .
the catholic church is all those who are baptized , we shall come back to that in a little while but it started from there because the genocide started from bringing hatred amongst the people .
the genocide was conceived in 1994 , it actually started in 1959 and they went on practicing it to the end .
in all those times they went on saying those things , they were people of the church who wronged it .
talking about the church in general while mentioning people we know such as the leaders , whoever is called a christian , baptized and goes to church i can call him a member of the church .
in the beginning let 's start with kayibanda to make it easy .
i will speak of it in a few words because we all know about it now .
the first republic honestly seemed to continue with the programs of the colonialists .
let 's talk about kayibanda , he cause divisionism among the rwandans which gave birth to refugees like i said , it gave birth to tribalism in schools and at work places , and even in 1972 when habyarimana wanted to over throw kayibanda and he told lies that the tutsi had again rioted but the truth is that he had made it up so as to find a way of overthrowing him .
when habyarimana came in , what he added was tribalism and regional discrimination .
the other thing he added was the planning of the genocide .
then the time birasa went to become a chief in nyambiriri community is when his father and kayibanda also went to ndiza , and kayibanda joined the seminary .
but then what 's true is that kayibanda 's father himself was coming from mushi . so to say that he fought and hated tutsis just because he was not rwandan , probably meant that he was actually not tutsi
he wanted a government based on multiple political parties which scared mrnd even more , that 's also something someone should add on , multiple political parties together with the refugees became new refugees of inkotanyi .
what i can say about it is very easy , that 's what happens when someone is starting something , earlier i mentioned that ... from 1959 , there were preparations leading to that . one who discerns would sense that it was leading to nowhere else but to that . it was very clear that someone would tell where it was going to . it was all from his speech that he had just pronounced saying that the tutsi are the enemy of the state . a priest says that tutsis are bad in general yet he knows that man was created by god .
that their enemy ...... is a tutsi is poison in that to convince him that it 's not true , he will not accept
i would thus like to know that if the rwanda of tomorrow or its children being born today
and to follow what encourages us to have the same vision ...... i have finished
did you know the old man you killed ?
we know that you are one of the people who admit that they killed and you are ready to say the truth on what happened in ntarama .
are there some of the people you were with in ntarama that you accused ?
there are some who are leaders .
in the beginning i gave you an example of the cops . when someone is at the level of [ adjudant chef ] is already a leader .
i know of someone called sebuhindo , but i do n't know where he is now .
even policemen are leaders in a country because they are armed .
mr bizimungu issac who is in ririma at the moment . he is also a leader .
i remember inspector karerangabo vincent . he was also a leader and educated .
i even remember ...
to be honest , the punishment that i was give did not suite the crime i committed .
because when you kill someone you are also suppose to be killed .
but that is not what happened , because the current government used a new rule , which says that whoever reveals the truth , his punishment will be reduced .
and that is what i chose to do .
therefore , the fact that i was sentenced to a seven years imprisonment yet i killed somebody , but simply because i revealed the truth and asked for forgiveness , pleases me a lot .
and i must say that i am pleased .
but such people who still denies and hides the truth , they should not be given the same punishment .
because they are hiding the truth and that adds weight on what they did .
to me , i believe such people should be punished by the authorities accordingly , following the rules that guide them .
i have been in prison for 5 years but i was 40 years old then .
it 's that one over there , the unfinished one . when we reached there , i saw mudasomwa 's vehicle full of interahamwe .
i saw mayor mukibaruta and commandant sebuhura .
then i asked who they were because i had never seen them .
i was told they were local leaders of gikongoro .
the commandant had also come to give orders to policemen to shoot and to the rest of the villagers to throw stones and hack the ones who would survive the shootings .
some villagers left and local leaders said it was time to challenge the tutsis .
we threw stones at each other but we were defeated , they run after us up to the murambi road , the main road that cars use to get here , and then i saw soldiers coming from the bushes where they were hiding .
they threw grenades and shot .
even the soldiers we had come with started throwing grenades .
later they even had to refuel their supply .
the villagers attacked the tutsi who had sought refuge there .
they hacked them with machetes and others were killed with clubs .
they found me there , as they were running away and i used a club to kill them both .
he was a counselor from nyamagara . he even took 5,000 frw from that tutsi .
it 's because the tutsi were the only ones there .
no one else was there .
yes i can recognize him .
by then we were with the interahamwe who had guns .
and i was in a very big attack , which had so many people .
i was n't the only one who killed , even those whom we were together killed .
i have already apologized to the people i know but those i do n't know i would like to apologize to the government and ask god to forgive me .
i neither drowned him nor tie him .
but i witnessed the whole event .
it 's a certain river from our place in rukarara .
no one in my family participated in the genocide .
i considered them as relatives @: we would give each other water , we shared everything and there was no problem .
i did n't see any training taking place .
when the french came , those who wanted to flee went to zaire [ democratic republic of congo ] but only the hutu .
there were no any other killings after the tutsi from murambi and gikongoro had died .
now i have changed my way of thinking . now i 've changed and i became a good person because i have been educated .
how i saw it , they removed the detonator clip and threw it on them . and they all died right away .
yes i have nightmares about it . i dream about it and feel deeply sad .
justice can unite us when we show and say the truth on what happened in rwanda .
all the genocide survivors ... because this country does n't want to kill people ... the way others were murdered .
therefore , we can ask them to forgive us and in return they will forgive us .
thereafter we will live together in peace as before .
before rwandans used to be good people , but later on the former leadership changed them and then they became bad people .
however , this new government is totally different from the former one .
because the former government was following the ideology of division among people .
and , that is all they would teach people .
but this government is teaching people how to live together and how to share and washes away the bad thoughts out of people 's minds .
things like grid , killing ... this government does n't support that ideology of killing . all this government needs is people to live with others peacefully ; it wants killers to ask for forgiveness .
that is all it wants ... they want people to say the truth .
i personally ... according to how this government ... if the government never ... people with bad hearts , who were influenced by the government .
in case it was him who killed my own child , what i would do ... according to these days , i would ... i would forgive him due to ... i would forgive him .
during that time , i faced a very hard time in my life . because all my tutsi neighbours had died .
there was no one i could apologize to during that time .
if they had been there , i would have apologized to them .
but i was only hurt because of those ruins
i was hiding with other men who were in the same situation as me .
yes and up to now he is still a counselor .
i do n't know about his ways of leading because i 'm in prison .
it 's my first time to come here ; i last came here when his excellence the former president had come with the zambian president kabombeki .
in the village ... since that woman had already known that i 'm the one who killed her child , i would ...
yes until now i have never see them .
i last saw them when they were there at the flat . i saw them the time they were covered in tents in that building .
and , up to now i have n't seen them so that i can know what to tell others .
about the first burial ... when they had just killed them , some trucks come from gikongoro ; big trucks .
therefore they would offload them .
the locals were passing here going to markets , but they would stop and intervene .
it was the prisoners who were coming from gikongoro ... i was just a villager and i saw them .
where ? at whose house ?
did you know where they came from ?
what were you up to tell them that you use nyabingi ?
so like you as a good old woman , why do think the rest never had a helping heart .
they killed him in this war , look where his granddaughter is ?
come here !
here she is , her grandmother was my co wife . i went to get her when she had lost her parents .
before telling the young children i can first tell the white people , that long time ago when they were going to kill , when they were to kill and man named runanira and their daughter and maid and saying that it is their brother that killed them , rudahigwa went and brought the whites and brought their pictures and placed them on other pictures where killed them from and there came her husband and they said why they killed him and what he used to kill him and they got hold of him and he accepted up to now the whites even though they burnt his things , and then they came and put their machine in the air and then get all those who come against me
interahamwe !
i was a seeing and that is what i am telling you !
unity and reconciliation ?
do really want me to talk about unity and reconciliation ?
ok ! let me tell you !
unity and reconciliation you will go and sit there you drink alcohol and another and pass it over , then you will go to the toilet when you come back you find that your beer has been poisoned and he kills you , me i will n't reconcile and share some thing
i was here in the house sited like this , crucified like this , i can n't say that someone is here , those who were here can tell that , whenever they came i spoke out loud and those in the house were the ones writing so i do n't remember them because they all came from far .
that is the truth that is there , because there those who were killing , the sensitizers and those who were innocent .
yeah !
but those simple ones
muhamudu is the one that i took people to . i would say i met this person please hide him for me but i never told him that i had more .
they are all alive most of them went to uganda , one sent this and another .
they wanted to know if i am alive , they are alive
problems are what i encountered ?
they used to beat me up while asking me .
i said i did n't know and they got into the house but saw nothing , i had abandoned my house and you would tell that nobody lived in it , it was there for them to shelter from the rain .
one named emmanuel twagirayezu is a director in ntongwe , and jose mukandera she is also a director , mukamwiza is just there looking after her two children , and one named guido , works in the army bank in cyangugu , mugabo and innocent are student at ulk , two of murebwayires children namely evode and lando are high school students and the young children they had are also in high school , and one named devotha works in gakinjiro with her husband they sell timber in gakinjiro , only those .
and the right to life
if there external observers you are also asked to show your selves
they lived at , those killed in the cell where they did not live at
and give evidence saying those who had a part to play
in your different levels of work with no single decision
could have had a role in that but our consciousness
for someone to speak he must ask for permission
it is good to speak clearly so that others
about what he saw or knows someone who has been found
and it is evident that he was summoned
but before he speaks
and confession , handing yourself over and confession
the time at which the crime was committed considering when the witnesses saw it happening .
my father is called mucyowtore thomas and my birth mother is called meresiyana
can you tell us about the house
there was someone who was my worker i can see he is here , he is called prosper
i had started by talking about what happened here in gikondo where we lived
i think we liked to converse because he lived besides me
i do not know who told and immediately left
i looked myself in the house , if they had come in they would have found us that time
people liked there was some who lived there called kijyambere
that time we stayed up , we were wearing many clothes
but that time i told him to come
people like nzamurambaho were killed ...
and he told me "@ do n't to ask him about the cockroaches
we kept trading places in keeping watch so that if people come at least we know where they are coming from
and passed there then went behind
she was a mature woman , i could hear the shots ringing a lot as they kept shooting
which etienne ?
that father has sent us that come and we go
prosper went head and kept checking if there are any people near by
remained , he was called ruzagiriza
and they threw him into it
thinking that we were inside , they checked and found no one
to see if it was where i was hiding
over there at the methodists where there is a hole
but there were many things in it , i did not take anything
i was born in 1972
and put bricks over us forming something like a sort of a small trench
did he die ?
up to now the life we have we owe it all to her
in gashamvu and lived there and the war spread , after it spread we left and left them in gishamvu
at you place if you remember anything you can tell us
we were together , we jumped over and were followed by safari 's sons
they went over and he opened for them
can safari tell us his youngest son 's name ?
we decided to go and check on things at home because there were a lot shots fired as he had said
that 's when we left for mille collines
i would like you refer to your children by name
we immediately sloped together
ruzagira , so we sloped down as i had said w were coming a garden of millet
the first group left and we remained behind
particularly they kept on bowing their whistles and pointing fingers at makuza 's
and i told him that , do you trust this place here ?
the testimony i am going to give is that what this man mucyo jean dieu
they attacked the house at 2 o'clock while were there and those people had grenades
what i wanted to elaborate on was that when this man oscar died we were around although
did you go to his place ?
that this man you can see might make us encounter problems here because we have no right to be here with him
we fled together and they left me in gitarama as prosper said but they continued together with him
is it oscar we were talking about , yes ruzagirizi
this is n't the time to only give testimony is it ? i have more information on what they have talked about
the date 20/02/1994 i called for an important meeting at the stadium in nyamirambo
i gave a speech and said that , mrnd is organising mass murder of rwandese .
by then they had not included politicians of the night of 6th .
before that i had a brother who lived in remera and had spent the night at gatabazi 's last funeral rights
he went into his white mercedes jeep he owned and found me seated at home
if you are supplementing on what other people said , do so in summary
could it be gakara ,
and some tutsis , if check the names of the dead you will see this
that you might die , "@ what have i done ? @" i asked "@ you 'll die because i just found out that shamukiga was killed @" she answered
that 's when there were shoot outs ...... they almost killed many times
because even if you send him away it 's the same thing .... so we stayed at that man 's place without knowing each other and children not also acquainted as that child said
where someone accepts god to guide him , he told me to go to church and i refused
we were neighbours
i would like to know the date when they shot the people , do you know it ?
you said that you heard them shooting at gatera 's
that 's what i wanted to add , when the time comes to give my testimony , i will give a detailed account
and restore it bearing in mind that genocide was planned ,
we find here sainte famille parish . as you know it well ,
as a someone who was living in kigali , as an authority , as a person who
ladies and gentlemen , the members of gacaca court panel in front of you make up the sector court .
and intends to provide some addition to the witness 's information or ask for some clarifications .
the floor will be given first to old men and people coming from very far . the speaker must
in case of second offence , the guilty person shall be sentenced to six months up to
then signed for it , in case it is discovered it was a lie and did it intentionally .
some of its members may be attacked .
those people are those who were escaping to sainte @-@ famille church .
so , we want him
what he saw as it has been explained above and what he heard .
i guess you mean to swear !
okay !
luanda in angola in a mission too .
from luanda , on my own initiative ,
as a rwandan .
in this testimony i would like to tell you
i stayed in gommu chaired at the time by a colonel from zaire
i joined gommu one and gommu two chaired by
what i saw and heard all along my carrier
here is the succession of those governments @:
from 1994 to april sixth 1994 ,
from 1959 to 1994 .
this was implemented in schools , work places , public services , and the army ; everywhere the policy of extermination .
rwanda experienced this in 1962 , 1963 , 1967 and 1973 .
the genocide of tutsis had been planned and was perpetrated since october 1st 1990 till october 31st 1994 .
within the context of this scenario , soldiers and gendarmes from kanombe , kacyiru , kami and kigali military camps were ordered by the army staff and the gendarmerie to shoot in the air all the night .
i saw this myself because i told you i was here in the city
it is clear to one 's eyes that all unities were commanded by people from gisenyi or ruhengeri . in addition , the very unities arrested people , arrested tutsis and hutus and took them to the stadium within the context of the operation ordered by the national army staff .
as you have said that one has to say what he knows or heard , mrnd maintained this policy up to april , may and june .
they did not change at all .
as you know it , the genocide of tutsis was carried out in june and july 1992 in bugesera , kigali ngali .
the genocide of tutsis was carried out in march 1992 in gisenyi , kibirira and kibuye .
from february 25th to march 2nd 1993 rpf met mdr , pl , psd , and pdc in bujumbura and accepted the ceasefire .
in far , there was a very bad atmosphere as well .
there was such a misunderstanding that some were for mrnd , cdr , pl power were strongly against mdr uwiringiyimana 's leanings , pl lando 's leanings , and rpf supported by all tutsis in rwanda called rpf inkotanyi 's accomplices
after the death of gatabazi in february 1993 there was genocide of tutsis in kigali .
minuar was seeing that tutsis were being killed by the government of rwanda .
are you through ?
since 1959 , the governments of rwanda had been using a big number of hutus to kill tutsis whom hutus seized the property of the latter without any prosecution by the government .
please , another clarification ! did you hand the report in to habyarimana 's regime or the current regime ? i mean ours .
hello !
listen please !
note father karibushi as well .
father karibushi who received those displaced people in saint @-@ michel cathedral . this was in the center of my area . no single individual was attacked by the gendarmes under my command in saint @-@ michel cathedral .
you shall invite father karibushi . even gisimba can tell you that i did not hurt any of his children and old people .
surprisingly , i read in newspapers .... meanwhile when inkotanyi came and took people with them , mp rugema donatien went among the people .
on the way he came back to saint @-@ paul lest he should get killed . he had joined the group at saint @-@ paul and stayed with them . when i went there for their help , he immediately ran away and went to sainte @-@ famille to tell displaced people who were in that he had just escaped from death @: lieutenant @-@ colonel had taken people in a pickup and was going to kill them .
do you mean you set them to protect people who had escaped to the church ?
explain it well till we really understand . why were those interahamwe armed ?
it was among your duties to protect people so that they might not be killed . where did those people get guns from if you were not connected with them ?
so , why were they dying every single day ? it is clear in many reports and many people who had escaped there say it . how can you really explain that ? it is not clear !
they had the formation commander who was in charge of them . it was a unity under the command of the army staff .
i told them to go and protect the population in the places i mentioned . the unity under my command in the capital was the mobile group . you should only ask me about saint @-@ michel cathedral because it was in my area .
on june 17th ...
no , i did n't
this is not a trial , sir !
this is not a trial , sir !
i told you that distributing food was not among my duties .
we can not be in war and see lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi distributing to displaced people . it is not possible at all .
you can see well that he completely told lies .
i told you that i gave the order to captain ntirugiribambe to tell gendarmes to go and bring food for displaced people to father 's . i never distributed food . that accusation is wrong as well . remove it too .
may be he was confused about it . if it was me , the president or any other of the court panel ; that would really be a fake accusation and you would have won the discussion .
what are your names ?
the province is kibungo
i escaped from then . it was 2 pm . look at me carefully . i am not wrongfully accusing you .
i escaped to kiyovu . i spent three days there . you controlled the entire city together with renzaho and other soldiers .
even when you were still lieutenant , you would say that you commanded the gendarmerie , that all gendarmerie 's cars were yours , that all the property of the gendarmerie were your own property
let us just give you little information . you shall probably show us where to give more . we actually do have more .
major general munyakazi came to sainte @-@ famille many times . he was escorted by the pickup he has denied , which car travelled before his .
nyirabagenzi odette and mukandutiye angelina whose i do not know the address today ; nzamwita narcisse , a prisoner at muhima ; bagabo leonard , a prisoner at muhima as well ; codo , released and living at rugenge today ; muhutu released and living at rugenge today ; bideri , we do not know where he disappeared ; bikomagu ; mathias , a dancer in bikindi 's troop ; and nyirankeshimana .
tell us first your names then we will be asking you
raise your right hand
i come from ntenyo district , gasharu cell , kabusenyi sector , ntenyo district in gitarama
eeh , thank you ladies and gentlemen of the gacaca court panel . i will only say little of munyakazi .
i will not say much since we have been given a short time . when the war broke off i was at muhima . i was there when killings started . i left there on 14th with the help of someone who took me to sainte @-@ famille
they left and on 19th munyakazi himself came back with angelina and munyeshyaka . they said they wanted to see the gun which had been shooting at them . they did not want to have the gun actually ; they were looking for young men they might have not killed
she is called uzamusshaka
butare province
though he is saying he did not use to arrive at sainte @-@ famille ... you yourself munyakazi !
after you had just seen people at mille collines , you came and stood in the middle of the path in the church garden near a water tank . you said @: "@ those who want to be facilitated to escape should come with me @"@ .
seseko was nicknamed chief staff . they used to call him by that name . i told him about a young girl of his family who had come from mutara . actually , he was killing us while he himself was being hunted . i do not know what he had been given so to kill ! i asked him @: "@ are you going to shoot at me as you do to others while i saved a girl of your family ? @"
what is your cell of birth ?
it is an information ?
i arrived in cela on 7th at 1 p.m. on 22nd , munyakazi , renzaho , angelina mukandutiye and many others were there . i think this has even been being evoked by my colleagues
they came with kagame . kagame who is not the president of the republic . he can not be of such a riff @-@ and @-@ raff . they arrived there .
they were many . i think they took with them albert and others . i do not remember the . there might be people who do more than me .
they made people stand on their knees ... even my sister was made to .
wensislas munyeshyaka stayed in the sainte @-@ famille church . however as i told you ...
i answered all of them together . people have all been revolving around the date of june 17th and i had already explained about it to the tribunal .
was even established on june 1st 1999 .
there is someone , i think gasasira but others also said the same , who talked about eighteen young men that you might have taken away who were tied with shirts
i told interahamwe were established by mrnd and impuzamugambi by cdr . they were not equipped by laurent munyakazi
that is perfect sir ! have you just acknowledged you knew that the bodies were taken to the steward general 's office garage ?
wait !
you shall swear . raise your right hand and say @: i ...
tell us the truth father !
we did not , however , inform the displaced people over there that we resorted to this person or another
he was also appointed to going and fetch food from nyamirambo and caritas be cause he was known in high @-@ ranked soldiers
i am still on
another thing is that on the 17th when people died i had already left
that people in sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul not killed yet would be killed together without much effort of killers .
we immediately thought the latter were killing people .
for having attempted to get to the round @-@ about when hearing bullet shots -@ some were dead and others wounded @- the interahamwe said @: "@ weep not , we are soon revenging you @"@ .
because they prevented those people from getting in order to cover the scandals that were done @-
are you allowed to possess guns and military uniform ?
let 's go to mister munyakazi once again .
did you tell us that the inkotanyi came and took people from saint @-@ paul on april 16th 1994 ?
is a testimony ? tell us whether it is testimony
on that date in the morning , angelina who was the school inspector in nyarugenge arrived with munyakazi . she said that inyenzi had been shooting at her all along the night and that they were shooting from sainte @-@ famille .
parents ?
the day many people among them bidede were carried from saint @-@ paul is the day when he [ munyakazi ] carried many people among them bideli in three rounds of time .
i was listening . the barrier was set in front of kigega 's and martin 's houses . they came and said that was the task given to them by munyakazi .
i was sitting in a bar near bizimana 's house . i was listening .
after a while i saw the same car to the place where we were .
he may then explain how he did not it given he said that the displaced people comprised two parts of which one for the government in sainte @-@ famille yard . i think he must know them .
i went to sainte @-@ famille ; the gendarmes and xaverians sled me where i would be treated
that what i am going is true
he came to see the babies . as soon as he arrived , he was shot at . priests called mister general munyakazi for help . he came and entered the place where we were staying
i told an interahamwe beside me that i was hutu as well .
nsanzimana martin and kankindi anastasie
actually , tutsis from kiyovu , kimicanga and muhima had all gathered at cela
people who were frightened suggested not to fight since if we fought , we would all be killed . otherwise , in case we did not , women and children would survive .
because their mother had been interviewed for a long time , she begged to be told to call the father if they wanted him and have her children saved .
after they took and killed them there , i and one of my elder brothers were told to stand aside .
but my oldest brother who was a driver
this one entered as to go to the priest 's . he was accompanied by interahamwe who had swords and machetes rubbed with blood . it was in everyone 's sight . they had all necessary tools to kill
i would also like to beg him as a rwandan that has understood unity and reconciliation , to show me where my elder brothers were thrown so that i may worthily bury them . thank you ladies and gentlemen
martin in october 1990 when inkotanyi started the war , the sector councilor odette was an acquaintance of mine . then the time of "@ rwigema 's burial @" arrived . banana stems were brought to us so that we bury them . all of us i mean
the would @-@ be father . these thought that we wanted to pass through her and minuar so it might systematically transport those who wanted to go rpf .
there were eight gatete 's on the list . when they reached them , i thought my name will n't be read when i am still alive because i had been abducted from time to time . i decided to answer under the name of gatete .
you mean this one ?
he was there with ... the father , his partner .
they first came cutting down the bushes . he was with renzaho
to show us the eighteen people he took away or , if he killed them ,
kavurivundi and ... who were on the road .
kavurivundi told me @: "@ pray our father @"
my names are mukangarambe domithile , daughter of buyenge and mukamuganga anastasia
a man called emmanuel arrived and asked him @: "@ do you still have meat given cows have finished ? @" he replied @: "@ you already know my meat , man ! @"@ .
that is the time when i saw him talking to their driver murindwa .
no . he is dead !
i think it will be a point of view since i was not in all places he has cited . i was at saint @-@ michel
they did their best and helped us to escape to saint @-@ michel .
they came asking many questions . i introduced my self . they said they wanted to take older children to lycee notre dame .
the following day in the morning , about 4 , i went out .
i am going to talk about general munyakazi who is in front of us .
i will n't talk about his actions . he is responsible for their death before the heavenly god .
i would like to ask you to investigate about assiel 's death or ...
.... i do n't know what to say about the major general . may god consider his case !
men were separated from women . then the survivors , we escaped
they went to meet this man . they told him that people had been killed there . he already knew and that is why he was coming .
there were many people including my elder brother
i do not know much of this man but i saw him on 20th
we were found where we used to hide the day people were abducted from saint @-@ paul .
i saw munyakazi once in my life . this is my second time to see him .
born of gishoma deserved death as well .
i always prayed god . luckily the inkotanyi arrived at sainte @-@ famille
i can not know them . nuns said that they saw soldiers entering their house .
i was called by father karibushi asking to give them gendarmes to protect them though lycee notre dame was not within my area .
did you hear of that attack of april 22nd which cost lives of people , sir ?
please sir ; there are people who say you travelled in that car for humanitarian actions . what do you say ?
gisimba has even told you that all people who arrived with him and those he found there survived .
they brought them to hotel de mille collines and saint @-@ michel cathedral . you can ask the question to father blanchal .
we can not even dictate people what to say . you have seen that they even gave different experiences .
houses were not destroyed but many people died . you have yourself heard of saint @-@ paul 's and cela 's events ,
let 's go over to ...
that you facilitated father celestin to help us . he said he helped him to get water and food
it was an organ of the army and there is a way in which orders have to be executed within a military hierarchy
rather stay here with twelve guards at saint @-@ paul
i told you that on 20th , in the morning , i went to saint @-@ paul
be seated please !
in bad situations . however , when the government of rwanda implemented carried out genocide ,
it was said that i might have worked with colonel renzaho . for that reason , they started bringing fake accusations against me .
i thank the government of rwanda , the government of national unity
panel member biryogo sector also is hosting the prefect of cyangugu moussa fazhil harerimana tomorrow .
my mother was a very loving person . she used to love talking and giving advice to people .
even at her place of work people loved her very much and they would always come to seek advice from her .
family members like her younger sisters or people from my dad 's family used to feel so close to her .
nobody feared her because she was very easy going .
she treated everyone as her relatives . she would give them all she had ; she would refuse them only what she did not have .
she would really try her best to help people .
we never used to go for weddings with our parents but the thing i remember us doing together is the time we went to see a burundian musician at "@ chez lando @"@ .
we were all looking forward to it .
it was very nice because we were all together and we had a lot of fun together .
that 's the time that comes to my mind .
a soldier i did not know before murdered them . all i know is that it was a soldier and i do n't know who informed him about my family .
i know a man who was my dad 's very good friend who betrayed them .
my dad always used to go with him everywhere , in family functions like weddings or in traditional engagement ceremonies .
they used to share a drink every evening .
he was the head of interahamwes in kicukiro . he did n't help him at all , he betrayed him instead .
we even used to hide in that man 's house when the insecurity would increase before the genocide .
i remember a time my dad asked him if there was anything he could do , if he could maybe pay some money so they would not kill him .
another time , when he was wounded and sick after they shot him , my dad sent someone to ask him if there was anything he could do to help him and he still did n't do anything .
in fact he 's the one who went ahead and told the others that he [ my dad ] was still alive .
he told them to kill him and his wife and his children , as he would certainly revenge if he survived .
so he sent the second group of people who came and killed him .
they were very happy about it , my impression was that they were not at peace the times they were not busy killing .
they had the power and they were proud of them .
even after killing them , you could see them standing next to their dead bodies , like a hunter who has just found a game .
they were really happy !
i would n't call it a burial as they were thrown away .
have you ever met any of the people who were involved in the deaths of your family ?
tell me about your thoughts for the future . what sort of life 's aspirations do you have ?
i am somebody who always wants to work hard and to achieve something in life . i am not a sad person ; i am not a sorrowful person .
even when there is something that saddens me , i look for a reason to be happy .
i desire to work hard and to get somewhere in life as i know no one will have pity on me just because i am an orphan and get me there .
they will not just like me because of that , they will like me because they 'll see in me someone who is responsible for him .
that is why i want to move ahead in life .
i am not sad , i am happy .
can you tell me a little bit about your wife ?
what was she like ?
can you still believe in god after all that ?
can you forgive the people that did this ?
that 's what i was just talking about . the first thing is through educating people , to explain to people the badness that lies in doing wrong .
doing the wrong thing always has consequences on anyone .
i believe the people who did it also suffered while they were fleeing their homes , walking kilometres with their families , dying of hunger and of sickness .
it would never have happened if they did not do what they did .
for rwanda to avoid falling into the same problem again , the first thing is to teach people . i am happy about the work of today 's government , taking people in training camps and showing them all the consequences .
education is very important and i guess it will take a long time just like division was first taught in rwanda in 1959 .
and for thirty years each generation was taught hatred .
it will take the same amount of time for the next generations to be taught that hutu do not have to hate the tutsi or vice @-@ versa .
it will take long but the important thing to know is that for rwandans to get to the point of committing genocide , it took very many years .
it is something we were taught in school .
i was once a teacher and it is something that was given in the school programme .
and i myself had to say it even though i did not believe in it .
there was a lot of propaganda .
i believe rwanda needs to do a lot of teaching as it has already started it .
i do believe that if the teaching is well done , and if the example and the focus are good , the result will be very good in the next generations .
maybe people will still remember but we will always know how the policy and the teaching were wrong .
it will end slowly .
perhaps it would be very hard for the people of my generation to forget ... well one could pretend that he or she could , but there would still be something .
can you tell something about your ... tell me a happy memory from home .
can you tell me what happened to her ... your grandmother ?
please give it in a sentence .
could you discribe a moment for me the way in which the interahamwe went about comitting genocide , what did they do ? what did you see them do ?
was everybody evil ?
what happened to you after the genocide ?
where did you go ?
what did you do ?
what would be necessary for you to see that justice has been done for your mother ?
finally , who is beatha today ? what is your ... how do you discride yourself after all this ? i mean are you optimistic , are you faithful , are you hopeful ? do you ...
then i left .
yet again i met a young lady who was gathering roses for decorating her home . i said hello and asked her if they needed a housemaid .
she told me that actually they could not hire a person like me but it would be better if we asked her grandmother .
we went to her place [ she was living with her grandma ] . by the time we reached there , it was raining heavily . i was shown a place to dry up myself . i used that opportunity to dry my sarong .
that is when her grandma came to me and asked me clearly where i was coming from .
i told her that i was coming from ruhango .
"@ and how did you reach here ? @"
she asked .
i tried to lie to her , saying that i came with my parents and i never revealed to her the truth but she automatically knew what was the matter ; it was so obvious .
she then told me that she could n't take such a child among hers ; that i should try something else . her granddaughter simply liked me .
then she told me that she would take me to her father 's place .
that she would introduce me to her dad because she had no mum .
me alice as i was never knew where to pass or go .
the world felt too small for me . i used to hear people saying that inkotanyi were in nyamiyaga .
i would therefore think of a way to get there ... the girls left me and the people we were living with told me to flee with them .
"@ you never know , maybe you will see your family members at some point . " they said .
by then it was impossible to imagine that you would ever see your family members again . a time came when the war became very bad . and the people i was fleeing with were families of perpetrators running away from the inkotanyi .
she insisted that i tell her .
i told her that if i lost my mum and dad , it 's not because they were dogs . i told her that i did n't think telling her my problems could be helpful .
we almost quarrelled . then she said that i am undisciplined but i simply kept quiet .
later i saw coming to me with a polythene bag . inside the bag , there were soaps and other small things for school use . but still , what she brought was almost nothing . sincerely the things she brought us were n't an awful lot .
i know i do n't have to go to school with extraordinary school material like the ones that rich kids bring at school .
if i carry a washing soap , then that is enough for me .
she gave us ten washing soaps and three small colgate . each of us got her share .
what words did the man who first took you while you were being chased out say to you ?
what happened exactly ?
we would like to tell us in brief how it started , how you lived together and how he chased you .
are you saying in the orphanage , or ... ?
time came ... that man was a seventh day adventist .
but this time it was too much ... there is a proverb in kinyarwanda that means @: when a baby is not yours , its saliva sours .
i told him that i wanted to go and i would n't go alone .
he called me and asked me what was the matter .
i told him that it seems to be impossible for me to stay here .
but he rejected the idea .
later ... he was an adventist by then he was a leader of some church ; he used to pray from byimana .
i told him that i did n't want to go church that day ; i would like to stay at home .
in all your life time .
when he called me ... because i never used to get involved in the witnessing business , i used to find it waste of time .
therefore he asked me ; "@ alice !
you are the oldest , can n't you forgive me ? @"
i replied that , "@ it is true you did bad to me too , but i am not the one to forgive you .
his children are there , call them , and ask them to forgive you .
because we are neighbours , his wife came to me and told me the same story but i told her "@ i do n't think that is possible .
i can only decide after my cousins have said something about it @"@ .
they ended up talking to the oldest but she refused .
then there was no way i could forgive him yet those he had hurt did not .
anything else you would like to add ?
yes i am a student . i am in secondary four in the accounting section .
my dad was an employee of somirwa [ the associatin that was in charge of selling minirals ] that is where e was working .
my mum was a farmer and the children ... well since my dad was ... i was the oldest among those we shared a mum , because dad had another wife but later they got misunderstandings and ended the relationship .
she left two sons and they were older than me .
then there were four others who were younger than me .
he was a farmer .
but he had cows too because we used to graze them together .
there is no cow . you can not even find one .
they are all finished .
i went back to primary three after the war .
up to now i am still in school .
but i did not obey that law .
i just went out . they were soldiers who were camping around there . when they were going to shift to ruhengeri , i went and stood somewhere near the place where they were packing their luggage .
when they were living i left with them .
when i reached ruhe ... they did not go straight to ruhengeri , they first went to tare .
tare is also in kigali @-@ ngali [ rural kigali province ] .
they camped there .
i used to enjoy watching them using their guns , there is nothing i enjoyed more than that .
as i was standing ... in the morning , there are some people who came there where we were camping and said , "@ there are some people who are killing others . @"
and when the soldiers were about to go and help them , a soldier who had a higher rank came and said , "@ leave them ! @"
then i do n't know which other soldier said , "@ you too , go and work . @"
and because some of them did n't know what was taking place , they would ask ; "@ what work are they talking about ? @"
he responded , "@ the tutsis have killed habyarimana ; the inkotanyi killed him .
therefore , you have to kill all tutsis and wipe them out . @"
after he said so , i recalled everything grandpa used to tell me .
immediately i went back with the car that was going back to the camp . the camp was near our home .
when i got home , i found when they would hide during the day and come back at night .
and whenever i would inquire what was going on , no one would answer me .
since i had no alternative , i agreed and we sat there .
fortunately they did n't see us and at night we left the place . we went and reached a place called mbogo where we found other soldiers of habyarimana .
they took us to muhondo which is found in shyorongi but it is in zenga sector next to ruhe towards tare .
at night they told us that we were going to shyorongi .
they took us there and we camped just in front of where my grandpa used to live .
we got there ... i never thought they killed them .
i just kept thinking they ought to be there .
they never ... in my head i never thought they had died .
therefore , i decided to leave the camp and go there and when i reached my grandpa 's house , i found only ruins ; all houses had been demolished , one could n't tell which one was the bedroom .
that day i went back and the whole day i was just thinking about the situation and i was so confused .
the soldiers sent me to the station where refugees were camping , to go and buy some food .
when i reached there , i met all the other interahamwe whom we were neighbours .
but no one could tell me anything because i was in the combat uniform shirt .
then i thought some of my family members would be there .
i went round expecting to see them .
they had asked me to hurry up , so i quickly went back and found a roadblock set up by the interahamwes , with a man who was supervising it .
however , i do n't remember his name but all i know his older brother was called kanamugire ; and kanamugire is still alive .
that interahamwe had a gun , then he asked me , "@ are n't you ashamed of moving around yet we killed all your family ?
you will be the last one to be killed . @" he made me sit down at the roadside .
and then he hit my back with the gun 's butt .
i even went to hospital due to that injury and i am still suffering from it today .
you went without informing them ?
what would cross your mind during all that time you spent without talking ?
it is very difficult for me to talk about my future .
when i think about my future , the first thing that comes to my mind is to never get married .
q ...
that is something i can never understand !
i remember there is a time i joined vocational training that was organized by farg .
there was a lecture on reconciliation .
i could n't attend it . in fact i almost got a trauma attack and walked out . there were other students who also rejected it , and finally they decided to stop the lecture .
they reported that we disliked the lecture about reconciliation .
personally i do n't believe in reconciliation and forgiveness .
because i believe that in order to forgive somebody , he or she has to first confess that he @/@ she killed and he @/@ she should narrate the whole story in details without telling lies .
otherwise , most people accept their crimes for the sake of getting their sentence reduced .
i can n't believe in reconciliation ... take the example of the old man called nshaka ; when i was young , i was told about his deeds back in 1973 .
and then recently i witnessed him doing the same things .
how can you ever reconcile with such a person ?
because it is very clear that whenever he is with his children , he is teaching them how tutsis are bad .
that is why i never think about reconciliation in my life .
well , normally a family is made up of a father and a mother .
i have none of the two .
however , i have relatives and my older brother ; he is the first born in our family .
currently we are three ; we used to be eight but five died and three survived .
now i am living with my older brother who wasliving in burundi before .
yes there is .
i believe he is the third born . he was a soldier but later he was demobilized .
yes i could tell , because we knew where our relatives used to go ; some relatives from bugesera joined inkotanyi .
for example if some one escaped his family and joined inkotanyi , that family would be in trouble . his family would be spied all the time .
they could say , that person 's family has inkotanyi .
therefore , we should keep an eye on his family .
everybody could see what was taking place . secondly , there was a radio called ‘ muhabura ’ which was under the supervision of the inkotanyi .
one had to hide under the bed in order to listen to it .
and then tune it on .
no one could listen to it in public .
so , even a young child could know notice what was taking place ; sometimes kids would ask , "@ how come when we want to listen to radio muhabura we first hide under the bed , while we listen to radio rwanda in public ? @"
then the adults would explain to us that there was a problem and so on .
the inkotanyi used to put a program for boosting people 's morale on the radio and the adults would be very happy .
so , one [ a child ] could ask , "@ how come you become happy while listening to those songs of morale [ hope ] ? @"
then they would answer , "@ there are our children singing with inkotanyi . @"
but our neighbors especially the hutu neighbors were not happy at all .
for example , if there was a person who joined the inkotanyi , or a family whose member joined the inkotanyi , that was reason enough to hate the entire clan [ tutsi ] because they used to say that all tutsi were inkotanyi .
in fact , by then we were no longer called inkotanyi , we were called ‘ snakes ’ .
that is how bad things used to be .
we ran and those nterahamwe soldiers followed us , with bullets passing over our ears and whoever could not run any longer , interahamwe would catch you and hit your ankles and knees .
i ran up the hill while they were lagging after me , but because i was n't the only target i led them by far ; i left them because they could stop on the way to burn houses , kill other people that were caught .
i finally managed to escape them .
i ran until i reached home .
i told them , " you are finished . you are dead . @"
by then my sister and other relatives who had come from several sectors were at home .
that is the last day i saw my family members and those were the last words i said to them .
after telling them those words i took off .
but as i was running , bullets were passing me ; i was chased and shootings had increased .
then when i reached somewhere in a banana plantation , i found my grandpa ; he was very old to the extent of dropping his teeth .
he was making very slow steps .
when he saw me he called me , i answered him , "@ yes i am listening grandpa . @"
then he asked me , " i can see some people running this way and others taking the other way , where am i supposed to pass ? @"
i answered him in few words , "@ grandpa , take any way you wish . @" then i went on running .
we could go and search for sweet potatoes and boil them .
we could only cook at night .
we would put the potatoes in the pot [ that is before they broke our pots ] and add dirty rainwater , which was stagnating from the rocks .
[ it was the rainy season ] .
we would fetch that water and use it to cook the potatoes .
that is when we used to ask one another , where is so and so ?
one would say , "@ so and so was killed , we were together but i escaped the interahamwe . @"
then we would know that one of our friends was dead .
that 's the kind of life we lived .
we stood up and started walking , i had two raw potatoes and the other boy had two as well , we had kept them for chewing while we were on our journey .
we started our journey at around seven o'clock in the evening .
in our plans , we wanted to go through kajevuba because there was a way that leads to ririma .
then from that road we would take either gashora or ngenda .
but when we were about to reach nyamata , we heard a group of people coming down from kayumba , they had goats , and we heard voices from so many people , we immediately hid in the bush near that road .
we could hear them saying , "@ i got a nice bed from the house of so and so . @"
they were carrying beds , basins , and goats ; in fact i remember a goat tried to graze at a bush where we were hiding , and i was afraid they would see us but it was at night and it was dark .
so , they could not see us .
somebody pulled the goat and fortunately the whole group passed without seeing us .
we stood up and walked to kajevuba .
it was by god 's will that we were not killed throughout the way .
then we continued that road up to a place called karera near gashora .
therefore , we stayed together but my cousin was an expert in spotting where the attackers would come from ; it seemed as though he was communicating with god . that is what i 'd call it .
he would organize us and walk ahead of us .
whenever he could hear the attackers coming up the hill , he would let us know and we would escape , running towards where the interahamwe were coming from ; in a way that we would go behind the interahamwe .
sometimes they would see us but we could run .
by then we were four from the same family .
one day three of us were hiding and the older cousin had hid somewhere else .
i remember a group of attackers discovered us .
some people ... a family of interahamwe , a man with two wives and very many sons and daughters .
in fact his children were grown ups [ the man was old by then ] . this man 's children had called themselves ‘ abandagaye ’ because they were very many .
[ meaning the irresponsible ones ] . his children had made their own group of attackers , and in case they caught you , you would simply say goodbye to your beloved ones .
because they never would let you go . they could hunt a person until they got him or her .
therefore , three of us were hiding together and ‘ abandagaye ’ found us out ; this is when i realized god was with us .
my youngest cousin swiftly run and they did saw him . but that group ambushed my other cousin and me .
two of the attackers were slightly behind us and two others ahead .
so , what happened ; my older cousin jumped out of where his hiding place and ran down the hill towards the valley .
then the attackers followed him , thinking that all the people who were hiding had run to the valley .
when i saw that , i ran back to where the attackers came from .
they ran after him . he was caught and killed . "@ may his soul rest in eternal peace . @" that is what i can say .
peole started ... that time many people died again .
those who would have survived , after hearing that news they came out of their hiding places because they thought that inkotanyi ( rpf ) were near .
then my older brother with other young boys and men organized themselves . some of them knew shortcuts .
rpf troops gave out a sign when they got closer , in a place called juru .
the rpf troops shot in the air .
then two helicopters from habyarimana 's side went towards where the inkotanyi were .
a few minutes later we heard fire .
there was a lot of noise due to the shootings .
then we said that inkotanyi must have been there where shootings were taking place .
we were about 24 people . so , we decided to go and join the inkotanyi [ rpf ] . if it costs death , we shall die .
but there was a young man from a place called mwogo who knew the way .
we were given machetes , bows and arrows .
i was also told about my other sister who was married .
i heard that there was a lady whom they worked together , they were both primary teachers .
my sister asked her if she could hide her but she refused saying , " go away , do n't die from here . @"
by then my sister was with some lady and it is that lady who told me this .
fortunately that other lady survived .
normally the army is a society that reforms and changes a person from what he was to becoming a different person .
i can give you a personal example ; if i had never joined the army , i would n't have become who i am today .
i would n't have been able to leave with the hutu .
but after i joined the army , i came to know the truth ... ok [ let 's leave this subject ] .
i see the way they postpone things and if there is no immediate justice in rwanda , if there is no truth , if there is no trial proceeding , and if there is no clear punishment , which is an important foundation then i can assure that there will be no unity .
nowadays they prioritised hutus and interahamwe ; it seems like they force the interahamwe to admit their crimes .
but how can one force someone to accept his or her crimes ?
that is where things go wrong .
or how can one force someone to ask for forgiveness ?
because one admits his or her mistakes and later asks for forgiveness after realising that he or she really did wrong . but in our case , people are forced to ask for forgiveness yet in reality they [ perpetrators ] do n't even accept that they killed .
that act may later on lead rwanda into problems .
another thing is the perpetrators are the ones who are catered for .
the survivors are not remembered , no one talks for them [ survivors ] . the government and gacaca court are biased .
if the gacaca court does not work in transparency , they will not reconcile people .
eh , before the genocide ... well , i was living with my parents . i was in primary school .
i was with my younger brothers .
i had a good life with no concern as far as school fees are concerned ; we were living in peace as a family .
but later things changed .
bad times came from april 1994 ; that is when we started suffering due to the genocide .
people were hunted , i lost my family members ; i had about sixty relatives but they all died and i am the only one survivor .
i suffered ... i went through so many problems , the roadblocks , and things of that sort .
but because my [ last ] day had n't reached , nothing happened to me .
later the inkotanyi saved me .
but still , they only saved me because we met at the place where they were fighting . they used to take some people , not everyone and then they would advance .
how old are you ?
they were accused of being inyenzi traitors .
they were again accused of having friends in exile , such things .
before 1990 , people used to come to rwanda from exile maybe they were coming to visit their relatives .
but things changed , they stopped coming .
there was no more communication among people since then .
the interahamwe who would do that were always accompanied by an older person to direct them saying , "@ go there ... @" someone who knew the place very well .
therefore , we decided to flee but we never managed to flee in the morning .
people got killed that particular night .
we were hearing gunshots the whole night . and some of our neighbours had already put roadblocks on the streets near our home .
that 's how they started killing people .
you did not clearly explain about that long line of people , where was that line coming from ?
was it the people who had hid there ... ?
do you know how your family members died ... ? i mean your brothers and sisters and your mum .
you told us that your dad was shot ...
generally , during the genocide , i suffered a lot because i got many problems yet ...
what was bothering you while you were at school ?
what i would do , i would go to some place where i would keep myself busy especially to my former house .
i thank god that i did n't rent a house .
and as far as school fees were concerned , i would n't bother much because the funds [ f.a.r.g , fond d' assistance aux rescapes du genocide ] would help us .
we appreciate their help for our school fees because we would go to school saying , "@ let 's study maybe tomorrow we will be able to improve our lives . @"
the message i can give them ... well they should first admit their crimes .
after they have admitted that they killed , the next step would be easy .
because if you deny that you killed yet they are witnesses who accuse you to have killed , i believe it is better to accept that you committed the crime .
what do you think you ... [ bad sound ]
such a person will live a lonely life , in anxiety . at the end of the day , all this does not really matter .
the best thing i would advice such a person is to concentrate on life ... to look for a way to improve his or her life .
they should say , "@ since this happened , let me be the first one to fight against it .
i saw this with my own eyes .
i saw how someone from one ethnic group hacked someone else from another ethnic group or someone who did not share their political beliefs . @"
therefore , i believe the best thing is to first of all get it out of one 's mind , to forget it .
well , there is a way you can forget something in the head but it is still in your heart .
and there is also a way one can completely forget ; truly believing that to keep on remembering is a waste of time .
this testimony we are getting from you is going to be kept in a special way .
people may see it after ... when you are very old .
even your kids may see it or your grandchildren because it will be kept in the safest possible way .
what message can you give to people in general , but more specifically to your future children , in relation to what happened .
anything else you would like to add ?
they went on , "@ they have something in common and it shows .
look at them !
there is no way you can lie that they belong to you .
and , if they belong to your wife 's brother , it means that your wife is a tutsi though we thought she was a hutu .
therefore , she must die together with them . because there is no tutsi entitled to survive from this land .
then that man imagined and said , "@ impossible !
you can not kill my wife .
it is impossible , how can you kill my wife ? she is not a tutsi .
maybe it is just something that occurred in a family where she is related to the father of these kids . @"
then they called his wife and asked her , "@ how are you related to these kids ? @"
she said , "@ they are my nieces . @"
then they angrily left . while leaving they said , "@ we shall come back for you . @"
as they had just left ... meanwhile , that man told them that , "@ at least take the cows and maybe if you are to come back , we should talk about other thinks but do n't kill the kids or my wife .
i will tell you the truth . @"
then , in a small distance , there were other attackers in the coffee plantation .
therefore , they came at once and took the cows .
one of the cows was very aggressive yet it was the fattest of all . so , as they would try to take it out , it would act violently trying to kill them .
so it ran and how they killed it , one would hack at the neck and another on would cut the tail , till when some of them aimed from in front of it and hacked it 's cloven hoof .
then the cow could n't move anymore ; it fell down .
and after it fell down , how they slaughtered it ... it horrible ; one would cut the leg and go .
and , the other one would take off the head and go , another one would take the other leg , until when the skin was left on the floor .
then they took the cow outside , hacking it .
they never used slaughter cows , they would kill it in a way that would let you think that ; if they got you , they would kill you more painful than a cow .
if someone can kill a cow like that ; "@ hacking off the neck and another one cutting off the tail or any other part that appears close to him ! @"
then one would imagine , "@ what about me as a human being and yet the target ? @"
one would imagine how she or he is going to die , and then she @/@ he would get confused .
after they took the cow ... it was mooing all the way . i constantly heard it up to the time it disappeared completely .
it mooed in pain ; they would hack it like this ... they would just hack . they would n't lay it down for slaughter and remove the skin first , never ! they would only hack anywhere no matter which part it was .
if one hacked at the head , then he would take it like that while it was dripping blood .
if another one hacked off the leg , then he would take it like that with its skin on .
in order to make it lay down , they would hack its hoof joints ; they would hack one by one until when it could n't move any further and then fall down .
so , they took that cow and told him , " we are still not convinced .
we shall come back so that you explain to us the history .
because if you agreed to keep gahizi 's kids , there must be another connection between you and him . of course your connection can not be based on nothing . @"
but the old man denied , "@ there is no relationship at all .
the kids who were here left , and they were here as kids of the neighborhood . @"
then they said , "@ wait , we shall come back and talk about it and the day we will find anything here , you will be in trouble .
we shall demolish your house and kill you with your wife .
because apparently it is explanatory that you are supporting them . @"
so , they took that man and ... they said to him , "@ we looked for you all the time but you were no where to be seen .
yet we know you corroborate with inyenzi .
you are going to tell us every thing plus their [ inyenzi ] plans . @"
then he told them that , "@ do as you wish ... @" he was a quiet man .
he told them that , they should do as they want ; "@ if you want to kill me with my wife kill us , and if you do n't want to kill us , them leave us . @"
a certain man was holding that sharpened stick and struck it to him in the ribs .
another person pushed it deep into him and it appeared from the other side .
then he pulled it out and the intestines came out .
his wife immediately fell down and they did the same thing to her .
after piercing her , they pulled out the stick and her intestines came out too .
then , he [ killer ] reached for her intestines and pulled them so hard while the lady was lying down . i would see it from a distance .
he pulled the lady 's intestines and tied them with the husband 's intestines ; you could see that he was struggling to tie them together because he would shake almost falling down .
then he tied their intestines together and then one of them told his fellow who was tying them , "@ after tying them , make them stand up and ask them to stop us as the used to do . @"
that is how he told the fellow .
i was watching them ; i was in a bout five meters distance but i was in the sorghum plantation .
therefore , the man replied that , "@ we can not stand , it is impossible . @"
they were lying down .
then the perpetrator said , "@ okay stop us again from moving . this is our government and we shall do what we wish to do or want .
so , show us that you can stop us now . @"
"@ hey you @" he said to me , "@ find somewhere else to hide , i do n't want to see you in this house . @"
"@ i will n't enter in your house , i keep outside with other kids @" i replied him .
therefore we sat and other kids told me that , "@ do you know that doudou died ? @"
i replied them that i know .
then they told me that they saw the place where dogs ate her from .
"@ she was wearing a jumper that looks like this ... @" and one would say , "@ i saw her leg @" and the other one would say , "@ i saw her head ... but dogs already ate her . @"
i told them that , "@ i know dogs ate her .
and i am the only one surviving . @"
some lady called toyota saw me and wondered , "@ you are still alive !
where are you since all your people died ?
you survived in order to live with the agony of your people .
let me take you where they would kill you very fast . @"
i told her that i will n't go from where i was , "@ they should find me here . @" i said .
therefore , i stayed there with other kids on the roadside .
they would talk and sing in whistles but me ... maybe it was because i was on the road expecting anybody to come at anytime and identify me out of others and kill me .
one would come and say , "@ this kid must die though we do n't know her home .
because she does n't look like others . @"
umh !
the old man got scared when he heard that person , who knew all my background from my mother 's side .
then he immediately told him that , "@ do as you wish .
you though about it and you made a step to come here , god can witness of what i worked for ... @" but as he was talking , they were not listening .
"@ do what you want . @"
he told them .
then they said , "@ what should we do ? @"
and pastor said , "@ if you want to remain with the kid , stay with her but give out the remaining cows to be eaten . @"
"@ i can not give out the cows .
the remaining cows ... i worked and i have been struggling all these months ... @" he replied them [ it was about two months ] "@ it has been almost two months looking after the kids and properties and now you want to take all things from me and i will be the looser . @"
the old man added and he told them that it was impossible .
then pastor said quickly that , "@ well , so they should kill the kid but still , after killing the kid even the cows will never stay here .
of course some other people will come and say that gahizi 's cows are still there .
yet they must die too by all means .
so , you have to make your choice . @"
the old man said , "@ okay , instead of killing the kid , take the cows . @"
whenever i would hear some people coming i would face into the water and pretend like i was fetching water .
therefore , they would hear that somebody is fetching water .
until when a digging season reached and she would send to the garden for weeding .
i would spend the whole day going through my agony ... i would think about that all the time and it would never finish .
i felt like i should think about those events only . i never wanted to forget about it even a single moment .
i would imagine how they died , how they rested , i would imagine how they bare no more problems and then imagine how i was going to suffer .
i would try to see the life i was gong to lead but i would not get it .
i would see a group of people coming like attackers ... that time they were not using dogs ; they were hunting people by themselves .
they would go to suspects ' homes , to the sorghum plantations ; they would go there by themselves .
it had reached tome of harvest and some sorghum was cut down .
and it seemed very clear in the plantation . i knew i was going to die .
i asked myself , "@ where will i go ? @"
therefore , i went there and suddenly they saw me coming in at around 6:30 .
so they asked me , "@ what has happened ? @"
i told them that , "@ i have come . @"
so the old lady asked me , "@ why have you come .
well here the war stopped .
few people are moving . @" it was in the end of july .
"@ few people are moving you can sit here and tell me what happened where you were . @"
then i told her that , "@ there , beatrice would take me to dig , send me to fetch water alone while her kids would stay at home .
she would tell me that i must work since she hid me .
when i realized that i can not manage , i decided to come here . @"
she welcomed me and i lived there .
with in few days i heard that my sister was still alive .
the person , who told me that , seemed to be my second enemy .
"@ you are telling me that doudou is alive ? @"
she died and dogs ate her while we were together .
i am sure about it .
even other people told me about it .
now you are saying that she is alive ?
how ?
the inkotanyi had never arrived there ?
which month was that ?
what about her home ?
you went back to your place then you found out the doors of your house on ...
then after the genocide , you went to live with relatives .
now it 's ten years ago , do you ... ?
as far as unity and reconciliation is concerned , i think ... just the fact that one recognizes the wrong they 've done makes their sentence less severe .
but personally , i do not agree with that way of doing it .
this should be the case only if the killer feels guilty of what they did because otherwise , it would be a way of reducing their punishment while they do not have any conscience .
i am saying this because you can meet somebody ... i always meet many people ... when you meet somebody whom you saw killing , they take a different route or they turn back and flee .
if it were somebody who has truly acknowledged their wrong ... or maybe they only did it in order to have their punishment reduced because if they had truly confessed , they should even be able to recount everything in details especially because they know very well there 's nothing we can do against them .
because if that was your intention , if you wanted them imprisoned , you 'd know where to find them anyway .
that 's why i do not agree with the whole process .
personally , i would n't release a prisoner just because they 've acknowledged their wrong deeds .
maybe it was fine at first ; it looked like a way of reducing problems , at least that 's the impression it got .
that 's what i think .
you will hear people saying that anyone would agree to plead guilty just to have their punishment reduced and that does n't necessarily mean that they feel guilty for the wrong they did .
they are n't even able to publicly confess and to recount the events of the time in details .
you know very well that when you have something on you conscience , talking about it does you good .
the weight of it feels much lighter once you 've shared it with someone else .
do you have anything to add on ?
my sister stayed there and i stayed at my godmother 's place .
two days later ... i think it was two days , my godmother came and told me , "@ i will not continue to hide you because they may kill me too . @"
she went on to say , "@ you remember you came here with your sister and your mum and you know they left .
it is better you follow them . @"
i asked her how i was going to follow them yet i did n't know where they had passed . i told her i did not know which way to take . she told me it was none of her business .
"@ whether you die or survive it is your problem @"@ , she said .
that is what she told me .
in the morning ... i remember i was sick ; i had a terrible wound on the knee , i could n't walk properly .
in the morning , it was even raining , i left alone and sat on the road wondering what i was going to do .
then i advised myself to go to that place where we first hid when the war had just started .
it was in runda .
therefore i went back there .
however the man was very motivated into genocide issues .
fortunately , his sons were good people .
so they interceded on my behalf , "@ this is a very young kid , they will never ask her for identification papers .
so why worry ?
just keep her until the war is over . @"
they went on to convice him , "@ the interahamwe do n't know her , in case they come , she will tell them that she is your granddaughter . @"
there are some questions we would like to ask you ... first , you told us that you were thrown into the river ; you and your sister , and later you came out of it .
is it because the waters did n't want to kill you ... ?
which river was it ?
well according to what you have told me ; it seems like all that happened was in the context of gacaca .
tell me , when one admits their crime , does it mean they have also admitted that they killed people ?
you may say that genocide survivors are this or that way , they encounter such or such problems , and they feel this way ... considering their living and all that is happening to them as they are trying to solve their problems .
a message related to memory .
a massage about what took place especially in these days where there is a tendency of forgetting what happened .
any advice you can give to a genocide survivor and if possible , you can tell something to those who did those things [ killings ] .
thank you .
as dad was defending himself , he also shot him on the right hand , it almost got cut off .
he became very weak and fell down but he was still alive .
when the interahamwes came ... i mean the inkotanyis came and followed him and killed him .
they took us to rebero where there were other people that same evening .
all the people from our neighbourhood who had not been injured or who were okay were in that group .
two days later , when the inkotanyis saw that there were bombs being thrown from the airport , they told us to go to gishushu where the offices of the conseil national de developpement [ cnd ] were .
we got into a daihatsu and went to cnd .
the interahamwes were still throwing bombs there but they did n't know that some inkotanyis were scattered in the surrounding neighbourhood .
before genocide , mother was a teacher at kicukiro , dad was a businessman .
because she was a teacher , when we went to nyanza , some of her students who had machetes recognized her and protected her saying @: "@ this is our teacher ... @" our neighbourhood was - i would say @- difficult because that 's where some important leaders of the mouvement revolutionnaire [ mrnd ] were living , it was sort of their head quarters .
do you remember some of the people who did it or do you sometimes see them today ?
i 'd like you to please tell us their names if you know them .
tell me how you felt about it all despite the fact that you were still very young ?
how did you feel when you 'd go and come back ?
my grandma was killed with machetes .
as far my uncle ... my mom 's father was shot in his car as he was fleeing , that 's all i was able to know .
i do n't know how the rest were killed .
yes , do you think suspicion will ever stop ?
what are your plans ?
anything you 'd like to add on to this ?
about a week after my father 's death , that was when shyaka , the soldier i was talking about came . he was the son of nsengiyumva innocent .
he asked , "@ how could you kill nicolas and leave his children ? why did n't you eliminate them all ? @" by then i was in secondary [ form one ] .
then the killers added , "@ especially his son who goes to school .
he knows all the secrets of inkotanyi .
he is part of them .
therefore , he must be killed ! @" my older brother burabyo gabriel was hiding at rusizana 's house .
one night rusizana bought my brother beer while he was supposedly hiding him .
gabriel took the beer and got drunk . then rusizana made him talk loudly . the gang of perpetrators , which worked with shyaka climbed the fence and got inside .
they go him and the last word i heard him saying was , "@ rusizana , why did you betray me ?
we fed on the same breast , how could do this to me ? @"
from what i heard ; when my mum was breastfeeding gabriel , rusizana 's mother stopped breastfeeding him . therefore , my mother would breastfeed both rusizana and gabriel at the same time . they shared the same breast , the way twins do .
my brother was about 27 years .
he first fought the killers but they stabbed him ; i heard him screaming .
there was moonlight , so i quietly followed them , shifting from place to place to see how they would kill him .
they killed him at a certain bush but i never went closer to the bush and i could n't see clearly although it was on moonlight .
they killed him ; they finished him up .
therefore , i decided to go to them doubting if they would accept me in their home .
as i was still knocking on the door ... my elder brother and my younger brother serubibi guido used to come to eat in the same home and after they would go back to their hidouts .
but they had a special way of knocking in that home .
therefore , when i reached there , i knocked on the door but no one responded .
i knocked and knocked but there was no response .
it was becoming bright and morning was coming then my brother rudahunga michael saw me and he came towards me .
he asked me , "@ how are you !
i thought they killed you , how did you escape them ? @"
i started telling him what had happened but he stopped me because it was a long story .
he took me to a man called nzaramba whose wife was called mujawimana francoise , she worked at a certain hospital ; she was an assistant nurse .
i spent there about three nights and she warmed water and washed me . she treated the injury that i had .
i spent about three days there .
q ... [ bad sound ]
does that mean that between 1990 and 1994 they never tortured you , did they do anything bad to you ?
how many corpses were exhumed from that pit ?
but did you think their zeal to kill was normal ?
there 's this man , the soldier you told us about , did you know him ?
how old was he ?
some people hid you , the home where you knocked and your brother was hiding ... why were they different from others ? why did they stand by you ?
do you ever miss your childhood ?
what do you think about reconciliation , do you think it is possible in rwanda ?
i would like to ask you something that i forgot to ask you before .
how do you feel whenever you pass by the pit latrine you were dumped or how do you feel when you think about it ?
apart from here , do you normally have people you share this with ?
my name is mukamusoni speciose ; i live in kimironko but before i used to live in muhima ... muhima sector .
i was born in ntongwe commune in gitarama prefecture that 's where my parents used to live and they died from there during the genocide .
during that time was your family attacked ?
then it reached a time when habyarima came to power in 1973 .
would you tell us briefly what happened and how your family was treated ?
eh in 1994 .... habyarimana died on 6th , i think it was on wednesday around nine in the morning .
it 's when it was announced on radio rwanda that habyarimana has died on a plane crash .
then they started killing tutsi people , who used to live around kanombe .
areas like kabeza , kicukiro ... those areas of hotel chez lando in remera .
soldiers took up those areas and killed every tutsis around those places .
and sudenely the killings had spread every where in the city .
it was just through god 's grace that you got a hiding place .
yes !
you see ... how we separented ... my husband was an accountant in a certain hardware store in kigali , and he knew many businessmen in town .
so he went to seek asylum there but later , a certain soldier took him ; he was from the presidential guard unit and his name was rurangiza .
i do n't even know that so called rurangiza , maybe if we met on the way we would pass by each other .
so , he [ ruranngiza ] first asked him what he was .
and when my husband said that he was a tutsi , the soldier laughed mockingly and said , "@ i have killed so many tutsi and this one is going to be the last victim in my hands . @"
he held his gun and fired over my husband 's head and my husband fell down .
he was latter taken to chk [ a hospital ] together with other wounded people and he was dressed .
let me ask you another question , after the genocide , you know very well that people died in various ways .
however some are still alive , for example ladies who were raped , people who were handicapped in many ways due to the atrocities .
do you have some of your family members who got such problems ?
let us proceed . i would like to ask you another question .
whatever maybe the case , a nation is built by its natives when they put their hands together .
and as you said earlier that after the genocide , some people divided themselves into separete divisions .
which divisions , seem to be helpless as far as developing our country is concerned .
so , what can you talk about the development of our country ... what can you predict about her future ?
personally ?
my name is mudahogora ernestine .
i was born in bugeserain ntarama district .
my father was called karinamaryo peter and my mother was called mukagasisi veronica .
we were seven in my family but i am the only one who survived .
to start with , i know we migrated to bugesera but that was not our origin .
our origin was ruhengeri .
we migrated in 1959 escaping the hutu persecutions .
when we were young kids , we used to hear our father saying that there used to be a very big forest where they used to live .
so he would tell us how it was not very easy for them while they were fleeing .
they were lucky they managed to reach bugesera .
he used to tell us ... he was once the chief 's personnel assistant , [ this is what i used to hear him saying when we were young kids ] .
so , on their way while coming they asked him , " hey you !
what 's your name ? @" he replied them , "@ my name is karinamaryo @" because that was his name .
so habyarimana 's soldiers asked him again , "@ karinamaryo ? @"
meaning ‘ the shrewd one ’ . they went on and said , "@ can you imagine ? listen to this guy .
so go ahead and show us your shrewdness @"@ .
so again i told my sister , " hope you have heard what the policemen said . i guess you can guess what will be next .
you will see if those who will spend the night here will survive until tomorrow .
i told her , "@ let us go to the schools , we immediately left and went to the schools .
just after we left , they threw grenades at the ntarama church .
they killed everybody ; the survivors are handicapped today .
anyway , we continued and went to the school .
at that time , the only safe hide out was at the school .
for those who managed to survive nyamata or anywhere else in the whole of bugesera , the only hideout was at the school .
we went and spent the night at the school .
we used to spend the night there , and during the day we would go loitering in the swamps but we had never slept there because the interahamwe used to go home at around 4 o'clock and we would go behind them and go back to the school .
so he came in .
i do n't know why he came ; maybe he had come to loot .
because he knew that house , he came with other people and i heard them hit the door .
my heart was beating very fast out of panic .
my wounds had started rotting and there was pus all over .
i felt so much pain ; it was beyond death .
i was feeling stiff . i just thought of how he was going to hack me inside those wounds .
he pushed the door where i was then said , "@ oh my !
that is how you are looking now ? @"
did you continue to study after the genocide ?
what do you think about unity and reconciliation ?
how was the situation at home after he was caught ?
do you know how they were killed ?
where you here during the war ?
tell us your name .
dad was taken after , on the 14th .
whenever i come here , i feel pain … do i talk about everything else ?
right here where we are ?
my name is mrs. pierrot helene moonback .
we have been living in this cell nyakabanda since 1986 .
when we arrived there , they were very many peole ; the natives but the majority were the tutsis who at the same time faced problems .
this place is called nyakabanda cell and before , it was known to be part of kanombe district but after 1990 when the war started it was made to be part of kicuciro district up to now .
but we could hear them asking him that , "@ but they appear on the list ! @"
they had a list of names on a shit of a paper .
therefore , they would ask him , "@ their names appear on this list . @"
and , others would say , "@ these people are belgians and even if they were n't , their parents ( mothers ) were tutsis because there is no belgian who ever married a hutu .
which means they are tutsis . @"
then , i could hear some voices saying , "@ heee ... they have two sins ; the first one being the fact that they are belgians and the second one , being tutsis . @"
however , that man pleaded and pushed them back .
they used to hacke them ... they could be hacked because those days you would bribe to be shot .
or else one wwould be so kind to shot you . otherwise they could be hacked and others would be hit to death using clubs .
they joined the interahamwe later but before they were our neighbours ; they were people we knew very well . when we came back , they were the people who seized our properties .
we found spiked clubs in their homes ... lonng knives ; they left them in their home and ran away .
however , in our area , the interahamwe who were led by aloys , were the ones who did all those deeds .
the people who killed them what were they like ?
were they soldiers ?
personally would you like other people to also know that there are some people who died from here ?
they were shot .
yeah , i do .
could you please introduce youself ?
when did it all start ? was it after habyarimana 's death ?
was rwagapfizi also hiding here ?
these people were removed from ...
