/nfs/isd/jlee/SMT/african/my_git/scripts/kin_sent_fsts/109/fe445d64ee94d8928beb36cfd3df0bb5.fst	kayibanda was given power by the belgian colonialists . kyibanda was there for some time then habyarimana toppled him .

/nfs/isd/jlee/SMT/african/my_git/scripts/kin_sent_fsts/172/523f11715070c86f1326cd2bc8020638.fst	he had lived with french people .

/nfs/isd/jlee/SMT/african/my_git/scripts/kin_sent_fsts/437/15d304804996fd66caec45446c473751.fst	then after the republic of kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in rwanda and then habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the french who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 .
/nfs/isd/jlee/SMT/african/my_git/scripts/kin_sent_fsts/277/697eb3088a91897ac5e67583b8201a05.fst	in a way , up to today you see how the french were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all .
/nfs/isd/jlee/SMT/african/my_git/scripts/kin_sent_fsts/52/ec66f74af1e24de47988a660a7505de8.fst	is there anything you can say about that ?
