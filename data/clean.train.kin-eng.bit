my name is odette umulisa , daughter of matthias kamuhanda and of yulida nyiramatama . ||| nitwa umulisa odette , nkaba ndi mwene kamuhanda mathias na nyiramatama yulida ;
i am from mabanza commune , in a place called rubengera , in rubengera sector , in mataba cell . ||| nkaba nkomoka muri commune mabanza aho baita i rubaengair , secteur rubaengair , ariko mu mataba ; sellule ni mu mataba iwacu .
we were many in my family ... we were many . ||| nkaba nrakomokaaga mu muryango turi abana benshi ... turi benshi .
i had 4 brothers called alfred , edouard , uwitonze and shumbusho . ||| nri nfite basaza banjye bane ; hari uwitwaga alfred na edouard n' uwitonze na shumbusho .
shumbusho is still alive today . ||| shumbusho ariko we ubu yarasigaye .
i had one little sister called ngirabakunzi . ||| nkaba nri nfite murumuna wanjye umwe , witwaga ngirabakunzi .
but she did n't ... no ne was ab ... she did n't survive . ||| ariko we nta ... nta n' umwe washo ... we ntiyasigaye ;
only my brother shumbusho , my mother and i survived in my family . ||| iwacu umuntu ushoboye kusigara ninjye na musaza wanjye shumbusho , na mama .
my father also passed away . ||| papa nawe yarapfuye ntawe uriho .
i would say it all started when i was still very young . ||| ibintu bitangiye ... njyewe nvuga ko ibintu bitangiye nkiri muto cyane ,
i remember how when i was in primary school , they used to tell us to stand every year and then they 'd ask us to tell them about our ethnicity . ||| njyewe nraibuka ko nri ku ishuri kuri primaire ; buri mwaka bajyaaga batubwira ngo tuhagurukae tukahaguruka , bakatubaza ubwoko , ubwo rero tukivuga .
i remember how the first time they told us to stand up , they told the hutus to stand up and then the tutsis , i was in primary iii and that was the first time i was seeing something like this . ||| ariko nraibuka ko umunsi wa mbere batuhagurutsa ... nraibuka ko umunsi wa mbere batuhagurutsa baravuze ngo abahutu nibahaguruke n' abatutsi nibahaguruke nigaaga muri 3ieme primaire ( umwaka wa gatatu w' amashuri abanza ) nicyo kihae nri nbonye ibyo bintu bitangiye . ariko nraibuka ko ntari nzi n' icyo nri cyo , kuko nrakomeje nraicara . abandi barahagurutse ,
i did n't know what tribe i was and thus i remained seated . ||| igice cya mbere kirahaguruka njyewe nsigara nicaye .
the rest stood up , first the group of the hutus , then the tutsis . ||| icyari icy' abahutu , icya kabiri nacyo kirahaguruka ariko ntinhaguruka kuko ntinri nbizi . ariko mwarimu utuigishaaga kuko turi tuturanye yari azi ubwoko bwanjye ,
our teacher was also a neighbour and she knew my tribe as she knew my father ; he asked me why i did not stand up and i asked her why i should have stood up and she asked me @: "@ do n't you know you 're tutsi ? @" ||| kuko yari azi papa aranbwira ati @: « odette kuki utahagurutse ? » nramubwira nti kuko maitresse unbwira ngo mpaguruke ? niko twamwitaga .
then i stood up ; i remember how my friends started mocking me saying @: "@ so you 're also tutsi ? @" ||| aranbwira ati @: « ese ati wowe ntabwo uziko uri umututsi ? » ntahaguruka , nraibuka ko inshuti zanjye tuiganaaga utwana duto ,
that 's how i states learning things about ethnicity . ||| twarantsetse turanbwira tuti @: « eh ! nawe burya uri umututsi ? » icyo kihae nibwo ntangiye kumenya ibintu by' amoko .
i later on went home . i remember meeting dad on my way home . ||| nyuma rero ntataha nraibuka ko nhuraiye na papa mu nzira ,
i was very sad and i asked him why my friends had laughed at me telling me i am a tutsi . ||| nri nbabaye cyane . nbaza papa nti kuki bagenzi banjye bansetse bakanbwira ko ndi umututsi ?
"@ what does being tutsi mean ? @" ||| nti kuba umututsi n' iki ?
i asked him . ||| papa aranbwira ati @:
he told me @: "@ i do n't know how to explain that to you ... that 's just the way things are ... @" he told me he would one day explain to me as i needed to know that i was actually tutsi . ||| « ntinzi uburyo nkusobanurair ati ni gutyo . » nramubaza nti ese tuba ... nti nsobanurair . papa aranbwira ati @: « ntacyo nkusobanurair ,
he said he also found things that way ... when i got home , i asked mother for more explanations . ||| ati kuko ugomba kumenya nyine ko uri umututsi nnjyae ni gutyo nbisanze ; » ibintu nk' ibyo ... nyuma rero ntataha ngeze mu rugo nbaza mama , nramusobanuza , mama aranbwira ati @:
she then told me @: "@ in rwanda , there are twas , hutus and tutsis . ||| « mu rwanda hari abo baita abataw , n' abandi baitwa abahutu , ati n' abandi baita abatutsi ati @:
this is not something that should make you feel sad or cry . ||| « nraumva icyo atari ikibazo kikagombye kukubabaza ukarira ,
you are tutsi . @" ||| ati ugomba kumenya ko uri umututsi .
she went ahead and told me about my grandfather whom i never met . she explained to me that the reason why i did n't meet him was because there were some bad people who believed the tutsi was a bad person . ||| mama rero niho yatangiye kunsobanurair anbwira yuko ntamenye sogukuru ; ntamenye se , kubera ko hari abantu babi babifata gutyo bakaumva ko umututsi ari umuntu mubi ,
she told me it was n't true and we are all the same and i should never believe such a thing . ||| aranbwira ati ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo , tuesae turi bamwe ibyo ntibizigerae bikuinjira mu mutawe .
it went on like that and they used to tell us to stand up every year . ||| hanyuma rero birakomeje nyine bakajya batubwira buri mwaka hafi nka buri mwaka bakajya batubwira ngo tuhagurukae ,
i finally got used to it and stop feeling like being a tutsi was an issue . ||| tukahaguruka nyuma nza no kubimenyera nkaumva ko atari ikibazo kuba umututsi nrabimenyera .
i remember a conversation i had with mom while i was in primary iv . ||| nraibuka ko ngeze 4ieme ( umwaka wa kane w' amashuri abanza ) noneho nje kuzaganira na mama ,
i wanted more explanations and she then told me what exactly happened to my grandfather . ||| noneho nramusobanuza ... nramusobanuza , aranbwira ati @: « noneho umaze kumenya ubwenge , ati nkubwiye ko utaigeze umenya sogokuru wawe ,
she told me how in 1959 , they came and took her dad , she was 16 and a mature person . ||| ati noneho ngiye kukubwira impamvu . » nibwo yanbwiraaga komuri mirongo itanu n' icyenda ( 1959 ) baje bakatwara papa we ; bakamutwara ari umwana uzi ubwenge kuko mama yanbwiye ko yari afite imyaka nka cumi n' itandatu ( 16 ) . aranbwira ati @:
she told me he was taken away together with other members of his family . ||| baramutwaye , bamutwaraan n' abo mu muryango we wose . ati @: « niyo mpamvu utajya ubona ko mu muryango w' iwacu nta muntu mukuru urimo ,
she told me how she followed him to the car where they tied his hands and put him in with other people . ||| baramujyana ati @: njyae mperuka ... » anbwira ko yaherekeje se , bamushyira mu modoka baramuboha , bamaze kumuboha bamushyira mu modoka babapanga hamwe .
she told me she followed that car throughout her neighbourhood as they were picking up everyone whose name was on their list . ||| kuko ngo hari imodoka yapakiraaga , bari bafite ama listes , mama anbwira ko yamuherekeje akamugeza aho imodoka yagendaaga hose , ihagarara muri iyo quartier yabo ifata abantu .
he told me about other members of her dad 's family who were taken away at that time as well . ||| anbwira abantu anbwira sogokuru anbwira n' abandi bo mu muryango we . nibwo ntangiye ... bajyanye icyo kihae aranbwira ati @:
she told me how they never found out what exactly happened to her father but that he was taken by some hutus secondary school students who told them how he was killed . ||| « ntabwo nigeze menya uko bigenze , ariko sogokuru wawe yajyanye n' abanyeshuri bigaga mu mashuri makuru icyo kihae , b' abana b' abahutu nibo batubwiye uburyo sogokuru wawe bamwishe . »
she told me they threw them in a pit in ruhengeri but i do n't know the exact location in ruhengeri . ||| anbwira ko babajyanye ngo bakabata mu cyobo kiri mu ruhengeri ,
then came the multiparty system in 1990 . ||| ariko ntabwo nshoboye kumenya mu ruhengeri aho ariho . nyuma rero ubwo haza kugera igihe cyo muri 1990 amashyaka atangiye ,
things went wrong in our area . ||| iwacu ibintu biza kuba bibi ,
but i was n't there for long , i moved to gisenyi where i lived with some of mother 's relatives . ||| ariko ntabwo nhamaze n' igihe iwacu kuko nrahavuye njya i gisenyi niho nbaga mu bantu bo mu muryango wa mama ,
she is from gisenyi . ||| kuko mama akomoka i gisenyi .
in gisenyi , things were worse than in kibuye . ||| i gisenyi rero ibintu biri na bibi kuruta iwacu ku kibuye .
maybe in kibuye people acted as though everything was fine , but in gisenyi , they were doing it in the open . ||| ku kibuye wenda abantu ho barenzagaho na gato ariko ku gisenyi ho babishyiraaga ku mugaragaro .
they used to tell us that they 'd one day kill us . ||| bakatubwira bati @: « igihe kimwe tuzabica , »
but i thought that was impossible . ||| ariko jyae nkajya numva ko ibyo bintu bitashoboka .
mother had explained to me that my grandfather was killed because he was a tutsi , saying he used to go the royal court but i did n't believe that was the reason he was killed . ||| n' ubwo mama yansobanuraiye ko sogokuru bamwishe kuko ngo yari umututsi ; ngo yajyaaga kutaarama i bwami , ntabwo nigeze numva ko ibyo mama yanbwiye aribyo .
i felt like maybe there 's something else he did that made them kill him . ||| numvaaga ko sogokuru afite ikindi kintu bamwiciye yaba yarakoze ,
i did n't believe that one could be killed just because they were tutsi . ||| ntabwo numvaaga ko kuba umututsi bashoboraaga kuica abantu . ariko muri mirongo cyenda ( 1990 ) i gisenyi bibaye bibi ku buryo noneho ntangiye kubibona ,
but in 1990 , things were so bad in gisenyi that i started seeing that it was true , the were killing the ‘ abagogwes ’ [ a tutsi clan in the north of rwanda ] ; so i could see where things were heading , i even realized that one day it would probably reach me or any other tutsi . ||| kuko noneho haicwaaga abagogwe , nkabona ko ibyo aribyo byose ariho bijyana ; ko igihe kimwe nnjyae bizangeraho , cyangwa se n' iyo bitangairho n' abandi bantu banri b' abatutsi .
i left gisenyi [ she starts crying ... ] and when to see my father after a long time . ||| nraibuka ko nvuye i gisenyi ... ( ararira ) nkajya kureba papa hari hashize n' igihe ntamubona ;
that was in 1992 ... i had n't seen him in a long time as i had been living with my mother 's relatives . ||| hari muri 1992 ngiye kureba papa , hari hashize igihe ntamubona ndi muri famille yo kwa mama .
i was a grown up and him and i had a serious conversation . ||| kuko nri nzi ubwenge turaganiriye na papa .
he told me to visiting him as things were going to be very bad soon . ||| aranbwira ngo njyae nza kumureba ngo kuko ibintu bitangiye kuba nabi aranbwira ati @:
"@ maybe i will never see you again my daughter @" he said while i was about to leave . ||| « wenda ... mwana wanjye n' ubwo ugiye ntinzi ko wenda tuzaongera kubonaan . »
i told him @: "@ we will see each other again , dad ! ||| nramubwira nti papa nti @: tuzabonaan ,
the inkotanyis are fighting now and hopefully they 'll win the war before anything wrong happens to us . @" ||| nti urabona ko inkotanyi zatangiye kurwana wenda tuzagira imaan zifatae i gihugu ntacyo bari batutwara .
i only went back home 5 months later and we would talk about what was going on . ||| nyuma papa rero nongeye kusubira mu rugo ntabwo njyaagayo igihe kinini . nsubiyeyo hashize nk' amezei nk' atanu .
i talked with my brothers , the one who followed me was only a year younger than me . ||| turaganira nganira na basaza banjye uwankurikiraga nmurushaaga igihe gito kuko nmurushaaga umwaka umwe .
edouard told me @: "@ odette , things are going to be really bad around here and i want to leave . ||| edouard aranbwira ati @: « odette ibintu bimeze nabi njyewe nshaka kugenda kubera ko uba i gisenyi ,
since you live in gisenyi , i 'd like you to get me a way of fleeing to zaire [ current congo drc ] because we will all be killed . @" ||| uzanshakirae uburyo ngenda nkajya muri zairae nkahunga .
i told him we were going to be okay but i promised him to look for a way as i had friends in goma . ||| ati kuko bazatuica . » nramubwira nti @:
"@ i 'll find you a way to reach goma and then go to the battle field . ||| oya ntabwo bazatuica nti ariko ngiye kushakisha uburyo kuko nziraanye n' abantu i goma nkushakira uburyo ugenda ukajya muri zairae ukagenda ukajya ku rugamba .
maybe one of us will survive that way @"@ , i said . ||| ukajya kurwana wenda muri twe hari uzashobora kuzasigara .
he insisted that i assure him that i was going to do it for him and i promised i 'd do so . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ uzabinkorera ? @" nramubwira nti nzabikukorera ,
i went back to gisenyi and there was a woman called immaculee . i told her about my 2 young brothers , still strong , who needed to flee the country , i told her i needed her help . she told me she was going to help me do that . ||| nragenda njya ku gisenyi ngeze i gisenyi hari umudamu utwaraaga abana mu nkotanyi yitwaaga immaculee nramubwira nti immaculee ntashaka ko unfasha i wacu hari abana nti iwacu ibintu bimeze nabi ku kibuye hari abana basaza banjye babiri bankurikira n' abasore none uzanfashe tubahungaishe ;
i told edouard to get ready . i went back to kibuye and told my dad about it , he said it would be great if it 's possible to get my brothers out of the country so that we would not all be killed . he was desperate , as though he already knew he was going to die . i was home on a monday and i remember telling edouard to get read and join me on friday . ||| immaculee aranbwira ati nta kibazo nzabikukorera ati ntugirae ikibazo nzabikukorera noneho ubwo edouard nramubwira edouard witegure nsubira iwacu ku kibuye njya kureba papa nramubwira nti papa edouard yanbwiye ko ashaka kuhunga ntashaka kumuhungaish aranbwira ati uzaba ugize neza niba ushaka kufasha basaza bawe ukabahungaish bizaba ari byiza ntituzapfae tuesae ,
that was in 1993 . ||| papa yari yaraihebye ubanza yari aziko azapfa ;
he got ready and found me in gisenyi with another young man who was his very good friend although he was hutu . he said he 'd follow him in exile . he said he was not just going to watch them kill my brother , he said he did n't want to survive him . he was called munyensanga . ||| papa rero ndabimwemerera edouard nramubwira nti witegure uzansangae i gisenyi nrabiibuka ngiye mu rugo ari ku wa mbere nramubwira nti ku wa gatanu uzazae edouard ku wa gatanu araza icyo kihae hari muri 1993 araza ansanga i gisenyi azana n' undi mwana turi tuturanye bakundanaaga cyane ariko w' umuhutu aramubwira ati niba uhunze nnjyae nrajyana nawe ntabwo uzansiga n' ubwo bashaka kubica ariko ntabwo bazakuica ngo njyewe nsigarae yitwaaga munyensanga .
i remember how surprised i was when i saw munyensanga , wondering if they were going to go together . ||| munyensanga nraibuka ko yaje nkanikanga , nramubwira nti ese baraza bose kujyana ?
i tried reasoning him saying that edouard was fleeing because they were targeting us and we knew they 'd kill us even though it had n't happened yet . ||| nramubwira nti munyensanga se edouard ko uhunze ko ubona twe bari kutuhiga n' ubwo batari babishyira mu bikorwa ariko bazatuica .
he said that if edouard was going to leave , he 'd go with him . ||| aranbwira ati @: « oya , edouard niba agiye nnjyae ngomba kugenda . »
i went and talked to immaculee and she told me everything was ready for them to leave on saturday . ||| hanyuma rero ubwo nragenda nbwira immaculee , immaculee aranbwira ati @: « byose nbitunganyaije bazaambuka ari ku wa gatandatu mu gitondo ;
a friend of mine called alivera came and told me she did n't think it was a good idea to let them cross the border . ||| noneho ubwo hari undi mwana w' umukobwa tuuzuraaga witwaga alivera araza , aranbwira ati @:
she said that although munyensanga had n't said exactly when she was leaving , she had told them she was fleeing with edouard . ||| « rero odette niba uzi ubwenge bariya bana ntubaambutse . munyensanga yasezeye iwabo , yasezeye iwabo ntiyababwiye umunsi azagendair , ariko yababwiye ko azagenda ... ko azahungaan na edouard . »
she advised me not to let them go as they 'd know i sent my brother away with munyensanga and they were going to kill me . ||| ni uko rero alivera aranbuza aranbwira ati @: « ntutumae bagenda kuko nibagenda bazakuica bazamenya ko wohereje musaza wawe na munyensanga .
"@ his family will not be happy to hear that you sent them to the inkotanyis @"@ , she said . ||| iwabo ntiuzabakira ko ubaohereje mu nkotanyi ,
i ended up not sending edouard , i was selfish and i sent him back to kibuye . ||| edouard rero ntabwo namwohereje nratinye ... nrikunze kuko nramubwiye ngo nsubirae ku kibuye .
i told him it would be too dangerous for me when they find out . ||| mubwira ko babimenye ko nibabimenya njyae bazamerair nabi ,
he begged me to take him to immaculee but he refused . ||| aranyinginga aranbwira ngo nmushyiriye immaculee ndamwangira .
edouard went back to kibuye and looked for a way to leave from there but never succeeded . ||| edouard yasubiye ku kibuye basubirayo ashakisha uburyo wenyine agenda ariko ntibimushobokair arataha .
that was the last time i saw him , he went to kayove after that , he was scared to go back home and he went to hide in kavoye where mom is from , in a place called nkurutu . ||| ni n' ubwo tubonaanye kuko ntinongeye kumubona ntabwo nongeye kumubona yagiye i kayove kuko yagize ubwoba bwo kusubira iwacu ajya kuihisha i kayove , kuko mama niho avuka , ahantu baita nkurutu .
he went to hide there and the war occurred before he went back home and that 's where he was killed . ||| aragenda ajya kuihishayo intambara yarinze iba atari yasubira iwacu , ni naho bamwiciye .
i begged her and told her that she was the only one who knew i was tutsi because she knew my dad and that no one was going to find out unless she told them . ||| ndamwinginga nramubwira nti @: ariko se mariya nutagira umuntu ugenda ngo unbwirae ko ndi umututsi kubera ko uzi data , kubera ko unzi nta muntu uramenya .
i remember her younger sister 's child was at home and he @/@ she had a fine nose ... i remember telling her how my nose was n't even as fine as his or hers and nobody could think i am tutsi unless she reported me . ||| nraibuka yari afite umwana mu rugo wa murumuna we nramubwira nti se uriya mwana ko afite izuru risongoye njyewe nkaba nfite izuru ry' igice nti nta muntu uzamenya ko ndi umututsi nutagenda ngo ubivugae .
she refused and demanded that i leave her house . ||| aranbwira ati @: « oya nvair mu rugo genda ,
we were 3 ladies who were living with her , one of them was called melanie , she was married but i heard they were separated with her husband ... she was married to a white man . ||| turi abadamu batatu bari iwe nrabiibuka harimo umwe witwaga melanie uri ufite umugabo , banbwiye ko yatandukanye n' umugabo ariko yari ... yari afite umugabo w' umuzungu ,

"@ yes ! @" ||| nramubwira nti @:
i replied . ||| yego ;

she also suggested that i go and ask jules to help me flee . but i felt like ... i do n't if it was due to my young age or if it was that i was n't very intelligent but i thought ... i told her i did n't want him and i 'd prefer that he takes me to my dad if he had the ability to do so because i really wanted to see dad and edouard , i wanted to ask edouard for forgiveness as i felt like i should have let him leave and even taken the risk to be killed for him to be saved . ||| anbwira gutyo ati @: « cyangwa se ugendae ubwirae jules akuhungaishe . » ariko , numvaaga ko ntinzi niba ari ubwana cyangwa ubwenge buke nri nfite , kuko ntinzi ... nramubwiye nti @: hoya nti ntaho nrajya nti ahubwo niba yarashoboye kunjyana nkajya kureba papa , kuko numva abantu ba mbere nshaka kubona nshaka kubona papa ngo nbonae na edouard musabae imbabazi . kuko iyo nshaka ko agenda wenda aba yaragiye nkapfa , ariko nba nramukijije .

in the evening , we left the place for helene 's house . helene was maria 's younger sister . ||| nimugoroba rero tuva ahantu turi tuihishe turagenda tujya kwa helene murumuna wa mariya .
we begged her to hide us and she said she had no place where to hide us as everyone had become so wicked . ||| turamwinginga ngo atuhishe , helene aratubwira ati @: « ese nrabahisha he ? ati nta hantu nfite nbahisha ,
she told us to go and sit in the kitchen . ||| ati kuko abantu bose babaye ibisimba . » nraibuka ko yatubwiye ati @: « mugendae muicarae mu kikoni , »
she took good care of us til evening then she told us to leave as she had no place where to hide us . ||| ahantu batekairaga . hanyuma rero kugeza nimugoroba ariko atufata neza . hanyuma aratubwira ati @: « nta hantu nfite ho kubahisha ,
she told melanie to go back to maria since she 'd live with her for a long time and beg her again to hide us . ||| nimugendae . melanie ubanye na mariya wongere umwinginge urebae ko yashobora kukuhisha . »
we went back there but it was n't easy to find a way to use . ||| tuongera tusubirayo ariko ntitubona ahantu tuca tuhita tuhingukair ahantu ku baturanyi bari batuye ,
we came out at the neighbours ' and found that they 'd already caught other people and they took melanie and i together with them . ||| tusanga bamaze no kufata abantu benshi bahita batujyana ,
there were many other people i did n't know , i did n't know many people in that area as i had only been there for 3 days . ||| na melanie n' abandi bantu benshi baho benshi ntari nzi , kuko abantu b' aho ntabwo nri nbazi , kuko nta kihae nri mpamaze nri mpamaze iminsi itatu kusa .
the war started when i had been there for 3 days , i was just a visitor . ||| intambara yabaye mpamaze iminsi itatu , nri umushyitsi .
they took us to the kigali sports club [ cercle sportif de kigali ] in rugunga . there 's a woman who was with us whom i 'll always remember . ||| batujyana ahantu muri cercle ( cercle sportif de rugunga ) tujyana n' umumama , ariko ntabwo azanva mu mutawe .
she had a very small baby , about 3 months old . ||| yari afite umwana muto ufite nk' amezi nk' atatu ,
on our way , we met a friend of hers and she begged her to take the baby with her . ||| tugeze mu nzira ahura na mugenzi we aramwinginga ngo amufataire umwana , aramubwira ati @: « ko tubanye untwaraiye umwana . » aranga aramubwira ati @:
she refused saying that she could n't take the baby as our last day had come [ the tutsis ' last day ] . ||| « oya ntabwo nmutwara kubera ko imperuka yanyu yabaye ;
i also remember that melanie kept reassuring me all the way . ||| ubwo rero ubwo yabaye nimugendae . » nraibuka ko tugiye melanie ariko akampumuriza cyane .
they took us to a place that was kind of flat , the ‘ cercle ’ is actually kind of flat . ||| turagenda batushyira ahantu hari hameze nk' ahashashe , n' ubundi muri cercle henda kumera nk' ahashashe .
they started to shoot , both children and adults were begging for pity in vain . ||| ubwo rero baratangira bararasa , bararasa abana barataka n' abantu bakasaba imbabazi , ariko ntacyo bitangaaga .
some children were asking for forgiveness and even promised never to be tutsis again in vain . ||| nraibuka ko hari abana basaba imbabazi bakavuga ngo ntibazaongera kuba abatutsi , ngo nibababarire ,
i was so frightened i fell down ! ||| ariko ntacyo bitangaaga . nuko rero njyae ngize ubwoba mpita nikubita hasi ,
many people fell on me , melanie included . ||| abantu bose baangwa hejuru na melanie .
but melanie did n't ... about an hour later , when everyone was dead , i heard melanie 's voice calling @: "@ odette ! odette ! ||| ariko melanie ntabwo ... nyuma rero bimaze kucogora hashize umwanya munini nk' isaha numva melanie ari kumpamagara , aranbwira ati @: « odetta ... odetta ... upfuye ? »
are you still alive ? @" ||| nramubwira nti @:
i replied that i was still alive . ||| oya ntabwo npfuye .
she helped me remove the corpses that were on top of me . ||| aranfasha ankuraho imirambo yari inriho ,
she had been very wounded by the bullets . ||| ariko yakomeretse cyane kuko bari bamurashe , aranfata ankuramo , aranbwira ati @:
she got me out of there and said @: "@ we do n't have anywhere else to go and it 's almost morning and when it 's daytime , they 'll find out that we 're still alive . @" ||| « nta hanri hantu tufite ho kujya kandi bugiye kucya . aranbwira ati @: nibuza kucya mu gitondo baraza kumenya ko tutapfuye . aranbwira ati @:
she suggested that we go backt o helene 's . ||| icyakoze tusubirae kwa helene . »
we went back to helene 's house and entered the kitchen and sat there , they did n't used to lock . ||| tusubira kwa helene tujya mu gikoni kuko bari bafite ikikoni batakinga , turagenda tuicaramo .
melanie was bleeding very much throughout and she was so frightened that she was trembling . ||| ariko melanie ava amaraso menshi , afite n' ubwoba bwinshi yaratitiraga .
we stayed there until helene came in the morning to make some tea . ||| nyuma rero tuguma mu gikoni helene aza kuteka icyayi mu gitondo atusangamo aravuga ati @:
she was surprised to find us still alive . ||| « muracyariho ? » turamubwira tuti @:
she asked us about the rest of the people and we told her everyone else had been killed . ||| turiho . « abandi se ? » nramubwira nti @: abandi birangiye .
she said if we remained there , we 'd still be killed anyway . she said we should stay there until she came back and she went to look for someone who would agree to hide us . ||| nyuma rero aratubwira ati @: « rero ati nimuguma hano n' ubundi murapfa ; ati ariko mugumae ahangaha njyewe ngiye kubashakira umuntu wo kubahisha . »
we ate . ||| nyuma rero tuguma aho mu gikoni aratugaburira .
melanie was very tired . ||| ariko melanie we yari yanamaze no kunanirwa ,
helene did n't find anyone willing to hide us . ||| ajya kushakisha helene abantu bo kutuhisha ,
she told us to make the effort to go and sit in some bush at the querry despite the fact the melanie was so weak , until she finds a better place where to hide us . ||| ariko arababura . araza aranbwira ati @: « wowe ufite ingufu ariko na melanie yihanganae hari igihuru kiri kuri carriere , mugendae mwicaremo njyewe mu kihae nkibashakira abantu bo kubahisha .
in the evening , she took us there . ||| aratujyana ari ni mugoroba ,
as we were sitting there , melanie told me she was very tired . ||| aba ariho atwicaza ajya kutushakira abantu bo kutuhisha . ariko igihe tuicaraanye na melanie , melanie aranbwira ati @: « njyewe nmaze kunanirwa .
she told me i needed to find another place where to hide . ||| ubwo rero aranbwira ati @: « nugushakisha uburyo ugenda ukashaka ahandi hantu ujya kuihisha . » nrabiibuka yaranbwiye ngo ngendae ,
i remember leaving her house one day in the morning , it was raining heavily and she told me to go back to helene 's house . ||| ntasohoka hari mu gitondo nko mu ma saa yine , imvura yaragwaaga ari nyinshi , aranbwira ati @: « genda usubirae kwa helene . »
helene told me that the fact she asked me to leave the day meant they 'd all seen me and they 'd soon be looking for me . ||| helene aranbwira ati @: « uje ari ku manywa abantu bose bakubonye ,
it was too dangerous for her to hide in those conditions . ||| yakusohoye ku manywa ntabwo njyae nshobora kukomeza kukuhisha , nnjyae ntinshobora kukuhisha kuko ninguhisha bamenye ko uje hano nnjyae bashobora kunyica . »
she told me to go to the quarry , there was a man who was giving out identity cards for those who had lost theirs . ||| aranbwira ngo ningende njyae kuri carriere , hari umugabo utangaaga ibyangombwa iyo umuntu yabaga yataye irangamuntu . aranbwira ati @:
she told me not to show him my id and to just tell him that i was a hutu and that i had lost my id . i walked up in the day without trying to hide myself . ||| « ntumwereke irangamuntu , wowe ugendae umubwirae y' uko irangamuntu uyitaye , ariko uri umuhutu . » nrazamuka nragenda koko kandi ku manywa .
when i reached kiyovu , there was a roadblock ; it was raining heavily . ||| nragenda ngeze mu kiyovu hari bariyeri , mpasanga bariyeri ariko imvura igaw nyinshi . barampagarika baraambaza bati @: « uri uwahe ? »
they stopped me and asked me where i was from . ||| nrababwira nti @:
i told them i lived at maria 's and they said they did n't know me . ||| ndi uwo kwa mariya . bati @: « ko tutakuzi ? ugiye he ? »
i told me i had been sent and they said i was lying to them and i was a tutsi . ||| nrababwira nti @: barantumye . baranbwira bati @: « uratubeshya uri umututsi . »
i denied it and told i was n't a tutsi at all and it 's just that i had been sent . ||| nrababwira nti @: « oya da ntabwo ndi umututsi rwose ; rwose ntabwo nriwe . nti ntabwo nriwe ahubwo barantumye .
one of them had a gun . he told me @: "@ listen ! ||| umwe muri bo uri ufite imbunda aranyegera aranbwira aranbwira ati @:
tell me the truth if you are a tutsi . ||| « reka rero nkubwirae mbwiza ukuri niba uri umututsi .
i promise not kill you if you acknowledge you are one . ||| njyewe numbwira ko uri umututsi ntabwo ntakuica .
but if you say you 're a hutu and i find out you are n't , i will n't have mercy on you ! @" ||| ariko numbwira ko uri umuhutu , kandi nkasanga utari umuhutu ntabwo ntakubabarira . »
he asked me for my id and i got it out of my pocket and gave it to him . ||| aranbwira ati @: « zana irangamuntu yawe . » nrayimuha , nri nyifite no mumufuka .
then i said to him @: "@ i am sorry for lying to you , i am a tutsi . ||| nramubwira nti unbabarirae nkubeshye nti @: ndi umututsi ,
but please have mercy on me as you 've just promised . @" ||| nti ariko unbabarirae kuko umaze kunbwira ko uranbabarira .
he looked at it then said @: "@ you 're an inyenzi , go and sit there ! @" ||| amaze kuyireba aranbwira ati @: « uri inyenzi genda wicare hariya . »
i went and sat next to 3 young men and an old man who looked handsome . ||| nragenda nraicara nraibuka ko hari abahungu batatu , n' umusaza umwe usaga neza ntinzi uko nbivuga ,
i do n't know but ... they used to say the tutsis had a long nose , a long face and that 's the way he looked . ||| kuko icyo kihae bavugaaga ngo abatutsi ni abafite amazuru maremare ,
he had all the tutsi features they used to describe . ||| imisaya miremire nbonaaga asa n' ibyo byose , byose birangaaga umututsi bavugaaga .
i kept staring at him , hoping that he 'd ask them to have mercy on me but he did n't say anything . ||| nramureba cyane ngirango wenda ansabaire imbabazi ariko ntiyagira ikintu ... nta kintu yavuze .
then one of them ... the man with a gun moved backwards , i think he want to kill me because he stood behind me and loaded his gun . ||| noneho umwe mu ... urya mugabo uri ufite imbunda yigira inyuma , ngirango ahari yashakaaga kunyica , kuko yigiye inyuma . ahita atangira gusharija .
i was so terrified i did n't even ask ... i panicked . ||| ngize ubwoba bwinshi cyane nta nubwo nmusa ... nhise numva umutima unvuyemo .
then his friend said @: "@ are you going to kill her here ? ||| undi mugenzi we ahita avuga ati @: « ugiye kumwica ?
we do n't even have a hoe to bury her . if you kill her here , she 'll rot here and start smelling bad . where will we put her ? @" ||| ati wimwicira hano ; numwicira hano nta n' isuka tufite yo kumushyingura numwicira hano azahaborair ahanukaire uramushyira he ? »
he then said @: "@ just leave her , there 's a car that went to nyamirambo to bring tutsis , the presidential guardians [ gp ] are the ones driving it . let them come and take her with others . @" ||| aramubwira ati @: « murekae hari imodoka yagiye i nyamirambo kuzana abatutsi , itwawe n' abajepe iraza imutwarae hamwe n' abandi . »
i just sat there in the rain . ||| ntakomeza nraicara imvura igaw .
at some point , a passerby i had never met before . ||| nyuma haza kuza umuntu wigenderaga ntanamuzi ,
he knew that interahamwe . ||| ariko uri uziraanye n' uwo muhungu w' interahamwe .
he asked , "@ why did you get that girl to sit there ? @" he replied to him that i was an inyenzi . ||| aramubwira ati @: « ese uriya mukobwa ko mwamwicaje hasi ? » aramubwira ati @: « uriya mukobwa n' inyenzi ,
he was like , "@ you guys are actually killing everyone on the pretext that they are inyenzis ! @" ||| aramubwira ati ariko sha mwebwe murica abantu bose ngo n' inyenzi ? » aramubwira ngo @: « ntabwo ushatse kaumva icyo nvuze , uriya mukobwa ni umututsikazi .
his reply was that what he meant was that i was a tutsi and that they were expecting a car from nyamirambo that will be having tutsis in it and i would go with them . ||| tutegereje ko indi modoka iva i nyamirambo igiye kuzana abatutsi i nyamirambo iza ikamutwaraan n' abandi . »
he came back to me and asked , "@ where are you from ? @" ||| araza araongera araambaza ati @: "@ ese i wanyu ni hehe ? @"
i told him i am from kibuye . ||| nramubwira nti iwacu ni ku kibuye .
he asked me where exactly in kibuye and i replied , "@ in rubengera . @" ||| araambaza ati @: "@ ese ku kibuye hehe ? @" nramubwira nti @: i rubaengair .
he then exclaimed , "@ where in rubengera ? whose daughter are you ? ||| ati @: " i rubaengair ? ati ese i rubaengair kwa nde ? uri uwande ,
whose daughter are you ? @" i told him our place is called ruvumbu , on your way to mutaba . ||| uri uwahe ? @" nramubwira nti @: iwacu ni ahantu baita mu ruvumbu , umanuka ujya epfo mu mataba .
i told him that was called matthias kamuhanda . ||| nti @: papa yitwa kamuhanda mathias .
he asked me if i knew a protestant pastor called nzabahimana in kibuye . i told him i knew him . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ ese umupasiteri w' umuprotestati wa hariya ku kibuye witwa nzabahaimaan uramuzi ? @" nti nramuzi . ahita agenda abwira urya mugenzi we ,
he went to talk to his friend , i do n't know what he told him because they were n't near me . ||| ntabwo nzi ibyo yamubwiye kuko ntabwo turi tuegeranyae . nuko aragaruka aranbwira ati @: " mukusabaiye imbabazi , genda . @"
then he came back and told me , "@ i asked him to let you go and so you can leave but do n't go where tou were going ... where were you going by the way ? @" ||| ati @: "@ ariko ntugendae harya uri ugiye , ati @: ese uri ukihae hehe @"@ ?
i explained to him that i was going to look for an identity card with a man who gives them out up there because i had been told that if i had one that said i was a hutu , i would n't be killed . ||| nramubwira nti nri ngiye kushaka icyangombwa ku mugabo ubitanga wa hariya haruguru , nti kuko banbwiye ko nnyandikair ko ndi umuhutu batazanyica .
he told me that the person who told me that had lied to me and that the man would kill me . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ umuntu ukaoherejeyo yakubeshye ; ati @: arakuica @"@ .
he told me to go back where i was coming from ... i went back to the quarry where melanie and i hid ourselves on the first day . ||| ati @: "@ wowe hita usubira iyo uvuye @"@ , nragiye nisubirair ... njya kuri carriere harya nihishe umunsi wa mbere muri cya gihuru na melanie .
i was in the same bush till evening then i went back to helene 's house to ask her to hide me once again or to help me get someone else to hide me . ||| nragenda nsubira muri cya gihuru nimugoroba bawije , nsubira kureba helene , ngo yongerae ampishe ,
helene told me that she did n't have anyone or anywhere to send me to and that i was betrayed the day her own sister chased me out of her home . ||| cyangwa anshakirae undi muntu wo kumpisha . helene aranbwira ati @: "@ rero ati nta hantu nfite ati nta muntu nbona , ati uhemukaiyew na mwene mama umunsi yakusohoye ,
she said if her sister had kept me in her house , no one would have ever known my tribe . ||| ati @: iyo akugumaish mu rugo ntawari kuzamenya icyo uri cyo . @"
then she said she was going to ask therese to hide me yet again . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ ariko ngiye kaongera kureba therese akuhishe . @" ariko therese aramubwira ati @: "@ ntabwo bishoboka ,
therese told her she could n't as her own mother was a tutsi and her mom had her with a congolese man and everyone knew that . ||| kubera ko nnjyae mama ari umututsikazi , ati kandi uziko mama yatubyaye , ati @: afite ... ati njyewe papa ni umuzayirwa urabizi ,
her other siblings had tutsi fathers . ||| njyae baranzi , ati @: ariko abo tuvukana bose mama yababyaraanye n' abatutsi ,
she said she could n't take me in because if they found me in her house , they 'd kill us all . ||| ati @: ntabwo nshobora kaongera kufata odette ati bashobora kuhamusanga bikatuma batuica @"@ .
i went to mama olivier 's home , that 's where helene took me but again mama olivier was waiting for them to come and kill her as she was also a tutsi . ||| nragiye njya ku wunri mudamu mama olivier , nragenda aba ariho helene anjyana . ariko maman olivier nawe yari ategereje ko bagomba kumwica kuko nawe yari umututsikazi .
but she told me i could stay there with her and it was okay if they came and killed us together . ||| aranbwira ariko ati ntabwo ntakuirukana ugumae ahangaha , nibatwica bazatuicanae nta kibazo .
i only stayed there for 3 days and then she asked one of her neighbours to kindly keep me because mama olivier herself was being hunted and they 'd certainly kill her if they found me in her house . ||| nhabaye iminsi mike , kuko nhabaye iminsi itatu kwa mama olivier . aragenda abwira undi mudamu bari baturanye ati @: "@ rwose unbabariye nkakuha uriya mwana ukaba umunfashije nnjyae ko bampiga nibasanga mufite bazanyica nnjyae @"@ .
she then took me to her friend 's home . ||| anjyana kuri uwo mugenzi we ,
i was there for about 2 days ... helene kept on pleading with therese and she finally agreed to take me in with her again . ||| nrabiibuka bari bagiye baturanye , anjyana kuri uwo mugenzi we mpamara iminsi nk' ibiri ... ni ibiri nhamaze . helene arakomeza yinginga therese aremera araongera aranfata , aranfata arampisha .
by then , people in rugunga had all been killed . ||| ariko abantu barashize , barashize mu rugunga , barashize .
later on , the inkotanyis kept on fighting and fighting . ||| nyuma rero inkotanyi zirarwana zirakomeza zirarwana cyane .
when they reached a place called imburabuturo , people had toleave their homes for sometime . ||| zaigeze ahantu baita imburabuturo abantu biba ngombaw ko basohoka bakagenda gato .
but when they came back to their homes , therese told me that she was going to lock me in and if she ever came back , she would not keep me with her because things were really be bad then , she explained that they could even come on the next day searching in her house and find me there . ||| ariko kuko baongeye bakagaruka mu ngo zabo therese aranbwira ati @: " ngiye kusiga ngukingiranye ariko ningaruka ntabwo ntakugumana ati @: kuko ibintu bibaye nabi , bashobora no kuzaza ejo kudusaka bakatusangaan . @"
i remember helene begging her to keep me with her and she said she had already helped me a lot despite the fact that she did n't know me and she could n't continue risking her life for me . ||| nrabiibuka ko helene yamwinginze , ati @: "@ umugumanye aramubwira ati nramufashije uyu mwana mu buryo buhagije , nmuhishe ntamuzi rwose ariko ntinshobora kukomeza kushyira ubuzima bwanjye mu batuhiga . @"
she said she expected them to come soon and kill her siblings and her mother and she believed they 'd kill her as well . ||| ati @: "@ koko nnjyae ejo bazaza bicae bene mama , cyangwa na mama nnjyae ntibazansiga . @"
then helene told me not to worry and that she was going to get someone else who could hide me . ||| ubwo rero helene aranbwira ati @: "@ ntugirae ikibazo ngiye kukushakira undi muntu ukuhisha . @" nraibuka ko yagiye akagaruka , aranbwira ati @:
she left and came back saying that she found a benefactor old lady from kibuye where i also come from and the latter understood my situation and she was willing to hide me . ||| "@ nbonye undi mukecuru w' umugiraneza ukomoka ku kibuye iwanyu , nmubwiye ibibazo ugize , ati @: yemeye kukuhisha . @"
she directed me to that place , she told me to go and knock on the third gate . ||| aranrangira inzira ijya iwe aranbwira ati @: "@ ni igipangu cya gatatu uvuye ku gipangu cya mbere , ati @: uzagendae ukomangae ,

when therese came home , i told her to be patient with me as i had found someone else to hide me . ||| nbwira therese atashye , yagiye atashye nramubwira nti wihangane unyihanganaire nbonye undi mukecuru uzampisha ,
i remember living therese 's house at night . i went to mama sania the old lady 's house . ||| ubu ikisigaye n' uko nshaka uburyo nzagerayo . nraibuka ko nvuye kwa therese ari nijoro nragenda njya kuri uwo mukecuru , mama sania .
but i did n't know the place very well and i knocked on someone else 's gate by mistake . ||| ariko kuko ntari mpazi , nraibuka hari ahantu ku gipangu , naribenshye nkomanga ahantu ku rugo rw' umuntu .
they asked me where iwas going and i told them i was looking for mama sania and he directed me properly . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ ese urajya he @"@ ? nramubwira nti ntashaka kwa mama sania niwe uhanrangiye neza .
i went and knocked and they opened for me . ||| nragenda ntakomanga barankingurair , aho kwa mukecuru mama sania ,
i did n't know mama sania , the old lady and i mistakened her with the person who came to open for me . ||| ariko kuko ntari muzi nraibuka ko uwo nhingukaiyeho bwa mbere ariwe nise mama sania . aranbwira ati @: « ntinri we » ati @: « reka mukuzanirae . »
she told me she was n't the one and she went ahead and called her . ||| yaragiye aramuhamagara mukecuru araza . araambaza ati @: « ese uri uwahe ? » nramubwira .
the old lady came and asked me about myself , where i come from , ... then she told me that despite the fact that she had promised helene to hide me earlier but she was not going to be able to as things had become really bad . ||| araambaza @: « urindae , uri uwahe ? » nramubwira ,
she told me she was hiding many people in her home but she was n't sure they 'd still be alive the next day . ||| aranbwira ati @: « rero reka nkubwirae @: nri nemereye helene ko nkuhisha , ati @:@ ariko ntabwo nkikuhishe ,

bibi [ meme en swahili ] then told me to leave her home . ||| ntinzi impamvu numvaaga ko nzarokoka , n' ubwo ibyo byose nbibonaaga , numvaaga nfite umutima unbwira ko numvaaga nfite ko nzasigara . bibi aranbwira ati @:

she refused and said i should leave . ||| « oya genda ntabwo nkuhisha . »
when she said so , i felt like it was over and i was going to die . ||| anbwiye ko atampisha nhise numva birangiye ,
but i was mostly sad that i was going to die without saying goodbye to my father and without asking edouard to forgive me . ||| numvaishe ko mfuye . ariko nbabazawaga n' uko ngiye kupfa ntasezeye papa , ntanabonye n' uko nsaba imbabazi edouard .
i cried and then she asked me to come back . ||| nrarize , nrize mukecuru aranbwira ati @: « garuka . »
i was crying so much as i was leaving that she asked me to come back . ||| kuko nrarize cyane , ngenda aranbwira ati @: « garuka , ati @:
she told me she was a muslim , she believed in god and if she let me go and i got killed on the way , she believed god would ask her to give an account about me . ||| kuko njyae ndi umuyisilamu ntasenga , nemera imaan , ati @: ugiye bakakuica imaan yazakunbaza . »
she took me inside to a room inside her house and when i got in , i felt like the situation was hopeless ... i had been thinking that i was the only tutsi that was still alive in rwanda and then i found all these people who were hiding in that room . ||| yanyinjije mu nzu , ahita anyinjiza mu cyumba . ngeze mu cyumba cyo yanshyizemo , nhise nbona ko ntaho nvuye ,
they were so many ! ||| nta n' aho ngiye . kuko numvaaga ko arijyae mututsi njyenyine ukiba mu rwanda . numvaaga ko arijyae jyenyine .
the one i always remember is a girl who was there . ||| numvaaga ko nta n' undi wunri usigaye . nhasanze abantu benshi ahishe , muri abo bantu yari ahishe ... muri abo bantu yari ahishe , uwo njya nibuka cyane ni umwana w' umukobwa nhasanze .
she never talked to me . ||| hari umwana w' umukobwa ntabwo yigeze anvugaish ,
they had really destroyed her , she had been raped and done her really bad things . ||| bari baramwangije cyane . kuko baramuviyoye bamukorera ibintu by' impyisi .
there 's no other way to put it , she was rotten . ||| nta kunri nbivuga , yari yaraboze .
she was bleeding daily . ||| yavaaga amaraso buri munsi ,
i tried talking to her in a way to reassure her that we were going to survive but she never used to reply . ||| ngeragezaaga kumuvugaish kugirango mwumvishe wenda ko tutazapfa , ariko ntabwo yansubizaaga ,
she had become numb . ||| yari yarabaye nk' igiti .
i prayed all the prayers i could think of asking god to heal her but ... she was in so much pain and she could n't eat . the old lady tried her best to help us but it was n't possible . ||| nrasenze amasengesho yose abaho ngo imaan imukize , ariko ... yarababaraaga cyane ntiyashoboraaga kurya mukecuru yakoresheje ibintu byose ngo atufashe , ariko ntabwo bishobokaaga .
something that ... something that really surprised me and made me wonder why people were so much against us is that one day bibi went out , she used to walk around a lot . ||| ikintu cya ... ikintu kintangaje nyuma nkibaza icyo tupfa abantu , ni uko bibi yaragiye kubera ko yagendaaga cyane hanze aragenda ari ku manywa asanga umuntu ku muhanda wishwe n' inzara ,
she met somebody who was dying of hunger . ||| yaje amutwaye mu ntoki aramutuzanira ; yitwaaga minani . ntitusohokaaga , ubwo nyine abakuru bibi yatubwiraaga kumenya abakomeretse ,
she brought him to us , the man was called minani . ||| kuko muri twe harimo abari barakomeretse , no kumenya abana . nyuma rero azana uwo mugabo minani . aranbwira ati ... ni nnjyae yamushinze .
we never used to get out . ||| aranbwira ati @:
bibi put the adults among us in charge of taking care of the injured and of the children . ||| « uyu muntu umumenye . » ndamwegera ariko ntiyavugaaga kubera inzara yari yaramwiciye mu nzira . nramubaza se witwa nde ?
she brought the man called minani and told me to take care of him . ||| aranbwira ati nitwa minani nramubaza nti @: « se uva he ? » aranbwira ati @: « njyewe ndi impunzi y' umurundi nhunze i burunri intambara batumereye nabi n' umuryango wanjye ,
i approached him but he could n't talk as he was very hungry . ||| nnjyae ntahunga . nyuma rero tumaze kuganira gake , kubera nta mwuka yari afite ,
i asked him his name and he said he was called minani . ||| bibi aramunshinga .
i asked him where he was from and he told me he was a burundian refugee , him and his family were being persecuted and he fled the war in burundi . ||| hashize igihe , hashize iminsi yari amaze guhembuka gake ariko kuko yari yarazahaye cyane ... araambaza ati @: « ese ugeze hano kutae ? » nramubwira nti @:
a few days later , when he started getting back some strength , he asked me how i got there and i told him i sought refuge there in an attempt to flee . ||| ngeze hano mpunga . aranreba aranbwira ati @: « uri umututsikazi ? » nramubwira nti @:
he asked me if i was a tutsi and i said "@ yes @"@ . ||| yego . ati @: « nnjyae ndi umuhutu . aranbwira ati @:
his reply was that him on the other hand was hutu and the fact that we had met in such a place was probably god 's way of showing us how we really have no reason to fight and that at the end of the day , we are all the same . ||| rero ati ntacyo tupfa ati tupfa n' ubusa , ati koko ; ati dore ahantu tuhuraiye ati ubu n' imaan ikora ibintu nka bino kugirango ituerekae ko ntacyo tupfa , ko tuesae turi bamwe . »
but i did n't see any of them for about 3 months ... for me 3 months seemed to be a very long time . ||| ariko ntawe nbonye , kuko nshakishije igihe kinini nk' amezi atatu , numva amezi atatu ari menshi ,
i had given out my brother 's name and the organization cocern in gitarama told me they had a child called shumbusho . ||| kuri jyae yari menshi cyane nyuma rero nza ku ... kubera nri nratanze amazina ya petit frere shumbusho baza kuzanbwira ko bafite umwana witwa shumbusho muri icyo kigo cya ‘ concern ’ kiri kiri i kitaarama .
i found very young children there . ||| nragenda njyayo mpageze mpasanga abana bato cyane , abana bato umwana muto uri ufite nk' umwaka ,
a one year old girl ran to me calling me ‘ mom ’ , she was called mutoni . ||| aranbona ( bamwitaga mutoni ) aranbona araza ansanga cyane anbwira ,
maybe her mother and i looked alike , i do n't know what made her call me mom . ||| anyita mama . simbizi niba mama we yarasaga nkanjyae , ntabwo nbizi impamvu yanyise mama .
the other children came to me , they thought she had found her mother . ||| yaje yiruka cyane aranyegera n' abandi bana bari baraho baraza biruka bavuga ngo @:
i explained to the ones who were old enough to understand that i was n't her mother . ||| « abonye mama we burya uri uriho ? » nramuterura ariko abari bazi ubwenge nrababwira nti ... abari bazi ubwenge muri bo nti @: « ashobora kuba yibeshye . »
i carried her and headed towards the management to find out if the child called shumbusho was there . they asked me the names of the child 's parents . ||| nragiye nramuterura nramujyana . nragenda njya muri direction kubaza niba uwo mwana shumbusho ahari . baraambaza bati @: « shumbusho wande ? »
i told them father was called matthias kamuhanda and mother was called yulida nyiramatama . ||| nrababwira nti @: papa we yitwa kamuhanda matiyasi ; nti na mama ni nyiramatama yulida .
they went through the names of the children they knew and shumbusho was a bright boy and he had given out those names , he was 7 . ||| bajya mu mazina y' abana bari bafite kuko shumbusho yari azi ubwenge , yari yarababwiye amazina y' iwacu , kuko yari afite imyaka irindwi .
they told me he was alive but he had gone to school . ||| baranbwira bati @: « shumbusho ariho ariko yagiye ku ishuri . »
it was a miracle and i felt like it was n't true even after they told me he was alive . ||| numvise ari igitangaza kikomeye ntabwo numvise uko bingendekeye , kuko numvaaga ko nubwo banbwiye ko ariho ariko numvaaga ko atari byo .
i waited until noon when he came back from school . his school was n't far from the orphanage and he came at around 12 . ||| nrategereje ntahaguma kugeza saa sita igeze nko mu ma saa sita nibwo nbonaanye nawe kuko yigaga aho hafi .
when shumbusho saw me , he became ... he was taken by surprise , he just stared at me , he did n't even come forward to say hi . ||| shumbusho yaranbonye amera nk' aho , yumvise ari ... bibaye nk' ikintu kimugwirairiye ,
i approached him and he looked so scared . ||| kuko yaranrebye cyane , nta n' ubwo yanyegereye ngo anramutse . ngiye kumwegera ngo muramutse nkabona afite ubwoba .
the he asked , "@ you 're still alive ? @" ||| araambaza ati @: "@ ese uracyariho wowe ? @"
i said yes . ||| nravuga nti @: yego .
then he asked me if there was any other survivor at home which i told him there was none . ||| araambaza ati @: "@ ese mu rugo i wacu hari umuntu usigaye ? @"
he asked me about ngirabakunizi , our little sister because they followed each other . ||| nramubwira nti ntawe . ikintu yanbajije yanbajije ngirabakunzi , petite soeur kuko barakurikiraanaga .
he asked again , "@ even ngirabakunzi is n't there ? @" ||| araambaza ati @: "@ na ngirabakunzi ntawe uriho ? @"
i told him no , she was n't there either . ||| nti oya nti ngirabakunzi ntawe uriho .
he asked again , "@ even dad ? @" ||| ati @: "@ na papa ? @" nti @:
i said yes , even him . ||| yego . aranbwira ati @:
he told me it was impossible , that dad was very strong and there was no way they could have killed him . ||| "@ oya papa ntabwo bamwishe , papa yari afite ingufu , ati ubwo papa yari afite ingufu ,
"@ he must have fought and run . ||| buriya yararwanye arahunga .
they did n't kill him @" he said . ||| ntabwo buriya bamwishe . @"
"@ no , dad is not alive . @" i told him . ||| nti oya papa ntawe uriho .
then he run away . ||| yahise ampunga aragenda .
he run away from me very fast , he refused to approach me again ... i do n't know why ... maybe ... i do n't know why he did n't want to come near me . ||| yaragiye ariruka cyane arampunga , ntiiongeye no kunyegera , ntabwo nzi impamvu ... wenda ... ntinzi impamvu atashakaaga ko tuegeraan .
i never ask him about it . ||| ntinjya nshaka no kubimubaza .
his guardians told me to go back home and leave him , they said it was still hard for him to accept it . ||| nratashye abamureraaga baranbwiye ngo @: "@ ni ntahae murekae . @" baranbwira ngo @: "@ buriya mu mutawe ntabwo abiiumvaish . @"
i went back home and then i started working again . ||| nratashye nyuma nza kuzasubira ku kazi nrababwira ko nmubonye , nbabwira ko baongera kunsubiza ku kazi nkakora , baranretse ntakora .
a nieghbour once came and told me violette and claudette were still alive as well . ||| nyuma rero umuntu araza aranbwira turi tuturanye iwacu ati @: "@ na ba barumuna bawe bariho , violette na clodette ngo bariho ntabwo bapfuye . @"
i was very happy and i felt like it was a miracle . ||| nrishima cyane numva ni ibitangaza .
i had some money and i remember going to buy beds and mattresses . ||| nyuma nragenda nrabiibuka ko nri nfite amafaranga nragenda ngura ibitanda na matelas .
i thanked bibi for all she did for me and i told her i wanted to leave because i had found my younger brother and sisters and i did n't want to bother her with them . ||| nbwira bibi , nti @: bibi rero ntashaka kutaha ; nti ungiraiye neza nti ariko nbonye barumuna banjye ,
bibi told me not to leave , she said she was going to take care of them just like she had been taking care of me . ||| nti nbonye bene data batatu ntabwo nza kukugora . nti ntabwo tuza kukugora . bibi aranbwira ngo @: "@ oya guma hano nrakureze ,
i insisted i wanted to leave and i asked her to help me find a house , i told her i could now afford paying a rent and taking care of them since i had a job . ||| nabo nzabarera . @" nramubwira nti @: oya ntashaka kugenda ahubwo unfashe tushakae inzu , ntakora nzajya nyiriha nbatungae nta kibazo .
i told her she could continue helping me but i did n't want to continue bothering her . ||| namwe muzajyae munfasha ariko ntabwo tushaka kukomeza kukugora .
bibi finally agreed to help me find a house . ||| bibi aranbwira ati @: "@ ok ngiye kukushakira inzu . @"
she got me a three bed roomed house . i had 3 beds made , one for shumbusho as i intended to ask the people from the orphanage to give him to me and 2 others for violette and claudette . ||| anshakira inzu y' ibyumba bitatu nkoresha ibitanda niteguye kusaba shumbusho bakamumpa aho yari ari muri orphelinat n' ibindi bibiri kimwe cya clodette n' ikindi cya violette . nragenda nongera naka uruhushya bararumpa ,
i got another leave and went to look for violette and claudette . i went back home to kibuye and found out that the person who told me about them had lied to me . ||| kugirango njyae kushaka violette na clodette nragiye njya iwacu ku kibuye , nsanga yaranbeshye wa muntu , yaranbeshye kuko nsubiye kwa chantal masenge , aranbwira ati @:
my aunt chantal told me they killed them at the stadium . ||| "@ uwo muntu ukubwiye ibyo ngibyo ni uwahe ? ati @: barabaishe babiciye muri stade ,
she told me she had not wanted to tell me about it as she could see how difficult it was for me . ||| ati @: kuko nanze kubikubwira kuko nbonaaga ukibabaye ,
she said my uncle mutabazi was injured at the stadium but left there while he was still alive . he went to her house and told her everyone was dead . ||| nkubwira ko bose bapfuye . ariko ati @: mutabazi so wanyu we yavuye muri stade yakomeretse , ariko ntabwo yari yapfuye ati @:
he told her my dad got out of the stadium but they killed them all ... no one survived ! ||| kuko yaje iwe anbwira y' uko bose bapfuye ati ariko anbwira y' uko papa wawe we yari yashoboye kusimbuka stade akahunga ati @: ariko barabaishe bose ati nta ... nta usigaye . @"
i still look at their mattresses today , i did n't use them ... sometimes i feel like it is not true , as though they did n't die ... some days i feel like it 's impossible ... it 's impossible that so many people can die at the same time , as though they were maybe somewhere else but that they have n't died . ||| n' ubu njya nreba matelas zabo nranazibitse nanze kuzikoresha , hari igihe numva ko atari byo , hari igihe numva ko n' ubwo nbibonye ariko ko batapfuye , hari umunsi numva ko bitashoboka ... bitashoboka ko abantu bapfa bangana kuriya ,
but there 's nothing i can do about it , it is something i am starting to accept and i thank god that i have a good life today . ||| ko wenda bari ahandi hantu . ko batapfuye . ariko nta kunri ntangiye kubiemera no kushima imaan ko yashoboye kumpa situation nziza nyuma nrimaraiye ( se marier @:
i later on got married and i have 2 kids . ||| nrashatse ) nfite abana babiri .
whenever i remember my siblings who died and even our neighbours , i feel very sad but when i look at my children , it gives me the desire to continue to live . ||| iyo nibutse abo tuvukanaaga cyangwa n' abaturanyi agahinda karanyica ariko nbona abana banjye nkabona bimpaye kushaka kubaho ,
they are my siblings and my children at the same time . ||| nkabona nibo bavandimwe banjye kandi nibo bana banjye .
are you still with shumbusho ? ||| shumbusho muracyari kumwe ?
yes , shumbusho is still with me and i do my best to help him forget all the bad things he saw . ||| yego , shumbusho turi kumwe , turi kumwe shumbusho . ariko naho turi kumwe ariko nkora byose kugirango shumbusho nrebae ko yakuibagirwa ibyo bintu byose yabonye .
but sometimes i get the impression that life is meaningless to him . ||| ariko ubona hariho igihe ubona ko shumbusho kubaho nta na kimwe ... nta na kimwe bimubwiye . ubona hariho igihe ubona ntazi nnjyae aho ari .
sometimes he looks so absent . but he is such a source of joy to me because i believe that even if our family was wiped out , god will give it back to us one day through shumbusho . ||| ariko akaongera akantera kuishima kuko nziko n' ubwo umuryango wacu uzimye nziko umunsi umwe imaan izaongera kuwutuha iwucaishije muri shumbusho .
you 'd think dad called him shumbusho ( meaning the substitute ) knowing that through him , we shall have a substitute to our family . ||| wagirango papa yarimwise aziko ariwe uzaba shumbusho w' umuryango wacu .
how many children were you in your family ? ||| mwari bangahe , mwari abana bangahe ?
we were ... the boys were 4 plus shumbusho , that makes it 5 and my little sister ngirabakunzi and i. ||| turi aba ... abahungu bari ... bane bapfuye na shumbusho wa gatanu na petite soeur ngirabakunzi na njyae .
if we go back to 1994 ... can you remember exactly how you left kibuye for gisenyi ? ||| tugarutse inyuma gato mu kihae cyo muri 90 ... niba ubiibuka neza utubwiye ko uri uri ku gisenyi , ese uje kuva ku kibuye kutae ujya kuba ku gisenyi ?
was it as a consequence of the war ? ||| n' ibyo bibazo by' intambara ?
no , it was n't because of the war . i left home before the war started . ||| oya ntabwo ari ibyo bibazo biri biriho by' intambara nnavuye iwacu ibyo bintu by' intambara bitari biba ,
i was brought up in gisenyi because that 's where my mom was born . ||| kubera ko mama avuka ku gisenyi niho narerewe ,
i was mainly brought up in her family . ||| akenshi narerewe mu miryango yo kwa mama .
did any of your neighbours in gisenyi die when the inkotanyis attacked in 1990 ? ||| igihe inkotanyi zitera muri 1990 hari abaturanyi mwari muturanye ku gisenyi baba baraishwe ?
not among our neighbours in gisenyi . ||| abo turi tuturanye ku gisenyi oya ,
not where i was living . but people i know of people who died in kayove where mom was from . ||| aho nri ndi nta bapfuye kaereka aho mama akomoka i kayove nibo nzi bapfuye .
you told us your mom 's family and your cousins lived in kayove . who were you living with in gisenyi ? ||| ku gisenyi ubanaaga na nde kuko utubwiye ko i kayove hari famille ya mama n' aba cousine ?
i was living with mother 's cousin in gisenyi . ||| ku gisenyi ni abana n' umucousine wa mama .
how did you end up in kigali ? ||| hanyuma igihe uje ... uje i kigali kutae ?
we did n't understand it well ... ||| uva ku gisenyi ntabwo ubitusobanuraiye neza .
i had a white boyfriend . ||| nri nfite inshuti tuuzuraaga y' umuzungu , fiance wanjye .
i used to come and visit him but i would also bring some things to sell . ||| njyaaga nza kumureba ariko nkaza nfite n' utuntu two kucuruza , kutugurisha nkagenda .
i would stay at maria 's until i finish sellingmy things then i would go back home . ||| ariko nkaba ndi kwa mariya , kwa mariya niho nbaga nshumbitse , kugeza igihe ibintu byanjye bizamara kugurairw nkabona kusubira i gisenyi .
you told us the war broke up when you had been in kigali for 3 days , you also said that there 's a time you were with the child called micheveux for about 2 weeks , i did n't quite undertand that part . ||| utubwiye ko , wigeze kutubwira ko intambara yabaye umaze iminsi itatu i kigali ; hari n' ahandi utubwiye ko uri kumwe na wa mwana witwa mishove , mwari mumaraanye nk' ibyumweru bibiri mumenyaanye , ntabwo tubiumvise neza
well , when i said 2 weeks , i also realized later on that i made a mistake . ||| ok , hariya nvuze ibyumweru bibiri nnjyae nbiumvise nyuma nibeshye .
i spent about 2 weeks hiding together with micheveux and that 's the time she one day told me she was convinced she was going to die . ||| mishove tumaze nka 2 semaines ( ibyumweru bibiri ) tuihishaanye . icyo kihae nibwo yanbwiye ati @: "@ odette njyewe uyu munsi ntapfa . @"
i asked her why and she told me she felt like she was smelling blood all over her body . ||| nramubaza nti @: kubera iki unbwiye ko uri bupfae ? aranbwira ati @: "@ ndi kaumva ninukair amaraso ahantu hose . @"
i told her she was n't going to die , trying to reassure her . ||| nramubwira ngo ntabwo tupfa , nramuhumuriza .
but it was as though she actually knew she was going to die because that 's the same day her whole family was taken away . ||| ariko wagirango yari abizi ni uwo munsi iwabo wa mishove bose babatwaye ,
only a boy survived plus a girl who was in butare . ||| ariko hasigaye umwana umwe iwabo w' umuhungu n' undi w' umukobwa uri i butare .
michoveux died with them . ||| ariko micheveux yarapfuye .
have you heard anything giramata , the one you were hiding with at maria 's ? ||| ba bantu mwari mwihishanye igihe ubaga kwa mariya ba giramata , nta makuru yabo ... ?
mama giramata survived together with her husband and children . ||| mama giramata yararokotse arokokaan n' abana be n' umugabo .
but i have never heard anything about melanie . ||| ariko melanie ntabwo nigeze menya amakuru ye .
i never saw her again after the day i was with her in the bush . ||| ntabwo nongeye kumubona , umunsi wa nyuma turi turi kumwe mu gihuru niwo munsi nmubonye .
were helene and maria sisters ? ||| harya helene yavukanaaga na mariya ?
yes helene was maria 's younger sister . ||| yego baravukanaaga helene yari murumuna wa mariya .
and helene kept on looking for ways to hide you ... ||| hanyuma ariko nyuma helene yabashije kukushakira ukuntu yagiye agusova ...
yes , she is the one who helped me to get all the people who hid me because i did n't know anyone else in kigali apart from helene and her sister . ||| yego , yabashije kunshakira abantu bose bampisha , kuko njyae ntabwo nri nbazi nta muntu nri nzi i kigali . uretse uwo mukuru we na helene nta banri .
meaning that if helene did n't help me find all those people , i would not have survived . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo iyo helene atanfasha ngo anshakirae abantu bose bampishe , ntabwo nri kubaho .
was she married ? ||| yari afite umugabo ?
her husband was a killer . ||| yari afite umugabo ariko umugabo wicaga ,
he killed some people . ||| umugabo we yaraishe .
she even told me that if her husband had n't become a monster , she would have kept me in her home and that there was no point of keeping me there because he 's kill me ... i would n't survive even one night . ||| umugabo we yaraishe ubwo yarananbwiraaga ati @: « iyo umugabo wanjye aba atameze kuriya ngo abe atabaye igisimba , nnjyae nkugumana hano . ati ariko nkugumanye hano yakuica ntabwo ... urara .
her husband used to spend all his time going to roadblocks and she did n't want to have my death on her conscience . ||| kuko umugabo we yirirwaaga kuri bariyeri agenda , ntabwo yashoboraaga kufata uwo mutwaro wo kunshyira iwe .
if her husband had been a good man , she would have hidden me because it was on her heart . ||| iyo umugabo we aza kuba mwiza nawe aba yarangumanye ; kuko yari afite umutima .
if everyone had been like helene and mama sania , the tutsis in rwanda would not have died and been wiped out . ||| iyo abantu bose baza kumera nka helene , bakamera nka mama sania ntabwo abatutsi baba barapfuye mu gihugu ngo bashirae . ariko mama sania niwe ... mu bantu bose bampishe ,
but mama sania is the one ... among all the people who hid me , she surpasses them all because she became like a parent to me . ||| ariko we yashyizeho akarusho kuko we yanbereye umubyeyi . kuko we yaranbwiye ati @: « biriya byose bavuga ngo abatutsi ngo ni babi , ati @:
she told me , "@ everything that 's said about the tutsis and how wicked they are is not true , i am not a tutsi and to the best of my knowledge , there 's no tutsi blood in our family . ||| ni ukubeshya ati @: njyae ntabwo ndi umututsi , ati @: nta n' ubwo n' iwacu harimo umututsi mu maraso y' iwacu .

do n't get discouraged to the point of asking god ... of saying that god ... @" sometimes i 'd be so discouraged that i asked her what crime we committed , what sin the tutsis committed to the point of becoming an outcast tribe . ||| ati @: kubera icyo kintu ntinshobora kugirair nabi umututsi . » ati @: « ntabwo abatutsi ari babi ati @:

i did n't understand how god created us and could allow us to die like animals , even animals do n't die that way . ||| nawe nkamubwira nti @: ni igiki tukoze , ni igiki abatutsi bacumuye kitumye tuba ubwoko busa nk' aho ... kuko numvaaga nbaye maudit ( ruvumaw ) numvaaga turi maudit ( turavumawe ) kuko jyae numvaaga ntibishoboka ko imaan yaba yaraturemye ngo itumae abantu bapfa nk' impyisi . n' impyisi ntabwo zipfa kuriya ;
sometimes i do n't even how to put it . ||| bapfa nk' ibintu ntazi kuko ntinzi ukuntu ntabwo njya nbona n' aho nbishyira ntinzi ukuntu nbibona ;
i used to tell her that god did n't exist but later on i asked god to forgive me because i know he is there and he is n't the one who made them such things . ||| nramubwiraaga nti @: imaan ntibaho ariko nyuma nsabye imaan imbabazi nrayibwiye ngo inbabarirae kuko iriho ntabwo ariyo yatumye bakora ibintu nka biriya .
what about the child called mutoni you met at the orphanage , did you see her again ? ||| ka kana mwahuriyeyo nako kaitwa mutoni , ese ntabwo mwongeye kubonaan ?
umutoni , i looked for ... after i got my own house , i was planning to ask for her and raise her up together with shumbusho since my cousins had also died . ||| umutoni nshatse ... bon nraje nyuma maze kubona inzu , ntekereza kugirango nzagendae nsabae umutoni bamumpe numvaaga ko , ngomba kumurera kuko nri nfite ubushobozi kuko nri maze kubura abo barumuna banjye bo kwa data wacu nkaumva ko we na shumbusho batazananira kubatunga .
i felt i could afford taking care fo the 2 of them . i had started all the paper works in order to ask for her and shumbusho , even shumbusho was n't immediately given to me . ||| ariko umutoni nsubiye muri orphelinat nri maze kutangira amaprocedure yose yo kugirango mufatae , nzamufataane na shumbusho , kuko ni nabyo nshakaaga . kuko na shumbusho ntabwo bahise bamumpa .
they gave him to me when they were assured that i had the means to take care of him . ||| bamumpaye babonye ko ndi capable yo kuba nmurera .
as far as umutoni is concerned , they told me relatives of her from burundi went to ask for her . ||| umutoni rero nsubiyeyo baranbwira ngo hari abantu bene wabo babonetse bavuye i burunri , baragenda baramusaba baramutwara , kuko ngo umutoni yari yageze muri iyo orphelinat ,
she was taken to the orphanage by a 12 year old girl , she had picked her among dead bodies . ||| yatwawe n' undi mwana w' umukobwa ariko we uri ukuze .
she was older and she is the one who told the people of the orphanage the names of umutoni 's parents . ||| kuko ngo uwari umutwaye yamukuye mu mirambo yari akuze , kuko yari afite douze ans ( imyaka cumi n' ibiri ) yaramurutaaga ho ... yaramurutaaga ni nawe rero ushoboye kubwira muri orphelinat amazina y' ababyeyi b' umutoni .
have you been able to bury in respect some of your people ? ||| hari abantu bawe uba urabashije kushyingura mu cyubahiro ?
yes , i buried ngirabakunzi my little sister , alfred and uwitonze and our uncle mutabazi . ||| yego , nshyinguye ngirabakunzi ma soeur ( murumuna wanjye ) na alphred n' uwitonze , na data wacu mutabazi .
because they ... mutabazi was killed together with uwitonze my 8 year old brother . we found them together . ||| kuko bo ... mutabazi bamwicanye na musaza wanjye muto baishe afite imyaka umunani , uwitonze bari bari kumwe tubakuye hamwe .
alfred was killed near our home . ||| alphred nawe bamwiciye hafi uvuye i wacu .
i found their corpses and buried them . ||| ku buryo nje kushobora kubona aho bari bari nrabashyingura .
dad was also killed near home , he was at the stadium but he managed to escape and then went back in ruvumbu , our home area and that 's where he was killed . ||| papa rero nawe bamwiciye aho hafi y' iwacu kuko yagiye muri stade avayo agaruka aho iwacu mu ruvumbu niho bamwiciye .
but i found out about it when he had already been taken to bisesero with other corpses . ||| ariko papa nbimenye bamaze kumujyana mu bisesero hamwe n' abandi ,
some people exhumed his body from where he was buried after being killed and took him to bisesero . ||| abashoboye kumukura aho bamushyinguye bamwiciye , bahise bamujyana mu bisesero .
how did you manage to face life after the war after all the difficulties you went through plus the fact that shumbusho was seriously disturbed by everything he had gone through ? ||| hanyuma nyuma y' intambara umaze kurokoka , umaze kuhura n' ibibazo , uhuye nabyo mu ntiambara , mbese umaze kuhura n' umwana shumbusho ;
how did you manage to face such a life ? ||| mutoya wawe ugombaaga kugirango umufatae . ndetse nawe ubonaaga yaragize ibibazo by' ihungabana . ese utubwira uburyo ubashije kuba muri ubwo buzima ni kutae ubashije kubumetiriza ( maitriser )
it made me feel mature because it was as though i became shumbusho 's mother , i started a new life ; i felt very responsible for him and i knew i 'd have to do everything i could to be able to raise him up and pay for his education . ||| nhise numva nbaye mukuru , kuko nhise numva nbaye nka mama wa shumbusho , kuko nhise numva nbaye mu bunri buzima . nhise nvuga ngo shumbusho ngomba kukoresha uburyo bwose bwo kugirango nbashae kumutunga ,
besides , when i finished organizing myself and putting everything together , i found cynthia , my cousin , the daughter of mom 's younger sister alive ! ||| ndetse no kumurihair ishuri . ariko nyuma maze kwiyenstalla ( s' installer @: kushyira ibintu hamwe ) nbashije kubona undi mwana wa murumuna wa mama , witwa cynthia .
so i was living with both of them . ||| ubwo nbana nabo .
i t was n't easy as cynthia used to spend the whole night screaming , she still does it at times today . ||| ariko ntabwo byanyoroheye , kuko cynthia we nijoro yararaga asakuza , kandi n' ubu ntibiri bimushiramo .
even today she wakes up in the middle of the night saying , "@ let 's flee , the interahamwes are coming to kill us ... let 's flee , the interahamwes are coming to kill us . @" ||| na n' ubu niko aryama arabyuka ninjoro ati @: « nimuhungae interahamwe zije kutuica ... tuhungae interahamwe zije kutuica . » ubwo bararaga basakuza ,
so they 'd make a lot of noise in the night , even shumbusho would join her . ||| shumbusho akasakuza ,
it was as though in their mind , they were still living in the war . ||| cynthia akasakuza ubonaaga ko mu mutawe wabo intambara bari bakiyirimo .
they did n't believe it was over . ||| ntabwo bari baizera ko intambara yashize ;
i put shumbusho in school but it was n't going to be possible for cynthia to be away as she was in a very bad state . ||| nbasize ... nsize shumbusho ku ishuri , cynthia ariko we ntibiri kushoboka kubara , yari yaraangiritse cyane . nbanje kumureka kugirango abashae kaumva ko tutakiri mu ntiambara ,
she went back to school later on . ||| kugirango ... kuko ntabwo ishuri yari kurishobora . icyo kihae yaje kujya ku ishuri nyuma .
shumbusho on the other hand ... i was trying my best to make my children happy . ||| shumbusho we rero ... nkoreshaaga ibishoboka byose kugirango abo bana banjye nshoborae kubashimaish .
i would use my salary to shop and pay the rent ... i suddenly had all these responsibilities ... my reaction was n't to ... the life i lived then did n't quite match with my age ... i turned 18 during the war . ||| udufaranga mpembwe nkagenda nkahaha nkariha inzu , nkariha ishuri , nri nrabaye ... ngize amaresponsabilites ( inshingano ) ntinhita ngira bya binri by' aba ... ntabwo nvuga ngo nbayeho ubuzima icyo kihae bw' imyaka nri nkwiriye ,
i did n't think like an 18 year old person . ||| kuko umuntu ufite imyaka cumi ... kuko nraibuka anniversaire y' imyaka cumi n' umunani nyigize mu ntiambara . ntabwo ntekerezaaga nk' umuntu ufite iyo myaka yanjye nri nfite .
i felt i needed to do all i could so that shumbusho and cynthia could study . ||| numvaaga ngomba kukoresha byose , ubushobozi bwanjye bwose nri nfite kugirango shumbusho na cynthia bazashoborae kuiga ,
that 's all i was concentrating on . ||| nta kinri kintu njyewe nrebaaga .
among the neighbours who killed your family , are there some who participated openly and never went to jail ? ||| hari abaturanyi mwari muturanye baba baragize uruhare mu kukuicira umuryango bakihari , bataigeze bafataw ngo bafungwae ?
yes there are ... in our areas ... most of them still do n't believe what they did was wrong and have n't come out in the open to tell the truth . ||| barahari , iwacu ho , ibintu byo ... abenshi bo nta nubwo bari baumva ko banagize nabi ngo biibura bashoborae no kuvugaish ukuri .
i went there after the war and they told mehow my family was killed and who killed them . ||| kuko njyewe nragiye nyuma y' intambara , banbwira uburyo abantu b' iwacu bapfuye . banbwira uburyo bapfuye banbwira n' ababaishe .
but when people started being arrested and the lawsuits started , they refused to testify . ||| ariko nyuma batangiye kugenda bafataw , hatangiye kujya haba ibintu by' imanza bakanga kubivuga .
and when we would ask them about the previous times they said it , they 'd say they never said it . ||| umubwira uti @: « ese ko ubinbwiye cya kihae , akakubwira ngo ntabyo nigeze nkubwira , njyae ibyo bintu ntabwo nigeze nbikubwira . »
some got arrested but others were never arrested . ||| hari abafashwae ariko hari n' abatarigeze bafataw .
for example , among the children who killed ngirabakunzi - one was mature enough - do you believe a 12 or 15 year old person who kills is still a child ? ||| kuko nko mu baishe ngirabakunzi , ma soeur mu baishe ma soeur harimo umuhungu uri ukuze muri abo bana bato bamwishe , ariko nawe yari umwana . kuko niba se umuntu yishe afite imyaka 12 cyangwa 15 nawe aba ari umwana !
they arrested him and released him later on saying he is mentally disturbed , but i also think they released him because he was a child . ||| ariko baramufashe nyuma baranamurekura ngo afite ibibazo by' umutima . ariko nibaza ko banamurekuye kubera ko yari n' umwana .
but even the rest of the people who killed my family or neighbours were never arrested and those who were have been released . ||| ariko abandi , abaishe abantu b' iwacu , cyangwa se n' abandi bantu turi tuturanye , abenshi ntabwo bafashwae .
if i had known that they were going to release them , i would n't have wasted my time pursuing them . ||| ntabwo bafashwae n' abari barafashwae barabafunguye . ariko ku buryo ahubwo n' iyo nbimenya ko bazabafunga bakabafungura , nta nubwo nba nririwe nta igihe cyanjye ngo nrabirukaho ngo babafungae .
i would just have let them go . ||| nba nrabaretse nkabaihorera .
i would have let them go because this should be the time when ... they should be shameful of their deeds ... but when i see them , i am the one who is ashamed because they killed my family and others as well . ||| nba nrabaihoreye kuko ubu nibwo muri make ... ubu nibo bakagombye kugira isoni , kuko banyiciye cyangwa baishe n' abandi .
today i see them and i remember how i pursued them , wanting them to be arrested and i feel ashamed . ||| ariko ubu nrababona nkuibuka ukuntu nbirukaagaho ngo babafungae ... ariko nrababona nkaumva arijyae ufite isoni .
i see them and i am so dishonored i could hide myself or i wish i could move to a place where i would n't be seeing them anymore ! ||| nkaumva arijyae umwaye , nkaumva iyaba nri nfite aho nkuihisha , cyangwa nfite ahandi hantu njya ntababona , ngenda .
it 's so shocking to run after somebody who killed your people so they can be imprisoned and then see them released ! ||| njyae kuko biteye isoni kuiruka ku muntu ukugiraiye nabi ngo bamufungae , ejo bakamufungura .
had i known it was going to be that way , i would n't have gotten involved . ||| iyo nbimenya ntabyo nba nririwe njyamo .
the politic of the government consists in releasing the people who have acknowledged their crimes so they can live with the rwandan nation again and be united with them all over again . ||| hari ikintu leta ikora cyo kufungura abantu ngo bireze bakaemera icyaha , kugirango baze mu banyarwanda , baongerae baiyungae .
what do you think of that ? ||| icyo kintu ukibona kutae ?
and how do you think things should be ? ||| wowe ubona bigenda bite ?
personally , i can not say that ... i have lost so much because of those people . ||| ku bwanjye ntabwo nvuga ngo ... urebye bariya bantu barampombeje .
they took away my family and everyone else who lost his or her people lost in the same way . ||| kuko banbujije umuryango , bahombya n' uwunri wese ubuze abe .
if my opinion is that they should be imprisoned and remain there - i have asked some people - and i believe that would be the right thing to do ... and that 's why i am saying that if i had known it from before , i would n't have spent so much time running after them for them to be put in jail . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo nvuze ngo @: ntekereje ngo babakomezae babafungae wenda ngo babagumaishe mu munyururu , ibyo aribyo byose njyae hari abo nasabonuje , kandi numva ko aribyo ... ari nabyo nvuga ngo iyo menya hakiri kare ntabwo nba nririwe nbirukaho ngo babafungae .
in jail , it is the government that feeds them . ||| kuko hariya bafunze ibyo barya ni leta ibibagaburira . bagirae kuba barayiciye abantu , ibyo aribyo byose ibyo barya birahenze !
not only did they kill my people - i 'd expect that their meals are expensive , their lives , their health , all that is costly - so the country is losing and it 's already lost anyway . ||| n' ubuzima bwabo , iyo barwaye ... burahenze . nraumva rero igihugu kirahomba kandi n' ubundi kiranahombaye .
so in my opinion , releasing them so that they can be working for the country is n't bad . ||| ubwo rero ibiiza nraumva ko kuba barabaretse bakagenda bakajya hanze , bakagenda bakakora bakanakorera n' igihugu nraumva jyae ntabwo nvuga ngo bagize nabi .
there 's no other solution anyway . ||| nta yinri solution nta kinri kiboneka .
because if i take the case of my home area in kibuye , almost everyone in rubengera killed ; even the one who did n't take a machete pointed at the place where a tutsi was hiding , showing his or her friend . ||| kuko ubundi nk' iwacu ku kibuye ahantu i rubaengair , abantu hafi ya bose baraishe . baraishe abantu hafi ya bose , n' utarafashe umupanga yatungaiye mugenzi we agatoki aho umututsi yari ari .
it reached a point where even children killed in kibuye , a ten year old child or a seven year old one were busy looking for people in the bush . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo ku kibuye ho hageze n' aho abana bica . bafite n' imyaka icumi bafite irindwi bakagenda bakajya mu masaka bakajya kuhiga abandi .
meaning that all those people should be taken to jail which is impossible . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo abo bantu bose ukagombye kugenda ukabafata , ukabashyira ahantu bose ukabafunga . ariko ntabwo bishoboka .
how would the country develop if everyone is in jail ? ||| igihugu se kitera inberae kutae abantu bari mu munyururu ?
that 's not possible . ||| ntabwo bishoboka .
so we just have to accept , there 's no other solution . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo tugomba kubiemera nta kunri .
but it would be so much better if all of them would accept their crime and apologize . ||| kusa iyaba babiemeraaga , bakasaba imbabazi kandi bose .
not so much because they know acknowledging it and apologizing is a means of being in jail for a shorter time . i have a problem with it ! they teach them that if they accept their crimes , their punishment shall be reduced . ||| ntibibae ngo nimbyemera nkasaba imbabazi nzafungwa igihe gito , nzagabanyirizwa icyaha . kiriya kintu nicyo kintu kinbabaza . kugenda bakabaigisha ngo nimusaba imbabazi ngo muzagabanyirizwa icyaha ,
one should first of all apologize from the heart , it should n't be because someone else has instilled it in one 's mind . ||| biriya byo biranbabaza . kuko ubundi umuntu yagombye kusaba imbabazi bivuye mu mutaima we , atari undi ugiye ngo abimuteraemo . kuko barabibafasha bakabibatsindagiramo ,
they keep telling them how when they apologize even after killing many people , they 'll be in jail for a short time . ||| bakababwira ngo nusaba imbabazi wishe abantu bangana gutya uzafungwa igihe gito ,
it 's useless . ||| ntaho bava ntaho bajya .
the fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again . ||| kuko kuba bonyine batabiikuraiye mu mutaima wabo ngo babikuraeyo kubera ko babibawiyew n' umutima wabo , ni ukuvuga ngo ejo , ejo bashobora kaongera kabikora .
are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ? ||| none se abaishe sogokuru wanjye , nibo nyuma baishe musaza wanjye nibo bamwishe ?
it was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 . ||| hari hashize imyaka myinshi kandi bamwishe muri 1959 .
meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo niba bo bonyine batavuze ngo tukoze nabi tuica abaturanyi , tuica abantu tusaga nk' aho tuva inda imwe , ntacyo tubaziza , none koko reka tusabae imbabazi ;
so , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo ntaho bava ntaho bajya ejo bazaongera babikorae .
you said that imprisoning them is a waste for the country . ||| uravuga uti @: « kubafunga n' uguhombya igihugu . »
do you believe the country will gain when they are free ? do you think it will be of any use for the country ? ||| ese ubona kubafungura igihugu aribwo kizaunguka ? ubona hari agaciro hari icyo bizamarair abanyarwanda ?
putting them in jail in my opinion is ... a killer ... someone who killed infants , who got an infant , hit it on a wall and killed it ; who killed a mother with a shaped stick of wood ! ||| nraumva njyewe kubafunga ... none se umuntu wishe ... umuntu wishe abantu nka kuriya abantu baishe impinja , akafata uruhinja akakubita ku rukuta uruhinja rukapfa , akafata umubyeyi akamwica amwicishije igisuti !
actually ... you 'd ... i do n't think they should even be imprisoned . ||| ubundi ... uraumva wa ... kumufunga ubundi njyae nraumva atanafungwa .
i think they should die ... they should just die , they should be sentenced to death . ||| nraumva yapfa ... nraumva yagombye kujya hariya akapfa , akacirwa urwo kupfa , akapfa .
but if almost all of them did that , what 's the point of imprisoning ? ||| ariko se niba hafi ya bose barakoze ibintu nk' ibyo ? nraumva kubafunga ntacyo biba bimaze ,
they should let them free so they can be seeing us on the streets ; they thought we would be wiped out ! ||| nraumva babarekura bakajya hanze bakajya banatubona , bakatubona kuko bo baumvaaga ko tuzashira .
they thought their children would be asking what a tutsi was looking like . ||| baumvaaga ko ngo umwana azajya abaza ngo ariko umututsi yasaga atae ?
let them see us ! ||| bakajya banatubona ... bakatubona .
one thing that hurts me is seeing a survivor becoming an alcoholic . ||| kusa ikintu kinbabaza , ni nko kubona umuntu ucitse ku icumu akaumva ko yasigaye akajya mu nzaoga akaba umusinzi .
we should n't turn into alcoholics or get discouraged . ||| ntabwo tukagombye kuba abasinzi , cyangwa ngo tucikae intege . ahubwo ibyabaye bikagombye kutubera impamvu yo kuva hasi , tukashaka uburyo bunri bwo kuva hasi ,
on the contrary , what happened should be a reason for us to stand up and develop ourselves as much as possible for those who have the means to attain that development and those who do not have comfortable life , they could approach their friends ... that 's all i can think of . ||| tushaka ukuntu twakwiteza inberae ababishoboye . abatabishoboye nabo bakajya baegera bagenzi babo nta kunri ... nta kinri nbona , nta kinri .
what do you think of the lives of the survivors in this country ? ||| ubona ubuzima bw' abacitse ku icumu bwitwaye kutae muri kino gihugu ?
how do you feel about gacaca , unity and reconciliation ? ||| ibintu bya gacaca n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ubuumva kutae muri make ?
[ she laughs ... ] unity and reconciliation ! ||| ( yabanje kuseka ) ubumwe n' ubwiyunge !
of course you can not tell people not to be united , because if you say so , you 'd be like the people who killed the tutsis . ||| ubundi ntabwo ukabwiye abantu ngo ntibakaiyungae , ntushobora kubwira abantu ngo ntimukaiyungae .
you would n't be any different from them . ||| kuko ubwiye abantu ngo ntimukaiyungae nawe uba ubaye nk' abaishe abatutsi .
on the other hand , would you dare tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed alfred ? ||| ntaho uba utanaiye nabo . ariko ubundi ubu se ngewe unbwira ngo ngendae niyungae n' umuntu wishe alphred ?
would you tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed my father ? ||| ubu se njyewe unbwira ngo ngendae niyungae n' umuntu wishe data ?
yes , we have to live together in order to build the country but you can not tell me to reconcile with them . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo tugomba kubaan kugirango tuubakae igihugu , ariko kuvuga ngo ngendae niyungae n' umuntu unyiciye ibyo ntabwo bishoboka .
you would be asking for the impossible ! ||| ni ukuvuga ngo ni ukukusaba ... ni ukusaba ibintu bitashoboka . uri ubona umuntu akusaba ibintu bitashoboka n' ukukusaba ibidashoboka ,
that 's just impossible ! ||| ibyo ntibishoboka ... ntabwo bishoboka .
today march 21 , 2007 , we are here at the head office of avega in the eastern province with mujawamariya francoise , one of the people supported by avega . we are going to have a discussion with her and she will tell her story . ||| iyu munsi n' itariki 21/03/2007 tukaba turi ahangaha ku kicaro cya avega mu ntara y' iburasirazuba turi kumwe na mujawamariya francoise ,
the story of what she went through during the genocide . ||| umwe mu bafashwa na avega aho tugiye kuganira nawe atubwira amateka ye kuri genocide .
mujawamariya francoise you could start up with introducing yourself ? ||| mujawamariya francoise rero ndagirango mutangirae mutuibwira .
my name is mujawamariya francoise and i was born in gashirabwoba , former gisumu . ||| nitwa mujawamariya francoise nkaba nvuka i gashirabwoba ahairi gisumu kiera .
when the genocide happened ... we all know it happened all across rwanda ... you , with your family in gisumu , would you tell us in detail how the genocide affected you ? ||| none genocide itangira nkuko tubizi yabaye hirya no hino mu rwanda hose . mwebwe iwanyu i gisuma tugiraaga ngo mutunyurairemo mu magambo arambuye . ese genocide yabagezeho kutae ?
where did it find you ? ||| ese yabasanze hehe ?
how many people made your family ? ||| mu rugo mwari abantu mungana iki ?
what happened to you ? ||| byabagendekeye bite ?
we were eight children in my family with both parents . ||| mu rugo turi abana umunani n' ababyeyi bombi .
when the genocide started we fled to the hospital in bushenyi . ||| genocide itangiye turahunga tuhungira ku bitaro mu bushenyi ,
interahamwes found us there and killed my parents and all my siblings . ||| interahamwe zitusangayo aba ariho zaicira n' ababyeyi banjye n' abana tuvukanaaga ,
i continued to run ... we fled to a place called ‘ ku kagatamu ’ . interahamwes found us again and killed everybody that was with me but i managed to escape . ||| igihe kiragera nkomeza kurorongotana tuirukanka . tuhungira ahantu hitwa kukagatamu interahamwe naho zirahatusanga , abo turi turi kumwe barabica ariko nbasha kaongera kuirukanka ,
while running , i met other interahamwe militiamen . they raped me but did n't kill me . ||| muri uko kuirukanka nje kuhura n' interahamwe zinfata ku ngufu .
... i kept on running away ... there was a man whom dad had been in the past ... he took me to his mother 's house where they hid me . ||| nyuma nrakomeje ntizahise zinyica nrakomeje ntahunga hari umugabo , hari umusore papa yari yaragiraiye neza ansanga aho ndi anjyana mu rugo kwa nyina ,
later , the police took me out of that house saying that i had a son in the rpf . ||| barampisha igihe kiragera baraza kuhankura aba police ngo n' uko turi tufite umwana mu nkotanyi .
then they took to be jailed at the commune office of gisumu . ||| banjyana kunfungair kunfunga kuri commune hari commune gisuma ,
policemen at the commune office raped me ... then at some point i was taken to cyangugu saying that they caught an interahamwe ... sorry an inkotanyi woman instead . ||| aba police ba commune nabo baranfata ku ngufu , igihe kiragera banjyana i cyangugu ngo bafashe interahamwe nako inkotanyikazi ,
when i reached cyangugu , the soldiers raped me again . ||| njyeze i cyangugu naho banfata ku ngufu abasirikare .
at some point , a born @-@ again soldier came ... he called himself so ! ||| igihe kiragera havamo umusirikare w' umurokorae ubwo yiitaaga umurokorae ,
he asked me if i had any relatives in congo then i lied to him that that i did . ||| ambaza niba hari bene wacu nfite hakurya muri congo , nbeshya ko nbafite kugira ngo nrebae ko nrokoka . yaje kuncikaish nko mu ma saa kumi n' imwe za mugitondo nbasha kugera muri congo nambukaijew n' umu n' umu zairaw uje uri uvuye kubohoza hano i kamembe mutwaza utuntu ngera hakurya .
i was trying to find a way to survive . ||| igihe kiragera interahamwe zitangira kuhungira hakurya zitangiye kuhunga nraongera nragaruka njya kuba mu nkambi i nyarushishi .
the first people who raped you , the interahamwe militia ... did you know any of them ? how would you describe them ? ||| nonese bariya bantu ba mbere bakufashe ku ngufu , ziriya nterahamwe hari izo harimo abantu uruzimo cyangwa ugereranyaije banganaaga iki ?
they were two and they came from karengera . i did n't know them . ||| bari babiri ariko bari baturutse muri karengera ntabwo nri nbazi .
the born @-@ again soldier you told us about , is he the one that helped you get to the congelese woman ? ||| hanyuma uwo musirikare utubwiye w' umurokorae se niwe uri ukufashije kukugeza kuwo mu zairoise ?
no . he just took me up to the road and he told me to go . i went i met the congolese woman on my way and when i reached rusizi river , we crossed it together . ||| oya yangejeje hariya hano ha hano mu muhanda abasha kunbwira ngo nii njyende njyewe ngiye mpura n' uwo mu zairoise ngeze hariya ku rusizi mpita nambukaan nawe ,
that man only took me up to the road but we did n't go all the way together . ||| yangejeje mu nzira ntabwo tugeraanyeyo .
but you did n't tell us about the death of your parents or your relatives . ||| hanyuma ntabwo ariko mwadusobanuriye neza ku bintu bierekeraanye n' urupfu rw' ababyeyi bawe cyangwa n' abavandimwe bawe .
how were they killed ? ||| ese baba baraishwe rupfu ki ?
where did they throw them ? ||| ese babajugunye he ?
could you try to tell us about that ? ||| ugerageza ukatunyurairmo .
my dad after managing to reach the football court of gashirabwoba got shot by some policemen and soldiers from cyangugu . ||| papa we yari yabashije kugera hariya ku kibuga cy' umupira i gashirabwoba ba baramurashe ni n' abapo n' abasirikare bari bavuye i cyangugu barashe ,
that 's how he died . ||| bagiye kuharasa yapfuye muri ubwo buryo .
my mum and my siblings were killed with machetes at the hospital of bushenge . ||| naho maman n' abana bo babaicishije amahiri n' imipanga hariya mu bushenge ku bitaro .
does that mean that from your whole family and all the people you lived with , you are the only survivor ? ||| none n' ukuvuga ng' ubungubu mu mulyango wo mwabanaga usigaye wenyine ?
yes . ||| uuuu
what happened in nyabushishi refugee camp ? ||| hanyuma mu maze kuba mu nkambi y' inyabushishi bije kugenda bite ?
we would like you to continue telling us how life was like went so we can wrap up . ||| turagira ngo ukomezae utubwirae uko ubuzima buje kugenda kugira ngo turangizae .
after some time in the camp in nyabushishi ... i had a brother who was in the rpf who came to know that i was in nyabushishi . ||| tumaze tugiye mu nkambi i nyabushishi nri nfite musaza wanjye mukuru uri uragiye mu nkotanyi ,
he came and took me where he was staying in butare . we stayed together in butare but after sometimes he died in a motorcycle crash . ||| aza kumenya ko na ndi i nyabushishi aza kuhanvana anjya yabaga i butare tubana i butare ariko igihe kirageze aza kuicwa na accident ya moto .
after he died i returned to cyangugu and avega started to help me . ||| amaze kupfa ngarutse i cyangugu avega itangira kunfasha ,
that 's how i came back . ||| ni muri ubwo buryo ngarutse .
we would like you to explain in detail from the time you left butare how avega came to know about you ... of course you were admitted in bushenge hospital but i do n't avega knew you out of the blue ! ||| tugira ngo noneho ugeragezae utusobanuraire mu buryo na none burambuye kuva icyo kihae uvuye i butare utubwirae inkuru ndende y' uko avega yakumenye n' ubwo uri usanzwe ibya aribyo byose uryariye mu bushenge ariko ntabwo bipfuye kuza gutya kusa ,
it must have happened in a way . ||| hari ukuntu bigiye bigenda .
describe in detail how your life was like from the time the genocide started until late when it ended . ||| ubuzima bwawe uko bugiye bu bugenda n' ubwo bwose , noneho ugeragezae kugenda ubituha mu buryo burambuye kukomeza nyuma y' igihe kingana gutya genocide irangiye .
i was very sick at the hospital when some staff of the tribunal in kigali came to cyangugu for work . ||| nrarwaye icyo kihae cyane abakozi bo kuri tribunal i kigali baza mu buryo bw' akazi i cyangugu ntinzi uburyo bamenye y' uko ndi mu bitaro .
i do n't know how they found out that i was there but after visiting me , they started to look for avega ... they were the ones to know about avega . they said that they would contact avega and let them know about my status and also so they follow me up . ||| bansanga mu bitaro nrembye cyane bagerageza kushaka avega nibo bari bayizi nyine kugirango ibashae kunkuriikirana no kubabwira imibereho yanjye ,
after some time they took me to kigali to be admitted to the tribunal ... no rather to king faycal hospital ! ||| ariko igihe kirageze banyijyanyira i kigali njya kurwarair tribunal nako njya kurwarair roi faycal .
that 's how avega started taking care of me . i never knew it before then when i was in cyangugu . ||| avega rero ni ni nk' uburyo bwo kusha kunshakira unyitaho mu kihae nri i cyangugu nnjyae ntabwo nri nyizi . ni muri ubwo buryo ntinzi ,
i do n't can n't tell you how they knew about me ... i was way too sick . ||| nnjyae ntinbabwira uko yamenye kuko nri nrembye cyane .
how did the people at the tribunal know about you ? ||| nonese abantu bo muri tribunal bakubawiyew n' iki ?
did they know you before ? ||| ese bari bakuzi ?
in fact those people were working on rights abuses and ... in the area where i lived ... they asked people and they were told that i was at the hospital . ||| n' abantu nyine kubera ko nri nrwaraiye mu kacae nvukamo n' abantu bari ba bari baje kumenya ibintu by' ihohoterwa nabo ,
so they came to collect my testimony but ... i was so sick then that i could n't even speak but later , i was able to tell them my story . ||| baza kubabwira ko nrwaraiye ku bitaro nyine baje ku ngo nbahae ubuhamya , usibye ko icyo kihae nri nrembye ntabashaaga kuvuga ariko nyuma yaho nrabutanze nabyo .
that 's how they came . ||| ni muri ubwo buryo baje .
during that time at the hospital it 's all after being raped . ||| hanyuma icyo kihae uri mu bitaro n' inyuma y' ibyo bintu utubwiye by' ibyo b' ifataw ku ngufu .
did you ever go to the hospital to be tested for hiv ? ||| uba uraigeze ujya kwa muganga kugira ngo wipimishe umenye niba uranduye ?
i got tested during my admission period and that 's how i found out i was infected with hiv . ||| icyo kihae ndi kwa muganga nibwo banpimye basanga nranduye .
francoise , i know it is not something easy but i would like you to explain ... i guess when you were very sick , you could think and ... after realizing that it was the result of the raped that you went through during the genocide ... i mean how did you receive the fact of being infected with aids ? ||| francoise ngira ngo n' ubwo ari ibintu bitoroshye nagirango utusobanuraire ese n' ubwo bwose uri urwaye urembye ariko ushoboraaga no kukeka yenda ko biba biraturutse kuri ririya fataw ku ngufu ribaye muri genocide no guhohoterwa bikabije . ese ikintu cyo kaumva uranduye ukiakiriye utae muri wowe ?
i had never been with a man before the genocide so i immediately realized that i contracted it during the genocide . ||| kubera ko mbere y' intambara ntari nraigeze nbonaan n' umugabo nhise menya ko ari mu ntiambara ,
immediately after figuring that out i was given medication because i had the right stage for the cure . ||| nkimara kubimenya ba banshize ku miti kuko nri ngeze igihe ,
i started taking them at king faycal hospital where i was ... even though it was hard i had to accept it . ||| ntagira kubifatair roi faycal kubera ko ariho nri nrwaraiye . n' ubwo bigoye nrabiakiriye ariko ntabwo byoroshye .
sorry but you have to be strong . ||| hanyuma , ihanganae .
i wanted to ask you ... please try to be strong and bare with m but ... there is not another way . ||| na nendaaga , nendaaga kukubaza ugeragezae kuihangana rwose unbabarirae kuko si nta kunri bigenda .
i want to ask if there is anyone else other than avega who has supported you after the genocide . ||| nshakaaga kukubaza nt' ese avega nta nta wunri muntu n' umwe w' umuterankunga wigeze ubasha kuba yagira ikintu akufasha nyuma ya genocide ?
there is no one . ||| ntawe .
maybe before i go into details about avega and how they help you . ||| wenda ntari ninzira cyane mu bintu bya avega n' uburyo ibafasha .
the genocide happened and it took away your relatives and you were raped ... the question that i would like to ask you is @: is there not anyone apart from the men who raped you that were involved in the killings of your relatives that you recognized ? ||| uraumva genocide yarabaye ikutwarair abavandimwe irangije irarangaza ikufata no ku ngufu , ntashaka kukubaza . ha nta muntu n' umwe usibye ni n' abongabo bakufashe ku ngufu uraigeze umenya ba baba baragize uruhare mw' iicwa ry' umulyango wawe .
i did n't even know how they died because i was n't with them . we were all scattered and i was n't with them . i were with them i would have also been killed . ||| ntabo nmenye ntinmenye n' uko bapfuye kubera ko tutari turi kumwe icyo kihae turatataanaga ntago turi turi kumwe kuko iyo tukiba tukiri kumwe nnjyae nba nrapfuye .
were you able to know where they threw them at least ? that could have helped burying them ? ||| hanyuma uba uraigeze nibura upfa kumenya n' aho babajugunye ngo nibura babae barashyinguwe ?
yes they buried them at the memorial site of gashirabwoba . my dad was drowned into the kivu lake . in fact all the people who were shot at the football court were thrown into the kivu . ||| uhh bashyinguwe hariya ku ku rwibutso rwo rw' igashirabwoba . ariko papa we bamutaye mu mu kivu kubera ko abo bose barasaiyew ku kibuga cy' umupira baba babajyanye mu kivu .
today your neighbours from where you used to live ... how is life like together today ? ||| ese uyu munsi abaturanyi bawe ahantu mwari mutuye ubundi ubu mubanye mutae ?
at least after the genocide when you go there , do you ever meet with people who used to live nearby ? ||| nibura ubona nyuma ya genocide hari ubwo ujya uhagera nibura uka ukabasha ku kugira icyo uhura n' abaturanyi bo mwari muturanye ?
no i can not return there . ||| huuu ntabwo njyayo ,
i can not be able to talk to them . ||| ntabwo nbasha kuvugana nabo ntinbishobora .
now that the genocide is over , there are many consequences after the genocide like misery . ||| reka noneho genocide irarangiye , hari ingaruka nyinshi za genocide ubuzima butari bwiza nyuma ya genocide .
your life after the genocide ... it is clear that it was not good but you told us that avega tried to help you as much as they could . ||| muri ubwo buzima bwose ugize nyuma ya genocide bwumvikana ko atari bwiza , avega nayo ikaba utubwiye ko yagiye igerageza kukufasha uko ishoboye .
so what can you tell us ? ||| ese ubona n' iki kintu utubwira ?
with the help from avega , do you sometimes feel that it is enough ? ||| ese avega urabona ibyo aribyo byose n' ubwo ikufasha ,
or do you feel like the help is kills more than it can save the situation ? ||| hari igihe uba uvuga uti ubufasha burampagije , hari igihe uba uvuga uti nrabona inkunga ari iica ntikize . ubivugaho iki kugeza ubu ?
can you tell us about that ? ||| ubuzima nyuma ya genocide iyi myaka cumi n' itatu irashize utubwira bimeze bite ?
because avega supports many people , the support it gives to individuals can not satisfy them . for people like me who are also on medication , it does n't help because we have lost of needs . ||| kubera ko avega ifasha abantu benshi inkunga igenda iha umuntu ntabwo imuhaza . nkatawe tuba tunafata imiti tubona ntacyo bitumaraiye kubera ko tuba tukeneye ibintu byinshi .
now i would like you to share your opinion ... what kind of advice would you give ? is it to increase the capacity of avega or to look for other organizations to help you ? ||| none ha ha ngirango ahongaho ushobora kutanga inama . ese inama utanga se n' iyihe ? niyo kaongera ubushobozi avega n' iyo kushaka indi milyango ibafasha ?
increasing avega 's capacity would be much better because ... or you could find other organizations if you can . avega does the best they can and there 's nothing negative that they do . ||| mwongereye avega a i ubushobozi birushaho kuba byiza kubera ko cyangwa mutushakiye nindi milyango uko mwabishobora kuko avega nayo irageragera nta nta kibi ijya itukorera .
the only problem is that the support is very small and a lot of people need it . for instance , we have an association that has almost ninety people . ||| ikibazo ahubwo n' uko inkunga zayo aba nke cyane zika kandi zikeneye abantu benshi , nk' ubu turi tufite ishyirahamwe ririmo abantu bageze kuri mirongo hafi mirongo cyenda .
all those people have their eyes on avega and it is clear to see that it does n't help them much . ||| abo bose bareba avega kandi ukabona nti ntibashoboye ntibafashe uko bikwiriye .
what 's the name of that association ? ||| ehh iryo shyirahamwe n' ishyirahamwe ryi riitwa ngw' iki ?
duhozanye . ||| tuhozaanye .
could you repeat for us in detail what this association does ? ||| utusobanurair mu magambo arambuye n' ishyirahamwe rikora iki ?
who are the members ? ||| ese abarimo ni bande ?
there are many people . i can n't remember their names ... they invited the lady who is the president the association but i do n't know if she came . ||| harimo abantu benshi amazina yabo ntabwo nbasha kuyibuka , bari banatumiye presidente waryo niba yaje simbizi .
it 's an association of patients . it does n't have enough support though . ||| ari n' ishyirahamwe nyine ry' abarwayi ariko nta nkaunga rifite ihagije .
is there nothing else apart from the fact that the problems are not just yours but meeting with your friends ... you might come up with an idea because it is clear that if it is an association of a lot of people , there are times you might be able to discuss and exchange ideas . ||| nta kinri kintu ibyo ari ibyo byose usibye no kaumva ko ibibazo atari ibyawe ariko kuhura na bagenzi bawe mushobora kugira igitekerezo wenda cyo kuba mwagira ikintu mukora koko biraumvikana ko niba ari ishyirahamwe ry' abantu benshi hari igihe mushobora no kungurana ibitekerezo .
would you try and tell us about life in that association if there is any help that it provides to you other than knowing that you are not the only one with problems . ||| ugerageza kutubwira ubuzima bwo mw' iryo shyirahamwe niba hari ikintu ubona bishobora kufasha umuntu usibye no ku kaumva ko yaba atariwe ufite ibibazo kusa .
if we ever get support , i am sure that we can find what to do . that 's the good thing about this association ... we would do it together . ||| tubonye inkunga tushaka icyo kukora nicyo kiza cy' ishyirahamwe kandi duhuje .
now before we finish , there is another question . ||| none mbere wenda y' uko turangiza numvaaga hari ikindi kibazo nifuzaaga kukubaza .
i would like to ask you ... you see , there are lots of women and children who confronted lots of problems in the genocide . ||| urabona hari hari hari abadamu benshi hari abana nabo bagiye bahura n' ibibazo mu ntiambara byo kufataw ku ngufu ,
that is to say rape ... and today , they are very sick , some woman got pregnant and infected ... they gave birth to children who are also infected with aids . ||| harimo uyu munsi abarwayi barembye harimo abagiye ba banateraw n' inda bakananduzwa , bakabyara abana uyu munsi nabo baranduye .
it 's clear that there are lots of problems . thirteen years after the genocide , it 's obvious that women who were raped during the genocide still face a number of problems today . ||| donc ibibazo byinshi urabona birahari , nyuma ya genocide ku nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu genocide irangiye tuvuga ko ibibazo biri kuba kubadamu bahohotewe mu ntiambara na n' uyu munsi bikiri ingorabahizi .
now what message would you send to all the people mentioned above ? ||| none ni iyihe message cyangwa n' ubuhe butumaw wunva uha abo bantu bose bavuzawe haruguru ?
the message i would tell them is that they should n't give up . ||| ubutumwa nbaha cya n' uku n' ukubabwira ko bakwiriye kuihangana .
i do n't think there is anything else although patience is not easy especially when you do n't have good welfare . ||| huu nraumva nta kinri , usibye ko kuihangana biragoye cyane cyane iyo nta nta n' imibereho ufite birarushya .
apart from what avega helping those people and looking after them ... maybe it is only avega that takes care of them ... what do you think the government should do ? ||| tsuu ariko usibye n' ikintu cy' avega ifasha bano bantu ari nayo ibaitaho wenda nvuga nga niyo yonyine , mwumva ubundi ubusanzwe , ubundi mwumva leta yakora iki ?
do you think that sometimes ... after the genocide has destroyed someone 's life , that people have some kind of care at least ? ||| ese nka leta urabona hari igihe umuntu unavuga uti genocide yaratuishe nyuma ya genocide abantu nibura bagerageje kuitabawho ,
let 's say , the government established an institution called farg ... the question is @: after the genocide , do you think that there is any effort done apart from avega regarding people confronted with diseases , regarding the issue of education , rebuilding lives ... could you say something about that ? ||| baravuraw cyangwa se babona ubushobozi leta ishyiraho farg . ese reka njyae nkwibarize ikibazo . nyuma ya genocide , genocide imaze kurangira ubona hari ikintu nibura kikozwe usibye n' avega kugira ngo nibura abo bantu bagiye bahura n' ibyo bibazo haba mu buryo bw' uburwayi ,
if you believe that something was done , what is it ? ||| haba se mu buryo bwo kuiga ,
and if you know it , could you also tell us if the help improved people 's welfare ? ||| haba mu buryo bwo kuisaan kugira ngo ubuzima bukomezae . gira ikintu ibinbwiraho niba ubona hari ikintu kikozwe niba ubona harakozwe iki . niba ubona harakozwe iki uvugae uti hakwaiye kukorwa iki kugira ngo abo abantu barushaeho kuitabawho ?
what they did is a lot . ||| ibyo bakoze byo ni byinshi kuko abantu ,
children were able to go to school ; some people were housed though it 's a few of them because housing and poverty are still the major problems . ||| abana babashije kuiga n' aba bamwe na bamwe babasha kuibonera amazu yo kubamo usibye ko atari bose . ariko hariho ikibazo cy' amacumbi abantu benshi batarafata , batarabona n' ikibazo cy' imibereho mibi .
i do n't know ... ||| nraumva ntinzi .
all these women who were raped and also infected with aids during the war [ genocide ] need medication and we know that the medication is very expensive and we know that the life that goes along with that medication requires that you are self sufficient and a certain level of good life ... i do n't know if in that association or the people you meet in avega ... is avega able to do all of that to allow you to live a life that requires all of those things ? ||| aaa aba abadamu bagiye bafataw ku ngufu ndetse bakananduzwa mu ntiambara bakeneye kubona imiti kandi tuzi ko iriya miti ihenda tuzi ko n' ubuzima bujyana n' iyo miti bisaba ko umuntu aba yifashije akabaho mu ubuzima bwiza . ntinzi niba wenda niba muri iryo shyirahamwe ryanyu cyangwa n' abantu murya muhurair muri avega . ese avega ibyo bintu byose ibasha kubishobora mukabasha kubaho muri ubwo buzima bukenera n' ibyo bintu byose ,
i understand ... you have already told us that the support is not enough but can you give us an idea and you maybe could tell us that if any of the woman facing these challenges could do this or ... if there was no medication for them ... just tell us something about that . ||| nrabiumva nkubu uvuze ngo ntabwo inkunga ihagije . ariko se ushobora kutanga nk' igitekerezo ukavuga uti hakozwe ibi ku badamu baho bahuye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi bigenda bitya . imiti itabonetse aba bantu bameze batya . mbese ukagira nk' ikintu ubitubwiraho .
concerning the medication , most of the people who have reached the stage to take the medication have already started to take them . ||| ibierekeraanye n' imiti ,
that 's not a problem but because they take the medications in poor conditions , they end up dying because those medications require a good life as you said . ||| imiti yo abenshi abageze ku kihae cyo kuyifa batangiye kuyifata nta kibazo kirimo ariko iyo miti kuberako bayifata mu buzima bubi nabyo ntibibabuza kupfa kubera nyine ko iriya miti iba isaba ubuzima bwiza nk' uko ubivuze , kubaho neza kurya ibintu bifite gahu ,
most of them do n't realize its efficiency . avega is also not able to help them . ||| akamaro kandi abenshi ntabyo babona . avega nayo ntiyabasho , ntiyabafasha ngo ibashoborae ,
if there was something else to support avega , that would be good because their life would be much better . ||| hagize icyunganira avega biba byiza kurushaho kuko ubuzima bwabo nibura bugenda burushaho kuba bwiza .
plus , since the donors of avega stopped funding it , avega does n't help them anymore . ||| cyane cyane ko n' umuterankunga wa avega yahagaze ubu noneho nta n' icyo avega iri kubamarair .
i do n't know if there is anything you would like to add to this discussion that we had but if there is something i did n't ask that you would like to say , whatever it is ... there is another question before you say something , i would like to ask you ... although you have all these problems ... problems of health ... do you still have hope in life ? ||| ntinzi n' iba hari ikintu wenda wunvaaga wifuza kuba ukaongera kuri iki kiganiro tugiraanye niba hari icyo ntakubajije wunvaaga ushaka kutubwira , nabyo ibyo aribyo byose . hari ikindi kibazo mbere y' uko nvuga ibyo ngibyo nri ngiye kukubaza , nti ese ni nubwo bwose hari ibyo bibazo byinshi bimeze gutyo ukaba ubona hari ibibazo by' ubuzima hari ibibazo by' imibereho , donc ibibazo ni byinshi biraumvikana . ese nibura wunva hari ibyiringiro by' ubuzima ?
hope ... can you have hope in life when you realize that your current life is not good ? ||| ibyiringiro by' ubuzima byo , nonese ugira ibyiringiro by' ubuzima utari kubona uri kubaho neza ?
i do n't have any hope ! i do n't even have a place i can call home . ||| nta byiringiro by' ubuzima ndi kubona cyane cyane nta n' aho kuba nfite .
avega was going to buy for me a house but because the funders stopped their support ... i do n't have any hope today . ||| avega yari igiye kaungurair inzu yo kubamo ariko kubera ko umuterankunga wa wayo yahagaze bihise biburizawmo , nta bu nta kaizerae cy' ubuzima nfite .
it 's now thirteen years after the genocide and obviously life gets more and more challenging but do you believe that at some point , all these problems will end ? ||| ese k' ubu tureba hashize imyaka cumi ni tatu genocide irangiye ubuzima nvuga bukaba buri mu kugenda burushaho kugenda bugoraan , nibura tuizerae ko nyuma y' igihe runaka hari igihe ibi bibazo ubona ,
and that people will have a better life ? ||| ubona bizashira baiga bikavaho bikashira ubuzima bukaba bugenda kubaho kuba burushaho kuba bwiza ?
where would one get that hope ? ||| icyo kaizerae se umuntu yakikura he ?
living conditions are even getting more challenging ... maybe if you could do something , i think that would be help somehow . ||| ko nyine bigenda birushaho kuba bibi , keretse mu mugize icyo mwatumarira nraumva bugenda burushaho kuba bwiza buhoro .
if not individuals , what do you think the government of rwanda should do ? ||| usibye na ntawe nka leta y' u rwanda mwumva yo ishobora kuba yakora iki ?
especially for those supported by avega or even others who faced similar problems during the war [ genocide ] . ||| cyane cyane by' umwihariko kuri bano bantu bafashwa n' avega cyangwa se n' abandi badamu bose bagiye bahura n' ibibazo mu ntiambara .
most especially i think the government of rwanda should take care of us because if they do n't , no one else will . ||| by' umwihariko leta y' u rwanda ikwiriye kutwitaho kubera ko nraumva hi itatuitayeho nta kinri kitwitaho ,
we can n't wait for foreigners when the government , aware what happened to us does n't take care of us as it should ! ||| ntabwo tutegereza ibivuye hanze kandi leta y' u rwanda ariyo izi n' ibyatubayeho itabasha kutwitaho kandi ntabwo ijya itwitaho nk' uko bikwiriye .
in conclusion is there anything you would like to say that i did n't ask or you would want to tell us ? ||| hanyuma turangiza wenda dusoza hari ikintu wunva mwifuza wenda kugira icyo muvuga niba ntacyo nbashije cyangwa se ikindi kintu mwumvaga mwa mwatubwira ?
what ... i would like to tell you is that you could try and see if you could find a way to help us to improve our lives at least as we are on medication ... so we can get food and all the other things that are related to that . then we can really feel that there are people who empathize with our sorrow ||| icyo numvaaga nbabwira n' uko mwagerageza gusha kushaka uburyo ubuzima bwacu bwa bugerageza kubaho kuba bwiza buhoro kuko kuba bwiza cyane bwo ntabyo ariko nibura no muri icyo kihae cyo kufata imiti tukabasha kubona ibyo kurya n' ibindi byose bijyanye nabyo nibura tukabona ko ubuzima bwacu ntawe tufite aba abo bubabaje .
we would like you to introduce yourself to us as we are about to talk about what happened in the genocide . ||| aho tugiye kuganira amateka y' ibintu bibaye muri jenocide ..... twagirango mutangirae mutuibwira .
my names are murebwayire josephine i live in kimironko in the sector of nyagatovu in the district of gasabo . ||| nitwa murebwayire josephine ntuye mu kimironko mu kagali ka nyagatovu mu karerae ka gasabo .
we would like you to tell us about your life with your family before the genocide , how big was your family ? ||| ese twagirango noneho utubwirae mbere ya jenocide itaraba umuryango wanyu mwari mubayeho kutae ese uri ufite umuryango ungana iki ?
explain to us and tell us how big your family was ; your children , your husband and then after try and give us an idea or paint an image for us on how your life was before the genocide . ||| utusobanuraire umuryango uko unganaaga abana umugabo noneho nurangiza uzae kutuereka ishusho cyangwa se isura yuko uwo muryango wanyu uri ubayeho mbere ya jenocide .
before the genocide we lived in a place called masoro at that time it was called ndera sector . ||| mbere ya jenocide turi tutuye ahantu baita imasoro icyo kihae bahitaaga muri secteur ya nrera .
commune rubungo is where we lived , nowadays it 's called gasabo district , i had a husband with six children . ||| komine rubungo niho turi tutuye ubu ni akarere ka gasabo nri nfite umugabo n' abana batandatu .
three boys and three girls , we also had a child that we had adopted , my husband 's niece . ||| abahungu batatu n' abakobwa batatu turi tufite nundi mwana twarairaga mwishywa w' umugabo wanjye .
we were living in harmony , we had a nice house , our standard of life was good , and my husband was working . ||| turi tubanye neza turi tufite urugo rwiza turi tufite imibereho ishimaishije umugabo wanjye yarakora .
my children were growing up and were in secondary school , the oldest was in senior four and the youngest was in primary four . ||| yeee hanyuma abana baangae bari bakuru bari bamaze kukura bari muri sogonderi umukuru yari ari mu wa kane sogonderi umuto yari mu wa kane primaire .
we also lived with my two brothers . ||| hanyuma nri nfite n' abandi bavandimwe tubanaaga basaza banjye babiri .
one had just gotten married and he lived near us , we were a big nice family , the genocide rally started in 1990 , that 's when we heard that the inkotanyi [ rpf ] had attacked . ||| umwe turi tumaze kumushyingira atuye hafi yacu mbese turi umuryango munini ushimaishije hanyuma jenocide yatangiye mubyukuri muri mirongo icyenda nibwo tuumvise ko inkotanyi zateye .
they said they came from byumba on the 1st of october 1990 , we all did n't know what it was when we heard about it with our neighbours . ||| bavuga ko zaturutse ibyumba ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwacumi mirongo cyenda tuesae tubiumvise kimwe n' abaturanyi bacu ntabwo turi tuzi ibyo aribyo .
on the 7th of october 1990 that 's when they came to arrest my husband saying he was a spy for the inkotanyi . ||| ariko itariki ya karindwi z' ukwacumi mirongo icyenda niho umugabo wanjye baje kumufatako ari ikitso k' inkotanyi .
they did n't find him at home , because even though they had said that nobody should leave their homes , my brother went to the shop to work because it was near the house . ||| basanze atari no murugo kuko babanje kuvuga ko nta bantu bagomba kuva murugo ariko twebwe kuberako turi tufite iyo butike yari iriho musaza wanjye .
so my husband also went to see how things were at the shop , the people who were coming to arrest him only found me and the children at home . ||| azamuka agiye kureba uko bimeze kuri iyo butike abaje kumufata basanze arijyewe uri murugo n' abana .
so they took me first but before that they were doing bad things ; searching the house and throwing things around , hitting me with their gun @-@ butt asking me where i had hidden the gun that we had . ||| ni njyewe babanje kutwara ariko babanje kukora ibindi bitari byiza gusaka kukubita , bakajya bankubita ibibuno by' imbunda baambaza ngo imbunda turi tufite irihae ?
when they saw it they said that we use it to look at the inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . there were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them . ||| bayibonye bavuga yuko ariyo turebairmo inkotanyi baba babonye urwitwazo hari gurude za mazi abana bajyanaagamo amazi nubwo hari hafi ariko hari ubwo batwaraagamo amazi .
they said it belonged to soldiers and they started beating me but not too much , telling me to show them everything else i had hidden and show them the inkotanyi . ||| bavugako ari izabasirikari barankubita ariko baita babaje cyane baambaza ngo ninerekane ibyo nhishe ngo ninerekane izo nkotanyi .
when they did n't get the guns they took me in the car and said that if they get my husband they will release me and let me go , when we reached near the shop we saw him . ||| imbunda zabo hanyuma babibuze barantwara mu modoka banbwira ngo nibamubona baranrekura turazamuka tugeze hafi yiyo butike turamubona .
so i said to them , there is my husband , he is coming . they stopped and told him to enter the car and go give them the gun i had promised them but could n't give it away without his permission . ||| nrababwira nti dore umugabo wange nguriya araje barahagarara baramubwira ngo niinjiraemo ajyae kaubaha imbunda nabemereye ngo ariko njyewe nanze kuzibaha atampaye uruhushya .
so i protested that they had just lied and they told me to get out of the car and watch over the kids saying that they will bring him back later . ||| nravuga nti muranbeshyeye baranbwira ngo ninsohoke nsangae abana ngo we baraza kumukarura .
they took my husband and i went back home to watch over the kids but at that moment you could see that our neighbours started looking at us like we were cockroaches and stigmatizing us . ||| umugabo baramujyana nangae nramanuka nsanga abana ariko ubona ko abaturanyi bacu babonyeko koko turi inyenzi ako kanya batangira kutuha akato .
i went home and rearranged everything they had disorganized and thrown around , wheat and sugar . they were very confused . ||| nragenda njya murugo negeranya ibintu byose bari bavangavanze negeranya amasaka negeranya n' amasukari ntabwo bagira gahunda .
i called all my children and started comforting them telling them that they almost took me , dad was taken , they might come back and take me too but do not be afraid . ||| nuko birangije abana nrabaegeranya nrabahumuriza nrababwira nringiye nangae na papa yagiye nubu bagaruka bakantwara ariko muhurae .
nobody was even reaching our home anymore ; if i came close to someone they would seem afraid that i was going to cause them trouble . ||| nta muntu uri ukigera murugo yewe nuwo negeraaga ubonaaga afite ubwoba yuko ndibumukoreho .
so i would wake up and go home , rubungo is far from kigali and nobody would direct me where he might be . ||| nuko nkajya nbyuka ngenda murugo hariya irubungo ni kure ya kigali nkabura unbwira ati araha nha .
in december we were told that we can go ask at cicr about our people who were put in jail . ||| bigeze mu kwezi kwa cumi na biri baza kutubwirako tuzajya kubaza kuri seyiseyeri bakatubwira amakuru y' abantu bacu bafunz .
i did n't know the place so someone directed me but i got lost and went to president habyarimana 's house in kiyovu . ||| ntinri nhazi nzakujyayo umuntu aranyobora icyo kihae nrayobye ntiungukair kwa perezida habyarimana hariya mu kiyovu .
soldiers made me sit down and asked for my identity card and then they said that i was a cockroach but i denied it telling them i was n't a cockroach . ||| abasirikare banyicaza hasi baambaza ibyangombwa baambaza indangamuntu nuko baranbwira ngo ndi inyenzi nrabahakanair ko ntariyo .
they asked me where i was going and i told them cicr so they said i was going to see spies , no someone called me to offer me a job , i said . ||| baranbwira bati ugiye he nti ngiye kuri seyiseyeri bati ubwo ufite inyenzi ubwo ufite ibyitso nti n' umuntu wampamagaye ushaka kumpa akazi .
so they told me raise my hands and walk away singing there is no way here . ||| nuko nragenda banbwira ngo ningende nikoreye amaboko ngendae nririmba ko nta nzira iri aho .
one of the soldiers showed me the place and i walked away saying what they had asked me to say , when i reached there i asked and they told me they were going to check in the computer , i did n't even know what a computer was . ||| ngenda nbivuga ariko uwo musirikari arahanyereka arahangeza mpageze rero nrabaza baranbwira bari reka turebae niba ari muri computer ntinrinzi na computer icyo aricyo .
my husband was taken , now i am being told that he is not on the lists . so she told me to go home and come back in three days . ||| nti umugabo wanjye baramutwaye none baranbwiye ngo ntawe aranbwira ati noneho genda nyuma y' iminsi itatu uzagarukae kureba nragenda .
after three days i came back , she had asked me to give her the names of my husband . she told me that my husband was in prison . ||| nyuma y' iminsi itatu nragarutse aranbwira ngo nimusigire amazina ngo azambariza nragarutse nsanga umugabo yanyandikaiye nyine anbwira amakuru ye nyine ko ari muri gereza .
so i started going to visit him at the 1930 prison but did n't see him until he was released six months after just like everyone else . ||| hariya 1930 ntangiye kujya njyayo ngirango nramusura ariko yarinze afungurwa nyuma ya mezi atandatu ntaramubona kimwe n' abandi .
we were not allowed to see our loved ones ; they told us to just bring whatever we were bringing for them on the last thursday of the month , telling us that it would be delivered to them . ||| ntabwo abantu bacu tubabonaaga baravugaaga ngo nituzaane ibintu babashyirae tukajyayo kuwa kane wa nyuma w' ukwezi .
so whatever we would take we would give it to the guards as they were threatening and beating us , there was no certainty that our loved ones would get it . ||| icyo tujyanye tukagihereza aba suruveya ariko baducunaguza ariko batukubita ntiumenyaaga niba bimugezeho cyangwa bitamugezeho .
he was released after six months and came back home , but from that point we were not sure what was going to happen next , but after a while it was peaceful and life seemed to return to normal . ||| yafunguwe yari amazemo amezi atandatu araza tuba murugo umuntu akibaza ese bizagenda bite ariko tubona habaye akahaengae umuntu asubira mubuzima busanzwe .
in 1992 that 's when we started hearing about the killings in bugesera , bigogwe and he would say that may be it will n't reach our region , we thought they were just selecting and killing men . ||| bigeze muri mirongo icyenda na kabiri nibwo tutangiye kaumva baishe za bugesair bigogwe akavuga ati ubanza bitazagera hano mbese tukaumva ninko kutoranya nk' abagabo .
when he would walk out i would keep thinking that he will n't return but we never thought that it would be as bad as it was in 1994 . ||| ukavuga uti noneho ngenda ntagaruka ariko tukaumva bitazafata intera ndende nkiyo bifashe muri mirongo icyenda na kane .
but i think the way it started depended on the region and the place where one stayed . how did you know that the genocide had started in the place where you stayed ? did you know that habyarimana 's plane was shot down ? ||| ariko uko yagiye itangira biterawaga na karerae ese wowe iwanyu ahantu mwari mutuye ese mwabwiwe niki ko jenocide yatangiye ese mwaba mwaramenyeko iyo nregae ya habyarimana yaguye .
how did all the events unfold in your lives , i would like you to explain and tell us ? ||| ese bibagezeho bite twagirango utusobanuraire ?
the place where we stayed was just opposite kanombe , it was in the valley but you could see everything that happens in kanombe . ||| twebwe aho turi tutuye hari hateganyae na kanombe mubyukuri ari mu kabande ariko ibyaberga ikanombe ushoboraaga kubibona .
when the plane was shot down we did n't know what it was but heard a loud explosion , it was at night and we were sleeping , we did n't have electricity so that we can stay up late . ||| indege yarahanutse ntitumenya ibyo aribyo ariko tuumva ikintu kiraturitse hari ni joro tuiryamaiye nta mashanyarazi turi tufite ngo turatarama cyane .
we were in bed but not really asleep , in fact we were still talking but when heard the explosion we did n't give it much thought and we went on sleeping . ||| turi turyamye ariko kwa kunri abantu baba bakiri maso abantu baganira ntitubiitaho turakomeza turiryamair .
at 5 am my husband turned on the radio and it was playing classical music so he said there was a coup @-@ d' etat , when we were starting to argue about it . ||| saa kumi nimawe umugabo yafunguye radio tuumva harimo musique classique aravuga ati habaye cout d' etat igihe tukishaka kubiganiraho ngo tubijyaeho impaka .
there was an announcement on the radio am not sure if it was from the president 's office or the military command but it said that the plane carrying the president had crashed . ||| baba bacaishijeho itangazo niba ar' ingabo niba ari irya perezidanse ivugango indege yari itwaye umukuru w' igihugu yahanutse .
we were terrified and woke up , i said to him that its over for us but instead he said no the one who wanted us dead is gone and you are saying its over for us , i replied and said that we were not going to live instead it was over . ||| ubwoba buratuica turabyuka nramubwira nti turashize aranbwira ati reka reka ati uwaduhigaga arapfuye none ngo turashize nramubwira nti oya nti ntabwo tukize ahubwo turashize .
they knew where to find everybody and who to kill , it was planned long ago , the plain just marked the beginning . ||| ngo barajya kwa nde barica kwande ahubwo babiteguye kera indege iba imbarutso .
that 's when they started working but that 's not when the genocide started , because they were already well trained and had planned , so i say that 's the day when it was implemented and perfected . ||| kusa wo kugirango barangizae umurimo wabo ariko ntabwo aribwo jenocide yatangiye baraitoje bakora gahunda neza ahubwo nvuga ko uwo munsi aribwo bayinonosoye .
that 's when the genocide was over even though that 's when it started , so the soldiers came with one of our children showing them the way . ||| ni nabwo jenocide yarangiye nubwo aribwo yatangiye ubwo abasirikari baraje bazana n' umwana w' iwacu aje kubayobora .
they found him on the way , tutsi 's were being hunted and him being one they got him and he brought them . they had list with many names and ours were at the top of the list . ||| bamufashe munzira yari umwana w' abatutsi kuko hahigawaga abatutsi ariko niwe ubazanye bari bafite liste y' abantu benshi ariko ari twebwe turi ku isonga .
when i opened i saw them and they said that i must be happy and they asked for the people who shot down the president 's plane . ||| baraza nkinguye nyine turakubitaan barambwirango mwishimye se ngo abantu bahanuye indege y' umukuru w' igihugu barihae hehe ?
i said there was nobody here and told them that we can not be happy because someone else died . ||| nravuga nti se bari hano ngo ariko mwishimye nti se tuishimye umuntu yishimira ko undi yapfuye .
did n't you hate him , they said ? can we hate someone we do n't even know or does he know us ? we heard it like everyone else . ||| ngo nti mwamwangaga se nti se tumwanga turamuzi cyangwa we aratuzi nti ntabwo tuishimye nti tubimenye nkuko abandi bose babimenye .
nobody is happy that he died especially when you are the ones that shot down his plane and the cockroaches who did it are your relatives ||| ntabwo bitushimaishije ntawishimirako undi yapfuye ngo kandi araimawe mwamuhanuye ngo kandi inyenzi zamuhanuye ari zenewanyu .
give us money . i do n't have money , he replied . you will give it to us , they said . he told them that they had found him sleeping and asked them to look for it . they did n't just let him go , they beat him and he gave them all the money he had on him . ||| tuhae amafaranga ati nta mafaranga nfite bati urayatuha ati ubu se ko musanze nryamye ngaho nimuyashake ubwo kikora urabiumva ntibari kumureka baramukubise amafaranga yari afite arayabaha .
they said to him , your wife must be keeping a lot of money ; women are the ones that keep money . ||| baramubwira bati umugore wawe ashobora kuba abitse amafaranga menshi abagore nibo babika amafaranga .
they opened the door for me and kept the children locked up , and then they told me to give them the money that my husband had told them that i was the one keeping it . ||| baraza barankingurair abana baraongera barabakingirana nragenda bati tuhae amafranga umugabo wawe avuzeko ari wowe uyabitse .
i told them that i did n't have any money as they kept asking for it . so i said to them , why do n't you take whatever you want and leave us in peace , it is clear that you came for a purpose . ||| nti nta mafaranga nfite rwose bati tuhae nrababwira nti se ubunriko mwaje mufite ibyo mushaka mwakwihaye ibyo mushaka ariko mukatubisa .
so they took whatever they could manage as they were going away and said that they were only there looking for what to take but those who were going to kill us where on their way . ||| nuko bafata ibibabangukaiye baragenda barangije baravuga ngo yemwe turi tuje kuishakira ibintu ngo ababica bari inyuma . a
they went away and then around 9h we saw the wives of all the tutsis on one of the hills coming towards our house . ||| bahita bagenda bamaze kugenda bimaze kuba hafi saa tatu abantu bo kugasozi ka batutsi abagore babo bose tubona baramanutse baje iwacu .
we had a big compound , so i asked them why they were coming at our home when it was the first place where they look , we are the ones they arrested first as spies , why did you come here ? ||| turi tufite urugo runini cyane nrababwira nti se ko muje hano muziko hano ariho ibintu bicikair bwa mbere nitwae batwaye mu byitso murajya he .
we were the first ones to be arrested . no , may be we 'll die together or something like that but we are not living this place . ||| nitwae babanje bwa mbere bati oya wenda tupfaane cyangwa bigenda ukundi ariko turaguma hano .
my two brothers and my two older sons also stayed home and i went with the four remaining children with the girl that we had adopted and the other women that we were together . ||| nbasaza banjye babiri n' abahungu baangae babiri bakuru basigara murugo nragenda n' abana batoya abana banjye bane nako kakobwa twarairaga nabo badamu turi kumwe .
when we reached a bit farther some people started blocking our way stopping us from moving forward but we did n't know that they were interahamwe fleeing inkotanyi from remera . ||| tugeze hakurya abantu batangira kutukumira batubuza kugenda naho zari interahamwe zihunze inkotanyi i remera .
but we did n't know what was happening and started separating some going through the banana plantations , others going on along the way . we left home during the day but almost reaching our destination , a place called ndera it was n't possible because we met someone who told us that there was a road block just ahead . ||| kuko ntituri tuzi ibyo aribyo tutangira kutatana bamwe bakaca murutoki abandi bakagenda uraumva tuvuye murugo ari ku manywa ariko tugeze ahantu tushakaaga kujya inrera ariko biratunanira tuhura n' umuntu aratubwira ati hariya hari bariyeri .
the others continued to a place called jurwe , me and my children we went and hid in a place where there was cassava when we saw a police car , we stayed there until it was dark in the evening . ||| abandi barakomeza bajya ahantu hitwa ijurwe ngewe n' abana tujya ahantu hari imyumbati tuihishamo tubonye imodoka y' abapolisi tubamo tugeze k' umugoroba hatakibona .
we went on but decided not to go to ndera but instead went to a place called musave , it was dark and we could n't see but reaching there found that that 's where everyone took refuge , there was a school . ||| turagenda noneho yanzira y' inrera turayireka tufata inzira y' ahantu hitwa i musave uri bawije hatabona tusanga abantu bose niho bahungiye hari hara mashuri .
so i asked the people i was with to force the door open of one of the classrooms since all the other classrooms seemed full . ||| nbwira abantu turi turi kumwe nti nnjyae nimunyicire ririya shuri nangae nigairemo n' abana nrabona hariya hauzuye .
i did n't know that i was telling interahamwe , i thought i was telling my people . they forced the door open and we spent the night there with the workers . ||| naho ubwo nrabwira interahamwe nziko ari abantu b' iwacu tuturanye ishuri barariishe turaramo n' abakozi
with other children that were our neighbours , in the morning around 8 am i saw that the others were cooking but i had n't taken anything except for sugar that i had remembered , i went to borrow a saucepan . ||| n' abandi bana babaturanyi mu gitondo hafi saa mbiri nbona abandi baratetse nta kintu nri njyanye kikora nri ntwaye isukari yo nri nyibutse jya kutira isafuriya .
i had very bad memories because i got lost in the forest when my family was fleeing in 1963 . ||| kuberako nrinfite souvenir mbi cyane ngewe natakaye mu ishyamba iwacu bahunga muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu .
i was found by some people , so i felt that if i let go of my child they would also get lost . so i pulled them and when we reached a little bit further we saw a car and inside was a guy form our region but he was an interahamwe . ||| ntoraguraw n' abantu noneho nkahora numva umwana wange murekuye nawe yatakara ubwo nrabakuruye tugeze inberae gato tuhura n' imodoka y' umuhungu w' iwacu ariko nawe yari interahamwe .
he was a driver of the commune and was coming to take his family which had also spent the night in the same place with us . ||| yari umushoferi w' imodoka ya komini yari aje kutwara umuryango we uri uraho ngaho turi tuhararaanye .
i recognized him and i asked him if he could also take me with my children , he spit in my face and asked me where i was going since it was over for us . he packed his family in the car and left . ||| nbona nramuzi noneho nramubwira nti none se nangae mwanshyizemo mukantwara n' abana arancira mu maso aranbwira ngo urajya hehe se ko akanyu kashobotse ubwo arabapakiye baragiye .
so i kept pulling my children behind me as we walked towards ndera , when we were almost there at a place called musave . ||| nnjyae ntakomeje nkururaan n' abana tugenda n' amaguru tugana inrera tugeze mu nzira ahantu baita imusave ugiye kugera inrera .
we saw a car with the head of region of rubungo and another man that was also from our region who was also coming to see his family which had spent the night in the same place with us . ||| tuhura n' imodoka irimo burugumesitiri wa rubungo ari kumwe nundi mugabo wiwacu nawe uruje kureba umuryango we uri uraho ngaho abana turi turaraanye .
i told him that his children had left ; they were told that their mother was alive . so , he put us in the car and took us to ndera at the catholic parish . ||| nti abana bagiye nti bababwiye ko maman wabo ariho nti abana bagiye nuko atushyira mu modoka aratujyana atugeza inrera kuri paruwasi .
he said , your husband and sons are at the catholic parish let me take you there . we went but before reaching the parish we reached a place called mugahoromani and there was a roadblock . ||| aravuga ati umugabo wawe nba bahungu bawe bari inrera kuri paruwasi ngwino nbakushyirae turagenda tutaragera kuri paruwasi tugera ahantu hitwaaga mugahoromani tuhasanga bariyeri .
he is called rugengamanzi , he was the head priest . he welcomed us ; he had even given them food to cook . so they welcomed us and gave us food and we were comforted that we had got refuge . ||| yitwa rugengamanzi niwe uri padiri mukuru aratuakira azana yari yabahaye nibyo bateka batetse baratuakiriye baratugaburiye tubonako tubonye ubuhungiro .
but personally i did n't want to stay at the parish because there was a man that we were not at good terms with since my husband was imprisoned among the spies . ||| ariko ngewe kuri paruwasi nkaumva simpashaka kubera hari umugabo tuhoraaga tuhanganye kuva umugabo wanjye yafungwa mubyitso .
a priest called gakuba always looked for me telling people that i was a spy , that we were cockroaches , always looking for a reason that i would stop me from coming to church or cause other people to harm me . ||| umupadiri witwa kakuba yahoraaga ampiga anbwira abantu ko ndi ikitso ko turi inyenzi mbese akahora ashakisha ikintu kituma hari ncika no mu kiriziya ahari kikatuma n' abantu baangirira nabi .
so i told my husband that the place had no fence and people were walking in and out at ease and also told him that if gakuba sees us he will kill us . ||| nuko noneho nbwira umugabo nti ariko aha hantu ntabwo bahakorotiriye nti kandi dore abantu barimo barahagendagenda nti kandi na kakuba ntubona arahatutsinda
so i told him that instead we go to the seminary , it was the 8th . so we made sure nobody saw us and then went to the seminary which was not very far away . ||| nti tuigirae mu iseminari ubwo hari ku itariki ya munani nuko ducunga abandi ku jisho tuigira mu iseminari abandi t . basiga aho ngaho ariko biri biegeranyae .
with all my children and brothers we went to the seminary where we spent the night . there was a hall and we spent the night praying because things were not well . ||| n' abana banjye bose na basaza baangae bose turagenda tujya mu iseminari turaharaye hari ahantu hari isale tuicaye turaye tusenga mbega tubonaaga ibintu bitameze neza .
the interim government was put in place , that 's when we found out that we were mixed with interahamwe because they started celebrating , all of a sudden we did n't talk the same language . ||| bashyiraho gouvernement ya batabazi nibwo tumenyeko tuvanze n' interahamwe baratangira barishima noneho tukaumva ntabwo tukivuga ibintu bimwe .
we spent the night in a lot of fear , in the morning of the 9th , i do n't remember well if the interim government was put in place on the 8th or 9th but it 's around that time . so on the morning of the 9th . ||| turara tufite ubwoba buracya mugitondo ku itariki ya cyenda niba guverinoma barayishyizeho ku yamunani niba ari kuya cyenda simbyibuka ariko ni muri iyo minsi ku itarik ya cyenda ku wagatandatu hari mugitondo
there is still a war going on out there , let them stay here they are ok when its all over they will go back home . so you do n't want to let them go ? let them go and we will give them soldiers to protect them , mbonapeka said . ||| rwose hariho intambara ati reka bagumae aha nkaha ntacyo babaye nibirangira bazataha ati mwanze mwanze kubarekurae ati se mwabaretse ko taubaha abasirikare bo kubarinda .
those people who are going to protect them can not protect every single one of them , let them protect them from here . ||| baravuga bati ariko abo bantu bo kubarinda ntabwo bajya barinda buri muntu ati nibabarindire ahangaha aho bari .
mbonampeka went away and after a short while he came back with soldiers and shot the priests . ||| mbonampeka aragenda hashize akanya gato cyane tubona aragarutse n' abasirikare baba padiri baba barabarashe .
they were hutu priests ; one was bisop nsegiyumva 's nephew , he was called naniya rugasira and the other was ananiya , he died on the spot . ||| bari abapadiri babahutu umwe yari na mwishya wa musenyeri nsengiyumva yitwaaga naniya rukasair undi we ananiya ubwo yahise apfa ako kanya .
one who is called andre now lives at st. michael 's , they died on the spot . so they said whoever is hutu walk out with your identity card . ||| uwitwa ndereya nubu ngubu arahari aba hariya muri saint michel baba baguye aho ubwo noneho bahita bavuga ngo uziko ari umuhutu wese nfatae irangamuntu ye asohokae .
so people started walking out showing their identity cards and the ones who did n't show it , it was still visible . ||| noneho batangira kuivangura umuhutu akaerekana indangamuntu nutayerekanye bibaga bigaragara akasohoka .
young tutsi men who tried to hide in the crowd were shot from the gate . we did n't know what to do , two of my older boys so the other people going out and came to see us where we were seated . ||| abashatse kuihishamo babana babasore babatutsi bagiye babarasair ku irembo amasasu atangiye kuvuga ubwo ntawe tugumaye aho ngaho biratuyobeye abana banjye babiri babahungu bakuru babona abandi barimo barasoka noneho baraza baratureba aho turi tuicaye .
they waved goodbye at us and said that we weill meet in heaven , they jumped the fence and ran away with one of my brothers . ||| baradupopera baratubwira ngo tuzahurair mu ijuru bo bakoze icyo kusimbuka igipangu bariruka bagwa inyuma na musaza wange umwe .
there were very many and said , you took all of habyarimana 's money when your inkotanyi and cockroaches , give us our father 's money . ||| nyinshi cyane baraza baratubaza bati amafaranga ya habyarimana mwayikwije muri inkotanyi muri inyenzi mutuhae amafaranga y' umubyeyi wacu .
and whoever we find with even a coin will be killed , me and my husband did n't have anything except wearing a lot of clothes , we did n't have any money on us . ||| ati kandi uwo tusangaan n' igiceri turamwica ubwo ngwee n' umugabo nta kintu turi tufite uretseko turi twagerekeranyije imyenda kusa nta ni giceri turi tufite .
so whoever had money gave it away , but they did n't really want money they were just toying with us . after that they tried to throw a grenade where we were . ||| nuko abayafite barayatanga ariko ntabwo ariyo bashakaaga mubyukuri biri ukwiyenzi barangije bashaka kutera grenade aho ngaho turi turimo .
and then a lady who was wearing clothes with pearls came in with another man who had a bow with arrows , they had a list with some names . ||| noneho grenade haza umukobwa uri unbaye ibintu by' amashara nundi mugabo uri ufite umuheto n' imyambi hari amazina bari bafite .
on the list was a man called pastor , rukanika , nkundabarashe and my husband , but they did n't call out my husband a lot , they called out for pastor and rukanika . ||| hari uwitwa pasteri na rukaanika n' umugabo wange na nkundabarashe ariko we ntibamuhamagaraaga cyane bahamagaraaga pasteri na rukaanika .
there was also another young man called mutsinzi that they were looking for , they put a bead cover on him which made him look like a woman . ||| noneho hakaba hari undi musore witwaga mutsinzi nawe baramuhigaaga noneho bamwambika kuvureri baramutwikira amera nk' umudamu .
he tried to run away but they shot him , and then they saw my husband and said , here is the head of all the cockroaches , stand up , they said . ||| arangije we abasohokamo ariruka yirutse baramurasa noneho baba babonye umugabo wanjye ngo dore nayanyenzi iruta izindi ngo haguruka baramuhagurutsa .
they also told my two daughters to stand up and took them outside but they did n't see me because i was behind some other women . ||| bahagurutsa n' abana banjye babakobwa babiri barabasohokaan babajyana hanze njyewe ntibanbona nri negamye inyuma y' abandi badamu .
the woman removed their clothes and wore them , they were wearing trousers . she said to them , go back you will die at the same time with everyone else no one is going to waste anytime . ||| noneho uwo mukobwa abambura imyenda yabo ahita ayambara bari baambaye amapantalo arangije arababwira ngo nimugendae murapfair rimwe n' abandi ntawe ugiye kupfusha umwanya ubusa
they brought them back inside the house and then the lady saw me and said , we took the child and forgot the mother remove all your clothes . they watched as i removed all my clothes . ||| babakarura munzu babagaruye munzu wa mukobwa aba aranbonye ati tusohoye umwana tuibagirwa nyina ati kuramo iyo myenda barampagarikiye imyenda nyikuramo nta muntu wayinkuragam .
i removed all my clothes and gave them to her as they walked away and only remained with a small dress i had on . after around 10 mins that 's when they came back and shot a woman called makurata , the wife of pastor . ||| nkuramo imyenda yose nsigaraan agakanzu nri nambaye ndayimuhereza baragenda nka nyuma y' iminota nk' icumi nibwo bagarutse barasa umugore witwa makurata ni n' umugore wuwo mugabo witwa pasteur .
they shot her legs and asked her to stand up when they had shot her legs ; they dragged her as they took us all out . ||| bamurasa amaguru baramubwira ngo nhagurukae kandi bamurashe amaguru bagenda bamukurura ntawe baratusohora .
they were so many i think each one of us had two people to kill him , they took us in a field that was there and asked us to lie down . ||| mubyukuri buri muntu ngirango ubanza yari afite abantu babiri bo kumwica bari benshi cyane baradusora batujyana mu kibuga baratubwira ngo nituryame .
if you did n't lie down they would hack you with a machete , it was all the same whether you lied down or stood , we lied down . my last memory is that i lied down holding hands with my daughter . ||| unzae kuryama bakakutema uhagaze byose biri kimwe turaryamye mperuka uko nryamye nramye nfatanyae mukiganza n' umwana wanjye w' umukobwa .
and i put the others on my side , i did n't want to part with them , they told us to lie down with our stomachs on the ground , they knew how they wanted it done . ||| abandi nabo nbashyira iruhande rwange mbese numvaaga batanva iruhande nuko turaryama tuubitse inda batuerekaaga position turi buryamaemo bari bafite ukuntu bari bubigenze .
my last memory was lying on the ground i regained consciousness only to see that i was hacked , i think it was on the 11th , at around 6pm is when it started raining and i felt like i was waking up . ||| ikintu mperuka nuko kuryama nongeye kugira ubwenge nbona barantemaguye ubwo batutemye ari nko ku itariki cumi nimawe bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi nebyiri nibwo imvura yaguye numva nbaye nk' umuntu ukangutse
so they walked around and then at night i tried to lift myself up but it was very hard , i think my brain was out where they had hacked and cut me . ||| nuko baragenda bigeze nijoro ngenda negura nbona bianga ubwonko buri busohotse nnjyae aho batemye bugombaaga kuba busohotse .
it 's just that god kept me otherwise they had hacked me just like everyone else . ||| nuko ari imaan yankijije kuko aho bantemye ni nkaho bari batemye abandi bose .
so i thought to myself that the others will also wake up since i had also woken up after being hacked . ||| nuko nravuga nti ubu nabo baraza guhembuka nti jyewe se ko nahembutse kandi bari bantemye .
i sat there among all those corpses and then all of a sudden the interahamwe came back . ||| nicara aho ngaho muri iyo mirambo ngiye kubona nbona za nterahamwe ziragarutse .
i went to drink water and then as one of the interahamwe was about the hack me with a machete another asked him , you have hacked this woman so many times are n't you satisfied ? ||| ngenda ngiye kumywa amazi igiye kunkubita umupanga indi iramubwira iti ariko se uyu mugorae igihe utaemeye ntiuhaze .
she is n't really alive and even if she lives let her die of sorrow , leave her alone . ||| ngo ntago ariho ngo nnabaho ngo azaicwae n' agahinda ngo murekae .
they went away and then i saw a priest standing in front of a praying room that 's where they had put ananiya 's corpse . ||| baragenda nrangije nbona umupadiri uri uhagaze inberae ya chapelle ubwo umurambo wuwo nguwo ananiya niho bari bawushyize ahagaze k' umuryango .
i went towards him , i knew him but he did n't recognize me because of the way i had become , i asked him to hide me inside since the interahamwe were coming back and they were going to kill me badly . ||| ngenda musanga tuziraanye ariko aranyoberwa kubera ukuntu nri nbaye nramubwira nti se wampishe aho ngaho nti ko hano bari kuza kandi ko bari bunyicae nabi .
i went there , i do n't know if he is the one that covered me with those plants or god but all i know is that they came back looking for me to finish me off and they could n't find me . ||| ninjiramo niba ariwe untwikiraiye uruyuzi ni ari imaan icyo nzicyo nzicyo nuko bagarutse kunshaka ngo banrangizae bakaambura .
they walked away saying , where is the woman that was here , where did she go since the priest did n't let her in ? ||| bahita bagenda bavuga ngo ariko se wa mugorae uri uraha ngo agiye he ngo aciye he se ko atakinguye ?
they looked for me and then said , even if she is still alive she is not coming back tomorrow . i spent the night there and then in the morning around 5am . ||| baranshaka ngo yewe ngo niba akinariho ngo ntago ejo azagaruka nrara muri urwo ruyuzi bigejeje mugitondo nko mu ma saa kumi nimawe .
i went back and looked at the corpses , looking at my children and i could see their brains , i looked at my husband . ||| nsubira muri ya mirambo nraongera nreba abana banjye bose nkasanga ubwonko bwabo busohotse nreba umugabo .
i could n't see where they had hacked him but he died holding another man 's hand , they died holding each others hands . ||| we nkabura ahantu bamutemye ariko yapfuye yari afatanyae nundi mugenzi we mu ntoki bapfuye bafatanyae .
so i sat among the corpses and then after a while i asked myself what i was doing . ||| nuko nragaruka nicaramo muri iyo mirambo nraicara ngeze aho nravuga nti ariko se ubu nraicara .
so i asked myself what i was doing among the corpses and then i walked around and then decided to go in the toilet . ||| ngeze aho nravuga nti ariko se ubu nraicara aha ntahakora iki noneho nzenguruka hahanri hose ngeze aho nravuga ngo reka basi njyae hariya muri toilette .
let me hide in the toilet , i was thinking to myself that if they return except killing me they were also going to do other bad things , i was really afraid they were going to rape me . ||| mbe ariho njya noneho nravugaaga nti noneho nibaza uretse no kunyica barankorera n' ibindi byose birenze no kuica nkaumva nfite ubwoba bwa viol .
they kept coming to use the toilets but they did n't enter in the one i was in . ||| barakomeje bakajya baza aho ngaho bakaza bakituma ariko yayinri ntibayizemo .
after around three days they were still going through the bodies checking if there were no survivors . ||| noneho hashize iminsi nk' itatu bagendaaga basubira muntumbi ariko bareba niba nta urokotse .
after three days is when mbonampeka brought fuel , piled up all the corpses and then burnt them , i heard them saying it from the toilet . ||| hashize nk' iminsi nk' itatu nibwo mbonampeka yazanaaga essence arabarundanya barabatwika nkaumva barabivuga ndaho muri toilette .
they piled and burnt them and then dug a hole in front of the praying room and threw them in and then covered it and left . ||| bararundanya baratwika bacukura aho ngaho inberae ya chapelle babashyiramo barenzaho itaka baragenda .
but i kept saying to myself that may be one my children was alive just like i was , because the way they had made me i was n't meant to be alive . ||| ariko ubwo nkajya nvuga nti wenda hari umwana wanjye uriho nkuko nnjyae nriho kuko ukuntu bari bangize ntago ngombaaga kuba nriho .
and then i would say that may be my boys who ran away at least there is one who survived , i hid myself because i thought there was a survivor . ||| ubundi nkavuga nti ba bana banjye buriya bairukanse bo hari uwarokotse mbese nihishaaga nvuga ngo hari uwarokotse .
so i stayed in that toilet two three days without drinking anything , i had lost so much blood till there was no more to bleed . ||| nuko nbaye aho muri toillete iminsi ibiri itatu nta kintu nywa amaraso yanvuyemo yaravuye yarakamye .
on the fifth day is when a student from that seminary came , they had hacked people and corpses fell on him but they did n't really hack him but he was wounded a little bit . ||| nuko k' umunsi wa gatanu nibwo haje umwana wigaga aho ngaho mu iseminari nawe bari baratemye intumbi ziramugwira ariko ntibamutema ariko basa nabamukomeretsa akantu gatoya .
he peeped through and saw me ; he is the one who gave me water to drink . he would give me tiny little droplets on my tongue . ||| ararunguruka arungurutse aranbona niwe utangiye kumpa amazi yo kumywa akajya akoza akantu ku rurimi agatonyanza .
he would say to me that if i drink a lot , the water would kill me . we stayed in that toilet and were joined by other children . ||| akanbwira ati numywa menshi arakuica tubaye aho ngaho muri toilette haza kuzamo n' abandi bana .
more people kept coming slowly ; by the time we left we were around five people . we stayed there until may 1st , that 's when they helped us from there ; we were also joined by another young boy @/ girl who also studied in the seminary . ||| mbega tuhavuye turi nk' abantu nka batanu bahaza buhoro buhoro ubwo tubayemo kugeza ku itariki ya 01/05 nibwo baturokoye baragenda umwana umwe uje wigaga mu iseminari nawe uri uturutse iruhanga .
i do n't know where he got a knife or a razor blade , he is the one that shaved me , my hair was stuck in my wounds and he could n't remove it . ||| ntinzi aho yakuye ikintu niba ari icyuma niba ari urwembe rushaje niwe unyogoshe imisatsi yarafashe mu bisebe ariko imisatsi kuyikuramo biramunanira .
the inkotanyi doctors are the ones that treated my wounds ; they started treating me from ndera . my wounds were rotten and i did n't think that they would heal or even if they healed that i would be normal again . ||| abaganga b' inkotanyi nibo banvuye batangiye kunvurair inrera haraboze nangae ubwange ntinrinziko nzakira cyangwa ngo ni nkira ngo mbe muzima .
but they treated me and then they took me to byumba , that 's where i was treated from . so all my six children , my husband , my brothers and my sister @-@ in @-@ law . ||| ariko rero baranvuye bageze aho bajyana n' ibyumba niho nvuraiyew ubwo rero abana banjye bose uko ari batandatu n' umugabo wanjye na basaza banjye n' umugore wa musaza wange .
they are all dead , but i did n't know that they were all dead . i thought that my two sons were alive , i kept saying to myself that they ran away , they are not dead . ||| bose barapfuye ariko muri uko kupfa ntabwo nrinziko bose bapfuye numvaaga abana babiri bashobora kuba bariho nravugaaga nti ntago bapfuye rwose barirutse .
i kept thinking that maybe they are alive , there is even someone who told me that my daughter was alive . ||| wenda buriya babayeho nkajya mpora nraumva bariho ndetse umuntu aza no kunbwira ngo hari umwana wange w' umukobwa uhari .
so one of my cousin @-@ brother from my mother 's side is the one that moved me from there and started helping me . ||| noneho musaza wanjye wo kwa maman wacu yari ari ibyumba akora kuri prefecture niwe uje kuhankura aranjyana aranfasha .
but when we were coming from ndera i saw they way my children had died and said . ||| ariko ubwo ngubwo tuva inrera nbonye ukuntu abana banjye bapfuye nravuga nti .
maybe someone took my children adopting and helping them , even me let me help some . ||| kuko hari n' abandi bana barokotse nkavuga nti hari abarokotse wenda barabatwaye nangae reka ntwarae aba babanri .
i had been traumatized i did n't want any child to suffer so i reached byumba when i had around five children when my cousin @-@ brother was coming to take me . ||| mbese nri nrahahamutse numva abana nta mwana ugomba kubabara nuko ubwo ngeze ibyumba nfite abana bagera kuri batanu ubwo musaza wange agiye kuntwara .
i took some of them in an orphanage ; i gave the other one to a soldier who turned him into a kadogo @/ child soldier . ||| bamwe nbajyana muri orphelinat undi umwe muha umuntu w' umusirikari aragenda amwigirira kadogo .
after the war i came back home but they were just ruins , they had destroyed everything , one of my nephews . ||| nuko intambara irangiye rero ngaruka mu matongo ariko nsanga barahashenye barahamaze hanyuma rero umwana nbereye nyinawabo .
he is the one that got a a house for us , i went in with some of his siblings . ||| niwe watubohoreje inzu njyamo n' abandi bana babavandimwe be jyamo turabana .
i became their mother but they got a relative who took them abroad . ||| nbabera nyina bambair abana hanyuma baza kubona umuvandimwe wabo abatwara hanze .
that 's how i got orphans and took care of them and when they would find their family they would go and stay with them and if not they stay with me . ||| ufite ukwamera ni muri ubwo buryo rero ngiye nshaka abana b' imfubyi tukabana ubonye abe akabasanga utabafite akansanga .
you told me that the people that came to kill you were in ndera ? ||| aha unbwiyeko igitero kije kubica mwari muri inrera ?
hummmm , at the seminary . ||| uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu mu iseminari .
looking at where you lived its evident that it 's a long distance from where they killed you from . were those interahamwe from the region where you lived or from somewhere else ? ||| noneho nreba noneho nreba n' ahantu mwari mutuye biragaragarako harimo akanya aho babiciye izo nterahamwe nizari zivuye aho mwari mutuye cyangwa niza hanri ?
the interahamwe would take turns , those from ndera would go to kanombe , and those from kanombe would go to ndera . the interahamwe that killed form the seminary must have been from kanombe . ||| yewe iby' interahamwe rero baraguranaaga abi nrera bakajya i kanombe ab' i kanombe bakajya i kanombe nkubwo ngubwo rwose interahamwe zaishe aho ngaho mu iseminari urebye nizikanombe .
even those from kanombe were with soldiers , also those from our region , because my eldest sons fled and went back on our hill where we lived . ||| nizi ikanombe zari kumwe n' abasirikari ariko rero nab' iwacu kuko abana banjye bakuru barahunze basubira kumusozi w' iwacu .
with my one brother that 's where they died from but i did n't know about it . ||| na musaza wange umwe niho baguye , niho baguye ariko ntabwo nri nraigeze nbimenya .
i kept looking for them , in 1997 is when we went to bury the remains that had been scattered on our hill . ||| nhoraaga nshakisha muri mirongo icyenda na karindwi niho tugiye mukikorwa cyo kushyingura amagufa yari yandagaye k' umusozi .
they would tell me that they are in this particular place , wherever they would show me bones i would not look for signs and i would think to myself finally i have got them . ||| banbwira ngo bari aha nha aho banyeretse amagufa nkagenda kutoragura nta bimenyetso nshakaaga nhitaaga nvuga nti ubu nibo rwose .
recently in april 2005 is when we buried . ||| ejo bunri mu bihumbi bibiri na gatanu ngirango nibwo tushyinguye hari mukwezi kwa kane .
someone convinced me that he knew where they were buried saying he was the one who had buried them , lets go i show them to you . i excavated twenty three people and buried them at gisozi . ||| umuntu aranyemeza ati nihariya noneho rwose ni nangae unabishyinguraiye ngwino njyae kubakuha nragenda ndataburura abantu makumyabiri na batatu nbashyinguye ku gisozi .
they are very big graves with crosses written on their names but i realized that he was lying to me . ||| nama sanduka manini cyane n' imisaraba yanditseho ayo mazina yabo nuko ariko biza kugaragara ko yanbeshyaaga ntinzi icyo yaragamije .
i do n't know if he knew what he was doing or not but i was really shocked . ||| niba yari abizi cyangwa atari abizi ntinzi ngewe nayobowe ibyo aribyo .
n gacaca si where child who knew my children , he @/@ she was there age mate , he @/@ she is the one that clarified and said that they were thrown in a latrine . ||| mu makuru ya gacaca niho haje umwana ubanaaga n' abana banjye bangana niwe uvuze ibyo aribyo ni nawe uvuze uko babataye muri toilette .
that 's when they were excavated in october and we buried them in december and i saw signs that it was really them , like identity cards . ||| nibwo babatabururaga mu kwezi kwa cumi tubashyingura mu kwa cumi na biri noneho ari ariko n' ibimenyetso byabo nrabibona n' amarangamuntu .
school cards and their clothes but they were just bones because they had decomposed . ||| amakarita y' ishuri imyenda yabo uretseko kusa bari barabaye utugufa barashengaguritse .
that day we excavated two hundred and fifty people , before that people kept lying to us and we would excavate the wrong people . ||| twataburuye abantu magana abiri na mirongo itanu icyo kihae kandi abantu bahariya iwacu baratubeshyaaga tugataburura abataribo buri kihae .
we buried a lot of times burying people who we were not related to but we were burying rwandans . ||| tushyinguye inshuro nyinshi tushyingura abntu batari abacu ariko n' abanyarwanda tushyinguraaga .
we do n't regret it but they toyed with us , always excavating and burying . ||| ntabwo tubyicuza uretseko batushinyaguraiye bihagije kuhora ushyinguye wataburuye ushyinguye .
burying the wrong people . ||| ushyingura abataribo .
let 's talk again about burying a lot of times burying the wrong people , the people who were directing you on where to excavate were they your neighbours ? ||| noneho ikintu ngarutse kuri icyo kintu cyo kushyingura incuro nyinshi ushyingura abantu bataribo abantu babarangira abo bantu n' abantu mwari muturanye ?
looking closely , how would someone say that somebody died from a certain place even when they are lying to you ? ||| iyo mwitegereje mubona ntinzi ukuntu mwabisobanurira umuntu ngo yaguye aha wenda anakubeshya .
the people who were telling you where to excavate where your neighbours ? ||| abantu babarangiraaga n' abantu mwari musanzwe muturanye ?
yes they were our neighbours ; the one who even told me that he had buried my children himself was even a genocide survivor . ||| n' abantu tubanaaga rwose turi tuturanye cyane uwo we wandangiiye akanbwira ko yabashyinguye ni numucikacumu .
i said that these were the consequences of the genocide on me , it was the second time , before i use to tell him that ||| nti izi ningaruka za jenocide zikomeje kunkurikirana ariko noneho we uraumva ko buri incuro ya kabiri kandi n' ubwambere nramubwiraaga nti ngiye .
i am going to remember , i did n't do anything without telling him as a fellow survivor , telling him that today i am going to pray and remember and he would come . ||| ngiye kuibuka nta kintu nkoraaga nta mubwiye nk' umucikacumu mwenewacu nkamubwira nti uyu munsi nzakora amasengesho yo kuibuka akaza .
i even asked him why he had taken so long without telling me where my children were buried and he said that he did n't want me to get traumatized . ||| noneho nramubaza nti ariko se kubera iki ugeze iki kihae cyo utaranbwira ko aba bana bashyinguye aho hantu akabwira abantu ko ngo yangaga ko mpahamuka .
and i told thim that i could n't get traumatized it was all the same since every 11th of april i would have prayers to remember them . ||| nkamubwira nti se nri kuhahamuka nti nubundi mu kwa kane buri tariki cumi n' imwe nkora amasengesho yo kubaibuka .
why did n't you let me get traumatized once and for all but atleast bury them , so in gacaca that child said where they were buried . ||| kuki utaretse ngo mpahamukire kimwe ariko nbashyingurae nuko muri gacaca rero uwo mwana abivuze byaho babashyize noneho .
i called him and even thought that the child is the one who was lying to me , we almost started arguing but i realized i would be disrespecting myself and did n't want any confrontation with him . ||| muhamagaye ngirango uwo mwana niwe unbeshya turi tugiye kutongana nukwitesha agaciro nanga kutongana nawe no kuhangana nawe .
i ignored him and said that i was just feeling the consequences of the genocide so i decided to fight them they way i normally fight but the other thing is that in 1995 . ||| ndamwihorera nravuga nti ibi byose n' ingaruka zingairho reka mpangane nabyo nkuko nsanzwe ariko ikindi cyo nuko muri za mirongo cyenda na karindwi .
those who misled us in excavating all those bodies on the different hills are the ones who participated in killing the not only my people but all the people on that hill . ||| abadutaburuje iyo misozi yose tuyiruka n' abaturanyi ni nbabigizemo uruhare mu kubica atari no kuica abanjye kusa no kuica abantu bo kuri ako gasozi bose .
but gacaca is exposing them all , they are turning on each other , those who are in jail denounce those who were not put in jail and those who are in jail also denounce those who are being released . ||| kusa gacaca irimo iragenda ibatahu abafunzwe bakarega abatarafunzwe abafunzwe bakashinja abafunguwe .
that 's how things are in our region . ||| niko iwacu bimeze .
lets talk again about the other children who were killed from ndera and were later burnt , we can tell that ... ||| reka ngarukae kuri abo bana abandi bo tuumvise ko baguye inrera nyuma bakaza no kubatwika ubwo biraumvikana ........
where they buried them , i do n't if it 's because i was still very traumatized in 1997 is when we first said prayers for them . ||| aho bashyinguye rero ngewe niba ari uko nri nkihahamutse cyane muri mirongo cyenda na karindwi nibwo tubakoreye amasengesho yanberae .
i am the one who showed where they were thrown there is a bush even pictures of the place . ||| ariko ubwo ni nangae werekanye aho babashyize hari ikigunda rwose n' amafoto yaho .
and the way i watered the place but when they said to excavate the bodies i said no , i do n't want you to excavate them ; they were n't many other people that survived from there . ||| y' ukuntu ngiye mpufira niki birahari ariko bavuze ngo mutabururae ngewe nravuga nti oya ntinshaka ko mudaburura urebye rero ntabanri bantu benshi baharokokeye .
it was me and the one boy who is now in switzerland , he is a member of ibuka there , his name is cesar . we asked them not to excavate them since they had also burnt them . ||| ninge nuwo mwana umwe ubu ari mu busuwisi ubu ari no muri ibuka yahariya yitwa sezari turavuga tuti mwikwirirwa mubataburura rwose baranabatwitse .
we asked if they could make the place look good and the priests promised us they were going to build a beautiful memorial , its there and every 11th of april we go there to commemorate . ||| nimuhakore neza hanyuma abapadiri batuemerair kuhaubaka urwibutso rwiza ruraho rurahari iteka kuri cumi na rimwe z' ukwa kane tujya kubaibuka .
they were in hundreds around four hundred because all the classrooms were full , there was even a hall that was full , the hutus later went out but they were few . ||| yewe bari nka magana ni hafi magana ane urebye kuko amashuri yose yari yuzuye hari n' akasarae kari kauzuye kusa abari abahutu baje kusohokamo baragenda ariko ntago aribo bari benshi .
the majority were the tutsis seeking refuge . ||| abari benshi n' abatutsi bari bahahungiye .
so you mean that in the four hundred seeking refuge the survivors are not more than ten ? ||| nukuvuga ko mu bantu magana ane bari bahari abarokotsemo ntabwo barenga icumi .
at the seminary it 's just me and cezar , they are some kids who also ran away , but the ones we are sure of and count are me and cezar . ||| aho ngaho mu iseminari oya ntabo nuwo mwana sezari nangae hari nutundi twana tubanje kugenda tuiruka ariko abo tuzi tuibara turi babiri .
we are the only ones who came out of the corpses . ||| muri izo ntumbi nitwae tuvuye muri izo ntumbi .
if we talk about your children that died in masoro did you get to know who killed them or how they were killed except the fact that they were thrown in the pit latrine ? ||| ngarutse kuri babana bawe baguye hariya imasoro uba uraigeze umenya abantu babaishe cyangwa se n' uburyo babaishemo wenda uretse no kubata muri toilette ?
in gacaca they talk about the people who died but even the ones who are there played a major role in it but what is clear is that whoever is involved were arrested because of gacaca . ||| muri gacaca rero barabivuga ariko iyo babivuga bavuga abapfuye mubyukuri n' abazima bahari mubyukuri nabo babigizemo uruhare kikora ikigaragara nuko abo basae abashaijew ubu ngubu barafashwae na gacaca .
they normally first hacked people before throwing them in the pits , did you get to know if your children were thrown in the pit alive or after being hacked . ||| usibye hari ikintu cyo babanzaaga kutema umuntu bakamuta mu musaraane ntinzi niba uraigeze umenya niba barabataye mu musarani ari bazima cyangwa niba barabanje bakabatemagura .
we 've been very good friends and we are going to die ; where we are going they do n't wear shoes , take my shoes and remember me whenever you look at them . ||| turabanye turapfuye aho tugiye nta nkweto baambara ati akira izi nkweto ujyae uzinyibukiraho .
and please tell the story . ||| ati kandi uzajyae ubivuga .
and then they told those who were about to kill them to wait so that they can first pray , and when they had finished praying they threw them in the pit . ||| ati hanyuma ngo noneho banbwira abari bagiye kubica bati nimubae muretse kutuica tubanzae tusengae , abana ngo barasenga ngo barangije babata mu musarani .
he is the one who told us all that . ||| niwe utuhayemo ayo makuru .
but personally i think that if that boy was given shoes by your son it means that he even saw the ones who killed them . ||| ariko ngewe nraumva nukuva ngo niba uwo mwana aba yarabashije kuba yarahawe inkweto n' umuhungu wawe nukuvaga ngo nbabatemye arabazi .
he knows them but he says that he ran away , they do n't agree to say everything clearly . ||| arabazi mubyukuri we aravuga ngo yahise yiruka ntabwo baemera kuvuga ngo babihagararaeho neza .
they do n't want to state facts i think of fear that the remaining ones will hurt them . he says that he ran away and says the one who chased him away and hit him with a stick on the shoulders . ||| ngo mbese bemeze ikiriho kugirango nbasigaye batabagirair nabi aravuga ati ngewe nhise niruka akavuga ngo nuwamwirukankanye ngo akamukubita inkoni mubitugu .
so he says that he does n't know who killed them but others say that he was killed by a man called habari , he is dead . ||| kuvuga ngo rero ngo ntago yabonye uwamutemye ariko noneho abandi bakavuga ko ngo batemawe n' umuntu witwaga habari n' umuntu upfuye .
he has n't even come back to court because he was imprisoned when he was still young but may be he will . gacaca will deal with it , i personally do n't know . ||| we nta nubwo araongera kubura ngo kuko yanafunzwe ari umwana ariko wenda azaburana gacaca niyo izi uko izabigenza ntabwo nge nbizi .
i understand that your whole family died but no one forgets her family , can you please tell us about your husband , what kind of man was he ? ||| none abantu biraumvikana ko abantu bakushizeho ariko hari ikintu ibyo aribyo byose nta muntu ujya wibagirwa umuryango we none twagirango utubwirae kumugabo wawe yari muntu ki ?
how did he relate with other people and what is the one thing that you remember about him that you can not forget ? ||| yari ateye atae mu mibanire ye n' abandi bantu ikintu ujya wunva umwibukiraho utashobora kupfa kuibagirwa ?
there is no way i can forget him , i do n't know how i can describe him i think that picture describes a lot , he was a very calm man . ||| nta na kimwe kituma mwibagirw ngewe nmuvuga se ngo iki kumuvuga ntago bihagije ngirango niriya photo ishora kubikuereka byonyine yari umugabo utuje .
he was avery humble man who easily related with everyone but especially he loved children , i think that 's why he went with our children . ||| yari umuntu ucaish make ariko ubana n' abantu bose cyane cyane nawe yakundaaga abana ngirango ni nayo mpamvu yajyanae n' abana .
he was very easy to relate to and was very merciful ; he could easily ignore himselfo or others . ||| be simbizi yari umuntu wumvikana kandi ugira impuhwe cyane kuburyo yashoboraaga kuiibagirwa cyangwa akaibagirwa abandi .
that was his nature , he was a man that really loved his family , i think if he had been greedy when he was released from jail he would have abandoned us . ||| niko yari ateye uuuuuuuu yari umuntu ukunda umuryango we cyane ngirango iyo aza kuba umugabo w' igisambo afunguwe mubyitso yari kuhita yigendera akanadusiga .
but he did n't , he loved everyone , he did n't hate anyone , he loved the poor and humble . ||| ariko ntago yabigize yakundaaga bose nta muntu yangaga yakundaaga abantu baciye bugufi abantu babakenae .
my children were also like that , they loved other kids and were always warm and happy , i can n't forget them , instead i try to imitate them and fail . ||| n' abana banjye kandi nuko bari abana bakunda abandi bana bagira urugwiro ntabwo nshobora kubibagiraw ahubwo ngerageza kubigana bikananira .
i do n't know how to say it , but here they killed all your family and finished it , if they came and confessed their fault , would you forgive them ? ||| ntinzi ukuntu nbivuga noneho ngewe ntashaka kuvuga aha nkaha baishe abantu bakumaraho abantu ese ..... birega bakaemera n' icyaha baje kukuirega bakaemerae n' icyaha abo bantu baje kukuirega ubabarira ?
to forgive , they are words that people are quick to use but it does n't even make sense . the person who asks it and you who says that you have forgiven him it 's not something easy . ||| kubabarira hari amagambo abantu baihutaish kuvuga ukabona utazi nibyo aribyo ari wamuntu umanuka akakusanga ari nawe uvuga ngo uramubabariye n' ibintu bikomeye cyane .
because personally the way i see this country it belongs to all rwandans , its not just mine it 's not even for only the genocide survivor , it 's impossible . ||| kuko ngewe uko nbona iki gihugu nicy' abanyarwanda bose ntabwo ari ikiangae ngenyine nta nubwo ari icy' uwacitse ku icumu wenyine ntibinashoboka .
evil is not repaid by evil ; personally i told god that i can n't do anything on my own . ||| ntabwo icyaha kihanaishw ikindi cyaha cyangwa se ngo ubugome buhanishwe ubundi ngewe ku giti kiangae nbwiye imaan ibyo nkora byose nta na kimwe nikoresha .
i can n't manage anything on my own , i do n't think i would even be alive , i think i would have gone mad . i surrender everything to god because to be able to get out of all the corpses of my children . ||| kuko ntacyo nakwishoboza biikoresheje nta nubwo nba nkiriho nba nrabaye n' umusazi simbizi ariko ngewe ibiangae byose nbiha imaan kuko nubwo kuva muri iyo mirambo ya bana banjye .
my husband , relatives and neighbours that were lying there dead , i did n't think i was going to live . ||| n' umugabo wange n' abavandimwe n' abatunyi bose nri nsize aho ngaho bagaramye ari intumbi ntinrinziko nzabaho .
i told god that he is the one in control and knows why everything happened . i asked god for something and he gave it to me , i told god that those who died and those who are alive , i asked that he may give me the power to love without focusing on anything else . ||| nbwiye imaan ko ariyo ibizi ariyo izi impamvu yabyo ikintu rero nsabye imaan kandi yarakimpaye nyibwiyeko niba ari aba bapfuye niba hari abandi bo kubaho izampa kukunda nkakunda nta kinri kintu nreba kuruhande .
so instead of being burdened i asked god to give me a big heart so that i can offer mercy to everyone who needs it . ||| noneho nkavuga nti ngewe aho kugirango nremerairwe nsabye imaan kumpa umutima wagutse urimo impuhwe nka zikiirira uwo nbona azikeneye .
even if it 's a hutu who killed my family and he comes when he is broken down . ||| niyo yaba ari umuhutu wa wunri unyiciye ariko akaza nbona yapfuye .
in need of mercy and forgiveness , i would forgive him because he is a human being , i can n't do the same atrocities like he did . it 's really not by my strength that i can do this , i will n't lie to you . ||| akeneye impuhwe kubabarirwa nge nmubabarira kuko ari umuntu nge ntabwo nkora ubunyamaswa nkubawe ntabwo rero aringe ubiihaye ntingiye kukubeshya .
because on my own i am nothing and i would be nothing but the fact that god saw that my children and body were dead . ||| kuko ngewe ubwange ntawe nriwe nta nicyo nba ndicyo pe ariko kuba imaan yarabonyeko abana banshizeho umubiri ukanshiraho .
i was disgusting and he revived me and people want to be with me when before they use to run away from me , people who saw me immediately after the genocide would avoid me . ||| nkakokoka nkasigara nteye isesemi ikaongera ikanrema umuntu yumva ashaka kunyegera mbere barampungaga abantu banbonye nyuma ya jenocide ho gato barampungaga .
i was hideous and disgusting and there 's no one who really took care of me to say they did it . ||| ntari nteye ishozi n' isesemi nta muntu wanyondoye nta muntu ugize ikintu ankorera ngo avugae ngo nkugiraiye ntya .
except my cousin @-@ brother but even for him it would n't have been possible without god 's power . ||| nubwo hariho uwanyondoye nkuwo musaza wange unjyanye akanshyira iwe ariko hatarimo imbaraga z' imaan ntabwo biri kushoboka .
i would have gone mad , but god kept and made me who i am today , so even me in his love i must do what he asks me to do and whoever asks me for forgiveness in truth , i would forgive them . ||| nri kusara bivuga ngo imaan niyo yambungabunze ingira uko ndi uku nangae murukundo rwayo ngomba kukora icyo insaba uwaza ansaba imbabazi ambwiza ukuri ngewe nzimuha .
and when someone is saying something from the depth of their heart you can tell and i can forgive them , but they do n't ask for forgiveness because someone asks for forgiveness is someone with a human heart . ||| kandi iyo umuntu avuga ikintu abikuye k' umutima urabibona nzimuha ariko rero ntago bazisaba kuko usaba imbabazi nufite umutima wa kimuntu .
someone with humanity in them comes close to you because he sees that you are human , whe he does n't it 's because he thinks that you are still the thing that he called you before . ||| ufite ubu muntu arakusanga kuko aba abona uri umuntu iyo atakusanze rero aba abona ukiri cya kinri ya kuitaaga cya kihae .
they dehumanized us by calling us cockroaches and other horrible names so i think they still see that in us , so whoever comes close to me , i would forgive them . ||| n' ubundi batuambuye ubumuntu batwita inyenzi batwita ibyo ntazi batwita ibiki nubu aracyabinbonamo ariko uwaza aka nyegera ngewe nzimuha pe .
after hearing the difficult things that you went through , surviving among all those people and your family being dead . ||| noneho nyuma yo kaumva ibintu bikomeye uciyemo uraumva kuroka mu bantu bangana kuriya noneho ukaza no kugira n' ikibazo umuryango wawe wose ukakushiraho .
nowadays how can i describe murebwayire josephine , what kind of person is she even though her whole family died , is she someone with hope even though her whole family died in the genocide ? ||| ubu muri iki kihae ntinzi nvuga nti se murebwayire josephine ubu muri iki kihae n' umuntu umeze utae ? n' umuntu ufite ibyiringo nubwo abantu bamushizeho mbese nyuma ya jenocide .
please tell us , how do you feel deep inside because i do n't understand ? ||| utusobanurair mbese muri wowe wunva umeze utae ntabwo nbiumva ?
it does n't make sense humanly speaking , it 's beyond our human nature and when they say beyond our human nature , it means it 's not human . ||| erega ntabwo biumvikana mu buengae bwa muntu n' indengakamere kandi iyo bavuze indengakamere wunva ko ari ibirenze kamere muntu .
everything that happened in my life since i was a child up to now is beyond human nature but there is someone who created human nature . ||| ntabwo ibiambayeho mu buzima bwanjye kuva ndi uruhinja kuva ndi umwana kugeza kuri iyi myaka nfite n' indengakamere ariko indengakamere hariho uwaremye kamere .
i did n't think i would have those responsibilities , it means that i had died and resurrected . in resurrecting i resurrected a new being not the same person . ||| kandi izo nshingano nta nubwo nrinziko nzazigira nri npfuye nrazuka nukuvaga ngo muri uko kuzuka nzutse ndi undi wunri utari wa wunri .
so i have to accept the way i always tell people that josephine died and aunty lived . ||| nkagombye rero kuemera uko njya nkunda kubwira abantu nti josephine yarapfuye habaho tantae .
because now i am called aunty of all the children , any child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it . ||| kuko ubu nitwa tantae w' abana bose kuko umwana unsanze afite ikibazo nbasha kugikemura ndagikemura .
to confort and convince that that child must live and encourage him @/@ her , so i think i was left behind so that i may be an aunty to all the children . ||| nkamuhumuriza nkamwumvisha ko agomba kubaho nka mutera imbaraga numva rero nrasigaraiye kuba tantae w' abana bose .
a child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it and confort them and convince him that they must live . ||| umwana unsanze afite ikibazo nshobora kugikemura ndagikemura nkamuhumuriza nkamwumvisha ko agomba kubaho .
i encourage and strengthen them , i feel like i was left behind so that i can be a mother to all children without mothers . ||| nkamuremaish kandi nkamutera imbaraga numva rero nrasigaraiye kuba maman w' abana batafite banyina .
it 's not a must that i take care of them in my house but they are some i advise on certain issues and they move forward . ||| ntabwo aringombaw ko nba nbatunze murugo rwange ariko hariho uwo nbwira nti ibi nibi ibi nibi nkabona ndamuremesheje ateye intambwe .
they are some that i have here in my house . i have six children , two girls and four boys . ||| hari abo nfite hano murugo ubu nfite abana batandatu nfitemo abakobwa babiri nfitemo n' abahungu bane .
the other thing is that god who kept me has a plan for my life that he helps to fulfill it , he did n't put me to shame , i would have gone crazy , and it was possible . ||| ikindi nuko imaan yanrokoye infiteho umugambi infasha no kuwusohoza ntiyankojeje isoni ntiyampinduye umusazi birashobokaaga .
they hacked me in the head but i did n't loose my mind i can think , it means i must live my life thanking god and doing what i can . ||| batamye mu mutawe ubwonko ntibugiye ntatekereza nukuvuga ngo ngomba kubaho nshima imaan ntatekereza nukuvuga ngo rero ngomba kubaho nshima imaan kandi nkora icyo nshoboye .
it 's something that can help others . ||| n' ikintu cya girair abandi akamaro .
how do you relate to the neighbours that you had befor all this , how is your relationship ? ||| abantu mwari muturanye ahantu mwari mutuye uyu munsi mubanye mutae ?
after the genocide which affected your life and the life of many rwandans , do you think that there can be normal trustworthy relationships ? ||| ese nyuma yubu bw' icanyi bwa kukozeho ndetse bukora no kubanyarwanda benshi ubu ubona hashobora kuzaongera hakabaho ikintu cyo kubaan nta kintu cy' urwikekwe .
between the killers and victims ? ||| hagati y' abantu baishe n' abicaiyew ?
about trust i do n't know if its kadafi who said that , protect me form my friends because i already know my enemies . ||| ariko urwikekwe ntinzi ngo niba ari kadafi ubivuze ngo ujyae unrinda incuti zaangae ngo abanzi nrabazi .
god gave us the wisdom to think , when you live with someone there is no reason to disturb someone who is going through hard times , if i am able i can help him @/@ her as a rwandan and if they are celebrating i can celebrate with him @/@ her . ||| ubundi umuntu murabana ariko imaan yatuhaye ubwenge ituha gushishoza nta mpamvu yo kumuhutaza yagize ibyago mpari nmutabara nk' umunyarwanda yagize ibiiza tubisangira .
but i live well with my neighbours i do n't how to segregate people saying one is hutu so i will n't greet them , or insulting someone that they are interahamwe . ||| ukarigendamo ngewe nuko nkubwira ariko rero abaturanyi turabana ntabwo nzi kuvangura ubwo ngo umuhutu simusuhuza ntinzi kugenda ntuka umuntu ngo uriya n' interahamwe .
when i see someone i see a human being and i only see evil when that person commits it , but i do n't push anybody away . ||| umuntu iyo tuhuye tuhura mubonamo umuntu hanyuma ikibi kikaza igihe kikorewe nangae nkabonako ari kibi ariko ntago njya nigizayo umuntu uwo ariwe wese .
my heart welcomes everyone who comes to me with good intentions , if you do n't then i do n't give you my time . ||| nkaumva umutima wanjye ukeneye kukira buri wese uje awugana yawugana nabi simuhe umwanya .
in the genocide especially women went through a lot of difficulties , besides killing them and finishing off their children , many were raped and infected with diseases . ||| hari muri jenocide by' umwihariko abantu babadamu hari abantu babadamu benshi bagiye bahura n' ibintu byibibazo usibye no kuba babica n' abana bakabamaraho hari nbagiye bahura n' ingorane bakabaviyora bakabanduza indwara .
besides being raped they went through a lot of fifficulties and problems that personally i think that widows have a lot of problems . ||| usibye no kubaviyora hari nbagiye bahura n' ibikomere bikomeye kuburyo uyu munsi iyo ugiye kuitegereza usanga nge nvuga nti abapfakazi benshi bafite ibibazo .
as a result of the genocide , it is very difficult because you find that someone has a sickness that will kill her at some point . ||| bituruka kuri jenocide ndetse ubona binakomeye cyane uyu munsi koko nkubungubu umuntu yikoreye umutwaro w' indwara izamwica igihe iki niki .
if she is not burdened by disease , the genocide ended and she is probably in a lot of poverty , i woulk like you as a woman . ||| utafite uwo mutwaro jenocide yarangiye aguma mu buzima butari bwiza ubukene burakomeza bumumerair nabi aha noneho nagirango nk' umuntu nkawe w' umubyeyi .
who went through the same and lost your whole family which is a very difficult thing to endure , i would like you to paint a picture for us of the genocide widows who are suffering the hard consequences . ||| ugize ikibazo bakakumaraho umuryango icyo nikindi kintu kikikomerae kiteye ubwoba aha nagirango umpe ishusho y' abapfakazi ba jenocide babayeho ubu bari mungaruka zikomeye cyane .
you have just asked me a very difficult question , i am part of a widows ' association called avega agahozo . ||| ikintu unbajije kirakomeye ubundi ngewe nba no mu muryango w' abapfakazi ba jenocide avega agahozo .
i am the second vice @-@ president on the national level , it 's an association that we set up because among widows there are many categories . there are some who were raped and infected with hiv & aids . ||| ndi vice presidente wa kabiri ku rwego rw' igihugu ni umuryango tushinze kubera ibibazo abapfakazi bari bafite abapfakazi barimo ingeri nyinshi harimo abafashwae ku ngufu koko barwaye bandujwe sida .
there are some girls who gave birth to children they did n't want , they are some who were hacked and do not have some limbs , some do n't have hands . ||| harimo abana babakobwa babyaye abana batashaka harimo abatemaguwe batafite ibicae byo kumubiri umwe ukasanga nta kaboko afite .
some do n't have eyes , they are different handicaps and then they are those who are emotionally handicaped . ||| uwo ijisho rivuyemo mbese harimo ubumuga butandukanye noneho rero reba aba bantu bafite ubu muga bwo mu mutaima .
and physically they do n't have a home , without a house to live in , many times they are next door to the ones who kileed their families and injured them . ||| n' umubiri batafite aho bataha batafite inzu yo kubamo kenshi na kenshi baegamiye aba bahekuye .
you understand that its adding more sorrow to an already broken heart , so our associationts goal is to stand by them and confort them telling them not to loose heart . ||| uraumva ko ari agahinda kageretse ku kandi ariko nka association yacu icyo tukora nukubatera ingabo mubitugu tubabwira tuti muhumurae .
telling them that the fact that they are still alive that they will continue to live , we are lucky that we got a project that helps them with anti @-@ retro viral medication for hiv & aids . ||| kuba ukiriho nejo uzabaho tugira amahirwe amahirwe tubonye umushinga ubafasha kubona iriya miti igabanya ubukana bwa sida .
there are many who died because the medication just started coming in recently , they are many who passed away . ||| abatarapfuye kuko hari benshi barapfuye kuko iriya miti ije vuba kuko hari benshi batucitse .
and it can really affect her because the medication is strong , to get food everyday is not easy because you can see that we are widows like them . ||| nayo ikamuzonga kubonera ikintu umuntu arya buri munsi n' ibintu bikomeye kuko urabona turi abapfakazi bagenzi babo .
we do n't have work and those who do sometimes have other responsibilities in their home , but we try to help and confort each other . ||| nta kazi tufite bamwe na bamwe bakafite nabo bafite izindi charges mungo zabo ariko turafashanya turahumurizanya .
what we mainly do is speak out because most people live in despair , so avega advises , conforts and brings us together . ||| icyo tukora nubuvugizi uraumva mubyukuri benshi babaho baihebye ariko noneho avega ikintu ikora nubujyanama guhumurizanya kuegeranya .
that is our main objective of our association , to bring us together , confort each other , convincing someone that if they are in pain tomorrow they might be conforted , if they are sick tomorrow they can get better . ||| ni nayo objectif y' umuryango wacu kuegeraan , guhumurizanya , guhozanya umuntu ukamwumvishako niba ababaye ejo ashobora kuhumurizwa niba arwaye ejo ashobora kaoroherwa .
hiv & aids is bad disease in the body but its clear now that it does not even kill when one gets those medication . ||| sida yo nikimungu kiba mu mubiri ariko bimaze kugaragarako itakinica kuwabashije kubona iyo miti .
so what we do is tell them the fact that they are in pain does n't mean that they die , and we speak up for them to the government , our desire is that these people are not given up on or forgotten . ||| icyo rero tukora ngewe ibyiringiro nbaha nuko kubabara atariko kupfa ariko nbuvugizi na leta kandi ubwayo undi twebwe icyo tuba tuifuza nuko aba bantu batarekuraw .
these people who are sent home and forgiven really traumatizes us because it seems as though they are the ones who are cared for . ||| aba bantu bataha aba bantu bahabwa imbabazi mbese usanga biduhungabanya kuko usanga basa naho aribo bitaweho .
but with us it seems as though those who advocate for us do not have strength or there is no emphasis so that the problems are solved , of course nobody can bring back the people who died . ||| twebwe ukasanga ubuvugizi butuvugair yego burahari ariko ukasanga nta nbaraga ubona bushyirawmo kugirango ibibazo birangirae yego ntawe uzakarura abantu .
if they help us it can be over . ||| ngo tufashwae tufashwae ikarangira .
but it has been thirteen years after the genocide , can we say that people are still the same way they were when the genocide had just ended ? ||| ariko tumaze imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide irangiye aha ntawavuga ko uko abantu bari bameze jenocide ikirangira ariko bakimeze .
thirteen years later , if you compare the way things are now and the way they were immediately after the genocide . ||| nyuma y' imyaka cumi nitatu ese mwebwe iyo murebye uko biri bimeze jenocide ikirangira mukaongera mukareba uko bimeze nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu .
do you think that atleast people are moving from the state of turmoil and life is being restored ? ||| mubona nibura hari ikintu kibayeho cyo kuba abantu baragiye bava mu gihirahiro kugeza ubu umuntu yavuga ngo ubuzima burimo buragaruka .
it 's just that no one can solve all the problems at once , or if we see a hundred people go on to say that everyone died but things have really changed a good example is the orphans that went to school and now have completed their studies it is evidence . ||| nukuri wenda uretseko ntawarangiriza ibibazo rimwe cyangwa wenda niba tubonye abantu ijana ngo tuvugae ngo abantu barashize ariko ibintu birahindutse none se iyo ubona abana b' imfubyi barize bakaba bararangije .
and now they are in university and some have finished , is their a child who came out of a pit thinking that he was going to study . ||| bakaba bari muri universte abandi bararangije hari umwana uvuye mu mwobo aziko azaiga .
the widows did n't have a place to stay , can that person say that nothing was done . ||| abapfakazi bamwe niba barabashije kubona aho baegeka umusaya ubwo uwo muntu yavugako ntacyakozwe .
it 's not enough may be because of limited means but i can n't say that they did n't help us . ||| biba ari bikeya ariko wenda mu mikoro make ariko ntago nrahira ngo nsembe ngo ntacyo tukorewe .
generally rwandans are not doing great now imagine those who were taken out of their own . ||| n' abanyarwanda bose muri rusangae ntabwo bameze neza nkantswe nuwakuwe mutawe burundu .
but slowly i think something has changed but there 's still a long way to go . they problem is that there are some people who are doing very badly and it huts me when i hear that they support farg . ||| ariko buhoro buhoro ngewe nbona hari icyahindutse kusa haracyarimo abameze nabi cyane binanbabaza iyo numvise bavuga ngo batanga inkunga y' ingoboka ya farg .
they say that in three months there are people who do not even it ten thousands francs , i am hurt whenever i hear this , sometimes i think thats its mocking us . ||| ukasanga baravuga ngo mu mezi atatu ibihumbi icumi hari nutabirya mu mezi icumi icyo kintu rero kiranbabaza icyo kiumvise hari nubwo numva ari agashinyaguro .
they should look for a way that a person should be supported continually so that they do n't keep going to ask for help . ||| bakwaiye kuiga uburyo bakareba ukuntu umuntu afashwa koko bihoraho bitahora biirukanka bajya kusaba .
i wanted to ask you something in line with rememebering our loved ones that were degraded and humiliated in the genocide . ||| hari ikintu nendaaga kubabaza kijyanye n' ibintu byo kuibuka abantu bacu bagiye bamburaw agaciro muri jenocide .
they were thrown in different places after the genocide , someone has to go searching ... and then they are buried , so i wanted to ask you how do you think our people should be buried ? ||| babajugunya hirya no hino nyuma ya jenocide habayeho kugenda umuntu ashakisha ..... noneho bakashyinguraw noneho nagirango mutubwirae mwumva abantu bacu bashyinguraw kutae ?
the first and best way to honor our people is to know where they were thrown and we bury them taking them out of the holes . ||| abantu bacu bagiye kubaibuka kwiza icyambere nukumenya aho bajugunyawe tukabashyingura tukabavana mu myobo .
to take them out of pit latrines , to be able to say that teh people in this district are going to be honored and buried and all of us get ready and go there remember and honor them . but rememeber well is to remember well is to remember the ones that remained behind . do n't go to remember a man ||| tukabavana mu misarane tukavuga tuti abantu bo muri aka karerae bashyinguye aha tukikora tukajyayo tuka habaibukair ariko noneho kuibuka kwiza nukwibuka babantu basizwe na babanri ntibajyae kuibuka umugabo w' umuntu .
we teach them good manners just like their parents would have done and then go the memorial sites and remember all the people who passed away . ||| ngo tubakanguraire kuitwara neza no kugira imico myiza nkiyo ababyeyi babo bari kuba babaha tujyae ku ma sites memoriaux ariko tuibukae na babantu basize na babanri .
personally there is a way i feel that we should remember our people and bury them in such a way that we would always remember them . ||| ubundi hari ukuntu njyae numvaaga ibintu numvaaga tukabaye tuibuka abantu bacu tukabashyingura neza tukahora tunabaibuka .
but both things work together just like you have said , about the survivors . there is no way that someone can remain in that kind of trouble without knowing where to live and starving . ||| ariko ibyo bintu byombi bikajya bigerageza kujyana nkuko uri ubivuze kuri abo bantu basigaye nta kuntu umuntu yasigara muri ibyo bibazo byo kubura aho aba n' inzara .
so that we may always rememebr them , i want that you will make your comment and say what you think . ||| ngo buri kihae tujyae tuibuka kuko ikintu nshaka kubivugair aho kugirango nzae kubasaba ko mwagira ikintu mubivugaho .
i think that after thirteen years that the genocide has ended its not a lot of years , but when you look at the way the memorial sites are maintained . ||| ngirango nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide irangiye ngirango ni mike cyane ariko iyo witegereje uburyo inzibutso zo mu rwanda zifashwae .
it is evident that they are not well taken care of and nothing is done about it , clearly if nothing is changed about the way they are managed then after twenty years they will be in a visibly bad condition . ||| ubona ko hatabaye ikintu cyo kuhindura uburyo zifashwaemo ubona ko hatabaye ikintu cyo kuhindura uburyo zifashwaemo ubunako nka nyuma y' imyaka makumyabiri zishobora kuba ziraangiritse muburyo bugaragara .
so here i want to ask , remembering is for who ? is it for the survivors , is for our neighbouring countries ? ||| noneho ahangaha nkaba nshaka kugirango nvugae ngo kuibuka nibyabande nibyabacitse ku icumu nibyabaturanyi bacu se bo mubinri bihugu ?
because many times people remember in april , there is no initiative so that memorial sites are always mintined and in good condition . ||| kuko kenshi abantu bagira ikintu cyo kuibuka ari uko ukwezi kwa kane kugeze ntabwo harimo akantu ko kushishikara izo site memorial zikaba zakorerwa .
you would think that we forget where they went and say , i will go visit my people in april . ||| wagirango tuba turaibagiwe aho bagiye tukavuga tuti nzajya kusura abantu baangae mu kwezi kwa kane .
but your loved one is always on your mind and heart and you always want to know where they spent the day and where they are but those memorials in the provinces and even the strong ones here . ||| ariko uwawe umuhozaho umutima ukahora ushaka kureba aho ari naho yiriwe hariya hantu rero munzibutso arizo mubyaro ari nizi zikomeye .
you said twenty years but i think twenty is a lot of time because they are some that are already getting spoiled . ||| ahubwo ngewe imyaka makumyabiri uvuze nrabona ari myinshi kuko hari naho ubona zitantaiye no kaononekara .
some places are crumbling , in other places there are bushes where animals are taken to eat grass , remebering is not for the genocide survivors only , its not even just for the government , because the government is people . ||| hari aharidutse hari ahari ibigunda usanga baragiramo amatungo ntago rero kuibuka ariby' abacitse ku icumu nta nubwo ari ibya leta kuko leta ni abaturage .
it 's for all rwandans to remember , i do n't see how some one who is neighbours with a memorial , i always take an example of kanombe . ||| niby' abanyarwanda bose kuibuka simbona rero impamvu umuntu aturanye na site njya ngira urugero rwa hariya ikanombe .
at the main road they had put there a metallic fence but they stole them and finished them off , i do n't understand how some one steals from a memorial site , what do you do with those thinks ? ||| kuri kaburimbo bigeze kuhashyira cloture y' ibyuma ariko barayibye bayimazeho umuntu ujya kuiba kuri site memorial abagiye kukoresha iki ibyo bintu ?
it is the home of those people , they may not be here on earth but it is there home . ||| ukibaza uti uru nurugo ruba bantu bantu batakireba ku isi ariko n' urugo rwabo .
i personally think that people should make it their purpose and we are also lucky that now we have lower levels of government the umudugudu @/@ village . ||| ngewe rero nkabona abantu bakagombye kubishyira mu nshingano zabo noneho tukagira n' amahirwe haje inzego zo hasi umudugudu .
as we are winding up , even though the genocide took place , we can n't forget about it . ||| kugirango wenda tugana k' umusozo nubwo habayeho jenocide ariko ntabwo tuzayibagirwa .
and we do n't wish for it to happen again , so i would like to ask you , according to the hard times we went through and saw we do n't want it to happen again . ||| kandi nta nubwo tuumva tukuifuzako yakaongera kubaho hagati aha rero nagirango nsabae ese mwumva dukurikije ibihe tunyuzemo nibyo tubonye tuumva tuifuzako bitazaongera .
what heritage would you like to give to the rwandan children who did n't go throught these things ? ||| wunva uraga abana bazavuka ejo hazaza uko b' u rwanda rwejo bataigeze baba muri ibi bintu .
what kind of rwanda would you like to give to them as a heritage compared to the one you lived in ? ||| ubaraga kuzabaraga mu rwanda ruba rumeze rutae ugereranije nuru tubayemo ?
i think that the new heritage has started already , there are still problems but i am really glad that no child is asked to stand up in class because of their ethnicity . ||| mubyukuri ahubwo nbona umurage uratangiye kukorwa nuko haba harimo za kidobya iyo ntekereje ko nta mwana ukihagurutsaw mu ijuri kubera ubwoko bwe .
the way it 's not being done in schools it should also be the same in people 's homes because all the ad influence takes place at home behind closed dooors . ||| uko bitakorwa mu ishuri bikagombye no kutakorwa mu ngo z' abantu kuko burya imico mibi yigishirizwa munzu .
on the cooking stove that 's how they always say , we parents are the ones that offer as a heritage good or bad things to our children . ||| ku ishyiga niko bakunda kubivuga abaturage ababyeyi nitwae turaga abana bacu ibiiza cyangwa ibibi .
the teacher is given responsibilities and a syllabus to follow but no one controls someone 's home . ||| mwarimu ahabwa inshingano ahabwa ibyo yigisha ariko ntawe ujya gu controrwa ariko ntawe ujya gukontrola urugo rw' umuntu .
are the ones with a problem and nobody will control and know what is being taught . the genocide was slowly taught for forty years but we have just spent thirteen years teaching to live at peace . ||| niho habi kandi ntawe uzahacontrola ngo amenye ngo baraigisha iki ariko buhoro buhoro urabona jenocide bayigishije imyaka mirongo ine ubu tumaze imyaka cumi n' itatu tuigisha kubaan mu mahoro .
if we continue to live in peace , our children would live together in peaceful rwanda with no turmoil and ethnicity . ||| tugize amahoro bikakomeza abana bacu bazabana mu mahoro bakabana mu rwanda rutarimo umwiryane rutarimo nubwoko .
but it starts with us the old and mature ones , we need to uproot it , i would like the government to emphasize refusing and condemning any word that leads to the genocide . ||| ariko haranrutse ko abakuru araitwae tubanza kubirandurawmo bwa mbere biibanze ngewe nkaifuzako leta yashyiraho umwete yanga ikisa n' ijambo ribi ryose riganaish kuri jenocide .
and whoever uses it should be punished publically even more than the one that actually used a machete , because a machete is used by someone who first talked about it . personally i would like our children without differentiating to all have a heritage of peace . ||| urikoze akarihanairw kumugaragaro ndetse akarusha uwafashe umuhoro umuhoro burya ufataw nuwabanje kuvuga nuko njyae nbiumva abana bacu ntawe nvanguye baragwa kubona amahoro .
i do n't know if there 's anything you would like to add on as we are concluding our talk ? ||| ntinzi niba hari icyo ukaongeraho kuri iki kiganiro turi tugiraanye wenda dusoza .
there 's nothing except to thank you because you thought of me and came to interview me , and for these things to happen , you can also tell me if you think that the things i said make sense . ||| nta kinri uretse kushimira ko mwatekereje kuza kunbaza kandi ibi bintu bikajya niba nawe ugira icyo unbwira niba wumvise bifatika .
if they make sense then you can keep them and if they do n't then you remove them . ||| biba bidafatika ibidafatika ukabikuramo ibifite icyo bimaze ukabirekeramo .
they can be somebody else 's opinion , thank you . ||| bikazaba ikitegererezo cy' abandi murakoze .
they came saying , masengo it 's us inkotanyi do n't worry ; come out of where you are . ||| nibo rero barimo kuza bavuga ngo "@ masengo turi inkotanyi ; muhumurae muso ; musohokae @"@ hanyuma njyewe numva ko ari interahamwe zije kututaw ;
i thought it was interahamwe trying to fool us so that they can take us . ||| kututwara ari amayeri ;
i tried to leave the place in order to hide in a nice place because i was feeling unsafe . ||| nsohotse ndi uwa mbere kugirango ; kuko aho ; aho ngaho nihishaaga nryamaaga mu banri ; ntabwo nbaga nihishe rero .
i left the place around 2 am and while i was going out i heard them talking , but there was still a lot of gunfire outside . ||| saa saba , saa munani nvuye mo mbere kugirango nrebae ukuntu nsubira muri wa mwanya njyaaga nihishamo ; nragenda koko ngeze hasi numva barimo kuvuga cyane ; ariko hakaba hari amasasu me @"@ nshi cyane ;
it was an exchange of gunfire between inkotanyi and interahamwe . ||| menshi ; menshi ; ariko akaba yari ay' inkotanyi ; yari ayo ku ;
i went down slowly and hid myself in a bush , i saw ndengeyingoma in front of those soldiers calling me . ||| kukumira interahamwe . nramanuka ngeze hasi njya mu kagunda gato nbona ndengeyingoma ari inberae y' abo basirikare ; arimo kumpamagara . nrabanza nritegereza koko ;
i carefully looked at them , because i knew how inkotanyi looked like . they were some of them i knew at cnd and others i knew from military course i took . ||| inkotanyi nri nzizi ; hari abo turi ruziraanye muri ; muri cnd ; hari n' abo nri nrabonye nkora cada cosse ;
i came out of the bush and said to them @: "@ i am masengo , i am here ! @" ||| hanyuma nva mu kigunda nza nbabwira ngo ndi masengo ; ndi hano ; ndi hano .
ndengeyingoma said to me @: "@ we are inkotanyi and we came to rescue you . @" ||| ndengeyingoma ahitako anbwira ati "@ turi inkotanyi tuje kubabohoza @"@ ati "@ ahubwo byutsa abandi @"@ nsubiye muri etage hejuru aho nraraga ;
he told me to call others , i went back in the building to call them and the ones in the house said to me @: "@ you want us to get killed . @" ||| bati ugiye kutuicisha .
it has been a good while they did not see me ; i usually came in the night . ||| ariko kuko bari bamaze iminsi batanbona kubera nyine ko ngaragaraaga mu ijoro ;
i said to them @: "@ i can not lie to you ; you know i am the one with the problem so they are inkotanyi . @" they said to me @: "@ you want us to get killed . @" i said no , they are inkotanyi . ||| nrababwira nti "@ ni inkotanyi kandi muzi ko ntababaish kandi muzi ibibazo nfite @"@ bati "@ uratuicishije @" nti "@ hoya rwose ni inkotanyi @"@ hamanuka bakeya ;
few young men went out and found it was them , so they came back to confirm that it was inkotanyi . ||| abasore bakeya babona ni inkotanyi ; basubira babwira abandi ; bitabujije ko hari nbahasigaye banzae kuemera ko ari inkotanyi ;
some of them refused to come , we were about 1700 people and 30 of them remained there . ||| hasigaye nk' abantu bata ; nka 30 ; mu bantu 1700 ; turi turimo hanyuma batwicaza ahantu mu kabuga ;
they [ inkotanyi ] told us to sit on the ground and they said to us @: "@ go down this way . @" ||| mu kibuga cya ; kiri kihari baratubwira bati "@ mumanukae aha nkaha @"@ batubwira inzira tunyura ; batu ;
they showed us the way and we knew that road . ||| tuumva turayizi baratujyana ; tumanutse hariya muri ya ; munsi ya saint fa ; munsi ya saint paul ;
we went down until we reached the first road in rugenge , we continued up the second one until we reached the third one known as the heavy weight road [ poid lourd ] . ||| tugwa ku muhandawa mbere wo muri rugengae ; tumanuka gato tugwa ku wa kabiri , turagaruka ku wa gatatu tugera kuri poid lourd ; poid lourd tuca mu gishanga ;
we passed through the swamp , heading to kacyiru by the time we reached kacyiru it was already in the morning and the soldiers were few around thirty soldiers . ||| twa tufata kacyiru ; tugeze kacyiru buba budukereyeho ; kandi abasirikare bari baje kutu ; kutubohoza bari bacyae cyane ;
the ones who managed to reach kacyiru continued but other camped there . ||| bari 30 ; hanyuma ababashije kurenga kacyiru bararenga ; abandi babacumbikishiriza ; inkota ;
the soldiers tried to find them places to stay in and they went back to fight with interahamwe . ||| izo ; abo basore b' inkotanyi babashyira mu mazu ahongaho bagaruka kurwana ; eeh n' abo ba ; n' izo nterahamwe .
they fought the whole day to protect the people they rescued . ||| bararwana umunsi wose ; ari ugu proteja ba bantu ba ; baa ; bari bajyanye ;
other soldiers [ inkotanyi ] joined them in order to give them a hand , in the afternoon that is when the remaining group managed to cross . ||| haza n' abandi n' undi musada uraza urabafasha bararwana ; bigeze nimugoroba bituma babasha kuambuka . ariko bitabujije ko mu nzira ; nk' umugore wa manyenzi ;
on the way going , some people like the wife of manyenzi , another girl lost their lives due to the shooting ; some were caught by the bullets because we were a long chain of people . ||| hari umwana w' umukobwa nawe uguye mu gishanga nawe ; hari ama ; hari ama barre perdu ; amasasu yazaaga ;
we went and reached gisozi , we were welcomed . ||| akaza kuko turi benshi ku murongo umwe ; akaza akagenda agira abo agwaho . turagiye rero tugera ; tugera ku gisozi ;
if i go back a little bit , the 30 people who stayed at saint paul saying that it was interahamwe trying to fool us were killed almost all of them . ||| baratuakira ; ariko ngarutse inyuma gatoya tumaze kuva muri saint paul ; ba banri batinye ; batinye bavuga ngo ni interahamwe zakoze amayeri yo kugirango zaiitae inkotanyi ;
one man called ally was one of the few people that survived the interahamwe attack . ||| barahazindukair ; umenya harasigayemo umuntu umwe muri abo 30 ; umugabo witwa all ;
he does n't know how he survived all he remembers is that he slept down and they started to kill people . ||| ari mu basigaye nawe ; uko yasigaye nawe ajya anbwira ko atakuzi kuko nawe yararyamye arisinzirair nyuma baraza bica abantu ; abo ngabo bari basigayemo ; n' abadashoboye bose barapfa .
so for us we reached gisozi . ||| twebwe rero ni uko nguko tugiye tugera ku gisozi ; turagenda ;
the young men became soldiers and the old women and others were taken to kabuga . i was one of the young adults that became soldiers . ||| abari abasore baitabair kuinjira mu gisirikare ; abakecuru babajyana i kabuga ; nnjyae ndi mu bitabiriye kuinjira mu gisirikare ; abandi bajya i kabuga ;
the war [ genocide ] came to an end . ||| baba i kabuga ; hanyuma intambara irarangira ;
we did not stay longer as soldiers ; some were still young so want to return to school . ||| ariko eeh ; ntabwo tutinze mu gisirikare ; tusabye yuko bamwe turi tukiri batoya tusabye ko tusubira mu mashuri ;
the main purpose was to quit the army because we felt kind of traumatized when remembering that someone had a family of ten people now he is left alone . ||| ariko ahanini tushakaaga kugira ngo tuvae mu gisirikare kuko ntabwo turi bazima ; mu mutawe ntabwo turi bazima ; kaumva ko uri ufite umuryango w' abantu nk' icumi ukaba usigaye wenyine .
we applied to leave the army and some were allowed . ||| twaraa ; bisabye bamwe baratuemerair tuvamo turaza ; tutangira ubuzima bunri bukomeye cyane umuntu ataigeze abamo ; ubuzima bukomeye ;
we went on and started new hard lives where there is no father , no mother only you alone . ||| kusanga inzu ari itongo ari wowe wowe wenyine ; nta ; nta so wanyu ; nta nyoko wanyu nta ki ;
we found the houses already destroyed . ||| mbese uri wowe uko uri . ni ukuvuga ngo ;
it was very hard the first days ; there was no food we had to search for it if not try to find a place where to sleep also visit friends . ||| iminsi ya mbere yaratugoye bikomeye cyane ; kubona ; bigatu ; rimwe na rimwe kubona icyo urya ukakibona kuri nyagasani ;
that is the kind of life i lived in . ||| ariko uba utanakibonye ukashakisha aho urara . ukasura abandi bana ; ni muri urwo rwego nnjyae nbayemo ;
i tried to search if there is any one of my family who is still alive unfortunately all of them died except one girl called chantal who was out of the country . ||| nje kugerageza kushakisha ngo numvae ko hari umuntu wanjye uba urasigaye ; nsanga bose barapfuye ; ariko nza kurokora umwe umukobwa umwe witwa chantal ; we icyatumye arokoka we ntabwo yari mu gihugu ;
she was out of rwanda during the war time . ||| ntabwo yari mu rwanda . n' abandi bose menya impfu zabo ; bakuru banjye ; barumuna banjye ;
i knew about the death of everyone , my siblings , my mother and i accepted what happened . ||| maman ; bose menya impfu zabo ; hanyuma nrabiakira . na rya shuri nri nrasabye kujyamo birananiye ;
about the other school i applied for , i was not able to go for it because i felt unhealthy , very weak , i felt i was not able to add two numbers . ||| birananiye numvaaga ntari muzima ; numvaaga nta ; nta kintu nshobora ; numvaaga ntashobora kuteranya rimwe ngo nbonae kabiri ;
i wondered why do i have to go to school , will it resurrect my mother so i felt it was useless . ||| cyangwa cyangwa mbe ; numvaaga mbese kuiga ari ; numvaaga nigair iki se ? numvaaga se nigair ngo maman azazukae ?
a lot of people begged me to go back to school as i was still young . ||| numvaaga nta cyo bimaraiye . abantu benshi baka nyinginga bati uracyari muto jya kuiga ;
i said to them @: "@ i saw where intellectual people went , even the phd holder died ! @" ||| nkababwira aah ; aah ; munbabarirae n' abize aho bagiye nrahabonye ; n' aba docteur bafite ama doctorat n' iki ?
i stayed in that miserable life . ||| nkomeje kubaho gutyo rero mu buzima bubi ;
sometimes god remembers someone . ||| ariko rimwe na rimwe imaan igera igihe ikaibuka umuntu .
i and the other sister of mine whom i told you , tried to rebuild our home house in order to have where to stay . in our financial weakness we managed to get small jobs . ||| mushiki wanjye uwo nguwo tuje kufatanya tusaan inzu yo mu rugo ; tubona aho tuba ; hanyuma mu mikoro makeya tugiye tubona akazi hamwe na hamwe ; hari nk' aho tukoze muri o.i.m ;
we worked in o.i.m and the small salary we could get out of it , we would use it to buy cement or other good people would buy for us cement . ||| udufaranga umuntu akaza akagura agasima ; undi ; umugiraneza yaza akagu ; akakaongera akandi gasima ;
we finally completed the house . ||| tubona inzu irahagaze ;
it was a big problem to have where to live ; it was hard for us to stay in several places , spending the whole year changing houses to live in when sometimes the people in there are financially unstable . ||| ni cyo kiri ikibazo kikomeye kubona aho utaha ; kuko ubundi biri bikomeye kurara mu ngo ; kumara umwaka ugenda mu ngo z' abantu kandi nabo batari bafi ;
the ones who are financially stable are mostly bad people . ||| bifite ; ukasanga ; ntabwo uri kujya mu bantu bifite kuko abari bifite bose ahanini bari abana b' abakizi ba nabi ; twebwe abacu ;
our houses were destroyed and their too . ||| amazu y' abacu yari yarasenyawe ; kandi nabo bafite ibibazo nk' ibyo ufite .
so asking for help when they also have such problem , we preferred to let it go . ||| ukasanga ni ibintu bikomeye ; ukasanga kujya kumutera ibibazo ; ukaemera ukapfair mu ; ukapfair inberae .
after completing the house , my sister got married and i stayed with the housekeeper . ||| eeh ; twa ; tumaze kusaan inzu mushiki wanjye yaje kwimaria we ; ubu njyae ndi jyenyine n' umukozi biraumvikana ;
as time passed by i had this idea to go back to school and i finally went to school at ulk university . ||| ariko bigeze igihe numva ; uko iminsi igenda yiongera numva ngomba kusubira mu ishuri ; ishuri nje kurisubiramo ubu nraiga ; niga muri ulk mu mwaka wa ;
i have finished the second year and i am going for the third year . ||| nrangije umwaka wa kabiri back ya kabiri ; ngiye muri licence mbere . bitabujije ko ubuzima ; ubuzima bwacu bw' abacika cumu njyae nbona buragoye ;
it does n't mean that the life of genocide survivors is easy ; we are not treated the way we should be treated . ||| buragoye ; cyane cyane ko nbona ; ntabwo tuitaweho nkuko tukagombye kuitabawho ; ntabwo abacikacumu bakwi ;
we always hear someone is dead , a genocide survivor , and another day you hear a criminal was released . ||| bitaweho ; buri munsi tuumva ngo umuntu yapfuye ; umucikacumu ; hanyuma ujya kaumva ukaumva ngo ruharaw yafunguwe .
that is the way we live , a criminal was released and a genocide survivor was killed . ||| twe ni uko tubayeho rero ; ruharaw yafunguwe umucikacumu yapfuye .
you hear it on the radios . ||| ngirango ababizi amaradiyo arabivuga ;
in this country the security of genocide survivors is insufficient . ||| ntabwo abacikacumu muri iki gihugu cyacu rwose umutekano wacu ugeraw ku mashyi .
we can not forget that we have to live and we are aimed at living but what these men did for us , it is not that hard for us to do it too but we were not created for that . ||| kandi uretse ko wenda twebwe ubuzima tugomba kubaho kubera ko nyine ari nacyo tuharanira ; tuharanira kubaho ; ariko ibyo bano bagabo batukorera ntabwo ; ntabwo bitunanira .
i realized it is even hard for me to kill a rabbit or a chicken . ||| ariko njyae nbona atari cyo twaremewe . njyae nbona nnjyae ubwanjye n' urukwavu kuba narwica cyangwa inkoko nbona ari ibintu biva kure .
imagine you take an innocent baby and hit the baby on the wall or remove an old woman all clothes and rape her . ||| ariko ukafata umwana w' uruhinja ukamukubita ku ; ku kikuta ; ukafata umukecuru ukamwambika ubusa ukamukorera ibya nfura mbi ;
you ask yourself if this person was created as you were created and you can not get an answer . ||| njyewe nba nbona yuko hari ; hari ibintu bimwe biba birenze abantu bakora ; ukibaza niba ari umuntu uremawe nk' uko wowe uremawe bikakuyobera . ikindi kintu rero kitubabaza cyane ni ukubona umuntu ;
another thing that hurts me , you find a person really confessing proudly of the a hundred people he killed , the horrible way in which he killed those innocent people , and the next day he is realized because of that . ||| umuntu yidegembya ngo ; ngo yishe abantu ijana akabarondora akabavuga ; akavuga uko yabaishe urubozo ; ariko ngo yavuze kusa ngo ;
you find the government is spending a lot on him while there are old women let 's say in gisozi who have nothing to eat , no where to live . ||| ngo nzae hanze . ukareba ukuntu leta imutangaho ibya mirenge hari umukecuru muri komine iyi n' iyi ; ku gisozi ; uri ;
this should be taken care of , the government should think about this . ||| uburara utafite ; kugeza n' ubu utarabona aho arara ; njyewe numva rwose bagombye kubitekerezaho ; leta ikabitekerezaho ;
okay for us we are still young men , they should care about weak people , wounded people , raped people and old women so they could die happily because the ones who betrayed us die happily . ||| wenda twebwe turi abasore ariko ikabanza ikareba abantu bababaye ; abafite ibikomere ; aba ; abafashwae ku ngufu ;
they came back and were given their properties . ||| abakecuru ; bakabanza bakabahumuriza nabo bakazasaza neza . kuko abandi bo batuhemukaiye bo basaza neza . baraje babasubiza imitungo yabo ;
got back their money from the bank got back their houses . ||| amafaranga muri bank ; nta jambo turi tufite ; amafaranga muri bank barayasubijwe ; amazu yabo barayasubijwe ;
it is sad to see someone who destroyed your house living in a very nice house of his father . ||| ariko bikababaza kurushaho iyo umuntu yagusenyeye akaza ukabona ari muri cadastre ya se ;
we do n't want those nice houses , the government should build for genocide survivors houses to live in . ||| ntayo tukeneye twebwe ariko leta nayo ; niyu ; niyubakaire wa ;
it is our right , when he is given back his properties he lives nicely than us . ||| wa cikacumu nawe abonae ahantu aba ; uburenganzira bwe bwose ; bamushubije ibintu bye ukabona abayeho neza kuturusha ; tukakomeza kubaho nk' uko twa twwabagaho na kera .
if this is not changed so the government will n't be helping us . ||| numva icyo kintu nikidahinduka rwose ntacyo leta izaba itumaraiye .
here is what i want ; all people who hurt us should be punished . ||| mu byifuzo byanjye rero eeeh ; nibahane abantu batuhemukaiye ; kuko nibatadu ;
if not i do n't see where this unity and reconciliation will come from . ||| nibatabahana na bwa buiyungae ba ; baa ; bavuga numva ko butazashoboka ;
there is this thing of asking forgiveness between each other and i find it bad . ||| cyane cyane ko hari n' imvugo mbi bavuga ngo nidusabane imbabazi .
what are we going to ask forgiveness for ? it is because they killed us ! ||| mbese nk' ubu ngubu twebwe tuzabasaba izihe nbabazi ? tuzabasaba imbabazi z' uko batuishe ?
i hear some leaders insisting that we should say sorry as if is there any fault we committed . ||| iyo mvugo rwose izavae muri ; njya numva abayobozi bamwe na bamwe babitubwira ngo nidusabane imbabazi ukagirango ;
you hear them saying that they are going to give us indemnity because we do need it . ||| ukagirango hari ikosa tubakoreye . nuko ukaumva ngo ; ngo bagiye kutuha indishyi ; ngo turashaka indishyi .
let me tell you that there is no indemnity that can replace a human . ||| nta ndishyi rwose igihe nta ndishyi y' umuntu ibaho .
it should not even be called indemnity ; it should be called compensation or another name . ||| bazarebae indi mvugo babiita ; bazabiitae impoza marair , bazabiitae ikindi kintu ; kusa barebae uko twa ;
they should find a way so the old men and women , and those wounded people could live . ||| uko abo bakecuru n' abo basaza n' abo ba ; n' abo ;
they should maintain the security of genocide survivors . ||| n' ibyo bimuga babaho ; kandi nanone umutekano ubacika cumu wubahirizwe ; kuko birababaje kaumva ngo umuntu yishe undi saa munani ;
it is sad people are killed in the day time , this happened in kabuga . ||| i kabuga birabaye ;
in kaduha , it is also the same . ||| i katuha ho ntinvuga ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe . ukaumva ngo ;
you hear a person was sent to prison , but during the visiting days they take for him meat , tea , and other nice things . ||| ngo baramufunze ; ariko umunsi wo kusura ; umunsi wo kusura baragenda bakamusanga muri ya gereza bamushyiriye inyama , bamushyiriye icyayi ,
you find that he struggles only from monday to thursday , but he lives nicely on friday like the way he lived while he is outside . ||| bamushyiriye ibiryo byiza bishoboka ; ababara mbese kuva ku wa mbere kugeza ku wa kane ; kuwa gatanu aba ariho nk' uko yari ariho hanze .
thank you too ; there is someone who said they call you nsababera , or nsababera eraste . ||| murakoze namwe ; hari umuntu wigeze kuvugaho witwa nsabiyera ; cyangwa se nsabuwera eraste wa ;
uuh ! ||| nsa ; nsa ; uhh .
your mother built for him a house ; did you find him after genocide ? ||| mwigeze ngo ; maman wawe yigeze kubakira . nyuma ya genocide hari ; wigeze umubona cyangwa ;
i said about it . ||| sina ; ntinbivuzeho ; ntinzi niba hari na ; hari ukuntu twa kenseramo .
if is there anything you can say about it , go on and say it . ||| hoya njyae nracyafata ; nagirango niba hari icyo uvuga utusobanuraire .
after when nsababera eraste caused us problems in ste famille , he came to know where my mother was and shifted her to another place . ||| nsaba ; nsababera eraste amaze kutuirukanaish muri iyo famille ; yaje kumenya aho maman ari aragenda arahamuvana ;
he really respected my mother . he took her and said to her @: "@ old woman , things are getting worse here in kiyovu so leave because you are most wanted . @" ||| yaramwubahaga pe !! arahamuvana aramubwira ati mukecuru rero ibintu bikomeye va muri iki kiyovu urimo kushakishaw .
he took her from she was , at another old woman and took her to the carcuters . ||| amuvana ku mukecuru uri hariya mu kiyovu aramujyana amugeza mu ba caricuta ;
in the carcuters that is where my mother lost her life . ||| mu ba caricuta ariho maman yaguye ; ariko ubwo yagirango ; mama yapfuye ku italiki 17 z' ukwezi kwa kane .
when nsababera came back , he got a way to kill people . ||| nsababera rero ubwo mu kugaruka kwe noneho yari abonye uburyo yica abantu . kuko yari abonye cya gitinyiro yara ;
he respected my mother at a point he could not kill while my mother is watching him . ||| cy' umukecuru wanjye yubahaaga ; yaramwubahaga pe !!! kiri kimaze gu ;
as my mother was far from him , he got strength to kill people . ||| yari amaze kubona ko amwigije kure ;
we raised nsababera as a child in the family . ||| atari buze kaumva koko ko yishe abantu ; kandi ubwo nsababera tumufataaga nku ; nk' umwana wacu ;
we used to call him kajevuba [ new comer ] because my mother did n't know his name . she used to call him kajevuba . ||| ubundi deja twanamwitaga kajevuba kubera nyine ko maman atari yakamenya izizna rye ; yamwitaga ngo ni ka kana kaje vuba ;
he took the spear and started to kill . ||| afata rero icumu atangira kuica abantu .
he came to kill a man called ruhotorinyana , ruhotorinyana 's wife was a hutu . ||| yaje kuica rero umugabo witwa ruhotorinyana ; ubwe ariwe umwiyiciye hanyuma umugore eeeh ; umugore wa ruhotorinyana akaba yari umuhutu kazi .
his wife ran to the sector where she could find the police . ||| arairukanka ajya kuri secteur ahari hari abajandarme ;
among those police men there was one who was a born again and she reported to him . ||| muri abo bajendarme hakaba harimo umwe w' umurokorae .
the born again asked kajevuba @: "@ why did you kill ruhotorinyana ? @" ||| uw' umurokorae araza abwira uwo kajevuba ati "@ ruhotorinyana umujijije iki ? @"@
he [ kajevuba ] replied @: "@ i kill him because he is a tutsi . @" ||| ati "@ mujijije ko ari umututsi @"@ ati "@ ese ntabwo uzi amabwiriza tufite ? @"@
the born again said to him again @: "@ do n't you know the rules , so i am going to kill you too because you are a hutu . @" kajevuba said @: "@ you can not do that ! @" the born again told him @: "@ i am going to do it . @" ||| umujandarume aramubwira ati "@ nnjyae ngiye kukuzeiza ko uri umuhutu @"@ ati "@ ubikora se ? @"@
kajavuba said to him @: "@ i have twenty thousand on me , you can have it . @" the born again replied @: "@ no , i do n't want your money . @" ||| undi ati "@ kandi ngiye kubikora @"@ ati "@ noneho nfite ibihumbi makumyabiri ati enda @"@ undi ati "@ oya ibyo ntabwo nbiemera @"@ ariko umugore wa ruhotorinyana agiye kutabaza kuri secteur ;
ruhotorinyana 's wife went to report to the police meanwhile kajebuva and other interahamwe stayed behind and dug a hole in which they wanted to bury ruhotorinyana . ||| kajevuba yasigaye acukurair ruhotorinyana ; n' abandi bantu ; n' izindi nterahamwe bagenzi be ;
this born again police man arrived when they have already dug only fifty centimeters but it was enough to put in a person an cover him with sand . ||| noneho umujandarume yaje batari barangiza kucukura ariko bari hafi kura ; bamaze kugera nko muri cm50 ; aho umuntu yajya bakarenzaho akataka .
the police man said to him again @: "@ you have kill ruhotorinyana because he is a tutsi and i am going to kill you because you a hutu . @" ||| aramubwira ati "@ ubwo rero ; aramubwira ati umujijije ko ari umututsi ;
kajevuba said to the police man @: "@ you can not do this to me ! @" ||| nnjyae ngiye kukuziza ko uri umuhutu @"@ undi ati "@ ese ubikora @"@ ati sinabiko ;
the born again replied @: "@ you think i can n't do it , i am going to do it . @" kajevuba gave him the twenty thousand , the police man refused . ||| nrabikora @"@ amuha ibihumbi makumyabiri arabianga ;
he gave him everything he stole within the few days he spent as killer , few days after my mother 's death but the police man refused . ||| amuha amagaziye yari yarasahuye muri iyo minsi mikeya yari amaze eeh ; akora ; akora ubwicanyi ; kuko maman nawe yari amaze iminsi mikeya agiye ;
the police man said to him @: "@ stand in front of the wall and i shoot you . @" ||| undi aranga ;
he begged him to give him the chance to say goodbye to a man called gikongoro . ||| aramubwira ati "@ jya ku kibambasi nkurase @"@ undi ati "@ noneho nbabarira nbanzae nbwirae umugabo witwa gikongoro ko ugiye kunyica @"@ undi aramubwira ati "@ ibyo ntibinreba ye ;
the police man said to him @: "@ i do n't care , i came to kill you . @" ||| ngwae nje nje @"@ amushyira ku kibambasi aramurasa ;
he stood in front of that wall and he got shot . ruhotorinyana did not die straight a way . ||| ariko ruhotorinyana akaba yari atari yapfa neza ;
the police was a good person , may god bless him . ||| uwo mujandarme yari umukizi wa neza rwose imaan imuhae umugisha .
he called other people to take ruhotorinyana at the hospital , on the way going to the hospital ruhotorinyana died . ||| yafashe abaturage aho ngaho bafata ruhotorinyana bamushyira mu ngobyi bamugejeje mu nzira nawe arapfa ;
kajevuba was put in the same hole he dug for ruhotorinyana and that is how he died . ||| ariko kajevuba nawe ajya muri wa mwobo yari yacukuraiye ruhotorinyana . eeeh ni uko yapfuye .
sometimes a person would say "@ things are not going well @"@ . you feel like commenting on it , a small advice to the government . ||| hanyuma ; ibyo aribyo byose ; hari igihe umuntu avuga ati "@ ibi bintu ntabwo bigenda neza @" ariko nawe ukaumva utanga ho umwanzuro ; ugiraho inama nka leta ukavuga uti mbese ;
yes it is good you have started the gacaca justice but it should be followed in a certain way . ||| nibyo koko mwashyizeho gacaca ; ariko gacaca ikwiriye kubahairizaw gutya ;
there is also unity and reconciliation but it should come after this or match in another way so that we can conclude within this direction . ||| nibyo koko muravuga ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ariko bukwiriye kuba nyuma y' iki cyangwa bukagenda gutya ; kugirango usae n' uwanzura muri ;
the raison i say this is because there are people who are willing to give genocide survivors their respect back , who want criminals to be judged and to send free innocent people . ||| muri icyo cyerekezo . kuko impamvu nbikubaza ni uko nzi ko uri umuntu umwe mu bantu bitangira kugirango abacitse ku icumu basubizwae agaciro kabo ; ariko kandi nanone abakoze ibyaha bahanawe ;
the kind of people who work truthfully , i think this is the way we should pass through . ||| n' abarenganyae babae barenganuraw . nk' umuntu ucaish mu kuri nraumva ukuanzura ujyana muri urwo ruhande .
studying is a tool to a better knowledge ; the same knowledge will enable you to understand the society and get to know how to handle the society . ||| kuko burya hari ikintu abantu baiga mu ishuri ; kikatuma umenya ukuntu societe iteye ; ukamenya ukuntu ukuitwara muri societe ; kuko ntakeka yuko rwose abanya ;
we do have intellectuals in this country ; let 's take an example of the ones who finished high school because they have lived in society for a while . they know what is true or wrong . ||| abanyabwenge bari muri iki gihugu ; wenda bakafatair kuri imanute da ; kuko umuntu wa ;
you can not take an old man and it happens that he judges his son , this is a rare case . ||| wize muri imanute aba yarabaye muri societe ; azi ibibi n' ibiiza ; ariko nta kuntu uzagenda ngo ufatae umusaza ; azae umuhungu we nza aje kuburana hanyuma amushinjae ;
the probability that it happens is one percent out of ninety nine percent . if it happens , the judgment will be dropped . ||| bishobora kubaho ariko izo cas ni nke cyane ; ni umwe ku ijana mirongo cyenda n' icyenda icyo kihae bararekuraw .
i endorse the fact that gacaca justice is there . ||| ako kantu rwose numvaaga bakwiriye kukitaho ; hanyuma inkiko gacaca turazishyigikiye rwose ntabwo turwanya inkiko gacaca ; kuko nta kunri kuntu ;
there is no other choice , the number of people is big and the capacity of the country is small so the gacaca courts are there as a quick solution . ||| nta wunri muti w' inkiko kaca ; w' aba bantu ni benshi ; ubushobozi bw' igihugu ni bukeya ;
this is a good way but there are some people involved in this while they are not inyangamugayo [ honest people ] . ||| inzira bafashe ni nziza ariko harimo abatari inyangamugayo .
the good thing is to remove the kind of people ; a person can not commit a mistake first time , second without noticing it . ||| abo rero ni ukureba ukuntu ukuramo ababi kandi baba bazwi ; burya ntabwo ushobora kukora ikintu ki ; kibi rimwe kabiri ngo ntumenyekane ;
it 's impossible . ||| ntabwo bishoboka .
thank you . ||| murakoze .
so freddy , maybe you can begin by telling me your name . ||| freddy nraumva ushobora kutangira utubwira amazina yawe ,
maybe you can tell me your name and your age . ||| n' imyaka yawe .
my name is mutanguha freddy and i am 28 years old . ||| nitwa mutankuha fredy , nkaba nfite imyaka 28 .
freddy , can you tell me ... tell me your earliest memory . the first thing you can remember about your childhood ? from when you were a child , what sort of things do you remember from your childhood ? ||| freddy ushobora kunbwira ibintu wibuka ku buzima bwawe bw' ubwana ? igihe uri ukiri umwana unbwirae ibintu uba wibuka .
when i was young , i remember i was very boisterous . ||| nkiri umwana nraibuka yuko nri umwana ukubagana cyane ... ko nkubaganaaga cyane .
i used to be so boisterous . i remember my mum would talk about me with other parents , telling them she had a very boisterous son who would break all utensils . ||| nraibuka ko na mama yajyaaga akunda kunganira n' abandi babyeyi ati @: « nfite umwana ariko arakubagana , amena ibintu cyane .
i remember i used to like playing football ; i joined a senior team when i was still in primary school . ||| kandi nkaibuka yuko nkundaaga umupira ; umupira w' amaguru . ninjiye mu ikipe y' abantu bakuru , ndi umwana cyane niga muri primaire [ amashuri abanza ] ,
nothing else could make me happy as much as playing football . ||| ku buryo numvaaga rwose nta kintu kishobora kunshimaish cyane kitari umupira w' amaguru .
that is my best memory . ||| icyo kintu nicyo nibuka kurusha ibindi .
tell me about your memory of your parents . ||| nbwira ibyo wibuka ku babyeyi bawe ,
if you recall ... ||| ibyo ukaibuka .
i will begin with my mum who gave birth to me . ||| ntahera kuri mama unbyaye .
my mother was the person i loved the most in the whole world ; i can still remember everything she used to do . ||| mama unbyaye niwe nkundaaga kurusha ibintu byose ngirango bibaho . ku buryo ibyo yakoraaga byose numva nkibiibuka ,
maybe because i used to be by her side all the time . ||| cyane cyane ko nmubaye iruhande igihe cyose yari akiriho .
i remember she was a very kind and generous parent . ||| nibuka ko yari umubyeyi utaba gito , yari umubyeyi ugira ubuntu cyane .
she was very social and had many friends . ||| yakundaaga abantu , ndetse akagira inshuti nyinshi . izo nshuti nyinshi yagiraaga ,
she used to tell me , "@ life is about making friends and learning how to live with people . when you know how to live with people , you will never fail to get anything . ||| yakundaaga no kunbwira ati @: « kubaho ni ukugira inshuti , kandi kubaho ni ukubaan . iyo ubana n' abantu ntacyo ubura ,
and , it is not good to be selfish , you should always share with others . @" ||| kandi ntabwo ari byiza kuikubair , ibyo ufite ujyae ubihaho n' abandi .
she did not have a lot but she gave a lot to those she lived with . ||| ntiyari afite byinshi ariko yatanze byinshi .
and , now i can see the fruits of her deeds . ||| kubo babanaaga .
all the people who help me do it in the name of ... they say , "@ you will never lack anything as long as we 're here thanks to your mother 's deeds . @" ||| ku buryo umusaruro wabo nywubona muri iki kihae , aho abaangirira neza bose , babikesha ... bavuga bati @: "@ ntacyo utuburana dukurikije ibyo mama wawe yatukoreye . @"
what is the memory of your household with your sisters and everybody ? what is the strongest memory you have about all the children ? ||| ni ikihae kintu kikomeye wibuka ku muryango wawe , haba ku bavandimwe bawe bashiki bawe n' abandi ... ni iki kikomeye ubibukiraho mu bwana bwawe ?
i would say ... maybe i only talked of my parents ... but let me talk about the kids , my sisters who were killed during the genocide . ||| ikintu nvuga , wenda nvuze ku babyeyi , ariko reka nvugae no ku bana bashiki banjye baishwe mu kihae cya jenoside .
they were four and all of them were killed so badly because , some of them were dumped alive in the latrine ... of all my sisters who died , angelique is the one i remember the most . ||| bari bane , babica bose kandi babica nabi , kuko hari mo bataye muri toilettes batarapfa . ariko ikintu cya mbere ... cya mbere nibuka ni uwari urimo witwaga angelique .
sometimes there 's a special bond between two siblings . i was much older than her but we loved each other very much . ||| hari igihe uba uvukana n' abantu , ariko ukagira mubo muvukana uwo ubona ko ari inshuti yawe bikabije . nmurushaaga imyaka myinshi , ariko turakundanaaga cyane .
i loved her very much and she loved me too . ||| yarankundaaga nnjyae nkamukunda .
in fact , she would miss school if i was not taking her myself . ||| nkaba nibuka rero ikintu cyane cyane yuko atajyaaga ku ishuri nnjyae ntagiye yo .
i always used to carry her in my arms when we were going to school and run with her and she 'd tell me that she was having a lot of fun . ||| kuko nkundaaga kugenda mutwaye mu maboko nkamwirukankana mu maboko we akanbwira ko iyo agiye ku ishuri agenda ari mu munyenga . ikindi kintu mwibukiraho cyane n' uko yanbwira ati @: @"@
i finished primary school when she was just starting it . ||| iyo turi ku ishuri @"@ ... ubwo tuigaga muri primaire njyae nri ndi muwa ... yatangiye primaire niga mu wa gatandatu ,
she used to tell me that in school , when other kids would want to fight with her , she 'd feel very safe simply because she knew i was around . ||| mu kihae nri ndi nko muwa karindwi iyo hari umwana utukaaga yazaaga kunbwira , ku buryo yabonaaga ko kuba mpari yabonaaga ko ndi byose . nta n' umuntu ushobora kumukubita , uziko abana bakunda kurwana .
she felt like i was everything to her . ||| ariko yabaga anyumvamo imbaraga ze ,
she completely trusted me . and , at home she would all the time be busy telling me all her little secrets . ||| yanyumvaagamo ikaizerae kikomeye . ku buryo no mu rugo yakundaaga kunbwira utubaanga twe twose yahuye natwo mu nzira .
tell me about particularly happy times that you had in your family ? ||| nbwira ibierekeraanye n' ibihe byiza unyuzemo mu muryango wawe .
maybe holidays , maybe a celebration or a wedding , or a party ... i do n't know , just tell me something that you remember with a fond memory . ||| nk' iminsi mikuru yabaga iwanyu mu rugo , ibindi bintu byiza ... nbwira icyo uba ubiibukaho .
the most special event that used to give me joy was that whenever they would get paid ... my mother was a primary school teacher . ||| ikintu nibuka kitushimaishaga mu rugo cyane cyane nkunda kuvuga nko mu kihae abarimu bahae ... mama yari umwarimukazi wo muri primaire , ariko ikintu kinshimaishaga ni uko iyo yajyaaga kuhembaw , bavugaaga ngo bagiye mu nama ariko akanbwira ati @: "@ nibigeza saa saba uvae mu rugo uzae unsangae ,
whenever she 'd get her pay , she used to tell me to find her in a place called rubengera at around 1 p.m. after her meeting and she 's buy me milk and cake as i was still a child . ||| " ni ahitwaaga i rubaengair . iyo yabaga yahembawe , bianze bikunze yagombaaga kaungurair amata na kekae , nri umwana biraumvikana .
when i reached secondary school , she once told me that she wanted to buy me a bottle of primus ( beer ) , but she forbade me to finish it . ||| bigezaaga aho ... aho ngereye muri secondaire yigeze kunbwira ati @: "@ noneho nrabona umaze kuba umugabo , ntashaka kukugurair primus . @" yarayinguraiye ariko anbuza kuyinywa ngo nyimarae ;
she then told me she wanted me to know that there are many stages in life and that i had now moved on to a level where she no longer considered me as a child @: she could now confide in me . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ nagirango nkuerekae yuko iyo umuntu agenda akura hari etape [ urwego ] ugenda urenga , ubu ntabwo nkikubara nk' umwana , ntakubara nk' uwo tushobora kujya inama . @"
she told me many things on that day . ||| kuko icyo kihae yanbwiye byinshi ntinzi niba nbirondora , ariko icyo kihae umunzi wa mbere angurair primus yanbwiye ibintu byinshi cyane .
tell me , what did she tell you ? ||| nbwira , ni ibiki yakubwiye ?
she first told me that there was a time ... tutsis were not liked in this country . ||| ikintu yanbwiraaga , yabanje kunyereka yuko hari igihe ... ubwoko bw' abatutsi butakunzawe mu gihugu ,
she explained to me how when she passed her primary school exams ‘ ordinary level examinations ’ [ tronc commun in french , it was once in the school system in rwanda and it is back again today ] , no tutsi ever passed again that exam until she completed her secondary school and became a teacher in the same school [ six years later ] . ||| ni nabwo yanbwiye yuko ajya kuba umwarimukazi , ya ... akimara kutsinda avuye muri primaire agiye muri tronc commun [ igihimba rusangae ] kiri igice ... ni ibintu bya kera ariko ubungubu biragarutse . yuko amaze kurangiza humanite [ amashuri yisumbuye ] nibwo umwana w' umututsi yongeye kutsinda kuri icyo kigo akaigishamo . ubwo uraumva yuko hagati aho yaragiye kuiga nta wunri mwana w' umututsi wigeze atsinda kuri icyo kigo .
she said to me , "@ i am the only one who is educated in my whole family yet my brothers are intelligent and yet their fate is to become cultivators . ||| aravuga ati @: "@ ubu nize jyenyine iwacu kandi nfite basaza banjye bazi ubwenge . ati @: bose bagiye kuzaba abahinzi ,
hutu children get schools yet they are not brighter than my brothers but i can assure you that you will complete your studies . ||| kandi abana b' abahutu bo batanabarusha ubwenge bose babonye amashuri . ati @:@ ariko ibyo aribyo byose icyo nkwizeza cyo ni kimwe , ni uko wowe uzaiga ,
and i am asking you to take care of your family as i did . @" ||| kandi nkaba nkusabye yuko bariya ... ugomba kuzajya umenya famille , nk' uko nnjyae nyimenye . @"
she gave me an example @: "@ hope you see that i fund my brother edward ... @" she took him to secondary school in congo , called zaire at that time . ||| yampaga urugero avuga ati @: "@ ubungubu urabona yuko ndihair musaza wanjye witwa edouard , [ yari yaramujyanye kuiga muri seondaire muri zairae ubungubu yabaye congo ] avuga ati @:
"@ it is very hard for me to look after my family and catering for his school needs yet he is outside the country . @" ||| biranrushya cyane kutunga urugo , nkanamurihira n' amashuri kandi yiga mu mahanga , ati biranrushya cyane . @" ati @:
she added , "@ all you need to know is you are not liked and you ought to learn how to behave in such a situation . @" ||| "@ icyo ugomba kumenya cyo , ni uko batakukunda , ugomba kumenya ukuntu ugomba kuitwara . @"
she went on to tell me , "@ something i would like from you is that you behave like your father . ||| ikindi yanbwiraaga yaranbwiraaga ati @: "@ nkusabye yuko uzajya witwara nka so , ati @:
he is one of the people i appreciate for their patience . ||| mu bantu njya nshima , ati @: nawe arimo yuko azi kuihangana , ati @:
personally , sometimes i give him a hard time and i realise it when it is too late , but he always responds perfectly to the situation . @" ||| "@ nnjyae ubwanjye hari igihe nmugoraaga . nkamugora cyane , ariko nkaza kubimenya nyuma , ariko uburyo yanyi ... yanyitwayeho nkasanga ari byiza cyane . @"
she continued , "@ i know you like football , but do n't let it obstruct you from doing school work . @" ||| icyo kintu rero aravuga ati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose ukunda umupira cyane nrabibona , ariko ntibikazajyae bikurangaza no mu ishuri .
i had n't performed very well in class that year ; i had got 65 % yet normally i used to get a distinction [ between 75 % and 85 % ] . ||| icyo kihae nri ngize amanota makeya , ngize 65 % kandi ubundi nkundaaga kugira distinction [ hagati ya 75 % na 85 % ] .
she told me it was certainly due to football . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ nrabizi ni impamvu z' umupira . ati @: rero nrakusabye ko nta kinri kigomba kukurangaza ,
"@ but please i beg you , nothing else should take away your attention . in your life you have to complete your studies so that in the future , you can do something for yourself . @" ||| ubuzima bwawe ugomba kuburagiza ishuri , kugirango uzagirae icyo wigezaho .
that is all i remember right now but slowly by slowly i will recall other things . ||| nibyo nibuka ariko wenda buhoro buhoro ngenda nibuka ibindi .
tell me about a difficult memory from the genocide . ||| nbwira ingorane zikomeye wibuka uhuye nazo muri jenoside .
well ... i was there when my sisters were about to be killed . ||| icyo umu ... bagiye kuica bashiki banjye byo nrabirebaaga ,
the perpetrators came saying @: "@ we are tired , we shall take these fat kids [ freddy and his sister ] later . @" ||| kuko baje bakavuga bati @: "@ ibi byana binini byo , tunaniwe turaza kubitwara mu kanya . @"
therefore , my sister and i stayed behind and they took the younger ones . ||| njyae na mushiki wanjye turasigara , batwara abana bato .
with our own eyes , we saw them being taken and they were killed not far from where we were . ||| bo bagiye tubareba , ndetse naho babiciye ntabwo ari kure yaho ,
however , i was not able to see each and everything . ||| uretse ko ntabirebaaga neza ,
but while killing them ... they would scream and we heard them screaming . ||| ariko babiciye ... babicaaga basakuza tubaumva .
another thing i remember is that my mum was taken very far away to be killed . ||| ikindi ni uko mama bagiye kumwicira kure ,
therefore , we went running ... at night she [ her deadbody ] was still out there . ||| ariko tuje kuirukanka ... kuko bumaze kwira yari akiri ku gasozi .
a certain boy and i rushed there and buried her . we simply covered her with soil . ||| nragenda n' undi muhungu tubanaaga , turairukanka tujya kumushyingura , tumushyize ... twamurengejeho ututaka kusa .
in brief i only saw my mum 's corpse . ||| muri make n' uko nbonye umurambo wa mama kusa ,
i never saw the corpses of the rest . i only heard the noise my sisters made while they were being killed . ||| nta banri nbonye . ariko abo bashiki banjye bo , induru zo kubica zo narazumvaga .
do you know who did it ? ||| uba uzi uwabikoze ?
... do you know who killed them ? ||| ... uba uzi uwabishe ?
because i would n't see him ... i would n't see them the way i am seeing you in front of me , but i know the people who took them . ||| kubera ko ntamurebaaga ... ntabarebaaga nk' uko nvuga ngo ndi kureba inberae yanjye , ariko abaje kubatwara nrabazi .
it was our neighbours , among them was a man called benoit who had been our neighbour for years and who owned a shop nearby . ||| ni abantu turi tuturanye barimo umugabo witwa benoit , hari n' umu ... uwo mugabo witwa benoit ndetse bari baranabanye cyane ,
he was her friend and he even used to lend her money for me to go to school the times she did n't have money . ||| kuko hari n' igihe mama yaburaaga amafaranga yo kunjyana ku ishuri aka ... kuko we yari afite boutique akaba ariwe uyampa .
they were relating to each other very well . he was one of the leaders of the group that took them the time they came to kill them . ||| akaba ari ... niwe ugiye ... uje ashoreye igitero nawe ari mu bantu bakomeye muri icyo gitero , baje kubica .
there was another young man called kanani . she was kanani 's teacher in primary . ||| hakaba hari n' umuhungu yigishaaga ... yigishije muri primaire , witwaga kanani , nzi neza ko ari nawe umukuye mu nzu nyuma i gitero ... abo bari bazanye ;
some people inside the compound tried to fight with them as they had been given money by my parents and he 's the one who was holding her hand when they were taking her out of the house ; he later on let go of it . ||| abari bari mu rugo bari bahaye amafaranga bakasa nk' abajya kurwana . ariko we yamufashe akaboko amukura mu nzu nyuma aza kumurekura ,
when he released her , my mum ran away but they found her where she had ran too . ||| mama nawe aza kuirukanka , nyuma baza kumusanga iyo yirukankaiye .
at least i can still remember that incident very clearly ... ||| ariko ibyo aribyo byose ibyongibyo byo nrabiibuka byo ...
freddy , how did they kill your mother ? ||| uba uzi uburyo bamwishe ?
my mother was beaten to death with clubs . ||| bamukubise amahiri bamwica .
during the rest of the genocide , did you continue to witness what the killers were doing ? did you see the killers often ? ||| nyuma y' aho jenoside ibereye , bijya bikunda kukubaho mu buzima bwa buri munsi ko bikugaruka mu bitekerezo , ukabona ibyabaye , abicanyi ...
i normally think about it ... it normally happens during april because that is when i think about what took place in rwanda the most . ||| ibyo nkunda kubibona , bikunda kuza cyane cyane mu kihae cyo mu kwa kane , kuko ariho nrushaho kutekereza ku bibaye mu rwanda .
yeah , in april is when i remember . ||| mu kwezi k' ukwa kane nibwo nkunda kuibuka .
and during that time , i get nightmares , i see people killing others ... i see interahamwe killing people . ||| ubwo icyo kihae rero nibwo nshobora kurota nbona abantu bica abantu , nbona interahamwe zaica abantu ... ariko ubundi ntabwo kurota bikunze kunbaho .
but otherwise , i am lucky i rarely have nightmares . however , in april i get them . ||| ngira amahirwe ariko mu kihae cyo mu kwa kane rimwe na rimwe nrabirota .
can i ask you more difficult questions ... can i ask two more ... is it okay ? ||| unyemerair nkakubaza ibindi bibazo bibiri bikomeye ?
how did the killers go about doing their work ? what did you see them doing to your family , to other people , what did you see ? how did it happen ? ||| ... ubonaaga abicanyi bakora iki muri kiriya kihae ? bicaaga abantu kutae ari abo mu muryango wawe n' abandi ... ibintu wibuka ubonye ukuntu bicaaga abantu ...
yes , i know them very well ... i know them . ||| eh , nrabazi cyane . nrabazi .
one of them is called niyonsenga ; he wanted to rape my sister . however , he never succeeded . ||| nrabazi baitwa ba niyonsenga abongabo ... uhoraaga arwanair kugirango aviyole [ afatae ku ngufu ] mushiki wanjye . ahubwo n' uko ata ... ntabwo yashoboye kubigeraho ,
they were very many and i knew them . ||| ni benshi nrabazi .
freddy , what does it mean to ... be a survivor , what did you feel when you survived ? ||| kuba uri umuntu ucitse ku icumu , kuri bwawe wunva bivuze iki ?
personally i believe having survived ... being a survivor is luck yes but it is also a big responsibility . ||| ngewe kuba nracitse ku icumu , usibye ko ari n' amahirwe ariko ubundi ni n' inshingano .
i look at it as responsibility because many of the survivors are very poor and do not even have the least necessary for life [ food and a shelter ] . ||| nbibona mo inshingano kuko abacitse ku icumu benshi , batafite uko bameze . abakeya muri bo bakaba aribo bifite , bashoboye no kugira icyo bigezaho ku bierekeye no kutunga ubuzima nravuga nk' ibyo kurya nibyo ... mbese n' ubuzima bw' ibanze ababufite ni bakeya .
that 's why those who have something to share need to feel responsible for the ones who do not have anything . ||| ni inshingano rero cyane , z' ababufite , ubwo ubuzima bw' ibanze kubusangira n' abatabufite .
and i call it a privilege because when i consider what took place in rwanda , with all the determination that was put in and when you consider all those who were fully motivated such as the government of rwanda or other governments of powerful countries , like the french government . ||| nvuga ko arero amahirwe ... kuko iyo urebye ibyabaye mu rwanda , ukareba n' ingufu biri bifite n' abari babirimo ; ari leta y' u rwanda ;
we can easily say that it is a miracle that some people survived . ||| ari leta z' ahandi ,
therefore , i believe that it is a privilege to be a survivor and i believe it is a big responsibility . ||| kandi z' ibihugu by' ibihangange nk' ubufaransa . ubonaaga yuko kugirango umuntu asagukae biri bigoye cyane . numvaaga rero kuba uwacitse ku icumu n' amahirwe kandi ni n' inshingano zikomeye .
what did you feel in 1994 ... ? how old were you ... 15 , 16 .. ? ||| ese wiyumvaga kutae muri1994 ? harya uri ufite imyaka ingahe cumin' itandatu ... ok ,
oh 19 . ||| cumi n' icyenda . none se wiyumvaga kutae ?
what did you feel ? did you feel angry , did you feel empty ? did you feel ... what was in your mind and in your heart ? ||| wunvaaga ufite umujinya , wunvaaga se umeze nk' igishushungwe ... wiyumvaga utae mu mutaima , utekerezaaga iki ?
how i felt during that time ... maybe i can not say exacty how i felt . ||| njyewe icyo ... uko numvaaga meze muri icyo kihae , hari igihe ubungubu ntashobora kubisubiramo ,
but i was so afraid . ||| ariko ubundi bwa mbere ngiraaga ubwoba bwinshi .
i used to imagine a machete cutting my neck all the time . and i would imagine my neck on the floor . ||| nkahora ntekereza ukuntu umuhoro ugiye kuzakubita igikanu kikagwa ,
i would always imagine seeing my mum being killed [ i mean the period from the 8th to the 14th of april . ||| nkahora nkibona hasi kiguye ,
] my heart was full of fear while in the cieling where i was hiding in someone 's house . ||| nkahora nbona ukuntu bagiye kuica mama [ nravuga nka periode yo kuva ku itariki umunani kugeza kuri cumi n' enye mu kwezi kwa kane ] nraanzwe n' ubwoba ahantu nbaga ndi muri plafond z' abandi bantu .
they used to allow me to sit near the fire as i would be freezing in the cold . ||| nkakonja bakanjyana ku ziko bakanshyira inyuma y' urutaro ,
i was hiding behind a big sieve [ used for sorghum ] so that whoever was making the fire , would n't be able to see me . ||| kugirango umuntu ucanye ataza kunbona . nbagaho ku buryo numvaaga nrangaw n' ubwoba ,
i was so afraid and i lost hope of survival . ||| nta kaizerae cyinshi cyo kubaho nfite .
i reached a point where i was no longer scared . i was no longer afraid of death ; death or life meant nothing to me anymore . ||| ariko nyuma y' aho ngeze aho ubwoba buranshiraan neza neza ku buryo numvaaga npfa , ntapfa , numvaaga ntacyo bintwaye .
sometimes my sister and i would walk on the road ... we walked a lot but we were not afraid of passing where there were roadblocks . ||| ku buryo hari igihe njyewe na mushiki wanjye tugendaaga mu nzira kuko tukoze urugendo rurerure ,
we only feared to pass a roadblock once but we realised that it was n't good , because there is a certain place where i reached ... ||| ntitutinyaaga kunyura ahantu ngo bari bariyeri , ngirango tubitinye rimwe kandi tubonye ko atari na byiza , kuko hari ahantu ngeze ...
when we reached that roadblock we tried to hide and used a way down that road but we were found out . ||| ... ubwo ngeze ahongaho kuri iyo bariyeri , tushatse kuyinyura munsi ,
that was in a place called mwendo in kibuye . ||| ni ahantu baita muri mwendo ku kibuye .
they took us up to the roadblock and asked us if we were tutsis and we said we were not but they looked at us and told us we must be tutsis because of our soft hair and all . ||| tushaka kunyura hepfo gatoya , kugirango wenda abantu bo kuri bariyeri bataza kutubona baratuzamura batuzana kuri bariyeri , batubaza niba turi abatutsi turabwira tuti @: ntabwo turi abatutsi .
they said many things and told us to stop lying to them . ||| batubwira byinshi ... bigeze aho bati @: "@ urebye iyo misatsi yanyu , urebye iki ... bati @: ntimuzae kutubeshya . @"
they asked me to dig up my own grave and i refused which shows that i had reached a point where i was no longer afraid . ||| baranbwira ngo @: "@ wowe ugomba kuicukurair , " ariko nrabianga . bigaragaza ko icyo kihae ntabwo ntinyaaga ,
we were taken to the commune . they said the borgamster would be the one to judge our case . ||| turi tugeze aho tutatinya urupfu . nyuma baza kutukura aho ngaho baravuga bati @: "@ bourgmestre wa mwendo niwe uza kuca urubanza , " batushyira kuri commune baratufunga .
we ended up spending one night in a cell as we found when the borgmaster was drunk . ||| batufunze ariko kuko bourgmestre tusanze yasinze , aravuga ati @: "@ babae batufunze . @"
but i was n't afraid anymore at that time . ||| ariko muri icyo kihae numvaaga nta bwoba ,
all my fears died up after my parents were murdered and after seeing so many dead bodies on the way . ||| n' ubwo nri nfite nri nbufite ababyeyi batarapfa . kandi turi tumaze kugenda mu nzira tusimbuka intumbi nyinshi , ku buryo tuumvaaga twebwe nta bwoba bituteye kuba tupfa kugeza ubwo .
do you think that people understand your experience ? . ||| wibaza ko abantu baumva cyangwa basobanukirwa ibyo mwanyuzemo .
a few people understand . ||| bake barabiumva .
obviously not everyone can understand what i went through . ||| ibyo nbayemo ntabwo babiumva bose biramvikana ,
some people did not even want me to live and they still do n't want me to be alive today and they 're not happy when they see me prospering . ||| harimo n' abatifuza y' uko nbaho , kandi na n' ubu batabiifuza babazaw n' ukuntu babona umuntu agenda atera inberae .
those who are with us do understand , those who went through similar things , especially those who share our lives daily . ||| ariko abandi turi kumwe barabiumva , cyane cyane abo tusangiye ubuzima bwa buri munsi .
can you forgive people that carried out these problems ? ||| wunva urababariye abakukoreye ibyo utubwiye ?
it is difficult to forgive . ||| kubarira biragoye .
it is difficult to forgive and i have n't gone down that road yet because i do n't even know where to start . ||| kubarira biragoye kuko n' iyo nzira numva ntarayitangira , kuko njyae numva ntazi aho nyihera .
who should i forgive anyway ? the former government as it contributed to it very strongly ? ||| ese ntangirae nbabarirae leta kuko nayo yari ibifitemo uruhare ?
do i forgive people individually ? ||| ntangirae se nbabarirae umuntu ku giti cye ?
do i start from forgiving ... ? i look around and i do n't know where to start from , as so many people were involved in it . ||| ntangirae se nbabarirae ... nreba ababigizemo uruhare bose nkabura uwo ntiangiriraho .
it is certainly hard but it is possible . ||| ibyo aribyo byose , birakomeye ariko birashoboka .
the reason i say it is possible is because patriots ... the survivors in this country are very few . and their strength is ... they can not develop the country on their own . ||| impamvu nvuga ko bishoboka ni uko umuntu ukunda igihugu ... ... abacitse ku icumu bakisigayemo ni bakeya , amaboko yabo ni ma ... ntabwo bonyine bashobora kuzazamura i gihugu bonyine .
therefore , all people in the country should put their energy together and develop the country . ||| ni ngombaw ko abari mu gihugu bose bafatanya ingufu zabo kugirango igihugu kizamukae .
personally , i am not ready to begin that journey [ of forgiving ] soon . ||| ariko ku bwanjye ntabwo iyo nzira nteganya kuyitangira vuba , mu kihae ntaramenya uwo nhera ho nbabarira .
first i do not know who i should forgive . it is better those who committed the crimes start asking for forgiveness . ||| biri bikwaiye ko uwabikoze uwo ariwe wese yatangira kusaba imbabazi ,
they should come to us and we talk about it . ||| tukanegeraan akaza tukanabiganiraho wenda .
let 's say if it is a hutu who killed , he should come and say , "@ i killed people and i am really sorry . @" ||| ari umuhutu wishe akaza akavuga ati @: njyae nraishe , ariko munbabarirae .
they should do it in way one would really see that somebody is truly sorry . ||| bikaza ari ibintu ubona ko bifite umutima wihariye wo kusaba imbabazi .
then things would proceed and finally reach the countries that participated . ||| bikagenda bigenda , bikagera no mubihugu bibigizemo uruhare .
and they [ those countries ] should use their power to help the survivors who are needy . ||| ndetse no muri ibyo bihugu bibigizemo uruhare ukurikije ubuhangange bwabyo , bikanitabair kufasha inbabarae z' abasigaye .
i am not among them because i am not handicapped , i am able to work for myself . ||| njyewe ntinri mo kuko njyae ntinri ikimuga ,
in fact i could compete in healthy competions ... i am very ready . ||| njyewe nshobora kuikorera . nshobora no kuhangana n' abandi , nkajya muri competition [ irushaanw ] y' ubuzima njyewe numva ndi tayari [ niteguye ] .
but what about those orphans , those other kids who look after themselves with several other responsibilities , how do they survive ? ||| ariko se izo mfubyi , abo bana bibana batarageza imyaka , bafite inshingano nyinshi babaho batae ?
the countries who participated in the genocide know about that . ||| aho ibyo bihugu bibigizemo uruhare birabizi ?
they should do something to show that although they participated , it was involuntarily ! they need to do something to show that they care about them [ the orphans ] despite everything that happened . ||| kugirango wenda nabo batangirae kaumva ko ... wenda nubwo ... bacitswe bakabikora , bakifite umutima wo kubakunda .
i believe the process of forgiving is hard but possible . ||| njyae numva gahunda yo kubabarira irakomeye ariko irashoboka .
why did you start to be involved in a.e.r.g , why did you do that ? why did you think it important to try that ? ||| tuzi ko ubaye mu muryango a.e.r.g , ni iki uwo muryango uwuvugaho ... ubona ko ari iki kitumye ushingaw ?
i personally would like to thank those who founded a.e.r.g. when you look at its objectives , its deeds , you ought to thank a.e.r.g. it is the only association with so many people willing to help the genocide survivors , starting with young kids and themselves . ||| a.e.r.g. ni umuryango njyewe kubwanjye numva ... abawutekereje ngomba kubashimira . ukurikije intego zawo , ibikorwa byawo , nsanga ari umuryango ngomba kushimira ,
i think it is an association worth ... i even worked with them and lived with them for a long time . ||| kuko niwo wonyine nibonye y' uko ... harimo n' abantu benshi barimo ubona bafite ubushake bwo kufasha abacitse ku icumu . bahereye ku bana bato kandi nabo bihereyeho . njyae nbona ari umuryango ... kubera ko nrawukoreye , nwubayemo igihe kirekire ,
it was an organization that helps people believe that , although they lost their parents , some friends or a fellow students can try and do as much as a parent as much as possible . ||| ubona ari umuryango ushobora ku ... kutuma umuntu yiumvamo yuko kuba yarabuze ababyeyi ... ariko inshuti cyangwa umunyeshuri bigana ashobora kurangiza inshingano umubyeyi we yagombaaga kukora .
and my hope is that as long as that association is still operating , orphans will stop looking at themselves as orphans . ||| ikaizerae nywufitemo rero n' uko igihe cyose uzaba ukiriho , abana bazagabanya kaumva ko bari imfubyi .
that they will find that , in the absence of their parents and friends , a.e.r.g. is there for them . ||| abana bazaumva yuko umuryango witwa a.e.r.g ubabereye aho ababyeyi n' inshuti zabakundaaga batari .
that they 'll find peace in it . ||| kuko bawuboneramo amahoro ,
i know this from experience ; i once lived there and found peace in it . ||| njyae nrabizi kuko nwubayemo nnjyae nwuboneyemo amahoro .
do we learn anything from the genocide ? do we learn anything from the genocide ... ? does genocide ... does it teach us anything ? ||| hari ikintu ubona jenoside ituigisha ... hari isomo ubona tuyikuramo ?
the occurency of the genocide teaches a lot . ||| ubundi kuba jenoside yarabaye , yigisha byinshi .
there is much we learn from it . ||| yatuigishije byinshi ,
we are not happy that it occured but it has helped people grow before time . people became responsible while they were still young and they forgot they were young due to the experience they went through in life . ||| ntituishima kuba yarabaye , ariko nyuma abantu bakuze batarakura . abantu bafashe responsabilites [ inshingano ] ari abana kandi babiikuramo neza , bikurikije na experience bagize .
well it was n't a good experience but it taught us great lessons . ||| ntinvuga ngo ni nziza , ahubwo hari icyo yatuigishije kikomeye , cyo kumenya yuko ugomba kuimenya .
a lesson on knowing who you are , how far you can go , how to behave with others and where you belong in this world . ||| cyo kumenya yuko ... kumenya aho ugeze , ukanamenya n' icyo ukorera undi ,
generally genocide taught us a lot of things as far as being responsible is concerned . ||| no kumenya uruhare rwawe muri iyi si . ibyo ari byo byose numva jenoside yabaye yatuigishije byinshi ku bierekeye na responsabilites [ inshingano ] umuntu agomba kufata .
what do you think the international comunity should learn ? ||| ugira icyo utubwira ku muryango mpuzamahanga ? ni irihae somo umuryango mpuzamahanga ukwaiye kuigira ku bibaye ?
the international community needs to know that it is very important to keep one 's word and that they can not take it back . ||| ibihugu by' amahanga cyangwa se abanyamahanga , bakwaiye kumenya yuko icyo bavuze batagomba kuisubiraho .
they also need to know that they did very little to save the people who were dying in our country . ||| bagomba kumenya kandi ko bagize intege nkeya zo kutabara , abapfaaga mu gihugu cyacu .
they also need to know that survivors are there and that these survivors need to live a good life . ||| bagomba kumenya kandi ko hari abasigaye , kandi abo basigaye bakeneye ubuzima nk' ubwabo .
they need to know that the genocide actually happened and they need to show respect to its victims and to acknowledge that these victims were actually innocent . ||| bagomba kuibuka y' uko jenoside yabayeho , kandi bakaha icyubahiro abayizize kuko batagiye ari imbwa . kandi bakamenya yuko bazize ubusa .
can i ask you the same question again .... would you like to have a family one day ? ||| wunva wifuza kuzagira umuryango umunsi umwe ?
in my future plans , i plan to have a family . ||| numva mu ntego zanjye nazo nfite mu munsi iri inberae , no kugira umuryango nabyo birimo .
and i plan to teach my family the same morals i was taught . ||| ni ukuvuga yuko ningira umuryango , no mu byo niteguye kuzakora ku muryango wanjye , ni ukutanga inyigisho nhawe nyine .
what would you tell them ? ||| ni iki uzajya ubabwira ?
what they first need to know is that the word of a parent is of great value . ||| ikintu cya mbere , ni ukumenya y' uko ijambo ry' umubyeyi riba rifite agaciro kakomeye . icyo bagomba kukifata ,
that 's something they need to know and keep in their hearts ; especially when they are positive advice . ||| bakakishyira ku mutaima . cyane cyane iyo ari ryiza ... nzajya ngenda nbaha urugero rw' ibyo nbawiyew ,
i will keep on showing them the example of what i was told so they can one day tell it to their descendants . ||| y' uko nshaka yuko nabo ubwabo bagomba kugenda babwira abazabakomokaho .
here i am talking about my wife and my children . ||| ubwo aho nravuga abana banjye n' uwo tuzaba turufatanije .
and finally , who is freddy today ? which sort of a person are you ? ||| hanyuma turangiza , nagirango utubwirae tuvuga ko freddy ari muntu ki , muri iki kihae ?
i feel like i am one of the survivors who have the development of all the others on their heart , whose goal is for us to be united as we fight against all the consequences of the genocide . ||| njyewe uwo nriwe , ni ikibazo kigoye kukisubiza , ariko numva ndi umwe mu bacitse ku icumu , bafite igitekerezo k' iterambere ryabo .
i am one of the people who dreams of a developed rwanda and i am also one of those who really wants to fight all genocidal ideologies . ||| bafite kandi n' intego y' ubufatanye mu rwego rwo kurwana n' ingaruka z' itsembabwoko . ndi umwe kandi mu bahora barota amajyambere y' igihugu cyanjye . kandi ndi umwe kandi mu bahora barota kurwanya igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose , kiganaish ku itsembabwoko ni ukuvuga @:
several people , some of whom i know and others i do n't know are ready to fight those ideas as much as we can . ||| [ ideologie genocidaire ] . ibyo n' abandi benshi nzi nabo ntazi , tufite umugambi wo kuzabarwanya tuivuye inyuma .
our plan is to build our nation and we shall make it only if we put into consideration the younger generations and if we work towards removing all bad ideologies from their minds and replace them with new ones . ||| kandi tukaba tufite n' umugambi wo kuzamura i gihugu cyacu . ibyo tuzabigeraho tuibanda cyane kubakiri batoya , tubakuramo ibitekerezo bibi , baiga n' ibitekerezo byiza .
this is the 29th of march 2004 , in kigali and we are speaking to rosette . ||| turi ku itariki 29 werurwe 2004 , turi i kigali , kandi turaganira na rosette .
rosette could you first of all give me your name and your age ? ||| rosette , mbere na mbere ubanza kutuibwira ? amazina yawe n' imyaka ufite .
my name is sebasoni musabe rosette , i am twenty @-@ five years old . ||| nitwa sebasoni musabae rosette , nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu .
and after the genocide ehh ... how many of your family were killed in the genocide ? ||| hanyuma nyuma ya jenoside ... upfushije abantu bangahe mu muryango wawe muri jenoside ?
during genocide , i lost my parents and my four sisters . in total , i lost six people in my family . ||| mu kihae cya jenoside hapfuye ababyeyi banjye hapfa n' abavandimwe banjye bane ... ubwo bose hamwe ni batandatu .
can you describe for me ... eh , describe for me your mother ? ||| unbwira kuri mama wawe ? sa n' umunshushanyiriza mu magambo , nbwira mama wawe .
my mother was a wonderful parent . because i learnt strong lesson from her . ||| maman wanjye yari ... nvuga ngo yari umubyeyi utangaje cyane , kuko nmubonyeho urugero rukomeye .
she a parent who knew very well how to look after us . ||| yari umubyeyi uzi kuturera neza cyane ,
her great example is still very vivid in me . ||| njya nbitangaho urugero .
she was very open with us , she used to tell us everything . ||| yatubwiraaga byose nk' abana yabyaye ,
we used to think it strange that she would tell us that she loved us ; everyone we would tell about it could not believe it , as it is not something a parent easily expresses to his @/@ her child [ in our culture ] . ||| biratutangazaaga kaumva atubwira ko atukunda . ku buryo tubibwiraaga n' abandi bavuga bati @: "@ ibyo nta mubyeyi ubibwira umwana . @"
but she was a parent who knew how to look after her children . ||| ariko yari umubyeyi uzi kuturera neza ,
she was very sociable and people still say so today . ||| akamenya kubaan neza n' abantu , cyane abantu bose n' ubu tuumva babivuga , n' ubu atakiriho .
she was a very good adviser , people used to come home to seek advice from her . she had very many friends and there would always be visitors at home . ||| akamenya kujya inama abantu bazaaga kumugisha inama . akagira inshuti nyinshi cyane , urugo rw' iwacu ruhoraaga rugendaw . tuhoraaga tubona abantu ,
we used to see several people coming home ; some would come to live at home , others would come for school fees or some were domestic workers . ||| abaza kuhaba , abo arihair amashuri ,
if my mum found a worker to be bright enough to go to school , my mum would take him or her to school . ||| abakozi nk' uje ari umukozi , yabona hari ... yabona amenye ubwenge , yabona ko hari icyo yazavamo , akamujyana mu ishuri .
they are a lot of people whom she took to school and some went up to secondary yet they started as domestic workers at home . ||| turi tufite abantu benshi yagiye arihair amashuri , akabajyana no muri secondaire bari baraje ari abakozi bo mu rugo .
saying everything about her would take ages ; all i know is that she was a very wonderful parent . ||| kumuvugaho biba birebire cyane , icyo nzi cyo yari umubyeyi utangaje .
tell me about your father . ||| noneho nbwira no kuri papa wawe .
all i can say about my father ... he was also a wonderful parent . ||| icyo nvuga kuri papa ni uko nawe yari umubyeyi utangaje .
we realized it after the genocide as people say a lot of good about them . ||| tubibonye wenda akenshi nyuma ya jenoside , aho tuumva bose babavuga neza ,
they say , "@ it seemed impossible that such good people would spend their old age together and see their own children when the latter are adults . @" ||| bavuga bati @: "@ ntibiri kushoboka ahari ko babana ngo basazaane , tuesae batubonae tukuze ,
actually all i said about my mum similarly applies to my dad . ||| " kuko ibyo nvuze kuri mama , nibyo nvuga no kuri papa . kuko papa we ... ntiyagiraaga amagambo menshi ,
although he was a quiet man , he also had so many friends . ||| ariko yari afite inshuti nyinshi cyane .
... especially his collegues and neighbours . ||| ... cyane abo bakoranye , abo babanye ,
and most friends we have now ... the people who helped us after the genocide were my father 's friends . ||| n' ubu inshuti tufite nyinshi abantu bagiye batufasha nyuma ya jenoside ni abantu bashoboye kubaan neza na papa .
former schoolmates , colleagues ... usually the female parent is the one who is more familiar with the children . however , our dad too showed us love . ||| abo baiganye , abo bakoranye ... kusa umubyeyi w' umu mama burya niwe ukunda kuegera abana cyane ariko data nawe yatureraanye urukundo .
tell me about happy times ... a particularly happy memory that you have with your parents . ||| nbwira noneho ibihe byiza ugize mu buzima bwawe . ku bw' umwihariko ibintu wibuka bikushimaishije ... ukiri kumwe n' ababyeyi .
the one who was after me was called consolee , another one was called angelique . ||| uwankurikiraga yitwaaga consolee ,
she was followed by the one called illuminee . another one was called florence . ||| undi yitwaaga angelique ukurikiraagaho witwaga illuminee undi yitwaaga florence .
there was also an adopted child at home called jeanne . we considered her as part of our family . ||| turi tufite n' undi mwana twarairaga [ adoptif ] ubwo nawe tubara nk' umwana yitwaaga jeanne nawe yabaga i wacu nawe tumubaraga nk' umwana .
sorry , could you please tell me the names of your sisters again ? ||| bishoboka ko unsubirairmo amazina y' abavandimwe bawe na none ?
my sisters who died in the genocide , were consolee , angelique , illuminee and florence . ||| abavandimwe banjye bapfuye muri genocide hari uwitwaga consolee , hari uwitwaga angelique , hari uwitwaga illuminee , n' undi witwaga florence .
but there was also an adopted child who died together with them and we considered her as our sister . ||| ariko hari n' undi adoptif nawe bapfaanye tufataaga nk' umwana wacu ,
she was called jeanne . ||| nawe bapfaanye witwaga jeanne .
what was your relationship with your sisters , how did you get on with your sisters ? ||| imibanire yawe na barumuna bawe yari iyihe ? ese mwasabanaga mutae ?
what i can say about my sisters ... they were still young . ||| icyo nvuga kuri ... ku bavandimwe banjye , bari bakiri bato ,
it took long time before my parents gave birth to other children after we left burundi . they were still preparing themselves for having other children . ||| igihe tuvuye i burunri , haciyemo igihe kinini mu rugo batarashobora kubyara abandi bana ... bakibiitegura .
therefore , the young ones were much younger than us . they were very obedient kids . ||| ubwo abana .. abato ... bari bato kuri twebwe . ikintu ... icyo ... turi tumeze bari abana bari bazi kaubaha cyane ,
they considered me as their aunt . they considered me as someone more mature than them . ||| banfata nka tantine wabo . nk' umuntu mukuru ubakuraiye ,
we used to discipline them because that is what mum used to tell us . ||| tukabaha discipline [ tukabashira ku murongo ] kuko ariko mama yajyaaga atubwira .
another thing i can say , our mother had forbidden us to fight . we used to teach them good manners ; we would tell them that none of them should abuse the other . ||| ikindi nvuga cy' icyenzi nvuga , ni uko mama yari yaratubujije kutukaan . abana bacu tubahaga uburaire ,
she used to tell us that insulting someone as stupid could make them grow up with a belief that he or she is actually stupid . ||| tubabwira ko nta muntu ugomba kutuka undi . ko ... akajya atubwira ko ngo kera iyo babwiraaga umuntu ngo n' ikigoryi , yakuraaga yumva ko ari cyo . mama rero akatubuza akatubwira ati @:
therefore , she would warn them never do it again , she told them she did not want to ever hear them abusing each other . ||| "@ ntimuzaongerae , ntinzaumvae umwana utuka undi . @"
and that is the discipline we taught to our young sisters . ||| ku buryo n' abo abana tuvukanaaga , ariwo muco tubatozaaga .
of course they were naughty just like other children are and we would punish them . ||| nta muntu ushoboraaga kutukaan . barakubaganaaga nk' abandi bana , tukabahana .
but they would never abuse each other because we told them not to . ||| ariko ikintu cyo kutukaan ntibakigiraaga . kuko turi turakibabujije .
another thing i recall about my relatives , angelique was an extraordinary child . ||| ikintu na ... ikindi nkuibukair ku bavandimwe banjye , ni uko umwana witwa angelique , yari umwana ubona atasanzwe ,
she was very bright . i remember she was good at playing draughts ; it is a very popular game . ||| yari afite ubwenge bwinshi muri we ... afite ubwenge bwinshi muri we . nraibuka ko yajyaaga akina umukino witwa dame ... dame ngirango abantu barayizi benshi ,
she would play with twenty @-@ five or thirty @-@ year @-@ old people . ||| yajyaaga akina dame n' abantu bakuze . bafite nk' imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu ... mirongo itatu .
it a game that requires thinking . ||| ni umukino usaba ubwenge , usaba kutekereza .
but she would win over them all yet she would be the youngest . ||| ariko yarawukinaaga abantu bose akabatsinda .
i remember she was in primary two . ||| ari umwana , icyo nrabiibuka ko yigaga mu wa kabiri yari mu mashuri abanza ,
she won over many people . ||| yakinaaga n' abantu benshi akabatsinda .
i remember she was a very sharp child ; she knew how to distiguish different types of music at a very young age . ||| ikindi mwibukiraho yari umwana ufunguye cyane mu mutawe , ku buryo kuva kera yari azi kutandukanya indirimbo , nvuga nka sorte z' indirimbo .
i mean types of music ; she could listen to music and tell which one is funky , which is rock and which is zouk . ||| yakaumva iyi akavuga ngo ni funk , ukaumva ngo ni rock , akaba azi ngo ni zouk akiri muto ,
she also enjoyed dancing a lot and most people liked her . ||| akabikunda akakunda kubyina cyane . abantu benshi bakamukunda ,
while she was still in nursery school , her teachers used to take her to the lake in gisenyi or in kibuye . ||| akaiga muri maternelle [ ibinyoni ] hari abantu baigishaaga ahongaho bajya bamujyana kuri lac , bakamujyana i gisenyi , bakamujyana ku kibuye yari umwana ushimaishije cyane .
she was such an interesting child that almost everybody liked her . ||| ku buryo abantu bose bamukundaaga cyane ,
she knew how to sing and how to make friends as young as she was . she left us special memories , we shall always remember her . ||| akamenya kuririmba akamenya kukunda abantu ari mutoya ni ... tuumva ko tumufite ikintu cyo kumwibuka cyane .
the other children had a more quiet spirit . ||| urebye abandi bari bafite caractere isa nk' icecetse ,
however , she was different , she was more noisy . it was easy to forget she was just a child looking at her ability to reason like an adult . ||| ariko we yari eveillee [ afungutse mu mutawe ] ... cyane yari umuntu uzi ... ubona ko utamufata nk' umwana ,
no one considered her to be young . ||| n' ibitekerezo bye ukaumva ko utamufata nk' umwana .
but , she died so young ; she was only ten years old . ||| kandi yapfuye afite imyaka mike , yapfuye afite imyaka icumi kusa .
if you were going to remember only one thing about your mother , what would it be ? ||| uwakubaza nk' ikintu kimwe wibukiraho mama wawe , uvuga ikihae ?
what i remember about my mother ... is the advice she used to give all types of people . ||| ikintu nkuibukairho maman cyane ... cyane ni ... ni ukujya inama . nvuga ngo @:
and that was why most people liked her . she was humble and able to give people advice . ||| elle etait conseillere de tout le monde [ yari umujyanama w' abantu bose ] nicyo abantu benshi bamukundiraaga , kuko yacaishaga make , akashobora kujya inama cyane .
i guess that is the one thing i recall . ||| numva aricyo ngicyo .
did you see it happen ? ||| none se ibyo urabibonye biba ?
yes , i saw it . because we were together when they took them . and killed them in our presence . ||| yes ! ibyo byo nrabibonye kuko babatwaye turi kumwe , babica tubona ...
what happened ? ||| bibaye bite ?
on the 7th of april 1994 , it was during the holidays ... i remember i was with mum coming from the market . ||| mukihae cyo ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane [ 7 /04 /1994 ] , turi turi mu kiruhuko , turi muri vacance . nibuka ko hari igihe nri nvuye ku isoko ,
then she told me that ... meanwhile she had read a certain newspaper . ||| ndi kumwe na mama , aranbwira ati ... ibyo ari byo byose yari amaze kusoma ikinya ... hari ikinyamakuru yari amaze kusoma . aranbwira ati :
then she said , "@ horrible things are going to suddenly happen in rwanda . @" ||| "@ ariko mu rwanda hashobora kuba hagiye kuba ibintu bibi cyane tutari tuiteze . @"
then she talked to her friend called xaverine who is still alive today . then we passed by the market and brought a few things , then went back home . ||| avugana n' undi muntu uri inshuti ye witwaga savera , ariko n' ubu aracyariho baraganira . tunyura ku isoko tugura ibyo tuguraaga turataha ... ... tutega imodoka turataha .
she went telling me how bad the situation was . ||| agenda anbwira ukuntu ibintu bimeze .
but we were not prepared for anything like what happened . then on the 7th [ around the 4th ] on the 7th ... that is when ... [ after habyarimana 's plane crashed ] it began at night . ||| ubwo ntitubiitegaaga ariko ku itariki zirindwi [ ubwo hari mu matariki nk' ane ] , ku itariki zirindwi niho [ indege ya habyarimana nyine imaze kuhanuka ] . tutangiye mu ijoro ,
we heard them talking in the bedroom [ our parents ] they woke us up and said , "@ wake @-@ up , things are not good . @" ||| tutangira kaumva bavuga bari mu cyumba ababyeyi bacu . barabyuka baravuga bati : "@ nimubyukae ibintu ntibimeze neza ,
they tunned on the foreign news and heard it being said in both french and english . ||| " batangira kaumva amaradio y' amanyamahanga , babiumva mu gifaransa no mu cyongereza .
then we asked them what was taking place , they told us not to worry , but bad things were likely to happen in this country . ||| tubabaza uko bimeze , baratubwira bati @: "@ mwigira ubwoba ariko hashobora kuba hatagiye kuba ibintu byiza muri iki gihugu . @"
in the morning we heard that our neighbour had been killed . ||| hanyuma mu gitondo niho tuumvise umuntu w' umuturanyi , turi tuturanye ,
then mum sent us to a certain person who was selling ... in the neighbourhood , he was also a tutsi . ||| bavuga ngo baramwishe . mama aratubwira ati @: ... atutumaho umuntu ucuruzaaga hafi y' iwacu , yumvaaga ko agomba kuica ari umututsi aravuga ati @:
she told us to go and tell him that he should close his shop because things had deteriorated . ||| "@ mugendae mumunbwiraire ko ibintu bikomeye , afungae . @"
he was running a bar . ||| yari afite akabari .
and on our way as we were going to tell him , we met people going to kill others . ||| hanyuma tugiye kumubwira tuhura n' abantu bariho bajya kuica abantu ,
we ran back home and never said anything . ||| turagaruka ntitugira icyo tuvuga .
that was when the war had really started ; people started to kill . ||| ariko mu by' ukuri ... ubwo intambara niho yari itangiye , batangira kuica abantu .
at home they came to kill on the 12th . ||| twebwe mu rugo iwacu bahishe ku itariki cumi n' ebyiri . ku tariki cumi n' ebyiri niho baje ,
they first protected us ; some people were willing to protect us . ||| bari babanje kuturinda , tubona abantu baravuga ngo @: bazaturinda @:
"@ nothing will happen to you @"@ , they promised . ||| twebwe nta kintu bazatutwara .
but people from different areas were saying that if our family was still alive , then no tutsi was dead , then the inyenzi were still alive . ||| ariko abantu bakaturuka hirya no hino , bavuga ngo @: "@ niba urugo rw' iwacu rutarapfa abatutsi ntibarapfa , inyenzi ntizirapfa ... @"
later we were attacked by groups from gisenyi ... they headed towards our home . ||| hanyuma tuza kubona ibitero biturutse i gisenyi biza bitusanga mu rugo ,
they could n't believe we were still alive . ||| bibaza ukuntu tutarapfa mbese batabiumva .
therefore , they fought those who were protecting us ... the soldiers and interahamwe who used to come home would tell us who else they had killed and in what way they had killed them ... @" mum would constantly comfort us saying , "@ do n't be scared . ||| hanyuma bashobora kurwana n' abantu bari bahari bashaka kuturinda , b' abasirikare n' interahamwe , ariko bakajya baba mu rugo batubwira bati @: " tuishe kwa kanaka ,
even if you die , several people have died too , do n't be afraid . ||| tubaishe gutya , " ariko cyane cyane nravuga nka mama niwe ututeguraaga . akatubwira ati @: "@ ntimugirae ubwoba .
that would just mean that all the tutsi were meant to die . maybe if you survive you might suffer . ||| niyo mwapfa , hapfuye abantu benshi , ntimugirae ubwoba , ubwo araba ari ukuvuga ngo nta mututsi ugomba kusigara .
so do n't be afraid , all people in this area have died , we are the only ones remaining ... @" they were protecting us and stopping us from fleeing telling us that we should n't go anywhere and that we should just stay there . ||| n' iyo mwasigara mwasigara nabi . ati @: ntimugirae ubwoba abantu bose bapfuye muri iyi quartier nitwae tusigaye twenyine ... @" uraumva baraturinze batubuza no kuhunga , ngo nitugume aho .
then later , after the attack of the 12th of april 1994 left us alive , on the 14th of april 1994 ... meanwhile they had come home and said that all the boys should come out . ||| hanyuma igitero cyo kuri cumi n' ebyiri [ 12/04/1994 ] kitusize , kuri cumi n' enye [ 14/04/1994 ] ... ariko mu rugo bari bamaze kuza , baravuga bati @: abahungu bose nibavemo ,
but my older brother was not there ; together with other cousins who lived at home , they had taken them to hide in the ceiling of other people 's house . ||| musaza wanjye mukuru ntiyari ahari , n' abantu tubanaaga b' aba cousins bacu [ babyara bacu ] barabafata babajyana ahandi hantu bakajya baba mu maplafond .
therefore , they did n't find any ... they only found my parents and i plus the young ones , who had come to hide at home thinking that we would be protected . ||| noneho icyo kihae bahasanze nta mu ... hari ababyeyi kusa , hari nnjyae . n' abandi bantu bato ... n' abandi bari bahungiye iwacu bibaza ngo bazaturinda .
on the 14th is when the group of attackers ran after us and searched for us in all corners where we were hiding . ||| hanyuma kuri cumi n' enye , nibwo igitero kije kiratuirukankaan kiratushaka aho turi turi hose ,
we fled but they followed us and found us . ||| turahunga baratushaka baratubona ,
i myself hid under the bed . they even hit me with a club on my ribs while they were searching for me . ||| ba ... njyewe ngiye ahantu munsi y' igitanda banankubita ikintu cy' ubuhairi bariho bashakisha ... mu rubavu .
then i decided to get out . ||| nravuga nti @:
i had realised that they may kill me inside there . we came out . ||| reka nvaemo ,
they ran after my young sisters . they were young and they were screaming . they took my parents . ||| kuko nri maze kaumva ko ubwo bagiye kunyiciramo n' iki ... tuvamo ba ... barumuna banjye barabairukankaan bari abana batoya ba criya [ crier ] bavuza induru ... hanyuma bafata ababyeyi banjye ... ntibatuha umwanya .
then they said , "@ everyone is dead , you are the only ones remaining , yet you are the top inyenzi [ cochroaches ] " then they killed them . ||| baravuga bati @: "@ abantu bose barashize nimawe mwari musigaye , muri inyenzi nkuru ,
mum said goodbye to us before they left . ||| " ba ... barabica . ariko mama agiye kugenda aratusezera .
we asked them to let us say goodbye to them but they never let us say goodbye to dad . ||| turavuga tuti @: reka tusezerae , ntibatumye ubwo tusezera kuri papa ,
but we got to say goodbye to our mum . ||| ariko tusezeye kuri mama ,
then mum told us , "@ be strong . @" ||| mama aratubwira ati @: "@ muzakomerae . @"
and the way she told us , "@ nothing will ever happen to you . ||| ikintu kitutangaje ni uko yatubwiye ngo @: "@ ntacyo muzaba mwebwe , ngo @:
you have several relatives in burundi and in kigali . ||| hari abavandimwe banyu bari i burunri hari n' abandi bose bari i kigali hirya no hino ,
you shall live with them with no problem and nothing will happen to you @" still surprises me today . ||| muzabanae nabo nta kibazo .
the only thing she told us is to be strong . ||| ati ntacyo muzaba ... @" ikintu yatubwiye yaratubwiye ngo @: "@ muzabae abagabo ,
we said goodbye to her and then we left . ||| " turamusezera turagenda . ubwo rero bo baravuga bati @:
then they said , "@ we will n't kill you , we only want to kill old chockroaches . ||| "@ ntabwo mwe tubica turashaka kuica inyenzi nkuru ,
the rest of you can leave . @" ||| bati hanyuma abandi nimugendae . @"
we were taken to a certain old man 's house but there were several other interahamwe . ||| batushyira ku muntu w' umusaza , ariko hari n' abandi bantu b' interahamwe ,
they told those interahamwe to keep an eye on us , "@ these kids should not leave this place , we shall kill them later ! @" they were back on the 15thof april 1994 . ||| barabaturindaish baravuga bati @: "@ aba bana nibava hano tuzabica . @"
the interahamwe had spent the whole night watching us ; they abused us , bragging about how they had killed people and some of them [ the people they killed ] were our relatives . in the morning they came to get our sisters . ||| baza kuza ku itariki cumi n' eshanu [ 15/04/1994 ] interahamwe zaraye ziturarairiye , batutuka , bavuga uko baishe abantu ... abavandimwe bacu n' iki ... bukeye mu gitondo baza kufata barumuna bacu ,
they said , "@ you , you look older , killing you would require some energy . @" therefore , they took our sisters and killed them . ||| baravuga ngo @: twebwe ngo @: tubarushya ngo @: turi bakuru n' iki ... hanyuma barabafata barabica ,
poor kids , all the way they went saying goodbye to us , "@ bye bye ... we wish you a good life and may god help you ... @" it was surprising to see them talking to us as though they knew we would actually survive for everyone [ tutsi ] was entitled to die . ||| abana bagenda batusezera , bati @: "@ murabeho muzabaeho neza , imaan izabafashe ... @" mbese wagirango bari bazi ko ahubwo tuzanabaho ,
i really wonder why they said words like such as ‘ we wish you a long , good life ’ . ||| kuko buri wese kuri ukupfa , ntinzi impamvu wenda bo bashoboraaga kutusezera bavuga ngo @: muzabaeho ngo muzagirae kutae ... hanyuma ,
later we left that place when we realized that they wanted to separate me from my brother . ||| tu ... tuva ... tuvuye ahongaho batangiye kuvuga ko bashaka kuzantwara bakantandukanya na musaza wanjye ,
they were planning to take me to congo and do with me ... we bribed someone and then he helped us escape at night . ||| bakazanjyana muri congo bakazagira kutae ... tuza kugira ... tuza kuha umuntu amafaranga , aratucikaish ari ninjoro . umwe akajya agenda nk' ugiye kuri toilette [ ku musaraane ] n' undi kuri toilette ,
we left as though we were going for a short call , one by one and then we all left . ||| turagenda .
we walked so much that it seemed as though we had walked around the whole of rwanda , in gitarama , in gikongoro and maybe in cyangugu as well . most of the time we used to walk at night . ||| turagiye tusa nk' aho twazungurutse hafi u rwanda rwose , za kitaarama ... za gikongoro ntinzi ubanza n' i cyangugu turahageze kuko kenshi tugendaaga ninjoro .
i guess ... for us to survive , we went through several hardships ; it would take too long to talk about everything one by one . ||| nraumva ... tuza kurokoka ... tunyuze mu bikomeye nraumva kubisubiramo ahari biba ikibazo .
we went through many things , we were starving most of the time , we spent nights in the bush . ||| tunyuze muri byinshi , tuishwe n' inzara , turaye mu bihuru ,
we used to get somewhere and fail to find ... i remember once in the forest , we had no idea where we were , neither which province it was . ||| hari igihe tugeraaga ahantu tukabura ikintu ... tukabu ... turi nko mu ishyamba , nraibuka hariho igihe tuigeze kugera mu ishyamba ntituzi aho ariho ,
then we suddenly heard hyenas . we got into the forest ; we did n't seem to know whether we wanted to get in or out of it . ||| ntituzi ngo ni muyihae province [ ntara ] . tuumva impyisi , tuinjiye mu ishyamba tunanirwa kusohoka tunanirwa no kuinjira .
then we heard the hyenas squealing and heading towards us , wanting to bite us . we slept there and were rained on . ||| hanyuma tuumva impyisi ziza zihuma zishaka kuturya n' iki ... turyama ahongaho imvura ikatunyagira ,
we used to hide at day time and spend the night walking . ||| ku manywa tukairirwa tuihishe ninjoro tukagenda ,
i was with my brother called freddy . ||| nri ndi kumwe na musaza wanjye witwa freddy .
i guess that is it . ||| nraumva ari ibyo .
do you know how your parents died ? ||| uba uzi uburyo ababyeyi bawe baishwe ?
my parents were hit with clubs to death . ||| ababyeyi banjye babaicishije ... babaicishije amahiri .
after killing them , they threw their bodies outside and cursed them . ||| babaicishije amahiri . barabaishe babata ku gasozi , babavugairho amagambo menshi cyane ,
later that evening my brother went and covered them with some soil with the help of someone else . ||| nyuma ku mugoroba musaza wanjye n' undi muntu umwe , baragenda barabafata babarenzaho ibitaka . kubera ko bari babatayeho ku gasozi .
did you witness ... did you see the interahamwe carrying out their killings ? ||| wigeze ubona n' amaso yawe interahamwe zaica abantu ?
i saw the interahamwe killing people . ||| nbonye interahamwe zaica abantu .
we experienced the war for quite a long time , not just one or two months . ||| tubaye ... twebwe tubaye mu ntiambara igihe kinini , kitari ukwezi kumwe , kitari n' abiri .
from the 7th of april 1994 to the 1st of august 1994 , we were going through the war because we were still running away . ||| kuko kuva ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane [ 7/04/1994 ] kugera ku itariki ya mbere y' ukwezi kwa munani [ 1/08/1994 ] twe turi tukiri mu ntiambara , kuko turiho tuirukanka .
we witnessed the interahamwes murdering many people . ||| interahamwe zaicaaga abantu tubona .
some were shot down and some were beaten up with clubs and we saw it all happening . ||| zibarasa , abandi zikabakubita amahiri , tubibona .
we sometimes had to jump over dead bodies as we were running away . we could at times reach a roadblock and they would tell us to go away with the hope that we would be killed on the next one . ||| akenshi tukasimbuka abapfu tukagenda , tukagera kuri bariyeri , bakica abantu . twebwe tuka ... bakatubwira bati @:
in other cases we were able to somehow escape . ||| "@ nimujyae inberae muicwae n' abandi , cyangwa tukabacika .
i saw many of them killing people . ||| twa ... nrababonye benshi bica abantu .
can you describe for me anything very dificult ... can you discribe for me , the ... just one of those things you saw that stays very strongly in your mind and maybe ... no. before you do that , what was going though your mind ? ||| ushobora kunbwira ikintu kikomeye kikusigaye mu buengae ... mbese ntashaka kuvuga ikintu kimwe mu bintu bikomeye ubonye bitajya bikuvamo . ariko mbere banza unbwirae , ni kutae wiyumvaga kiriya kihae ?
was it fear , was it survival , what happened during that time ... what were you thinking ... what were you feeling ? ||| ese uri ufite ubwoba bwinshi , cyangwa wiyumvagamo kuzarokoka ... muri wowe icyo kihae biri bimeze kutae ? gerageza ubitubwirae .
during genocide , we spent two weeks very frightened ... for a week we were so terrified . ||| mukihae cya jenoside , tumaze ibyumweru bibiri tufite ubwoba bwinshi ... tumaze icyumweru tufite ubwoba bwinshi cyane .
and after we saw our parents being killed , our sisters and other people ... when we realized that all people were finished . ||| ariko aho tumaze kubona bamaze kuica ababyeyi , baishe abavandimwe , tubona abantu bose bashize .
all the fear disappeared . the only problem remaining was why you did n't die with the rest . ||| nta ... nta muntu usigaye , ikintu kisa ... cy' ubwoba kisa nk' ikikuvuyemo . ukibaza ahubwo impamvu utapfuye .
i remember this man called nyarusenge who came and told me he wanted to help me flee so i would n't die ; he said he was going to take my brother somewhere else . ||| nraibuka hari igihe umuntu yaje ... yitwaaga niyonsenga nrabiibuka , aranbwira ngo @: arashaka kunjyana ngo akampungana , ngo @:
i was still very young but i could understand that he either wanted me to become his wife or he had in mind to rape me . ||| ntinzapfae , ngo musaza wanjye nawe ngo bakareba aho bamujyana . kandi icyo kihae nri muto , ariko nkaumva ko muri gahunda ze ashaka nko kungira umugore ,
he had a club they called nta mpongano y' umwanzi [ a spiked club ] . ||| cyangwa se ashaka nko kumviyora [ ku nfata ku ngufu ] . ntinzi ... yari afite ubuhairi hari ubwo baitaaga ‘ nta mpongano y' umwanzi ’ , ubuhairi buri bufite imisumari .
he asked me to enter the house and wait for him . ||| hanyuma aranbwira ngo ... aranbwira ngo @: "@ ninjye mu nzu ngo aransanga yo , ngo nininjire munzu iwe . @"
i was so hurt ! ||| numva biranbabaje cyane .
what shows that all fear was gone is the way i replied him so rudely , "@ i can not do that ! @" ||| ikintu kikuereka ko ubwoba buri burashize , ni uko nmubwiye nabi cyane . nramubwira nti @:
i think that 's the reason why we left that place ... when we realized that things were going so wrong . ||| ibyo ntinshobora kubiemera ... ... ni nacyo kintu urebya kitumye tuva ahongaho , turi turi . kuko turi tuumvise ko ibintu bikomeye ,
they were saying that they would come to rape me . ||| bavuga ko bashobora no kuza kumviyora [ kunfata ku ngufu ] n' iki ... musaza wanjye abiumvise ,
when my brother heard about that ... i was scared about that ... we decided to go and be killed elsewhere . ||| nnjyae ubwanjye bimaze kuntera ubwoba , turavuga tuti @: "@ tujyae kugwa ahandi . @"
during the genocide , i was n't scared most of the time . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo igihe cya jenoside jyae nri nrashize ubwoba ku bwanjye .
i told him , "@ if you feel like killing me then just go ahead and kill me . ||| njyewe nramubwiye nti @: "@ uraumva ushaka kunyica ngo unyicae ?
my parents are now dead , they were educated people , they had degrees ... you were among the attackers who came to kill them yet you once lived together , they once fed you , you were friends . ||| ababyeyi banjye barize , bapfuye bafite diplome [ impamyabushobozi ] , bapfa barabanye nawe bapfa barakugaburiye , uza mu gitero cyo kubica ,
and now you want to use me in any way of your wish . @" ||| urabanye nabo . none uraumva ko njyewe ushaka kunfata uko ushaka .
i went on and told him , "@ i 'd rather be killed than becoming your wife or fleeing with you . @" ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ aho kugirango mbe umugore wawe , cyangwa mpungane nawe , unyica . @"
he entered the house , very angry saying that he had the rights to kill me . ||| ajya mu nzu afite umujinya mwinshi cyane , anbwira ngo @: "@ afite uburenganzira bwo kunyica . @"
then i asked him that , "@ why do n't you kill me ? @" ||| nravuga nti @: "@ ko utanyica se ? @"
he just kept quiet and left . ||| arabiihorera aragenda ,
but they were waiting for the nightfall to kill us . ||| ubwo bari bategereje kutugirair nabi ninjoro .
it could even be that they were thinking of other ways of mistreating me or both of us . ||| ahari bagiye kureba ubundi bugomae bunri bari buze kunkorera , cyangwa baza kutukorera ,
i was with my brother . ||| njyae nri ndi kumwe na musaza wanjye .
but god helped us and and we left in the morning . ||| hanyuma imaan iratufasha tuzinduka tugiye ,
they never found us . ||| baratubura .
it shows that in reality , we were n't scared . ||| kikuereka ko nta bwoba umuntu yari afite mu by' ukuri .
by then , all fear was gone . ||| nta ... icyo kihae bwo nta bwoba turi tufite .
can you discribe for me just ... just something you saw during that time , which really stayed in your mind as the most terrible , the most difficult moment ? ||| ushobora kunbwira ikintu kikomeye ubonye , ikintu kibi ... kibi cyane , kitajya kikuva mu buengae [ mu bitekerezo ] .
the one thing that still hurts so much is the way my sisters were killed . ||| ikintu kinbabaza cyane , ni ukuntu baishe barumuna banjye .
it 's maybe understandable that my parents were killed because they were tutsis and they were even maybe contributing in helping out the inkotanyis , they were adults and responsible for the actions but my sisters were just kids ! ||| numva ababyeyi kuba yenda barabaishe babaziza ko ari abatutsi ; ko wenda se bakotizaga mu nkotanyi ; cyangwa se iki ... ko bari bakuru wenda bavuga bati @: "@ mwazize icyo mwumva mwari muzi . @"
but what about young children were just screaming ? ||| ariko nk' abana bato bariraga ,
i can still recall the way the last @-@ born was crying . ||| nraibuka nka cadette umuhorerezi wo mu rugo ,
they carried her and told her that my mother had gone for a meeting and that that was where they were taking . ||| kuko baramufashe bamuteruye aravuga ngo @: bamushyiriye mama we . kuko yajyaaga avuga ngo @: "@ mama yagiye muri reunion [ inama ] ,
my mother used to go for meetings and she would bring for them biscuits or anything else they wanted and so they told her that that 's where my mom had gone . ||| iyo mama yavaaga mu nama [ kera iyo abarimu bajyaaga kuhembaw bavugaaga ko bagiye mu nama ] bajyaaga ba ... yabazaniraaga ama biscuits , akabazani ... mbega icyo baumvaaga bashaka cyose akaza akizanye , noneho bakamubwira ko ariho yagiye .
what i am saying is that what hurts the most is the way children were murdered in the genocide . ||| bishaka kaumvaish ko abana ... nbabazaw n' ukuntu abana bapfuye muri jenoside . nta kintu bazi ,
they did n't even know the meaning of "@ inkotanyi @" and they acussed them of being "@ inkotanyi . @" they did n't know what the word "@ inyenzi @" meant . they did n't know whether they were hutu or tutsi . ||| batazi inkotanyi ngo n' iki ? kuko bazize ngo ni inkotanyi , batazi ngo inyenzi n' iki ... ? batazi niba ari n' abahutu cyangwa se ngo niba ari abatutusi ... ,
sometimes i do n't understand it ! ||| ku buryo binanira kubiumva .
those people must have been extremely cruel to do such a thing ! ||| nicyo kintu nbona ko abantu bari abagome bikabije ,
killing an innocent child , who does not belong to any political party , who knows nothing ! ||| kaumva wica umwana atazi n' icyo azira . nta shyaka ... nta kintu azi .
that is the only thing ... that comes back to me . ||| nicyo cyonyine ... ikintu kingarukamo ,
i was never cry when memories of the genocide come back to me ... the image of the death of our kids .. whenever i recall it , i feel so much pain . ||| sinegeze nrizaw n' ibya jenoside ariko kenshi iyo image ... iryo shusho ry' abana bo mu rugo uko bapfuye , iyo nbiumvise kenshi numva ... numva binbabaje cyane .
rosette , what does it mean for you , being a survivor ? ||| rosette , kuri wowe kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu rya jenoside , wunva bivuze iki ?
personally , knowing that i am a survivor ... the fact that i survived makes me feel good because i realize that god helped us . ||| ku bwanjye , nko kuvuga ngo ndi umu rescape ... nrasigaye , numva binshimaishije kuko numva ko imaan yaturinze ,
it pleases me so much because so many people died . i strongly believe there a reason why god saved us . ||| nkaiishima cyane kuko benshi barapfuye nkaumva ko ifite icyo yadushigarije .
to me , being a survivor ... is to have the responsibility to stand in the position of the people who died . ||| ariko kuri njyae kuba uri uwarokotse , ni uko numva ko nfite nvuga ‘ objectif ’ [ intego ] yo kuba muri place y' abantu ... yo kuba mu mwanya w' abantu bose bapfuye .
what do i mean ? ||| ni ukuvuga ngo @:
i have to be my mum , my dad , my sisters and try to be complete . ||| nkaba mama , nkaba papa , nkaba abavandimwe ,
i have to try and be in their position . ||| nkaumva nrauzuye . nkagerageza kuba mu myanya yabo ,
i mean , i have to do what i am meant to do , go to school and study and finish my studies , i have to work . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo kukora ibyo ngomba kukora niba ari ukuiga ni ukuiga . niba aribyo kukora n' ibyo kukora ,
if it is to be a sociable person ... i would n't want to hear people saying that my parents left no one behind , or that we are irresponsible . ||| kubaan n' abantu , ariko nkaumva ko , nta uvuga ngo @: "@ kanaka yasize ubusa yasize abana b' ibirara se ,
i would n't give a chance to those who thought that they exterminated my family to find us in a shameful position . ||| yasize abantu batazagira icyo bifasha ... @" ku buryo wenda n' ababaishe babonaaga ko bamaze umuryango , ariko aramutse akubonye ,
i can n't find the right way to express it . ||| nibaza ko akubonye uri umuntu ... ntabwo nvuga kuihagararaho yenda ntinzi nka terme [ imvugo ] nziza ... ariko nvuga ngo akubonye uri umuntu w' umugabo .
standing in the position of both your parents and your siblings who died , being a man is a big responsability . ||| uhagaze mu mwanya w' ababyeyi n' uw' abavandimwe ,
and , i think it is everybody 's resposibility . ||| ukabihagararamo kigabo , numva nta ... numva ko ari ikintu kikomeye cyane . numva ko ari inshingano ya buri wese .
to stand in the position of those who are gone . meaning that you do what they were supposed to do . although you are only one person , you try and do their work as well as yours . ||| kuba mu mwanya w' abadahari . ni ukuvuga ngo kukora ibyo bakagombye kukora uri umwe ukagerageza . ukabikora .
and after the genocide , how did you survive ? ||| hanyuma nagirango utubwirae nyuma ya jenoside .
who looked after you ... where did you go ... ? ||| ese ugiye he ?
what did you do ? ||| ese ubayeho utae ?
we tried looking for a family after the genocide ; many of the people we were living with had died . ||| nyuma ... nyuma ya jenoside , tugerageje kushakisha umuryango , abenshi tubanaaga barapfuye .
my mother 's family was completely decimated . only 5 out of more than 60 people survived ! ||| abo muri famille yo kwa mama , abo mu muryango wo kwa maman urashize , umuryango wo kwa mama w' abantu bari bageze nko kuri mirongo itandatu n' abandi hasigayemo abantu batarenze batanu .
in my father 's family seemed to be more ... but all those who were in rwanda during the genocide had been killed , nobody was left . ||| umuryango wo kwa papa niwo nvuga ngo ugerageza , ariko nabo abari bari mu rwanda bose barapfuye urebye .
only one aunt survived and very few cousins who are very young , our uncles also died . ||| nsigaraanye n' umutante [ masenge ] umwe , tusigaraan abantu bakeya b' aba cousins [ babyara bacu ] , abana , kuko ba data wacu barapfuye .
most of them were exhumed and reburied at gisozi . ||| abenshi bashyinguye gisozi ,
others ... almost the whole family was decimated . ||| abandi ... mbese urebye mu by' ukuri umuryango urashize .
the way we used to live with other people ... how our parents behaved around others is what helped us to live in their absence . ||| ubwo rero uko tubanye ... uko ababyeyi bacu babanye , nibyo urebye bitumye tubaho mu minsi batari bariho .
everybody who would see us , would say , "@ these are the children of so and so , they survived . @" ||| kuko umuntu wese utubonaaga yaravugaaga ati @: "@ dore abana bo kwa kanaka , bashoboye kurokoka . @"
and people were good to us , they helped us in completing our school education . ||| abantu batubanaiye neza bakatufasha mu kuiga , bakatufasha ... kuko ntituri tufite aho tuba ,
we did n't have anywhere to live , it once happened that we did not have where to live . ||| tuigeze kugira ikibazo kinini cyane cyo kugira aho tuba .
we led a horrible life but we tried our best . ||| ariko tubayeho bitari byiza ariko turagerageza ,
our parents lived well with others , we also had to do so . ||| kubera ko ababyeyi bacu bashoboye kubaan tubana nabo .
there is a certain family , that had remained in burundi ; when they came we lived with them . ||| hari umuryango uri urasigaye i burunri baraje turabana .
presently we are living with a certain lady who adopted us . ||| ariko ubungubu tubana n' umukecuru uri uratufashe ‘ en charge ’ [ utuishingaiye ] ubanye na mama ,
she had once lived with both my parents and we had known her for a long time . ||| tubanye kuva kera , abana na papa ;
unforfunately , she recently passed away . ||| ariko ubungubu by' ibyago nyine muri iyi minsi yarapfuye ,
now we are living with the family she left . ||| ubu turi mu rugo tubana n' umuryango yasize .
how many of your simblings survived ? who survived among your brothers and sisters ? ||| ni bangahe babashije kurokoka mubo muva inda imwe ?
in my immediate family , we were six and only two survived ; my older brother and i. ||| mu ... mubo tuvukana , tuvukanaaga turi batandatu , harokotse babiri . ni njyewe na musaza wanjye mukuru .
what do you think about the future ... what kind of future do you see ? ||| utekereza kutae ejo hazaza ? ubona ejo hazaza hazaba hameze kutae ?
the way i think about the future ... i think it will be good . ||| njyewe uko nbona igihe kizaza , ntekereza ko ari kiza . ubundi kuri njyae nbona ko ari kiza ,
in my opinion , the future is promising ; the future will be better than the past [ i mean after the genocide ] . ||| nbona kiruta icyashize . ni ukuvuga ngo nyuma ya jenoside .
because before the genocide things were the other way round ; everything in life was like milk and honey . ||| kuko mbere ya jenoside ho biri ibindi . tubonaaga ari amata n' ubuki .
but after the genocide until today , one can believe ... in most cases , the citizens still depend on the government . ||| ariko ubu nyuma ya jenoside kugera ubu , nbona ko umuntu ashobora kugira ikintu cyo kuizera , cyane cyane burya ubuzima bw' abaturage budepa ... bushingaiye kuri leta .
when i consider today 's leadership , i can say that their aim is to bring people together and stop divisions . they want to unite people . ||| kuko nbona uko ubuyobozi bw' ubu bumeze , bushaka kurair butavangura , bushaka kuhuza abantu ,
therefore , the future will be good to many people . ||| nbona mu by' ukuri igihe kiri inberae kishobora kuzaba kiza ku bantu benshi .
but i would n't want to ignore that some people will still find the future so disappointing ... because they were left with diseases , there are some children who never went to school yet they were able to study . ||| ariko ntinnirengagizae ko hari n' abantu kizabera kibi ... bibi cyane kuko hari abasigaraanye indwara . hari abana batashoboye kujya ku ishuri yenda bari kuzabishobora .
but to me , the future will be better than the past [ i mean straight after the genocide ] . ||| igihe kizaza kuri jyae ntekereza ko kizaba kiza kurusha ikishize ni ukuvuga ngo nyuma ya jenoside kubera ko akenshi ,
because one had not yet defined the right path to go through . ||| umuntu yari atarabona umurongo agendairmo .
personally i was lucky . ||| nkanjyae kuri njyae ngize amahirwe nraiga ,
i am educated ; i completed my secondary school and i have now completed university . ||| nrarangiza amashuri yisumbuye , nrangije na universite [ kaminuza ] .
and now i see that ... well , of course life is not totally based on education but i guess there is much i thought i would never be able to achieve that i have achieved , which i am glad i did . ||| ku buryo nbona ko ... yego ubuzima ntibushingair ku mashuri kusa , ariko ntekereza ko yenda ibyinshi ... ibyo ntekerezaaga ibyo ntekerezaaga ko ntazageraho , nshoboye kugeraho numva ko biba aribyo .
i guess the rest will go according to god 's plan and personally . ||| ibindi bisigaye numva ko biba ari gahunda y' imaan , ariko nnjyae ku bwanjye numva ko nzabiitwaramo neza . ariko nkavuga nti @:
i will emphasize on the fact that in many ways , people 's lives are dependent on the leadership . ||| n' ubuzima bw' abaturage bushingair cyane cyane ku miyoborere y' abantu .
people died due to a bad government . ||| kuko abantu bapfuye bazize leta .
if the government had done the right thing , people would n't have died . ||| iyo leta ibiitwaramo neza , abantu ntibaba barapfuye .
thanks to the plan that today 's government 's has , many people have the hope of living and this reassures me that the future will be good . ||| nbona gahunda leta ifite ubungubu , iha ikaizerae abantu benshi cyo kubaho . ku buryo numva ko igihe kizaza mu by' ukuri kizaba kiza .
i am not forgetting that some people will have a bad life in the future . i am not saying that things will be like milk and honey [ a good life ] for all people . ||| ariko ntiirengagije ko hari n' abandi bantu banri bazagira ubuzima bubi , ntinvuga ngo ibintu byose n' amata n' ubuki ku bantu bose .
i always think about people who were infected with hiv @/@ aids during the genocide ... very young kids who were two or three years old then who never experienced parental care . ||| nibaza nk' abantu basigaiyew sida na jenoside baaka ... abana bari bakiri bato , bafite imyaka itatu ... ibiri bataigeze babona urukundo rw' ababyeyi ,
today they are not well cattered for in orphanages . others live on the streets , they are cattered for by passers @-@ by . they move from house to house . ||| bakareraw nabi mu nzu z' imfubyi . bakaba munsi y' imihanda , bakareraw n' umuhisi n' umugenzi , bakava mu rugo bajya mu rundi ,
i think that may have some negative impact on their future lives . ||| nibaza ko nabyo bizagira ikintu cy' ingaruka itoroshye ku buzima bwabo bw' inyuma .
i guess i was lucky because i got a chance of having parents and they prepared me . ||| yenda njyae ngize amahirwe yo kubona ababyeyi barantegura ,
and now i guess i have a foundation . i tend to think that i will never have to face plenty of problems [ as i did in the past ] to be sincere . ||| ku buryo wenda numva ko basae [ urufatiro ] nyifite . mbese numva ko ibyo aribyo byose nta kibazo nzagira cyane . mu by' ukuri .
rosette , is it possible to forgive the people who committed these crimes ? ||| rosette , wowe ubona bishoboka kubabarira abantu bakoze buriya bwicanyi ?
it is not possible for one to forget his or her people . ||| ntibishoboka ko umuntu yakuibagirwa abe .
that 's impossible . ||| ibyo byo ni ibidashoboka .
even wise men say that forgetting is a form of sickness . ||| ngirango n' abahanga bavuga ko kuibagirwa ari indwara .
forgetting what happened in one 's life ... for example there is no way i can forget that i had no parents . ||| noneho kuibagirwa rero ibyakubayeho ... nk' ubu ntinkuibagirwa ko nta babyeyi nfite .
sincerely i can not believe that i was born from a tree ! ||| ntinvuga ngo nvutse ku giti mu by' ukuri .
i can never forget that i once had sisters just because i do n't see them anymore ! ||| ntinkuibagirwa ko nri nfite abavandimwe ,
i often see children of their age who used to go to school with them and who are now finishing secondary school . ||| kuko simbabona . kenshi njya nbona nk' abo banganaaga , nkabona barangije secondaire , biganaaga mu mashuri amwe ,
there 's a lot that reminds me of them ! ||| ni byinshi bikuibutsa .
it is simply impossible to forget . ||| ariko kuibagirwa byo ntibishoboka . ntibishoboka .
we can never forget ! ||| ntabwo tushobora kuibagirwa .
do you think that you have had justice for your parents and your sisters ? ||| ese ku bwawe utekereza ko habayeho ubutabera ku babyeyi n' abavandimwe bawe ?
has justice been done to your parents ? ||| ku bwawe ubona ubutabera burakoze akazi kabwo ku buryo bukwiriye ?
i would say that justice ... justice is needed . ||| nvuga ngo ubutabera ... ubutabera bwo ni ngombaw .
the victims of the genocide were innocent . ||| ariko ku bantu bapfuye bazize jenoside , bazize akarengaane .
my parents , my friends and relatives ... i really believe that justice needs to take action . ||| nk' ababyeyi banjye ; inshuti ; abavandimwe . numva koko ubutabera bukwiriye kubaho .
it is hard to find the right words to say it ... umh nothing can bring them back , that is impossible . ||| kusa wunva utabona uko ubivuga . umh ... nta kishobora kubakarura , icyo ntikishoboka .
some people killed others ... let 's say there are several people who killed others in the history of the world , but they were killing people with whom they did n't have anything in common . ||| abantu baishe abantu ... yenda tuvugae ko hari abantu baishe abandi mu mateka y' isi , ariko yenda badahuje batafite icyo bahuraiyeho .
but rwandans killed each others while in reality , they were brothers and sisters ! ||| ariko nk' abanyarwanda bicanye ari abavandimwe mu by' ukuri .
therefore , you can never find the appropriate punishment to exercise on them . death is not a punishment . ||| kaumva ko ubona icyo uhanaish umuntu ho wunva ko kitahari . urupfu ubwarwo wunva atari igihano .
neither is imprisonment . i guess people should be sensitized and there should be justice . ||| kufungwa ubwabwo wunva atari igihano . mu by' ukuri , jyae numva abantu bakwaiye kuigishwa . ubutabera bukabaho ,
and the law should determine the kind of punishments to be given so that people will learn that human rights should be respected . ||| igihano baumva batanga mu mategeko kikabaho , kugirango abantu babonae ko uburenganzira bw' umuntu wese bugomba kubahairizaw . ari umwana , ari umukecuru ,
be it a child or an old woman or an old man , be it a hutu or a tutsi , be it a foreigner or any other person , as long as blood is shed , nobody should be killed when they are innocent ! ||| ari umusaza , ari umuhutu , ari umututsi , ari umunyamahanga ,
and justice needs to be there . ||| ari umuntu awo ariwe wese , ko ava amaraso , ko ntawe ukwiriye kupfa azize ubusa . ubutabera bwo bugomba kubaho .
not only in rwanda , i would request for justice in the whole world . ||| atari no mu rwanda , njyae numva nbusabair n' isi yose .
because justice is needed . ||| ko bukwiriye kubaho ,
people should n't die innocently . ||| abantu ntibapfae bazira ubusa .
my very last question . ||| ndagirango nkubaze ikibazo kinyuma ,
do you think that genocide is possible here again ? ||| ubona bishoboka ko jenoside yakaongera ikabaho mu rwanda ?
i hope genocide will never happen again in rwanda . ||| nfite ikaizerae ko jenoside itazaongera kubaho mu rwanda .
i guess the ideology that rwanda has now , together with the lessons people learnt from killing one another , really people ... i do n't think it will ever happen again . ||| nbona ko ingengabitekerezo [ ideologie ] y' u rwanda rufite , nkabona n' isomo abantu bakuye mu kuica abandi , mu by' ukuri abantu ... nta ... bitakaongera kubaho .
i believe we experienced it , we unfortunately experienced it . ||| ntawe numva ko tubibayemo , tugize ibyago byo kubibamo ,
i think we have a task of teaching people how to respect each other . ||| nibaza ko tufite inshingano zikomeye zo kuigisha abantu kaubaha abandi .
i mean , if everyone respects human rights , then there would be no genocide again . ||| uburenganzira bw' abandi . ni ukuvuga ngo uburenganzira bwa buri muntu wese nibushobora kubahairizaw , nta jenoside izaongera kubaho mu by' ukuri .
and even now i believe there will be no genocide again . ||| kandi n' ubu nizeye ko itazasubira .
i said that was my last question but i have one more question . ||| reka noneho nkubaze akabazo gato kanyuma na nyuma ,
what kind of person are you after this ? ||| nyuma y' ibyo byose uri umuntu ki ?
are you hopeful , are you optimistic ... are you sad and unhapppy ? who is rosette ? ||| ese uri umuntu wizera ejo hazaza heza ; uhora se unezerewe ... rosette ni inde ?
[ she smiles . ] today i am a very happy person , that 's who i have always been for those who know me . ||| [ araseka ] kuri ubu ngirango ni nako nhoze ahari , yenda abanzi . njyewe ndi umuntu uhora nishimye . imaan yampaye ibyishimo ,
i am free ; i am a very free person . ||| numva ko nta kibazo mu by' ukuri muri njyae , numva ko nisanzuye [ je suis libre ] ndi umuntu uri libre .
i do not constitute a burden to the rwandan society or to the people around me . i strongly believe that i will live long . ||| numva ko ntateye ikibazo muri societe . numva ntakagombye kuba ... numva ntari ikibazo cya societe y' u rwanda [ umuyango nyarwanda ] mu by' ukuri cyangwa se abo tubana .
i wish i ... i wish i would live a better life than this . ||| numva nfite ikaizerae cyo kubaho , numva nshaka kuza ... numva nshaka kuzabaho kurusha ukunguku .
i guess i mentionned it earlier that i would like to stand in the position of my parents , my friends and my sisters ; all those who died in the genocide . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo nbivuze kare ko nshaka kuba mu mwanya w' ababyeyi , inshuti , abavandimwe bose numva bazize jenoside .
i wish i would represent them . ||| numva nshaka kubahagararira . kubahagarira rero bisaba kuba uri undi muntu wunri . ugera kubyo nifuza ,
to represent them requires to be a different person , that 's my goal ... how can i say this ... [ she smiles ] ||| nraumva ntinzi uko nbivuga [ aramwenyura ] .
my name is mukundwa safi , i am 21 years old , and before the genocide we lived in kibuye , in the former commune of gitesi , currently known as karongi community , in the bwishyura sector , the sector kept its old name , bwishyura cellule . ||| nitwa umukunda safi nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe y' amavuko mbere ya genocide turi tutuye ku kibuye ahari icyo kihae yari komine gitesi ubu ni akarere ka karongi muri secteur yitwa bwishyura ngirango niko ikaitwa no muri cerile yitwa bwishyura

i was in kibuye when the genocide started , i was eight years old . ||| genocide yatangiye ndi ku kibuye nrinfite icyo kihae imyaka umunani .
could you give as an account of your experiences during the genocide and how you managed to survive ; could you in a few words recount how you lived through the genocide from its beginning and how it was carried out in your area of kibuye ? ||| mwatunyuriramo yenda mumagambo byo mwabaye muri iyo genocide nuburyo mwaje kurukoka , mwatunyuriramo mumagambo make uko mwabaye muri genocide nuko yatangiye nuko yashyizwe mubikorwa nko kukibuye aho mwari mutuye ?
the eighteenth of april , it was about two o'clock in the afternoon when three buses arrived with people singing and hanging on them , they were singing genocide songs ; the genocide songs that they sang at that time , those songs that you all know , they got off the buses and kept singing , for those who know the kibuye sports stadium , gatwaro is in a low laying area with hills on either sides , we were in the middle , then they started to shoot into the crowd . ||| cumi n' umunani z' ukwezi kwa kane nibwo hari nko muma saa munani nibwo haje ama bus atatu baza baririmba abantu biziritse kauma bus , baririmbango tubatsembatsembe za ndirimbo muzi zose bajyaaga barirmba icyo kihae bazivamo basimbuka cyane baririmba kuko stade abahazi kuri stade yo ku kibuye gatwaro iri hasi noneho hejuru hari umusozi no hirya hejuru hari umusozi batushyira hagati bakajya baturasamo .
one of my first terrible images of the genocide is one that always comes back to me , there was this man , who claimed to have become a hutu following some rwandan customs , he moved up towards the interahamwe on the gatwaro hill , when he got close enough one of them picked an axe and hit him splitting him open like firewood , they cut his body into two pieces and threw him back into the stadium . ||| image ya mbere ya genocide mbi nyine iri mubintu bijyaaga binyibutsa genocide hari umugabo umwe ngo yari yari hutuje muri bya binri by' amateka mubanyarwanda muzi arazamuka asa nuwegera izonterahamwe zari ziri kuri uwo musozi wa gatwaro abaegereye bahita bafata ishoka bahita bamwasa nkakuno basa inkwi bahita bamucamo kabiri intumbi bahita bayisunikairmo muri stade .
we continued in the forest until a point when the interahamwe came in with dogs , they brought dogs to hunt us and they were able to find some people , they would shout that they have seen someone and if you got scared and run then you would give yourself out and they would chase you and kill you . i know many people among my relatives who ran and they were chased and killed . ||| ubwo turakomeje tuguma ahongaho muriryo shyamba interahamwe ziza kuza ziraza zizanye n' imbwa imbwa ngo zituhigae nyine baraza bakajya bavumbura abantu nyine bakahagarara nka hariya bakavuza induru bati nguwo nguwo nguwo ugira ubwoba ukiruka baba batakubonye bakakuirukaho bakakuica nabantu benshi nrinzi abantu benshi bo muma famille bairukanka yakuirukanka bakamwirukaho bakamwica nizo imbwa zabo zituhiga nubwo buzima tubayeho muri iryo shyamba ariko twebwe ahantu turi turi ntabwo nzi icyatumye batatubona ,
we were in that forest but i do n't know why they were not able to see us ; we were able to see them and that is why i am able to tell you about the many things i saw , in that forest you could be in a position to see a person while that person was unable to see you ||| turi turi kubareba kuko ni ishyamba rifite ahantu nkuko nrinrimo kubibabwira tuhaboneyemo ibintu nyinshi aho turi turi ntabwo batubonye ariko twebwe turabarebaaga kuko ryari ishyamba rimeze ukuntu kuko ubaga uririmo ukashobora kureba umuntu uri hirya yawe arikowe ntakubonae .
we saw a lot of bodies at lake kivu , we heard that many of these people had been killed in the friday market day and their bodies had been piled onto a truck and dumped here . we saw very many bodies in that place , they seemed to be white as they reflected the moonlight , we moved on because we were very scared , we also saw trees and we kept thinking they we people only later to realize they were trees . ||| turajyana turamanuka muri iryo shyamba tugera ku kivu ujya inya mishaba rero uca ku kivu tusanga intumbi nyinshi cyane ziraho iruhande rw' i kivu abo bajugunye mu mazi ngo abashi bari baje vendredi kuko ariho haba isoko babapakirair intumbi nabo bageze ku kivu barazimena izo zose zari zaje ziri kunkombe ziki kivu tubonyeho intumbi nyinshi icyo kihae zabaye umweru hari hariho ukwezi icyo kihae turagenda kubera n' ubwoba tubonaaga n' ibiti tukabona byose ni abantu tubigeraho tukabona ari ibiti atari abantu
we stayed and slept there , in the morning , my mother who had a stomach problem , woke up hiccupping ; she hiccupped so much and being a child i started to cry , i cried hard and my mother tried to calm me down saying that it was going to be alright . i thought she was going to die . i was also thinking about many things because she had a stomach problem and we were hungry . ||| ubwo tuguma aho turaharara mugitondo mama yarwaraaga igifu cyane abyuka ari gutsepfura ari gutsepfura cyane cyane njyewe nri umwana w' umutesi nrarira nrarira cyane aranbwira ceceka birashira ari ku calmant ambwirango birashira nri nrikuibaza ukuntu nawe agiye kupfa nrikuibaza nti mama ashobora kupfa ndikumwibazaho ibintu byinshi kuko yarafite icyo kibazo cy' igifu n' inzara tuinjira muri iyonzu tuyiraramo migitotndo ;
we had slept in the other house ; in the morning ; about five o'clock , some people came to the house ; the interahamwe came to the house ; they said that the people we saw last night might be hiding in these ruins , so they decided to check the house , that is how they found us , they immediately saw us , they ordered us out and with many others took us to nyamishaba , they took all of us to the gasura sector ||| mugitondo nka saa kumi nimawe haza abantu haza interahamwe nyine ziza ngo ehh kandi ba bantu turaye tubonye nijoro bashobora kuba bari murizince bahita bainjira aho ngaho bainjiye , bainjiye bahita batusanga aho ngaho baratusohora bazana n' abandi benshi aho inyamishaba ehh baravuga batujyana ahantu mbese ahantu tuesae hari secteur kasura .
when the girl saw my mother she cried out to her , she said she had been raped and hacked with machetes , you see my mother , my mother was , i do n't know if i can say she was weak , she was affected by such a situation , she sat down and started crying , she told the girl to persevere because there was nothing any of us could do , that is how life is , you have to remain strong ||| mama yari ntinzi niba nvugako yari faible cyane ibyo byose bimukoraagaho nawe araicara ararira arangije aramwahanganisha aramubwirango ntakunri nyine nuku ubuzima bumeze nukwihangana .
the interahamwe at that point had not given us any orders , then suddenly they came , i think they had been in a meeting , they ordered us to dig pits , go did pits they said , children will bury children , you should bury your relatives , the rest will be buried on top to cover the pits and we all thought that is how it was going to be . ||| ubwo interahamwe zari zitaragira icyo zitutegeka hashize icyo zitutegeka ziraza ahari zari ziri munama simbizi siratubwira ziti mugiye kucukura ibyobo migiye kucukura ibyobo utwana tuhambae utwana tugenzi twatwo namwe muhambae bene wanyu bati mwebwe muraza kworosa ibyobo murajya kujya hejuru yabo bose tuumvaagako ariko bimeze .
i do n't know how much time i spent unconscious ; i did not seem to remember everything that happened , i stayed there a little longer , i then slept until sunset when i came around again . ||| nongeye kugira ubwenge ntinzi iminsi nhamaze , ntinzi ukuntu bigenze ngumaye nraryama aho nraguma ntaharyama ubwo nzakumenya ubwenge ari nkanimugoroba ari nkanimugoroba ;
i slowly regained consciousness and woke up hearing the wind ; being close to lake kivu , it was cold ; i was hearing the wind and noises from the valley below wondering where i was . ||| ubwenge kubajya buza etape par etape nkibaza nkaumva umuyaga urabona nihafi yo ku kivu nkaumva umuyaga umuyaga mwinshi nkaumva ibintu byo mugishanga ndibazani se ndihehe ?
what am i doing here ? ||| nrikukora iki ? aha mpita nibuka ukuntu interahamwe zaje , ukuntu batemye mama ,
i then remembered how the interahamwe had attacked , how they had hacked my mother to death , how they had hacked my brother to death , how they had hacked the other child , i did n't see how they hacked him but i clearly saw the rest , i did n't see this child because he was a small distance away but i could hear his screams , i kept on gathering my thoughts up to the point i remembered how i had been attacked and the first time i had looked at my arm , i saw that the bones had been exposed and were in pieces ; i realized the pieces of bone were not attached . ||| ukuntu batemye musaza wanjye , ukuntu batemaaga wamwana we ntinmubonye bamutema ariko abandi nrababonye neza uwo mwana niwe ntabonye neza kuko yari hairyaho gatoya ukuntu yavuzaaga induru ngenda nbiibuka nbiibuka ngeraho nnjyae niyibuka nibuka ukuntu bantemye mpita reaction ya mbere nhise nreba ku kuboko nsanga ikupfa ryarahangotse ntabwo bifatanyae neza ; niri nkiri , iri gufa ntabwo rifatanyae neza .
i kept on realizing where i was , at that time i was wearing a dress , it had been torn to pieces by the machetes and was full of blood , i then thought about checking other parts of the body , and they were also full of blood , the whole body as it was , with mud from the valley , water and other things ; that was at the sunset , early in the morning i wanted to ; when i regained consciousness i wanted to know truly if my family had died . ||| uhh ehh ngenda nibuka nzana ubwenge uhh ubwo nri nambaye agakanzu nako uraumva kacikaguritse aho bagiye batema kauzuyeho amaraso bihita binzamo nreba nhanri nyine nsanga nuzuye amaraso umubiri wose aruko bimeze n' ibyondo byo mugishanga n' amazi ibintu byose ; ubwo burije bukeye mugitondo kare kare ncaka ubwo maze kumenya ubwenge nshatse kuwenda kumenya uko bimeze niba koko abavandimwe bapfuye .
voice is not clear . he had been traumatized , i thought about how i would have been taken and killed , i showed him bodies , i kept quiet , i did n't have what to say to him ; at that point the man took me and gave me tea ; they got me other clothes and took off the clothes stained with blood , that auntie gave me a bath and helped me wear the new clothes . ||| ubwo umugabo aragenda ajya kumpa icyayi eyy banshakira niyindi myenda yamyenda yamaraso ubwo uwo mu tentin aranyoza anyambika iyo myenda mizima .
later about eight o'clock that morning , i went to visa 's house , they had told me that visa was a friend of the family , let 's see if they can give us any help , so we left , when he saw me , he immediately shouted ; fille , you are still alive ? ||| hari hamaze kucya noneho nka saa mbiri mpita njyana ahongaho kwa visa bavugango kwa visa ni inshuti zanyu ngo ziwanyu reka turebae niba haricyo batufasha bahita banjya aho kwa visa nkigerayo ahita anbona ahita avuga ehh fille uracyariho nti ntakiiriho sawa bahita banyiza munzu ,
and i said yes , i immediately entered the house , they took me in and gave me some food and because i had not eaten in many days , i felt like there were some wounds in my throat , voices are not clear , i was hungry but i failed to eat , i asked them give me some water , give me some water , and then visa told the husband of my auntie that their house was always being searched and they did n't know where to hide me , let 's take her to the back of the house in the sorghum garden until the sunset . ||| banyinjije munzu bashaka kumpa ibiryo kubera kumara imnsi myinshi umuntu atarya mumuhogo hari hameze nkaharimo ibisebe .. kandi nri nshonje birananira ati ntashaka amazi ntashaka amazi ako kanya visa ahita abwira umugabo w' umu tentin wanjye ati hano bajya baza kudusaka ntabwonzi ahantu fille tumushyira atariko reka tumujyanae hano inyuma tumuhishe mumusaka turaza kumwinjiza bugorobye .

there was blood everywhere . ||| umuryango ururi nka hano mpita ninjira iruhande rw' umuryango ..... ntivuga ....... dore amaraso kagiye hese ?
i stayed there for about four hours , later that evening i crawled back into the sorghum garden , there was a nearby maize garden owned by someone named patel ||| nguma aho hashira amasaha nka ane hageze nimugoroba nva muri cya kizu nrikurura nsubira muriya masaka hepfo y' amasaka hari umurima w' ibigori by' umuntu witwaga patel .
patel , i mean his wife , patel was not there at that time , his wife , her younger brother and a worker came to harvest some maize and saw me , they were very surprised ; ehh , this child is still alive ? ||| patel rero umugorewe nyine we ntiyarahari n' umugorewe na murumunawe n' umukozi aza ahongaho kuca ibigoro byabo bahita banbona bahita bavuga ngo ehh uyu mwana aracyariho reka tumutwarae umudamu ahita avuga ngo yo kandi disi mama we uwo mudamu ahita avuga kandi disi uyu mwana mama we yari inshuti yanjye ati rekanze mutwarae iwanjye arantwara nawe ;
he also told the head of the pediatric ward that when he returns he should not find me missing from the hospital . he then left , that 's the last i saw of him , honestly , he had been so good to me , he kept me from killers because they were scared of him . ||| ati uyu mwana nimubura muri ibi bitaro abwira responsabre nyine wo muri pediatrie ahita agenda nawe ubwo tubaturarangizanyije kumubona ariko mubyukuri yangiriye neza kuko yanshinganishije bajyaaga kunyica bati wibeshye umwice pater azakuica ntibanyicae nyine nguma mubutaro ariko nyine nibajya banvura ntabwo bashoboraaga kunvura ;
my leg was flexed and i could not stretch it out because i was not getting any treatment ; esther also had the same problem , she could not stretch out her arm . ||| katashobora kuihina nuwo mwana wunri esther akaboko kari karahinaliranye katashobora kuhina katashobora no kuraambuka .
when he heard about me , he said ; would n't it be stupid not to try to find her ? they tried to tell him that they would find me for him but he insisted on coming out . he then left the place . he should have had his wedding in july 94 , he left his hiding place and came rushing to find me . ||| arabimenya ataise ubusae si ububaw nrekae kujya kureba umwana ngo reka tuzajya kumukurebair ati reka reka ntinshobora kureka kujya kureba umwana ava ahantu bari ubwo yari afite n' ubukwe mukwa karindwi kw' icyenda na kane ava ahantu yari yihishe aza yiruka aza kunreba yangezeho nka saa moya za nijoro ;
it is where many tutsi from that neighborhood who came to the hospital were killed , you see many were injured so many came to the hospital ; they took twayigira and started to hack him , i could hear his screams , he screamed until he died , pascal had been killed ; pascal had a younger brother called bosco ; bosco is still alive , he lives in kacyiru . ||| niho biciraaga abatutsi bafataiye ahongaho muri cartie yaho ngaho kwa muganga kandi urabona ko ibyo aribyo byose iyo bakomeretse reaction ya mbere ni ukjya kwa muganga , baramujyanye bmutemaga numva avuza induru avuza induru baramwica nyine arapfa uwunri witwa pascal , pascal nawe murumuna wa bosco ,
they also told him that fille is still alive although she was hacked by machetes , at that time it was the kind of news that travelled ; let me go and see that child he said , he came with pascal 's fiance called christine , they came together , she was butchered in that hole ; then came another uncle 's wife , his name was pascal , his wife had given birth in a hole where she was hiding . ||| bosco we aracyariho aba hano kacyiru nawe baramubwirango fille arahari ati fille arahari ati bamutemye uraumva icyo kihae nizo nkuru zari zihari ati ehh rekajye kureba umwana ati reka pascal araza yari afite fiance witwa christine barashoreraan baraza nawe bahita babatemair muri icyo cyobo ,

we all had something in common , everyone felt responsible and wanted to come and visit and many people were killed by an interahamwe leader called mahundaza , i remember him ; mahundaza also had his leader called benoit , they used to come together . there was also the headmaster of gatwaro school . ||| noneho hari ibintu biri biduhuje umuntu wese yiumvaagamo nka responsabilite rekanjye kureba reka njyae kureba umwana bahaiciye abantu benshi benshi benshi interahamwe zajyaaga ziza kunsura iitwa mahujndaza niyo nibuka ehh na benoit yari mukuru wuwo mahundaza baraza hari nundi mu directeur w' amashuri y' igatwaro abantu benshi bakundaaga mama wanjye cyane cyane ngo yari sociable niko njya numva abantu bavuga ntabwo ngize amahirwe yo kumumenya neza ;
my mother was well loved and many people said she was a social person , i did not get a chance to know her well ; many people came to visit me ; one lady came wearing a skirt and blouse that was given to her by my mother . another girl , her father 's name was gisunzu , there was also a second girl who had clothes given to her by my mother , and she was also killed there . ||| noneho bakaza kunsura umwe yaje yaje yambaye ijipo n' ishati bya mama undi nawe abo bakobwa nyine papa wabo bamwitaga gisunzu undi nawe yambaye umupira wa mama iyo jipo n' ishati niyo mama yari yambaraiyeho bamwicanye .

those small hammers were used on us on specific days , that is one thing that hurt most during the genocide , if only people were to be killed without being mocked and tortured ; they always gave us dates to die , if i remember well , they once said , today is the 19th , on the 20th no more tutsi 's will be living ||| utunyundo dutoya buri munsi babaga batuhaye umunsi ngo burya ninacyo kintu kinbabaza muri genocide iyo bafata abantu bakahita babica batahangayitse cyane ariko bakatuha amatariki bati ejo ubu turi kwitariki cumi n' icyenda niba ntibeshye ati ku itariki makumyabiri nimawe ntamututsi uzaba ukihari .
we always waited for the dates when we were supposed to be killed but the interahamwe would come and say , we will kill you the day after tomorrow , then one day they came and ordered us out to be killed , i was so weak and i was unable to move , esther was also very weak and so we were unable to walk to our place of slaughter so they promised to come and kill us later ||| tukaicara nyine tutegerejeko itariki zigera ngo batuicae gutyo gutyo gutyo burikihae bakaza bakatubwirango tuzabica ejo tuzabica ijobundi umunsi umwe rero ubwo taratubwirangi nimuzae tugende tujyae kubica ntinshoboraaga kubyuka ntanakaimawe nshoboraaga kukora nta movement nimawe nshoboraaga kukora na esther biri ukonguko tugumaho biratunanira kugirango tugende batuicae baratubwirango turaje tubatwarae tubicae .
the auntie that i had lived with earlier had also come to the n.t ; she tried to follow @-@ up with the treatment but they asked her to leave it to them ; she asked them to let her take me to congo and see if some of my relatives can help me . ||| ubwo njyewe nyine wamu tenti hahanri ngiye akitura hasi bo bari baje nabo bari baje muri n.t barabikurikiranongo mumwihorere bamuvurae ibishoboka ;
they tried to treat me . i would like to talk about the time at the hospital again , there was once an old lady who came running after they had discovered her hiding place , i do n't know where she came from , she came running and hid under one of the beds , she was very scared , she had a rosary and was saying her prayers . the interahamwe came and took her . i will always remember that lady , i always remember her when i remember the genocide period . ||| mumujyanae muri congo kuko yaraziko haba abantu bo muri famille bazageragezae bamuvurae nyine bamuvuze uko bishoboka ntararangiza kubyo kubitaro rero hari n' umukecuru uje wirukanka bamuvumbuye ubwo ntinzi aho bari bamuvumbuye az yiruka yiruka ahita ajya munsi y' igitanda ahantu ahonyine aho turi turi ajya munsi y' igitanda kimwe cy' umuntu afite ubwoba afite ubwoba bwinshi cyane afite idhapure ari kuvuga amasengesho interahamwe ziraza zihita zimukuramo ziramujyana nuwo mukecuru burikihae sinhobora kumwibagirwa nawe mufiteho image mubintu binyibutsa genocide nawe njya mwibuka .
after leaving the hospital for n.t ; when we moved to congo , i met my relative , there was an auntie working in bukavu , she was studying at istem , she learnt i was still alive , we usually gave out our names and other details . she came and started helping me get treated but with a lot of difficulty ; if she had no medical knowledge i do n't think i would have been able to walk . she taught me a lot , i first learnt how to stand like an infant , then i had a wheelchair and later with improvement i was able to use crutches . i then stayed there ||| ubwo tumaze kugenda turi muri n.t gato batujyana muri congo nibwo rero nshoboye kubona abantu bo muri famille hari umu tentin ukoraaga i bukavu ukoraaga bukavu wigaga muri istem arabimenyako nkiriho barazaaga bakakubaza umuntu ukatanga umwirondoro we baramushaka baramushakisha araza aratangira aranvuza bimugoye cyane cyane sinz iyo ataba ari umuganga ntinzi niba nshoborano kugenda akakora effort nawe akanvura ankoresha ibintu byinshi nongera niga kuhaguruka nk' umwana anjyana mukagare nbaho nsa nuworohewe nfata imbago nguma aho gutyo nyine .

we later left bukavu , i really wanted to see rwanda , i really wanted to see how my home was . ||| ubwo tuza kuva i bukavu nshakaaga cyane kuza kureba ,
my auntie remained in bukavu and i returned with the family of my mother 's brother . she remained behind because of some things she had n't finished and was later to return to rwanda . ||| kuza kureba uko mu rwanda hameze nshaka kuza nkajya iwacu nkajya kureba uko ameze uwo mu tentin rero asigara i bukavu anzana muri famille nza nba ndi muri famille ahantu kwa musaza wa mama noneho we agumayo gatoya hari ibintu yari atararangiza nyuma yaho nawze azabonae kuza muri iyominsi baramutera nyine baramenyeko ari namwene wacu ;
she was then attacked by some people who knew her as my relative ; they attacked her and tried to kill her , but a white colleague who worked with the saved her . this white person , i do n't remember his name had been my doctor . she then moved to europe in a country called norway , she had a school going child , she moved with that child . i stayed with my uncle 's family ||| baramutera bashaka kumwica umuzungu bakoranaaga ntinibuka izinarye neza nawe yaranvuye cyane uwo mzungu aramutorokesha ahita ashaka ukuntu ajya i burayi ajya muri norvege ubu niho aba yari afite n' umwana umwe nawe yarari kuiga icyo kihae barajyana njyae sigara aho nba ahongaho nyine kwa musaza wa mama .
recently , in the year two thousand ; the year two thousand and two , she died ; she was n't ill , it was a sudden death , she left work , went to bed and died , that pushed me back a lot , to be honest about life ; about the experiences i lived through the genocide . i do n't know how to rank those experiences that remind me of the genocide , they are just so many . ||| nawe ejobundi muri deux mille mubihumbi bibiri na kabiri nawe arapfa nawe atarwaye mubintu bitunguraanye araryama avuye kukazi arapfa bituma nongera kusubira inyuma cyane nyuma ariko muby' ukuri ubuzima nubwo buzima bwanjye bwo muri genocide nibintu byinshi cyane njyawe ntinzi uburyo nabi numerotant ibintu binyibutsa genocide nyifiteho ibintu byinshi cyane bituma ntayibagirwa ;

in the beginning it was very difficult , i felt a lot of pain ; even when i had other kinds of problems , they always brought up the memories of my mother 's suffering and i wished she was still alive . it is understandable to hurt when your parent suffers and her life is taken . the pain you feel is understandable ||| eh na mbere mbere birangoraaga cyane nrababaraaga cyane niyo nbabaraaga cyane niyo habaaga ikintu kinbabaje nhitaaga nbiibuka nbiibuka nkavuga ngo cya kihae bwa bubabarae bukomeye mama yagize iyo mama aba akiriho ibintu byinshi ndetse nyine biraumvikana ntabwo ukuishima umubyeyi wawe hari ikintu kibabaje cyane cyanamwambuye ubuzima kimubayeho biraumvikanako nbabara cyane ngomba no kubabara kandi .
you were quite young during the genocide , eight years old , is there anything you remember about life before the war , you and your family at home ; the genocide later came and claimed the lives of your family members and parents , can you tell us the fondest memories of your mother ? ||| ibyo aribyo byose nubwo uri muto muri genocide imyaka umunani hari ibintu uba wibuka ukuntu mwari mubayeho mbere y' intambara mwibereye murugo muri umuryango ; genocide iza kuba arinaho yaje kubambura abantu muva indimwe ndetse n' ababyeyi bawe nka mama wawe umutubwiraho iki nkikintu cy' umwihariko ubona kitashobora kumukwibagizaho umwibukaho mbese ikintu umwibukaho utashobora nikihe ?
i have very many memories of my mother ; i was the only girl in the family and she use to tell me ; when a family has only one girl and she grows up into a foolish person that 's a terrible thing to happen , so i grew up with that in mind , not to grow up into a foolish person , she also told me that a girl is like milk , she can not be tasted , i heard those things as a child but up to today i still follow those principles ; she always wished to see me study and get into secondary school and finish , i always wanted to study at least until i finish secondary school and i was able to do it . ||| eh ibintu mwibukahobyo nibyinshi cyane ; nkiri umwana kuko arijyae mukobwa njyae jyenyine yajyaaga akunda kumbwirango , ngo kugira umukobwa umwe ngo iyo umuntu agize umukobwa umwe akaba ikigoryi biba ibibazo birebire nkuze nfite objectif yo kutazaba ikigoryi kubera ibyo bintu mama yanbwiraaga akambwirango umukobwa ninka amata , umukobwa ntasogongeraw ibintu byinshi kandi nri umwana ariko ubu nrabizirikana cyane ; yajyaaga yifuza ngo kunbona niga muri secondaire nrangije na secondaire ntabwo njyae nshobora kureka kuiga nibura ntarangije secondaire none nrarangije na secondaire .
i can not stop studying until i have attained at least ; at least a degree , she had high hopes in me , she hoped i would grow up to become someone ; a rwanda girl who is the pride of her mother , as her single girl child , and about the genocide we were able to share her last suffering and when i think of that , it gives me strength to keep fighting to live again . ||| ntabwo nnjyae nshobora kurekera kuiga ntarabona nibura ntarabona licence , numva nibuka ibintu byinshi yajyaaga anyifuzamo ibintu byinshi yajyaaga anyifuzamo umuntu muzima , umukobwa w' umunyarwandakazi numvaaga nba umuntu muzima nyine nkamuhaish ishema nk' umukobwa umwe yagiraaga ikindi kandi mubuzima bwa genocide akababaroke ka nyuma kubuzima bwe tushoboye nko kukakabana nrabiibuka nabyo iyo biibutse bituma bintera imbaraga zo kuongera kuharanira kuongera kubaho .

as i had already said , it was sunset and i was n't able to see clearly and it was out of our neighborhood ; there is one person i know though ; i remember him , he even told me that i should pay him back if i can , it was the guard named francois sinzabakira ||| hari ni nkuko nbibabwiye buri bawije ntabwo nbashaaga kubabona neza kandi ntabwo hari mujri cartie neza hari hepfo ho gatoya , uwonzi uwo nzirikana wanambwiyengo nzabimwiture nuwo uri umuzamu uhh nuwo uri umuzamu witwa francois ntinzabakira

one month later we went back to school and continued to live on but at that time it was the beginning of persecution , they sent to prison presumed accomplices and everything else even my father was part of those presumed accomplices that were sent to prison . ||| hanyuma hashize nk' ukwezi tusubiye ku mashuri tujya ku ishuri tukomeza ubuzima ariko icyo kihae itotezaw riratangira batangira kufunga ibyitso n' ibiki byose kuburyo na papa wanjye bamufunzemo muri ibyo byitso ,

in 1994 , the war [ genocide ] restarted but we thought it was similar to what happened in 1992 , we fled in a church like the way we did it in 1992 . ||| ubwo ngubwo haje icyenda na kane nibwo intambara yongeye gu genocide yo yongeye kutangira itangira ubwo twagizengo ni nka bya binri bya binri by' icyenda na kabiri ,

the interahamwe attacked and found us inside , we started to run and there came a time we ran separate ways and i could not find my brother again , other people picked me up because i was terribly wounded in the head that i had shrapnel inside the wounds . ||| interahamwe zikatera zikatusangamo tujyamo hagati turairukanka tukomeza kuirukankaan nyuma turatataan na wa musaza wanjye nza kumubura , abandi bantu baza kuntoragura abantu babaga babiri nibo bantoraguye , kubera ko nri maze nri nfite ibikomere mu mutawe biri bitangiye kuzamo inyo , kubera kumara igihe nta ntuza nta kintu nshyiraho ,

they used to take me on the back , and then we ran in the swamp up to musenyi , the genocide continued , and i finally met with my brother while i was still with the other people who rescued me . ||| bakampeka ku mugongo , noneho tukairukanka tukairukankair kuntuza mu gifunzo aho ngaho tukajya imusenyi , nuko genocide irakomeza , finalement nje kuhura na musaza wanjye turi kumwe na babanri bari bantoraguye ,

we were used that whenever they came , they came shooting but this time they came without shooting so we could not hear them and we were even at the edge of the swamp , it was not easy to run into it . ||| ziratera zihita zitufata baratutungura nta nubwo barasaga icyo kihae ntago barashe baje batutunguye batusanga turi hejuru y' urufunzo ntitubona uko tujyamo ,
my brother managed to escape but it was difficult for him to flee me because i was terribly wounded the whole body so they caught me and others . ||| musaza wanjye arairukanka arabacika jyae abura ukuntu anfata kubera nri naravunaguritse umubiri wose nguma nicaye aho ngaho baranfata ,
they killed some of the people and made me sit down , they were watching me . ||| noneho baragenda bicamo abantu banyicaje aho ngaho hari abantu bandinzee ,
when they finished to kill the ones inside the swamp and they took me with them , on our way going they saw a pot and told me to carry it , i asked them to let me search for some banana leaves so that i use them to carry but they forced me and put the pot on my head with all the wounds on it , they said @: ‘ carry this it is going to hurt you and kill you faster @"@ . ||| noneho baza kuva muri rwa rufunzo barangije kuica baranshorera baranjyana , basanga ahantu hari hateretse inkono tugeze ruguru basanga ahantu inkono zari ziteretse , bankoreza inkono , nrababwira nti reka nshakae ingata nikoreze nti oya barayinkoreza muri bya bisebe noneho baranbwira ngo ikorerae nibwo biri buomokae ngo ukagira ukapfa vuba ,
i carried it and we continued till we reached the other church , they heard other people who were coming even shooting so one man among the interahamwe who were with me started to shoot , and then they ran . ||| nrayikorera ya nkono turagendaaa , tugeze ahantu hafi ya cya kiriziya ubwo ngubwo ba barangije haturuka abantu ruguru barasa hari umugabo uri uri mu bacu witwaga gapira ararasa arashe baba barirukantse ,

we passed the first day the interahamwe did not come and they came surprisingly on the second day , it is safe , "@ get out of where you are , it is safe @" said the radio . ||| ubwo , ubwo twara ubwo hashize nk' iminsi nk' umunsi umwe interahamwe ntizaza ku munsi wa kabiri ziragaruka zigarutse noneho baraza na none batutunguye kubera ko bari basibye bavuga ngo ni amahoro , ngo nimuzamukae mujyae haruguru ngo ni amahoro radio ariko irimo kuvuga ,
so we went out suddenly we were surrounded by the interahamwe , they took my brother with other people and killed them after that they left them there . ||| ubwo turazamuka tugeze haruguru interahamwe ziba zatugose ziratufata ubwo zimaze kutufata nibwo bafashe musaza wanjye n' abandi bantu barabica babajugunya aho ngaho musaza wanjye nyine we bari bamuzi baravuga ngo wowe ngo turakuica ,
they knew my brother , they said to him @: ‘ we are going to kill you first and finish your sister after @"@ . ||| naka gashiki kawe turakica nyuma ,
they killed others first and came to him after , they hacked him ; they put him in front of everyone and hacked him while everyone was laughing at him . ||| baramufashe baramutemagura abandi bamaze kubica bamwica nyuma nyine bamushyize ku gasozi nyine bamushungereye ,
they left him there . ||| noneho ubwo baramufashe baramutemagura bamaze kumutemagura bamurambika aho ngaho ,
they took the metal tank they had with them and went to fetch water in the swamp . ||| hakaba hari ntuza hari ingunguru bari bari bafite iyo ngunguru barangije bayitereka aho ngaho interahamwe zijya kuvoma amazi mu gifunzo ,
they had a metal tank , a water tank and casseroles that they stole in several places . ||| bari bafite ingunguru babohoje ahantu na ntuza na muvero , n' amasafuriya n' ibiki ibintu byinshi cyane ,
after fetching water , they searched for fire woods to cook with . ||| barabifata bafata ya ngunguru bavomairmo amazi bavomairmo ya mazi bamaze kuvomairmo amazi bashyira ku ziko baracana bajya kushaka inkwi baracana ,
they said to me @: ‘ think the way we are going to kill you brother , it is going to be awful for you ’ . ||| bamaze kucana noneho ba ba baranbwira ngo baranbwira ngo wowe tekereza ukuntu tugiye kuica musaza wawe wowe uko turi bukuicae birarenze ,
they heated the water that was in the tank up to the boiling point , after boiling , his brother was still breathing a little bit so they carried him and put him in the boiling water and closed it . ||| ubwo ngubwo baragize bacanye ya mazi mu ngunguru barayacana arabira , amaze kubair bafashe wa musaza wanjye yari akirimo umwuka noneho bamushyiramo , bamushyizemo hari ntuza hari muvero yari ihari barapfundikira ,
they tried to increase the heat after he was thrown in the tank . ||| baracanair bamaze kumujugunyamo , noneho bakajya bafata imihini ,
they took shaped woods and started to press his head saying his head is getting out but the truth was that he was tall and could not fit in it . ||| imihini bari bafite bahondaishaga abantu bakajya batsindagira basubiza mu ntuza bamusubiza mu ngunguru ngo umutwe utareremba kubera ko yari muremure ntago yabashaaga kukwiraw mu ngunguru bari bamuhinanze .
they heated the water , after an hour i was scared thinking the way they are going to kill . i sat there and they said to me @: ‘ you have seen how we killed him ’ . ||| baracanair nyuma y' isaha ubwo nnjyae ntegereje ukuntu bagiye kunyica , nicaye aho ngaho baranbwira ngo ubonye urupfu tumwishe ?
they even said we were about to cut him in pieces but his body is of useless state , nothing we can eat from it . ||| ngo turi tugiye no kumubaga ngo ariko tubonye ngo inyama zashizemo ubumuntu , ngo nta kintu tuba turiyemo ,
they took him out of the tank and he was completely naked that his body started to become white . they left me there and said to me @: ‘ you ..... you are going to die right there , we do n't even have the strength to kill you , and we finished all of it in your brother ’ . ||| baramufashe bamusuka hasi bamaze kumusuka hasi nyine yahindutse umweru bari banamwambuye ubusa hose n' ibiki byose babimwambuye noneho barangije bansiga aho ngaho barazamuka baranbwira ngo wowe ngo wowe ngo pun go n' ubundi ngo uragwa aho ngaho ngo twebwe ngo nta ntegae twifitiye ngo intege tuzimaraiye muri uyu musaza wawe barazamuka bansiga aho ngaho .
i spent three days feeling crazy and even all others we fled together none of them passed there . ||| nragiye nicaramooo hashize nk' iminsi nk' ingahe nibwo inkotanyi zaje zimaze kuza baraza bakuramo abantu ariko nanga kusohoka ngirango n' interahamwe zagize , n' interahamwe ziri kubeshya ngo na nanone amahoro yabonetse ,
i stayed there , on the third day i regained my sense i woke up and found my brother still beside me but the smell was so awful and his body has grown bigger . ||| ubwo hashira indi minsi nk' ibiri nenda kupfairmo n' ibizi biri birimo bya bya nyine biranukaaga n' ibiki , ubwo ngubwo nyuma nibwo baje kuhagarara hafi y' urufunzo baravuga ngo ee ngo amahoro ngo yaje ngo n' inkotanyi ngo nimuzae tubasangae noneho abo turi turi kumwe baravuga ngo nimuzae tusohokae ngo usanga ari inkotanyi zaje , ubwo baranfashe nabob a mama icyo kubera ko nta nbaraga nri nfite narasukumaga , n' ibisebe nri nfite mu mutawe biri biranze kukira ahubwo hazamo inyo nshakisha ibyatsi nkahonda nkashyiraho ,
i had a dress that i used to tie up my stomach so that i do n't feel hungry , the same dress he used while taking me on his back so i took it and covered him . ||| bikanga kukira , ubwo baranfashe bangi ubwo abongabo baravuga ngo wowe uzatupfairho reka tukujyanae kwa muganga ubwo abasirikare baranfashe barampeka , nabo badame turi turi kumwe nta muntu n' umumwe nri nzimo , ubwo banjyana kwa muganga hariya inyamata ,
i went back to the swamp in the cnd , i found lots of dead bodies and i did not recognize any one of them because the people from our place fled in several places . ||| baranvura nhamaze nk' ibyumweru nka bibiri batujyana rero muri olphelina hariya kwa mingeti n' abandi bana b' inkomerae turi turi kumwe hari n' abandi bahise bajyana hanze , jyewe ibikomere byanjye ntabwo biri grave ,
they fled to ntarama , nor to nyabarongo . ||| bamvu bahise banjyaan ahariya muri olphelina baranvura .
i stayed in there after some days the inkotanyi came wanting to rescue me , but i refused to go with them thinking they were interahamwe , who are trying to fool me that it is safe . ||| ntahaba mu kihae kigeze nko mu mezi abiri ,
after two days i felt like i am almost to die , even the water in the swamp was stinking . ||| ubwo croix iza kutuvanamo hariya rero muri olphelina yo kwa mingeti ,
a while later , the inkotanyi stood at the edge of the swamp and said to us @: ‘ it is safe , get out and come to us ’ . ||| banjyana muri olphelina y' igisenyi ,
the people we were with said okay lets get out it may be the inkotanyi who came . ||| nyibamoooooo ,
they helped me because i was not able to move and the wounds in my head were not yet healed . ||| baranvura ntakira ariko icyenda na gatandatu nza kaongera kurwara kubera nyine izo nkovu zari zangarutse , nkarwara umutweeeeee nkarwara umutwe cyane , noneho nza kugera m ukihae cyo kujya nva amaraso , nva amaraso cyane nkajya nva amaraso aturuka hano mu matwi no mu mazuru hose ,
unfortunately the number of shrapnel was increasing , i tried to pick up some grasses and remove them but still i was not recovering . ||| nbirwara mu kihae kigera mu mezi icyenda , aho ngaho niho bamvujije baranvura ntakira , ubwo icyenda na karindwi baranvuje ntakira ntakomeza ubuzima busanzwe njya mu ishuri nraiga ,
they took me on the back ; i could not recognize any of these people who were helping me . they took me at the hospital in nyamata , i was treated for about two weeks . ||| noneho icyenda karindwi tuba aho ngaho muri oplhelina hari abantu bazaaga nyine batuzaniye ibintu imyenda n' ibiki bakoraaga mu ntuza muri cicr ,
we were taken to mingeti orphanage with other wounded children ; the ones that were terribly wounded were taken out of the country . ||| ubwo ngubwo hazamo umugabo umwe aravuga ati jyewe jyewe muzampe hari umwana njya nbona hano wirirwa wigunze muzamumpe njyae mujyanae njyae kumureraan n' abana banjye , ni njyewe nyine uri uri aho ngaho kubera ko nkundaaga kurwara umutwe nkakunda kujya ahantu hacecetse ha jyenyine ,
my wounds were not that dangerous , i was treated in the orphanage . ||| yaza reo azanye ibintu akanbona , noneho baramubwira bati uzazae umujyanae niba wunva ufite ubushobozi nta kibazo hano ushaka kufata umwana arabivuga akaza akavuga uburyo azamufata neza n' ibiki nk' umwana we nta kibazo uzazae tuzamukuha .
she became weak , and she was hospitalized for a longtime in faycal hospital . ||| hashize igihe gitoya kigera nko mu kwezi atangira ukwezi kutarashira nbona atangiye kuhinduka nabi atangira kujya avuga nabi , akataha avuga nabi , nta atanbwira neza ,
i stopped my job and went on to look after her , she was hospitalized for almost six months but she did not recover , and then she was transferred out of the country . ||| umunsi umwe aranbwira ngo ariko rero ngo nubwo nohereje basaza bawe ngo bakagenda hanze ngo tukasigaraan ngo hari ikifuzo nshaka kukubwira , nti se iki he ? ngo ntashaka ko uzaba umugore wanjye nramubwira ngo ntago bishoboka !
so i stayed at home with the children and their father . ||| njyewe ndi umwana wawe uranreze nk' umwana wawe ntago bishoboka !
one month later , the father decided to send the children outside the country and we , i and the father , will follow them later because it was not easy to get air tickets for all of us . ||| aravuga ngo rero ugomba kuba umugore wanjye ! nti ntago bishoboka , arangije ubwo aranbwira ngo nta kibazo ngo niba bitashoboka ngo nta kibazo ngo ubwo ngubwo ubiihorerae . ngo tuzagenda ngo hanze ngo wikomereze ubuzima bwawe nti sawa .
he sent them in belgium to meet their mother because that is the place where she the mother was hospitalized . ||| ubwo ntiyahwemye yakomeje kuhinduka akajya avuga nabi n' iki ,
i stayed with the father of the children . ||| hacaho iminsi mike cyane murugo turi tufite umukozi w' umuhungu n' umukobwa ,
after a while , i proposed him to let me go back to school , as i was doing nothing and i had no job . ||| noneho nza kujya ahntu nje nsanga yirukanye umukozi w' umukobwa , hasigara umuhungu , ubwo ngubwo nramubaza nti none se ko wirukanye uriya mukobwa nti wamwirukaniye iki ?
the good thing i finished high school with good marks . ||| ngo namwirukanye ngo namwirukanye ngo ibyo ntago bikureba ngo niby' umukozi n' umukoresha ngo wowe ntago bikureba ,
when i wanted to go to farg and apply for a scholarship , he said to me @: ‘ no , wait a bit i am still searching for your papers in order for you to study out of the country . @" ||| ndamwihorera ubwo haciyeho nk' iminsi ibiri ku munsi wa gatatu arataha ubwo jyae nri ndi murugo jyenyine na wa mukozi arataha ariko jyae ntago ntago nraraga mu nzu jyenyine !
i said to him @: ‘ while we are waiting for those papers , why will n't i go to school if everything is finished i will quit the school but in the meantime i am doing nothing . @" ||| njyaaga kutira umwana w' inshuti yanjye mu baturanyi noneho njya kufata njya kuzana umwana w' inshuti yanjye noneho nramubwira nti ujyae undaza akaza nimugoroba akandaza ,
he said to me @: ‘ no you are going to study in the country side and i can not make it without you here . @" so i stopped . ||| ariko ntago yari abizi ko aharara kubera ko yakundaaga kuza atinze ariko atari cyane .
a month later , he started to act strange . ||| noneho uwo munsi , umunsi umwe ataha ari sasita z' ijoro ,
he started to come home after job when he is nervous and talking rude to me . one day , he said to me @: ‘ even thought i sent your brothers out of the country , there is something i would like to ask you . @" ||| nibwo bwa mbere yri atashye atinze amaze kugera mu rugo arakomanga baramufungurair arainjira jyewe nri niryamaiye ajya ku meza akimara kuva ku meza yinjira mu cyumba akimara kuinjiramo hashize iminota mikeya arampamagara aranbwira ngo yvonne ngo ngwino hano nkubwirae ndamwitaba ngo nrakushaka ngo hari ikintu nshaka kukubwira ,
i said what is it , he said to me @: ‘ i would like you become my wife . @" i said to him @: ‘ it is impossible , you raised me as you child , and i am your child and that can not happen . @" he said to me @: ‘ you have to be my wife . @" i said no again . ||| ndamwitaba ngo subira mu cyumba cyawe nraje ,
he said to me again @: ‘ if you can not then leave it . @" ||| nisubirair mu cyumba ngirango n' ibintu bisanzwe nyine kuko nta na mukubaan kwanjye nawe kuhera icyenda naga karindwi nta kintu na kimwe yari yaraigeze anbwira nk' umugabo nyine ,
he said to me @: ‘ by the time we reach in another country , you are going to live on your own . @" i said fine . he continued to act strange . ||| ubaw nragenda njya kwi nba nsubiye mu cyumba noneho aba araje ,
at home we had two housekeepers , a boy and a girl , i went somewhere and i returned back and found the girl was chased away . ||| aje asanga nraryamye na wa mwana ahita anbwira ngo uriya mwana ngo n' uwa hehe ? ngo uriya mukobwa muri kumwe n' uwa hehe ? mpita mu mubwira yari anamuzi turi tuturanye yari atuye nka hariya ku mbese turi tuegeranyae , noneho arangije ngo ntago mushaka kuzana abantu hano ntabizi ngo simushaka nbyukae ahitae ataha ,
i asked him why ? ||| nramubwira none se musaba imbabazi nramubwira iki gicuku ?
and he said to me @: ‘ that is none of your business , it is between me and the house girl . @" after two days , on the third day he came home , i was alone and the house boy was not there . ||| reka basi reka bucyae atahae ntago azaongera kugaruka ariko nuko nri nfite irungu rya ndi hano jyenyine ,
i was used to not sleep alone at home ; i always called a neighboring friend to sleep with me . he did not know that i sleep together with somebody else . ||| nuko nri nfite irungu ndi hano jyenyine ntago azagaruka .
that day he came back home around midnight , it was the first time came home that much late . ||| ubwo yahise ,
when he arrived at home , he knocked on the door and they opened for him . ||| arabianga ngo ntago nbishaka ngo nbyukae ahitae ajyenda ,
i was asleep in the room , so he went straight on the dining table to eat . ||| yara ubwo umwan yabonye bibaye nabi arabyuka armubwira ngo nbyukae amuherekezae aramuherekeza aragenda amugeza kuri portelle y' iwabo aragaruka ,
when he finished eating , he went in his room . ||| arafunga arainjira ajya mu cyumba ageze mu cyumba ahita yongera aragaruka ariko jyewe ubwo nhise ninjira mu cyumba mpita nfunga chamber yanjye nriryamair ,
after few minutes , he called me and said to me @: ‘ yvonne , come here i want to tell you . @" ||| ubwo akomanga kurugi akomanze kurugi rwa chambre yanjye yumva harafunze aranbwira ngo fungura ?
i went in his room and he said to me @: ‘ there is something i would like to tell you , return in your room i am coming . @" ||| nbanza kuanga aranbwira ngo fungura n' inzu yanjye ngo nrayimena ngo fungura ! nhise nfungura yinjira mu cyumba amaze kuinjira mu cyumba armbwira ngo uzi n' ibindi ? ngo bibinri nkubwiye ngo uka nyumvira ubusa ukampakanira ngo ntago bishoboka ! ngo uyu munsi ngo birashoboka ngo uyu munsi ngo birashobola ngo uyu munsi ngo uraba umugore wanjye !
i return in my room , thinking it is nothing of importance because since 1997 ; he never called me for a serious issue . ||| nramubwira ntago bishoboka ngo oya ngo niko bimeze ngo uyu munsi uraba umugore wanjye , ubwo nravuga nti nrihagararaho nkoma induru , noneho ntangiye kusakuza n' iki nihagazeho ahita akora mu ufuka yari yambaye intuza ipantaro y' ikoboyi ahita akora mu mufuka azamura pistori ,
i went back to my room and he came after me , he realized i was sleeping with somebody else . he said to me @: ‘ who is this ? who is that girl ? @" ||| ibyo nkutegeka byose n' utabiemera ndakaurasa njyae mu munyururu ubwo nhise nbiemera ibyo yantegetse byose nhise nbiemera nrambura byose ahita ahita anfata ku ngufu ubwo yahise yinjira arangije arangije kunfata yahise yinjira muri chambre ,
i said to him @: ‘ it 's the other neighboring friend . @" ||| ahita ajya kuryama nnjyae nguma aho ngaho ,
he said to me @: ‘ i do n't want you to bring somebody in this house when i am not aware of it . @" he wanted her out , i begged him saying it 's really late . ||| ubwo yahise amfungirana arasohoka ajya mu cyumba nuko mu gikondo aranfungurair arakaraba ajya muri douche ,
i said to him @: ‘ please be patient until morning and she will go once and for all , i was just lonely . @" ||| arangije ahita ajyenda ajya ku kazi nnjyae nbyutse meze nk' umuntu w' ikigoryi ariko ntekereza yari afite yari arwaye nravuga ntatekereza nti yanteye sida n' ibindi binri simbizi .
he refused saying that he does not want my friend there . when my friend realized that it was getting far she woke up . he said to her @: ‘ wake up , i will escort you up to your gate . @" ||| nhise nbyuka njya ku mudame w' inshuti yanjye turi tuturanye tuegeranyae njya kumutekerereza inbiambayeho n' ibiki byose ,
he escorted her up to where she lived and came back . ||| arangije aranbwira ati tugende kumurega turagiye kumurega tujya kuri brigade y' iremera turi tutuye iremera hafi no kwa ruhama ,
when he came back , he went straight to his room . ||| tujya kumurega ubwo bahise bamwoherereza convocation ,
he did not stay longer in his room , he came back to mine but i have already closed and slept . ||| umudamu aranbwira ati ntusubirae hariya ugumae hano ntahaguma uko nasotse nambaye nta n' ikindi kintu nsohotse nri nfite ubwo tujya kumerega baza ubwo bamuha convocation araitaba bahise banamufunga aho ngaho nguma aho ngaho murugo noneho hashira nk' iminsi igera iminsi ine nsubira kuri brigade nsubiye kuri brigade ,
so he tried to enter and found it was closed . ||| nsanga baramufunguye ,
he said to me @: ‘ open . @" i refused to open and he said to me @: ‘ open it 's my house i will break it , open . @" i opened straight away and he said me @: ‘ you know what , the other thing i told you and you refused saying it 's impossible , today it is going to be possible and you are going to be my wife . @" ||| nsanze baramufunguye nrabivuga baravuga ngo yarabatorotse ngo yaragiye ,
i said to myself @: ‘ i am going to scream . @" by the time i started to scream and everything , he took a pistol out of his pocket ; he was wearing a jean trouser . he said to me @: ‘ whatever i force you to do , you have to do it otherwise i am going to shoot you and go to jail . @" ||| nsu ubwo njya murugo kubera ko uwo mudamu nri nrahungiyeho hari nkaha nkaha nahariya hakurya ku kinamba ntabwo biri biegeranyae no murugo ni hafi na hari ni hafi na gereza aho yari iri noneho ,
from there i accepted whatever he asked me to do , i took off all my clothes and he raped me . ||| aho turi tutuye twebwe ni hafi ya kie hafi yo kwa ruhama ,
when he finished raping me , he went back to his room to sleep and i remained in my room . he locked my room and he opened it while he was going for a shower in the morning , after he went to work . i woke up in a desperate mood feeling like a fool . i was asking myself what if he is hiv positive and that he just contaminated me , what if ....... i do n't know . ||| ubwo ngubwo nsubira murugo ngiye kureba ko wenda yaba yaba raiho ari njyanye na wa mudame ngezeyo nsanga yapakuruye ibintu byo mu rugo byose yaraimutse nsanga yaragiye .
i woke up right away and went to see a neighboring madam who was a friend of mine ; i told her the whole story . she said to me @: ‘ let 's go and report him . @" we went to remera police station because we lived nearby , closer to rwahama 's building . ||| ubwo ngubwo nshakishije uburyo nmenya amakuru ashoboka kugirango menye ahantu ari kubera n' ibintu byanjye byose yari yabijyanye akantu yabashije kunsigair yasigaiye umuntu w' umuturanyi kuko nrahingutse barabimpa n' utudocument twanjye kuko hari harimo diplome yanjye n' utuntu dukeya n' amakaye ibintu bigize kiri kifite agaciro kiri kirimo ni ntuza ni diplome yanjye yararimo ,
we reported him and they sent him a letter asking him to come at the station . the madam asked me to not go back home , i stayed there the way i came . i came with nothing except the clothes i was wearing . when he came at the police station , he was directly sent to prison . ||| ubwo ngubwo ngerageje kushakisha tubura amakuru ye nyuma tuza kaumva ko ibintu yose biri aho ngaho yabigurishije akahita ajyenda akahita yurira indegeakagenda ,
i went to stay at the madam 's house . four days later , i passed at the police station and i found out he was released . ||| hashize nk' amezi abiri nbaye aho ngaho ndi kuri uwo mu mama nigunze meze nabi nyine meze nk' umuntu ugize troma nta buengae nfite ,
when i realized that he was sent free , i asked why ? and they said to me @: ‘ he escaped . @" i went to the madam 's house ; she lived near the prison in a short distance . ||| nza kurwara ntatangira ndarwaragurika noneho uwo mu mama aranbwira ati rero ati hari n' igihe yaba yaranakusigaiye n' inda ,
but us , we lived closer to kie near rwahama 's building . i and this madam went to check if he might be at his house and we found he packed everything and shifted to another place . ||| ati ibyo utekereza ati wirirwa uvuga ngo yaba yarakwanduje ati wenda yaba yaranakusigaiye n' inda byose ati tujyae kwa muganga , aramperekeza tujya kwa muganga .
when we reached there , they checked on me and found out i was pregnant . ||| tugezeyo baranpima bamaze kunpima basanga yanteye inda ,
i tried to calm myself and this mother helped me to calm myself . ||| ok nrikarumye nbaye aho ngaho nrikaruma umu mama abasha kunkaruma ,
we stayed together and she said to me @: ‘ i will help you as i can , just be strong now that he left you and we can not find where he went . @" ||| turabana aranbwira ati nzakufasha mu bishoboka , ati wihangane nta kunri ati niko bibaho , ati none se ko yagutorotse yagiye ati umukura he ? umenya se anari hehe ?
i wrote to his wife because i usually used to contact the children and their mother and i asked her about everything . ||| ubwo ikintu nkoze nje kuandikair wa mu mama tubanaaga kubera ko tukiranga contact na na na nabo bana be noneho nza kumubaza amakuru yose ,
i told her everything his husband did to me and she told @: ‘ i am sorry , but you should have reported him at the police . @" i said to her @: ‘ i reported and later on he escaped . @" ||| mubwira ibyo umugabo we yankoreye nrabimubwira , aranbwira ati ihanganae ati kuki utamureze nti nramureze nti ariko yaranantorotse yaraje ,
i realized that the man did not go in the same country of his wife , but he went in different one . the wife was still in belgium . ||| kumbi ntago yari yaraigeze amu mbese ntago yigeze amusanga yagiye mu gihugu ke ,
later his wife wrote to me and said that he was in australia and he has contacted her . ||| noneho undi aguma mu gihugu cye yari ari mu bubiligi ,
i stayed in that life , i stayed with that mother and she helped me as she could till i gave birth . ||| nyuma rero niwe uje kunbwira amakuru ye ko yagiye muri ostralie yamwandikiye akamubwira ko yagiye muri ostralie nba aho muri ubwo buzima nbana nuwo mu mama nrabyara uwo mu mama anyitaho mu bishoboka mubyo yari ashoboye aranfasha nrabyara ,
finally i gave birth . after two months , she left the country because she had a husband who was a student in makerere university in uganda . so she went to see her husband . ||| finalement rero maze kubyara maze amezi abiri wa mu mama tubanaaga nawe yaje kugenda yari afite umugabo wiga makereri yari uganda aza kumutumaho rero aramusanga ,
i was left alone with the child and she said to me @: ‘ there is nothing i can do , i have to go and i can not take you with me because i do n't know where to take you . @" ||| amaze kumusanga ubwo nsigaye aho jyenyine ngumana n' umwana aranbwira ati rero nta kunri nragiye kandi ntago bishoboka ko nkujyana nta hantu nkujyana ibugande ati kuko ubuzima bawho ntago nbishobora ,
she said to me again @: ‘ you can not handle the life out there , so try your best to live . @" ||| ati rero shakisha ubuzima bwawe uko ubishoboye ,
the only thing she left me was a mat to rest on . ||| ikintu yabashije kunsigair ubwo yansigaiye matela yo kuryma ho nsigara aho ngaho ntangira ubuzima bushya bwanjye bwo kuibana ,
i stayed there ; i started to struggle with my child . ||| ntatangira ndateseka mpura n' ubuzima bugoye n' umwana nta muntu n' umwe nreba n' iki ubwo ntangira ubwo buzima nyine ,
i could stay in the house desperate ; i could spend the whole day and night without eating . ||| nkajya mu nzu jyenyine nkigunga ,
the next day , if i meet a good person and he or she gives me food . perhaps the following day i do n't find someone . ||| nkabwirairw nkaburara ejo nbona umugiraneza akampa icyo kurya ejo nkamubura ,
my child could get ill , if it happens i get a job i take care of my child . ||| nuko , umwana yarwara ngira amahirwe nkabona arakize ,
later i suffered the kind of headache i suffered in 1996 , i started bleeding in the nose but it was somehow different from before , though i was bleeding so much . ||| noneho nza kusubiraan indwara nri nfite nri nrarwaye icyenda na gatandatu umutwe nza kaongera kurwara umutwe , nkajya nva amaraso mu mazuru ariko uko nbirwaraaga mbere siko bigarutse ariko yaturutse mu mazuru nkajya nva cyane ,
i started to lose weight every single day ; day and night i was losing weight . ||| ubwo ntatangira nkajya nta ibiro buri munsi buri munsi buri munsiiii ,
i said to myself what if i am hiv positive and my tests came negative . i do n't believe i am alright . ||| nravuga nti ariko se mana yanjye yab yarananyanduje ariko bakaba barapimye nabi mu bishoboka kuko numvaaga nta kaizerae nfite ko ndi muzima nripimaish ahantu hose kuko bari bananpimye nrwara ,
i went on with other tests in order to be aware of how i am doing physically , i found out i was alright . ||| nta kibazo nri nfite ubwo nkajya nta ibiro nta ibiro nta ibiro ,
i continued to lose weight ; i lost weight every single day . i did not stop calming myself though i was like that . ||| nkata ibiro buri munsi ubwo ngubwo nkomeza gutyo nkomeza kwikaruma mu buzima bwanjye nta ibiro ,
i had 85 kilograms before ; i lost almost 33 kilograms in that sorrowful life . ||| nri nfite ibiro mirongo inani na bitanu ngumana ngirango ntaye ibiro mirongo itatu na bitatu , muri ubwo buzima bungoye nyine .
up to now , i live alone and i feel lonely . ||| , ubu n' ubu buzima nbayemo ubungubu nubwo ngubwo n' ukwigunga ndi jyenyine ,
whenever a day passes , i thank god the way i live with friends and good people who understand me and my life . ||| iyo bawije nkabona bucyeye nshimira imaan uko nbayeho n' inshuti n' abagiraneza , bakaangirira impuhwe nuko nbayeho , nubwo buzima buangae ,
i wonder how i am going to return to school . ||| ubwo nkaba nfite n' ikibazo cyo kusubira kuiga ,
this is a problem i face up to this moment . ||| uyu mwaka ubu niyo gahunda nfite kugeza n' izi saha nibyo bibazo nfite .
do you have a house ? ||| ese ufite icumbi
i do n't have a house , i rent ; i live in a rented house . ||| icumbi nta cumbi nfite , ntakodesha ,
i stay in there and when i manage to get the rent which is five thousand rwandan francs i pay it . ||| nba munzu y' inkodeshaanyo nta cumbi ngira , nyine ubwo nbaho ngaho bakancumbikira nbona ayo kukodesha ibihumbi bitanu nkayatanga ibihumbi bingahe gutyo nkayatanga ,
sometime they even want to throw me out of the house but god helps me , or i meet a good person and he @/ she gives me two thousand rwandan francs so i pay it that way coz that is the only money with me . ||| hakaba n' igihe bashaka no kunsohora mu nzu ariko imaan ikancira inzira nbona umugiraneza nkabona yenda ampaye ibihumbi bibiri nka bibakinga mu maso nkabona burije buracyeye nubwo buzima nbayemo .

what is the image , or thing that will cause you not to forget genocide in your entire life or your memories ? ||| ese n' iyihe shusho n' ikihae kintu kishobora kutuma buri kihae genocide itazasibangana mu mateka yawe cg mu buzima bwawe ?
the thing or image that will make me not forget genocide in my memories or my thoughts is the way my brother was killed , how he was killed . ||| ikintu kitazatuma genocide itazasibangana mu mateka yanjye mu mutawe wanjye no mu mateka nba nrabonye muri genocide , ishusho ya musaza wanjye uko bamwishe , uburyo bamwishe ,
this will cause me to always remember him . ||| nicyo kintu kitazatuma mwibagirwa ,

today is 23rd of march 2007 . ||| uyu munsi n' itariki ya 23 ukwezi kwa gatatu , umwaka w' ibihumbi bibiri na karindwi .
we are at kacyiru together with father muzungu bernardini where we are going to have a conversation on history . ||| aha turi ni ku kacyiru turi kumwe na padiri muzungu bernardin aho tugiye kuganira nawe ku mateka .
father bernardini muzungu can you start by introducing yourself . ||| padiri bernardin muzungu mwaba mugira ngo mutangira mutuibwira .
like you already said , i am called bernardin muzungu and i am a dominican father i live here in kacyiru . ||| nk' uko umaze kubivuga nitwa bernardini muzungu nkaba ndi umu padiri w' umudominikani nba hano ku kacyiru .
i was born back home on a hill called buhoro in nyaruguru , i was born in 1932 . ||| aho nvuka iwacu ni ku musozi wa buhoro muri nyaruguru , nvutse muri mirongo itatu na kabiri .
i got here amongst the dominican fathers through the lengthy journey of schooling starting from kibeho , in the elementary school in kabgayi , being part of the dominicans made me go to countries abroad , france , sweden , england , canada . ||| ubwo rero nrinze ngera hano mu ba padiri b' abadominikani nciye mu nzira ndende y' amashuli kuhera i kibaeho , mu mashuli abanza i kabgayi , mu badominikani bitumye njya mu bihugu byo hanze , ubufaransa , ubusuwisi , ubwongereza , canada .
you have begun well , that is a very important question having the first point to what i am going to say , the history of the world and that of rwanda like i will talk about here , is got from things i read but in brief because often when we are asked you find someone just merely speak ||| eh utangiye neza icyo n' ikibazo cy' ingenzi kirimo igisubizo cy' ibanze mubyo nza kuvuga byose , amateka y' isi n' amateka y' u rwanda nk' uko nza kubivuga ahangaha nrabikura mu bintu nsomye ariko mu magambo makeya kuko kenshi na kenshi iyo batubajije usanga umuntu apfa kuvuga kusa .
i want to tell those who will be able to hear me that what i am talking about comes from three chapters of the history of rwanda . ||| nragira ngo nbwirae abashobora kuzanyumva ko ibyo nvuga biva mu bigega bitatu mu mateka y' u rwanda .
i will start from the first chapter , and what happened before that . ||| ikigega cya mbere ari nacyo nza kuheraho ,
the history of rwanda we know , in french it is math , archaeology and fossils that scholars found on earth that told them the history before man could write , i think that you all heard about it . ||| n' ibyabaye mbere yayo mateka y' u rwanda tuzi , mu gifaransa ni mate ni archeologie n' ibisigarataka abahanga basanze kw' isi bakamenya amateka n' inberae y' igihe cy' uko abantu bari bazi kuandika ngira ngo muesae mwarabyumvise .
the first human on earth in the bible is called adam and also eva , they say that they were in africa , which is very close to here , our home , i will start from here . ||| umuntu wa mbere uvutse kw' isi bibiriya imwita adamu ndetse na eva , bavuga ko bari muri afrika ndetse afrika ya hafi ahangaha iwacu , aho nraza kuhahera .
these therefore are the things we find in those fossils . ||| ibyo rero ni n' ibintu tusanga muri ibyo bisa bisigarataka .
and the other chapter in which we find history especially us rwandans is the one which our forefathers told us , i think we all know that we find stories and many other things , names of hills but usually the source of these stories or way through which we get these ideas of rwandans and their true history which is with evidence are three ||| ikindi kigega tusangamo amateka cyane twebwe abanyarwanda n' ayo abakurambere batubwiye , tuesae ngirango turabizi tusanga imigani n' ibindi byinshi , n' amazina y' imisozi ariko cyane amasoko tusangamo iyo migani cyangwa se inzira tukuramo ibyo bitekerezo by' abanyarwanda n' amateka y' abanyarwanda by' ihame kandi byanditswe bifashe biri ubutatu .
the first are poems , i think you have all heard that poems exist and that they existed starting with queen nyirarumaga in the 16th century . ||| icya mbere n' ibisigo ngira ngo muesae mwumvise ibisigo uko biriho bibayeho bitangiraanye n' umwamikazi nyirarumaga mu kinyejana cya 16 .
then there is the second one , royal secrets , royal secrets also are things which started long ago with gihanga . ||| hakabaho icya kabiri ubwiru , ubwiru nabyo n' ibintu bitangiye kera bitangiye ndetse na na kihanga .
the royal secret keeper of the ancient basinga clan who was called rubunga who was the one who brought royal secrets to the banyiginya clan and told them to gihanga , which resulted in that ritual of continuing to teach the royal secret keepers during the reign of the banyiginya clan . ||| n' umwiru w' abasinga ba kera witwaga rubunga akaba nyina umwiru w' abasinga akaba ariwe uzanye ubwiru mu banyiginya akawubwira kihanga , ndetse bikamuvairmo kugira uwo muhango wo kuzagumya kubiigisha abiru bo ku ngoma y' abanyiginya .
what existed before kingdoms in this country ? ||| uti mbere y' abami muri icyi gihugu ahangaha habaaga iki ?
coming back to the scholars who base their research on fossil findings say our country , our region and africa is where they all claim without doubt that the first human being was discovered here . ||| nsubiye muri abo bantu babanyabwenge babikesha kureba ibyasigaye mu butaka , iki gihugu cyacu , aka karerae kacu n' iyi afrika yacu kubera ko ariho abo bose bahamya nta kushidikanya k' umuntu wa mbere ariho yabonetse .
this made them explore this place because of the fossils which revealed how the first human beings were . ||| bitumye bahashakisha kubera ibisigazwa bigaragaza abantu ba mbere uko bari bameze .
there reached a time when explorers came to rwanda and burundi . ||| bije kugera igihe ndetse haza n' abanyabwenge baza no mu rwanda no mu burunri .
and you often hear that ancient human beings including the king used to hunt . there was also if you analyse the period when the forest reduced is when cattle came , like they say , when cattle graze . ||| kandi murabiumva kenshi aba kera ndetse n' umwami hari ikintu cyo kuhiga . hakaba rero nyine urebye ndetse aho ishyamba regabanukiye haje inka ,
the thick forest is destroyed and then demolished . ||| niko bavuga inka zikarisha ishyamba rikarivunja riza maze kuhatazura .
then the hoe followed , if you observe , i will come back to it , is when they begun to come up with names we are used to now like hutu , tutsi and twa you see that those they called the twa were hunters . ||| rero isuka irakurikira , iyo ubigenzuye rero nraza kaongera nbivugae eh niho bahereye babona bahimba ama amazina tumenyereye ubungubu ngo y' abahutu n' abatutsi n' abataw ukabona ko baise abataw n' abari bafite umwuga wo kuhiga .
those who bred and herded cattle were called the tutsi , those who were cultivators were called the hutu but you realize they were one people . ||| abari bafite umwuga wo ku korora no kuragira inka baki babaise abatutsi ,
we shall later come to see how the error of calling it tribes came to be . ||| abari bafite umwuga wo kuhinga babaiga babaita abahutu ariko uraumva bari abaturage bamwe batandukanyaijew n' imyuga turaza kureba ukuntu ikosa rije kuza nyuma byo kubiita ngo ni amoko .
those are the people we know of and what existed before the time of kings , in brief that is what one can say and i think that is enough so that we continue our journey of the questions you are going to ask me ||| ehh ngabo abantu tuzi n' ibyari bihari mbere y' iki kihae tuvuga cy' abami , mu magambo make ni nk' ibyo umuntu yavuga kandi ngira ngo biba bihagije kugira ngo tukomezae urugendo rw' ibibazo wenda muza kunbaza .
let me quickly ask a question , you have told us that those who were hunters were called the batwa while others were called the hutu and others were called the tutsi . ||| nhita nbaza ikibazo , muratubwiye muti abahigaaga babaise abataw abandi babaita abahutu abandi babaita abatutsi .
what made them for example the people who bred became called the tutsi , what was considered so as to call the tribe that bred cattle the tutsi ? ||| ese n' iki kitumye nk' urugero nvuga nk' abantu ba ba bari baoroye babi bataitaaga abatutsi hari ikintu cyagenderewe kugirango ubwoko bwororaga buitwae abatutsi .
as well as one who hunted to be a twa ? ||| ibyo bihita binajyana no kuba uwahigaga nawe yaba umutaw ?
there are things we know of which are also spoken of which may not be well known or came from the history which people do n't know well and say that those three groups of people you have told us about did not reach rwanda at the same time there are those who say that the tutsi came last and others who say that the hutu reached first . ||| ese ko hari ibintu tuzi banavuga bati nabyo bishobora kuba wenda bitazwi neza cyangwa biraturutse ku mateka abantu batazi neza bavuga ngo ayo abo bantu utubwiye batatu ngo ntibagereye mu rwanda rimwe hari abavuga ngo abatutsi baje nyuma hari abavuga ngo abahutu bagezemo mbere .
is that right ? can you tell us something about that but starting with the question of naming , what was the reason behind it ? ||| ibyo nabyo mwaza kugira ikintu mubitubwiraho ariko muhereye kw' icyo kintu cyo kuita amazina , bigirairw bitewe n' iyihe mpamvu ?
i will come to that , we shall talk about it . there is a man called speak who brought that theory of tribes , if you are patient we shall get to it in a little while , but rather the question is how the cultivators or the breeders or the hunters came to be called tribes , if you can be patient , i will explain it to you . ||| ehh ii nraza kubigeraho turaza kubivuga hari umuntu witwa speek niwe uzanye iyo theorie y' amoko niwihangana rero turaza kubigeraho mu kanya kikora wenda ikibazo n' uko ara abahinzi ar' aborozi ari n' abahigi ukaba ubungubu babaita ngo n' amoko uu wihanganye rero nraza kubikaumvaish .
i said that they were just natives , and it is archaeology because no one saw them . ||| ubundi nvuze y' uko kusa ari abaturage bo ni archeologie ntawababonye .
it is archaeology giving an example as to why they say what they say like what we see here if we can maybe say like archaeologists who found blacksmiths . ||| ni archeologie tuvugae nk' urugero icyatumye babivuga mbese ibyo bavugaaga nk' ibi tu reba hano niba mugira hari tuvugae nk' aba abo bacukura basanze hari abacuzi .
here in this book , there are photos of hummers and small rocks , i think if it were visible one could see that there are small ropes here and pots . ||| hano muri iki gitabo harimo ibintu by' amafoto y' inyundo n' ubutare n' iki n' amabuye , ngirango niba bibonekaaga umuntu yabona hari inzitso hano n' utubindi .
when they say that the first human being was from africa , close to here , the assumption that they came from somewhere else is a misunderstanding , they did not come from anywhere , instead they came from here to other places and those who migrated were coming from here . ||| iyo bavuze y' uko ehhee umuntu wa mbere avuka muri afrika ndetse afrika ya hafi ahangaha , kuzana igitekerezo cyo kuvuga ngo bavuye ahandi ibyo nu nu n' ukutumva ikibazo neza ; ntaho bavuye ndetse ahubwo bazava ino bajya n' ahandi n' abimukira bazaba bavuye iwacu .
to say therefore that the hutu , tutsi and twa are tribes , i will explain it to you in a while and where it came from , now let us only say that where archaeologists found cow dung were cattle keepers , the hoe was also discovered . ||| kuvuga rero ngo abahutu n' abatutsi n' abataw nubwo igitekerezo ki cy' ubwoko nraza kukisobanura mu kanya n' aho kiturutse , ubu tuvugae kusa aho bacukura basanze harimo amase bati bari batu baoroye inka ,
they were found in the ground and they found them not to be present day hoes but those of long ago , so there was also cultivation , there were cows , they also found jaws of cows . ||| isuka na none iragaragara hari ibisuka babisangaaga mu bitaka kandi bakasanga atari amasuka y' ubu ari aya kera uhh kuhinga nabyo nyine , hari n' inka basanzemo hari na amandibiri y' inka basanze .
try to look closely when you are in the national museum of butare , there is a jaw of a cow of that time which was measured . ||| uzarebae muri mu mu rugo rwa hariya rw' indangamurama , indangamurage i butare hari hari urwasaya rw' inka rw' icyo kihae bapimye .
you see then that things to do with the problem of tribes , which i will answer later if you can be patient , are things which honestly came later , they came later and not at the time which people think , it is in the 7th century bc , a long time ago , they too did not know yet , saying that they lived in ethiopia , which ethiopia at that time did not yet have people who travelled . ||| uraumva rero n' ibintu n' ukuvuga ngo ngo ibyo bibazo rero by' amoko n' iki witonde nraza kubisubiza n' ibintu bije nyuma rwose , bije nyuma s' igihe cy' abantu batekereza ni ikinyejana cya karindwi mbere ya yezu kristu ni kera cyane , bari batarabwira nabo bavuga bavuga ko bari batuye muri ethiopia , niyo ethiopia icyo kihae yari itaragira abantu batembera .
in reference to those people you have told us who were cultivators while others were live stock keepers and others who were potters , what were their cultural similarities so as to know how the inhabitants of rwanda were related at that time . ||| ikindi ahongaho nyine kuri abo bantu mutubwiye ko bahingaaga abandi bakorora abandi bakabumba , bahurairaga kuwuhae muco ? kugirango bamenye ko ari abaturage b' u rwanda ari abavandimwe icyo kihae .
i beg your pardon ? ||| ubwo uuragi u urabajije cyangwa uragira ngo
during the reign of gihanga , the kingdom if rwanda had been established , what can you tell us about the way of life of the rwandan society ? ||| ku ngoma ya kihanga ubwo u rwanda ruri rumaze kubaho mwatubwira uko uvuga ku bierekeye imiterere y' umulyango nyarwanda .
we shall add the second one later . ||| ehh buretse turaza kaongera icya kabiri turaza kukiongera nyuma .
let us start with the way of life in rwanda then the leadership of the settlement . ||| reka tubanzae imiterere mu nyarwanda hanyuma ubutegetsi bwi bw' intuza .
the father has just finished telling us about the way of life in this region we are living in , the time before history . ||| turi tumaze padiri yaramaze kutuganirair ku miterere yaha y' aka karerae tutuyemo mu kihae cya mbere y' amateka .
poems truly are the first source , in the royal secrets , the royal secret keepers especially speak of how the leadership of the country is , i will come back to it in a little while of course , there were also riddles and family lineages of the kings and how they succeeded each other like the queens and the tribes of rwanda which were called also went succeeding each other on the throne ||| mu bisigo ariyo soko ya mbere rwose , mu bwiru abiru b' i ibwami , abiru b' ibwami cyane cyane bavugaaga uko imitegekere y' igihugu imeze , nraza kubisubiraho gatoya mu kanya nyine , hakabaho n' ubucurabwenge , ubucurabwenge n' uku n' ibisekuruza by' abami uko bagiye basimburaan n' uko abamikazi n' amoko yababyaraaga baitaaga ibaibanda nabo bagenda bakuraanw ku ngoma .
it started therefore like we said a while ago that here in rwanda , they found a long time ago , before jesus , hunters , livestock keepers and cultivators . ||| bikitangira rero hatangira ku mu kanya tuvugaaga y' uko u rwanda aha tuhasanze kera mbere ya yezu hari abantu bahiga , baorora , bahinga .
after some time they came together and became many , then they ruled so as to live together , if one is to explain it properly , one can start from how the society of rwanda started , i will also add on how it came to give birth to a kingdom . ||| biratinze rero baza kuigiraan baza kuba benshi baza kutegeka kushaka ukuntu babana , tuvugae umuntu abivuze neza yabanza kuhera ku mulyango ku mulyango w' abanyarwanda uko utangiye nza kungeraho ndetse ukuntu bije kubyara igihugu .
that is ok . ||| ehh noneho bikunda .
a family as we know it is a man or a boy and a girl who come together and give birth to children . ||| uraumva rero umulyango uko tuwuzi ubundi n' umugabo n' umuhungu n' umukobwa bashakana bakabyara abana .
while the rwandan family is still small , be it three people that is man , woman and children before they are married is called a home , that you know . ||| umu umulyango w' abanyarwanda igihe ukiri mutoya uba uko ari batatu umugabo n' umugore n' abana batarashaka witwa urugo ibyo murabizi .
after the homes have become many to the level of grandparents , they are called households after the households had become many and populated , one would go and live over there on the hill . ||| ingo iyo zimaze kuba nyinshi zikigera ku musekuruza basangiye babiitaaga inzu inzu , inzu iyo zamaraaga kuba nyinshi kandi iyo zamaraaga kuba zituwe umuntu yaragendaaga akatura hariya ku musozi .
you all know that the children , on the hill , would settle next to him as he went on taking over . ||| y' uko murabizi muesae ku musozi abana bakagenda bamutura impande ,
hills while he still had strength . ||| akagenda afata umusozi igihe yaba akishyira mu ntegae .
and get his own portion of land . ||| yaragendaaga akafata ukwe igikingi cye kianga ubukonde bwe .
when the houses become many , they were then called clans , those clans would have an area in which they lived and also ruled , protecting their land and property , later it came to be called a kingdom , that is how kingdoms came about . ||| igihe rero inzu zabaga nyinshi nazo bazaitaaga ubwoko ubwoko , bwa bwoko rero bukaba bufite igipande butuyeho ndetse butegeka bwicungaho ku butaka ku matungo kuki , biratinze rero babiita igihugu igihugu , n' uko igihugu kije .
later on after the kingdoms had become numerous with clans , i think you know about kingdoms made up of clans we hear about them , we find them especially in this book by father kagame , it is the one i wanted to show you called inganji karinga , it is where he showed us where the banyiginya clan begun their reign with gihanga , it is in this book that we are told the kingdoms which were in our region , which was later called rwanda . ||| biranatinda rero ibihugu bimaze kuba byinshi by' amoko , n' ibihugu by' amoko ngirango murabizi tujya tubiumva , tukabisanga rero cyane cyane muri aka gatabo ka padiri kagame niyo nagirango nbaerekae kaitwa inganji karinga , niho yatueretse aho abanyiginya batangiraiye kugira ingoma yabo kuri kihanga , niho muri aka gatabo batubwira ibihugu bibaga muri aka karerae kacu kaje kuitwa u rwanda nyuma .
the kingdoms that existed around the time of gihanga , in the baziga clan which we now call bubari is in the nation park , also in ndowra was the reign of the bashambo , you realize that it is the kingdom of the bashambo it was over there in kibungo , gisaka , of the bagesera , here in nduga , there were the babanda and here where we are seated also were others and in many other places . ||| ingoma zari zihari uhh nk' aho kihanga yatangiraiye , mubae mu bazigaba hari ubu ahitwaaga mu bubari ubungubu ni muri park national , hakaba ha hariya mu ndorwa , hakaba abashambo ingoma y' abashambo , uraumva ni ni n' igihugu cy' abashambo n' ingoma y' abashambo ; hakaba hariya za kibungo mu gisaka h' abagesair , ha mu nduga , hakaba ababanda aha tuicaye naho hakaba abandi ii ee n' ahandi henshi .
gihanga begun his rule by trying to bring together all those small kingdoms made up of clans , he started by working together with others but you realize they begun from a home to household to clans , a clan does not mean what we term it as that is to say hutu and tutsi , tribe meant what is called clans , those were tribes . ||| kihanga rero yatangiye ingoma yo kusa nk' aho yashyira hamwe utwo duhugu twose tw' ibihugu by' amoko , muby' ukuri nawe yatangiye afatanya n' abandi ariko uraumva batangiraiye ku ku rugo , ku nzu , ku bwoko ,
this has led me to show you another book which talks about it clearly . ||| ubwoko s' ukuvuga ibi bi tuihaye byo kuvuga ngo n' abahutu n' abatutsi , ubwoko n' ukuvuga abo baita les clans ibyo biri ubwoko ndetse nkaba bitumye nbaereka n' ikindi gitabo kivuga ibye neza .
that is how it was . ||| ng' uko uko biri bimeze . ubwoko rero nako umulyango ubaga ufite umutware , umubyeyi yagiraaga umutware ,
a family had a head , a parent those heads of every family , family in this case means household , in the clan they were ruled by their leader who headed the whole family and was called the king , the king is to say the popular one in ancient kinyarwanda , to be famous is like being popular . ||| abo batwarae bose rero ba buri mulyango , umulyango n' ukuvuga inzu , ubwoko bama bakaba aribo bategekaw n' umukuru wabooo utegekaaa umulyango we wose akaitwa umwami , umwami n' ukuvuga uwa kuamamara kwama kera n' ikinyarwanda cya kera ,
later the king of the banyiginya who was called mukobanya , kigeli mukobanya the 1st . ||| kwama ni nko kwamama ni nko kuba ikiamamarae kuba ikirangirire . biratinze rero umwami w' abanyiginya witwaga mukobanya , kigeli mukobanya wa 1 .
he gained the wisdom of never again sharing with children , before they used to go together and they would be let 's say like the basinga or especially like in gisaka . ||| yibuka ubwenge bwo kutongera gusangiza kusangira n' abana inberae baragendaaga bakigiraan bamwe bakaba tuvugae nka nk' abasinga cyangwa se nka tuvugae nka cyane cyane tuvugae nka ee nko mu gisaka ,
in gisaka is where it took long to be part of rwanda because it became part of rwanda during the reign of rwabugiri the 3rd . ||| mu gisaka niho bitinze kutaba u rwanda rwose kuko bibaye u rwanda kuri rubukiri iii abagesair babazirankende iii .
mukobanya is the one who started conquering countries and colonizing them by putting his own rulers , he went bringing things together , that is what gave birth to rwanda . ||| uwo mukobanya niwe wa utangiye ubwenge bwo kufata i gihugu akagiko akagikoroniza akashyiraho abategetsi be , akagenda noneho agira ibintu yegeranya n' utuntu twose nibyo bije kubyara u rwanda .
before they were just small kingdoms , rwanda was only made up of the banyiginya but it was not a kingdom when it had just annexed others , rwanda existed but together with others relatives , and came together with others . ||| mbere hose turi uduhugu n' u rwanda rubaye u rwanda rwa rw' abanyiginya ariko rutari u rwanda rw' igihugu ki ki kifata ibindi , hakaba u rwanda ariko akabana n' abandi , akava inda imwe n' abandi , akaterana n' abandi .
mukobanya is the one who worked together with others to get things for himself . ||| mukobanya niwe ukoranye ibya rusangizi nako ibyo kusangira n' abandi arabiiharira .
that is where the word to escape from rwanda originated from and he then established the rwanda of gasabo . ||| aho rero niho ijambo ryo kucika u rwanda ritangiraiye ashinga rero noneho n' u rwanda rwa gasabo ;
when you see the way i put together a society and kingdom ... it begun as a society , society came from home and as it grew to become a large kingdom , it became many small kingdoms , the banyiginya came and brought together those small kingdoms after winning them in battle and made them a united kingdom . ||| ubirebye rero uko nbifatanyaije umulyango n' igihugu shema tushyira hamwe ngo biri bimeze bite ? bitangiye ari umulyango , umulyango uvuye ku rugo bimaze kugenda bikuze biba igihugu cyose biba uduhugu twinshi , abanyiginya baraza ntaw duhugu twinshi baratuegeranya baratutsinda mu ntiambara batugira igihugu cya mugabo umwe .
mukobana is the one who brought that ideology of one nation , he established a government of course , i can not go through the whole government except that there was a king who ruled together with those he shared with the leadership . ||| mukobanya niwe uzanye iyo dini yo kuzana igihugu kimwe , ashyiraho ubutegetsi rero nyine , ubutegetsi ntinbisubiramo byose tu uretse umwami yariho akafatanya n' abo basangiye ubutegetsi ni bande ? hari abatware ,
there were the commanders of the army guarded the whole country . ||| aba abatware b' ingabo bo rero bagacunga igihugu cyose .
but concerning the country 's wealth , there were heads of wealth , that is to say those who looked after the resources , there were also cultivators who headed all cultivators who was known as the head of the land . ||| ariko mubierekeye ubukungu bw' igihugu hakabaho abatware b' umukenke n' ukuvuga abategeka iby' ubutunzi babanri tuvuze , hakabaho n' abahinzi bo kutegeka abahinzi akaitwa umutware w' ubutaka .
there were three branches of government , they did not put a government for hunters , often they all were hunters especially in the royals who hunted more than others , potters also moulded of course but that did not mean that they were leaders . ||| inzego z' ubutegetsi zikaba eshatu uko ari eshatu , ntabwo bigeze bashyiraho ubutegetsi bw' abahigi iii abahigi kenshi ni cyane kuhiga bose barahigaaga cyane cyane i bwami niho bahigaaga kurusha n' abandi ee ababumbyi nabo barabumbaaga nyine bitari ibyo kuvuga ngo n' abatware .
and those who were potters . that was the government . ||| n' aba vu babumbaaga nyine mujyae mubiumva .
i will talk about how it later came to be removed , later when white men came , they removed that government which was of three branches and made it one , they became chiefs , assistant chiefs and others but that is something else . ||| ubutegetsi rero bubaye ubwo nraza kuvuga ukuntu baje kubikuraho nyuma , nyuma aho abazungu aho bazaiye bakuyeho ubwo butegetsi uko ari batatu barabuvunja babuhindura kimwe , bihinduka aba chefs , aba sous chefs n' iki ariko ibyo biraza kuba ibindi .
that is what i can say on how the government of that time was there was something similar to democracy because the king , after they had one government when the banyiginya clan had conquered , that is nganji karinga . ||| urebye rero n' uko nvuga ubutegetsi bw' icyo kihae uko buri bumeze habaaga ikintu rero kijya kusa na democratie kuko umwami aho bamaze kugira ubutegetsi bumwe aho abanyiginya bamaze kuganza niyo nganji karinga .
after the banyiginyahad conqured other kingdoms , of all those kings that existed , after inganji karinga had conqured others , they looked for a way of woking together with societies which were strong , there were societies called ibibanda , ibibanda are the ones who give birth to the royal family . ||| karinga ingoma yabo y' abanyiginya imaze kuganza izindi zahozeho nazo , zabo bami bose zabagaho , inganji karinga imaze kuganza izindi bashatse ukuntu bafatanya n' imilyango ikomeye , hari imilyango yitwa ibaibanda ,
in the ancient royal family to be honest , the king came from the banyiginya clan but had queens who resembled , the queen with whom he shared the throne had a clan from which she came from . ||| ibaibanda n' ababyara abami . ubwami bwa kera rero muby' ukuri umwami yavaaga mu banyiginya ariko akagira abamikazi basa , umwamikazi basangiye ubutegetsi wa mwamikazi nawe akagira amoko avamo .
from the bega clan there were 10 and after there came the bakono clan , then the baha clan , then the bagesere clan , then the first from the muzigaba clan was a true muzigaba , it was a way in which they included something similar to democracy of today . you see therefore , i can not say it in many words but the ancient rule had something similar to democracy , there was unity , there was especially in the general leadership of the army which one may call administration of today , it is like the government of today but there is a government concerning three resources of the country , livestock breeders and cultivators . ||| abega habaye icumi hanyuma hajyaho abakono , hajyaho abaha , hajyaho abagesair , hajyaho n' umuzigaba uwa mbere yari n' umuzigaba muby' ukuri , ee buri uburyo bwo bashyiramo akantu kameze nka democratie y' ubungubu . uraumva rero ni nk' uko ntinvuga mu magambo menshi ariko tuvugae ubutegetsi bwa kera ni nk' uko , harimo ikintu cya democratie , harimo ikintu cy' ubumwe , harimo ikintu cyo kushyiraho cyane cyane n' ubutegetsi bwa rusangae ubutegetsi bw' ingabo umuntu yabwita administratif iby' ubu ni nka leta y' ubu ariko hakaba n' ubutegetsi bwerekeye k' ubukungu bw' igihugu iii aborozi n' abahinzi .
that is what came to give birth to the words that clans are not calms because nobody was only a cultivator , nobody was only a livestock breeder , no society was only made up of livestock breeders and another made up of cultivators only , that is a lie , we were related and one would become a cultivator and another a livestock breeder . ||| ibyo nibyo bije kubyara by' ukuri ayo magambo ngo n' amoko s' amoko kuko nta ntawabaga umuhinzi kusa nta n' uwabaga umworozi kusa nta nta n' umulyango ubagamo aborozi kusa undi ngo ubaemo abahinzi kusa ibyo n' ukubeshya , ubaga tubaga tuva inda imwe umwe akaba umuhinzi undi akaba umworozi .
in a few words i think i can stop there and maybe you can ask me anything on that . ||| ehh nraumva mu magambo make nagirango nhinair ahongaho wenda mwaza kuba mwagira icyo mwabaza muri ibyo .
you have just finished telling us about the way of life in the rwandan society and you went on to tell us a bit about the governance . i want us to therefore go deeper into the way of governance of the country . ||| ehh ubwo rero mumaze kutuganirair aa ku miterere y' umu y' umulyango nyarwanda ehh mwakomojeho mutangi muvuga gato no kubintu ku ehh mitegekere ho gatoya .
you told as that governance result from people coming together coming from families to the households which came together . ||| ngira ngo rero tusae nk' aba nk' abainjira cyane muri iyo mitegekere y' ubutegetsi bw' igihungu . ehh mwatubwiye ko ubutegetsi bukomotse , ukuntu abantu bagiye baegeranya bava havuye hari umulyango bikagera ku nzu , inzu zikaiegeranya
and they became clans . ||| zikaba ubwoko .
and they became clans , you told us that the banyiginya clan was the clan from which rwanda came from but there were other clans in this region , and many other kingdoms here . ||| zikaba ubwoko , mutubwira mu ubwoko bw' abanyiginya kuko aribwo bwa bukomokaho u rwanda ariko aha muri aka karerae hakaba hari harimo andi moko , hari harimo n' ibindi bihugu byinshi ahangaha .
i want you to tell us how that kingdom of the banyiginya , that kingdom of the banyiginya , how it went in building rwanda . ||| nagirango mutubwirae ukuntu noneho abo banyi ee aa iyo iyo ngoma y' abanyiginya , icyo gihugu cy' abanyiginya kigiye kiubaka u rwanda .
did it go capturing other kingdoms , how did they capture them ? ||| ubwo se kigiye kifata mu ii mu binri bihugu kigiye kibifata kutae ?
those who were captured , how were they captured ? what would those that were captured give to be part of rwanda ? ||| ese abafashwae bafatawaga mu buhae buryo ? ese babageneraaga iki abandi bafashwae bakashyiraw muri urwo rwanda ?
but we will not make it long , it is in brief . ||| ehh ariko twe nti tujyae kubigira birebire ni mu magambo makeya yenda nvuze mu magambo makeya ,
speaking in a few words , if i talk about how they went about with it , often they went to war , you know that long ago in rwanda , there was something called an army , they were called an army and they came times of war ||| nvuze ukuntu bagiye babigenza kenshi bibaga mu ntiambara uziko mu rwanda kera hari ikintu kaitwaaga ingabo , zaitwaaga ingabo nyine ziizi zaza mu bibazo by' intambara .
all rwandans were part of the , army when they heard that rwanda had existed for long , the first weakness is that it all depended on the army . ||| abanyarwanda bose ba babaga bari mu mitwe y' ingabo , baumvise ko mu rwanda hahangaye ikintu cy' inberae cy' ubute byose biri bishingaiye ku ngabo .
the army had heads of government . ||| ingabo rero zikaba zirimo imitwe y' ubutegetsi bw' igihugu buri munyarwanda wese yabaga afite umutwe w' ingabo arimo ,
every rwandan belonged to a certain group of the army , therefore had many responsibilities but the most important was to fight for the country but there were many other things like dance , like doing all other duties , but they included fighting for the country . ||| ingabo rero zika zifite ibintu byinshi zikora ariko icy' ingezi akaba ari kurwanair igihugu ariko harimo n' ibindi bikorwa byinshi byinshi nko kuhamiriza , nko ku nko kukora n' indi mirimo y' ............. yose ariko hakabaho nyine no kuzarwanirira igihugu .
be it to stand for it or save it when it has been attacked . ||| ari ukukirengera ari no kujya kukiungura , kukirengera bakiteye no kukiungura uuhh .
if you take a close look what the banyiginya were better at than others was the wisdom of knowing how to safe guard the country and how to fight . ||| urebye rero abanyiginya icya icyo barushije abandi ahari n' uko babarushije ubwo buengae nyine bwo bwo nge bwo kumenya gutu gucunga igihugu bakabyi bakamenya kurwana .
they went therefore capturing small kingdoms while adding them to others and maybe they had better leadership like sharing and interacting , so how did they rule so as to govern them ? ||| bagiye rero bafata ibihugu bito bito bagenda babiongera ku binri wenda babarusha n' ubutegetsi bwiza nk' uko kusangira nk' uko kuvanga , ehh kuvuga rero ngo ba ba babategekaaga batae kugirango babayoborae ?
first of all is that they would go and remove them from leadership but share with them . ||| icyambere n' uko babasangi baragendaaga bakabaaka ubutegetsi ariko bakabasangiza .
the next question is on the history during the colonial time but before we go to the colonial time , there is a question i wanted to ask which i feel lays ground for the next question of the colonialists . ||| ikibazo gikurikiyeho rero tura turajya ku cyiciro cy' amateka mu kihae cy' ubukoroni ariko mbere mbere y' uko tujya mu kihae cy' ubukoroni hari akabazo nshakaaga kubaza numva kaba ka kasasair ikibazo tugiye kujyaho cy' ubukoroni .
history tells us that rwanda probably begun ||| eh uko amateka atubwira atubwira ko u rwanda ruba ruratangiraiye .
from rwagasabo which was one hill . the hill of gasabo , is there something you can tell us about it . ||| hariya rwa rwagasabo ari agasozi kamwe . ako gasozi ki ka gasabo nako muri bugirae icyo mukatubwiraho ,
the white man found extending to rwicanzizu , rwanda had grown big and extended to masisi , it was very large . ||| abazungu bakaba barasanze u rwanda rugera ku kiyaga cya rwincanzizu , u rwanda rurabaye runini harimo rugera na za masisi ari hanini cyane .
i therefore want that maybe we first answer the question of rwanda 's history , there reached a time of colonialists in 1897 . ||| ubwo rero ngira ngo wenda mbere y' uko munakubita kuku tutangira ikibazo ki amateka y' u rwanda hageze igihe cy' abakoroni muwi 1897 . mwatubwira iyo miterere ukuntu u rwanda rugendaaga ruba u rwanda koko rutera inberae , abantu barwinjiramo bashyashya ,
can you tell us how rwanda was changing and developing , as new people came , how far had rwanda reached ? ||| u rwanda ruri rugeze mu bahunde , rugeze mu bantu ba bahae na kure icyo .
i think it is better for us to have a few questions because we have a long way to go . ||| ariko ibiiza n' uko tuvuga ibibazo tu tubigira bikeya kuko ngira ngo urugendo ni rurerure .
let us talk about things like the conquests of rwanda , is to say that i had to start because they begun around ... how they were and things would be going too far ? ||| tuvugae nkabiriya byo kaungura u rwanda , programme yo kaungura u rwanda , programme n' ukuvuga ko ngomba kuhera ku kuko batangiye ko mu kinyeja uko bari bameze n' ibintu bijya bya bijya kure uraumva ?
let this be an opportunity for mr to tell you about this book i have so far told you about three books about clans , this book ‘ l' histoire du rwanda precolonial ’ , i wrote it a few years ago in 2003 , that is where i compared many things which are not even in this one of kagame . ||| ehh urabona iki gitabo ndagirango wenda bibae na na n' impamvu yo kukibabwira , maze kubabwira ibitabo ngirango bitatu cy' amoko iki , urabona iki gitabo kii l' histoire du rwanda precolonial nkianditse hashize imyaka mikeya mirongo ibihumbi bibiri naka na gatatu , niho negeranyaije ibintu byinshi n' ibitari muri iki cya kagame ehh .
if you take time and look at what went on , there is a way the banyiginya clan had their way of life and their knowledge in what they called royal secrets , what you can call the constitution today , look at ‘ constitutionnel ’ , is a book i am writing now which is about to come out . if you read that book you find the laws they went by so as to safe guard , stand for and save the kingdom , to save in terms of capturing other kingdoms , in terms of supporting it and also culturally . ||| iyo ubigenzuye rero iyo ubonye umwanya umuntu akaba yareba burya ibyagiye , ha hari ukuntu abanyiginya bari bafite mu miterere yabo mu buengae bwabo biri mu mu mu byo baise ubwiru , ubwiru n' ikintu umuntu yakuita nk' ubungubu nka constitution , reba constitutionnel ; n' igitabo nriho nandika ubungubu kigiye kusohoka . muri icyo gitabo rero iyo ukisomye ubona amategeko bagendairagaho kugira ngo bacunge igihugu ari ukukirengera ari ukukiungura , kukiungura mu mu mu buryo bwo ku kukibonera ibindi bihugu , kukiungura mu buryo bwo kubona kukitunga , kukiungura no mbese no mu muco .
the king had a way of solving it . ||| umwami yari afite ukuntu agira kugirango kikirae . ibyinshi rero biganaish ku bukirae bw' isi bw' u rwanda ,
let us talk about kings , kings had a way in which their names reflected their responsibilities . ||| tuvugae nku abami bari bafite , abami bari bafite ukuntu bakuramwa mu mazina no mushyingano .
there were two kings , one was called kigeli and the other mibambwe , there duty mainly was to conquer for rwanda . ||| hari abami babiri uwitwaga kigeli n' uwitwaga mibambwe akazi kabo cyane cyane kari ako kwa kugura u rwanda .
that was kigeli 's duty , whenever he was on the throne , he had to conquer for rwanda and his son too who was succeeded by the one called yuhi , yuhi was one who brought peace and security and he was also involved in thing to do with activities and all others which involved resting and others . ||| kigeli niko kazi ke iyo yimaaga ingoma yagombaaga kugura u rwanda n' umuhungu we mibambwe akazakurikiraw n' uwitwa yuhi , yuhi akaba uzana amahoro n' umutekano akaba ndetse uza mu bintu by' imihango n' ibindi byose bituma nko kuruhuka n' ibiki byose .
there were others for milk , the ones called kirima and mutara brought plenty to the kingdom , that is why mutara is place of cows , that is where that name came from . ||| hakabaho na n' abandi rero ba b' amata uwitwa kiraima n' uwitwa mutara bazana uburumbukae mu gihugu n' icyo kituma nyine naho mutara nyine ni mutara h' inka niho ririya zina riturutse n' iki .
that leads us to things concerning how the kingdom had to move forward . ||| uraumva rero bi bi biganaishije mu bintu bierekeye uko igihugu kigombaaga kujya mbere .
you were asking how kings let 's say amongst those kings who went far in what you were saying to benefited rwanda . ||| ubwo rero ubazaaga ukuntu ba abami bagiye tubigirae nka nko muri abo bami rero abagiye kure muri ibyo uvugaaga baunguye u rwanda ni ba mbere hari abaitwaaga izina rya ruganzu bari ku baba naryo ryari iry' abarwanyi ruganzu ,
first there were those called ruganzu , they were to be fighters of ruganzu , the first was ruganzu mpimba and ruganzu ndoli . ||| uwa mbere ruganzu mpimba na ruganzu ndori .
that name was removed from the history because those who were named after it ... it made them lose their lives . ||| iryo zina baje kuri kura mu mateka kuko rya abariiswe bose ba ribateye ubuvukasi ,
one was mutabazi ruganzu mpimba and another was killed , ruganzu ndoli and they were removed because it was cursed . ||| ritumye ba ba ba bagwa ku ku ku kahinga ii umwe yabaye mutabazi ruganzu mpimba undi baramwishe ruganzu ndoli babakura mu mubarae kuko ritewe n' ibyago ubuvukasi .
anda in kinyarwanda means a world without boundaries . ||| u rwanda , anda mu kinya , anda n' ukuvuga n' ukuvuga isi itagira imipaka , aanda ii .
kigali means large , without boundaries , it is one kigali , that is what they name it . ||| ehh kigali n' ikigali n' igihugu nyine kigali kitagira imipaka nyine , ni kigali kimwe rwose niko bakaise .
you have known that the first capital here was kigali , rwoya which was found in at the ends of kigali above in the ground in the woods above there . ||| umunye y' uko gapi capital ya mbere ya yaba ni kigali nyine rwoya ishinze hariya mu mu bushorishori bwa kigali hariya hejuru mu bitaka mu biti hejuru hariya .
gasabo of course is a churn of rwanda , of milk , it 's like saying it charns rwanda , it 's what churns milk for rwanda . ||| gasabo nyine neni n' igisabo nyine kaicundair u rwanda uraumva nyine cy' amata nyine nabyo ni ukuvuga u rwanda nyine ; ni n' igicundira u rwanda , n' igisabo nyine , n' igisabo kaicundair u rwanda amata .
over there in muhazi you see that it is its tributaries . ||| hariya ha mu mu muhazi ureba n' umwaro wayo .
thank you , continuing with our conversation with father muzungu , we have finished talking about . ||| eh murakoze , tukomeje mu kiganiro tugiraan na padiri muzungu eh turi turangije kuganira ku ntinvuga ngo turarangije nyine y' uko dukurikije gahunda tuihaye ,
i can not say that we have finished because were are following our program , we seemed to be talking about rwanda in the time of colonialists . ||| tuha noneho tusaga nk' abagira ganira ku rwanda mu kihae cy' ubukoroni .
can you tell us about rwanda in colonization in the time white men reached rwanda . ||| twagirango mutuganiraireho ku rwanda mu bukoroni mu kihae mbese u rwanda rugezawemo n' abazungu .
that 's a good question , it 's in line with what we were saying , in the same way i will divide it into two parts , that concerning how locals of rwanda were colonised and how the colonialists took over power in rwanda , i think that 's better . ||| eeye icyo n' ikibazo cyiza kirakurikira ibyo turi tumaze kuvuga , ni nka kwa kunri nagirango ngiraemo inzego ebyeri hari ibierekeye ii aa abaturage , abanyarwanda uko abakoroni babafashe n' ubutegetsi bw' abanyarwanda uko abakoroni babutwaye ngirango nibyo byiza .
let me start with the locals of rwanda , how were they colonized ? ||| eh umuntu yahera ndetse ku baturagae b' u rwanda abakoroni bamaze kuhagera babafashe batae ?
that 's where our problems started because the white man came with foreign ideology ||| eh aho niho hari umuzi w' ibyago tunyuzemo by' ukuri kubera ko abazungu baje hano mu rwanda bafite ibitekerezo bakuye ahandi .
there was a british man called captain john honing speak who came to our africa around this area in ethiopia and even reached uganda , then saw people of the hima tribe , babito tribe and then reached here and saw the rwandans especially the tutsi who of course looked like the hima who were cattle keepers . ||| hari umuzungu witwa w' umwongereza witwa capitain john honing speek yaje muri afrika yacu yo muri aka karerae za ethiopia agerayo za buganda abona abantu b' abahaima , b' ababito , ageze ino abona n' abanyarwanda cyane cyane abona aba abatutsi basa nyine n' abo bahaima aba b' aborozi .
after seeing this he thought that the tutsi were not rwandans but from up there in ethiopia , from the bagara , that they looked like the bagara who were the cattle keepers and drunk milk ||| amaze kubibona atyo rero yibwira y' uko abatutsi atari abanyarwanda ari abantu baturutse aho nyine ruguru iyo muri za ethiopia , mu bagara , ngo abanya basa n' abagara mu by' ukuri ari aborozi , ari abantu banywa amata .
milk has an effect on one who takes it . ||| amata burya afite ikintu ashyira ku muntu uyanywa .
he brought about the mentality that rwandase were not the same , that some that is the tusti came from up there and that the hutu are like the other africans from around , he brought about that mentality they are not from around this area , he gave us that mentality , we all thought were from around here without discriminating that this is an african or a kenyan or tanzanian or abisinya ||| azana rero bya bitekerezo by' uko abanyarwanda atari bamwe atari bamwe ko abatutsi ari abantu baturutse iyo ruguru ko abandi bahutu ari nk' abandi bairabura baturutse hairyo iyo hose , azana n' icyo gitekerezo cy' uko bafite aho bavuye atari abaturage b' ino , niwe wadukanye icyo gitekerezo ubundi turi tu mu kanya ngirango nbabwiye y' uko ubundi abantu bose baturutse ino , adam n' umunyarwanda n' ako s' umuti n' umunyafurika wenda n' umukenya cyangwa n' umutanzaniya cyangwa se nu abisinya n' iki .
he brought that . ||| azana ibyo rero abikase atyo .
other priests and white men with whom he was believed him and when he went back to his home he wrote a book talking about that trip he took to africa and in the 9th chapter of that book talked about rwanda in other words his discoveries here in africa called aux sources du nil in french , a book was written in france called aux sources du nil ||| eh abandi bapadiri n' abandi bazungu bari kumwe ba ba babifatair hejuru , yani yasubiye iwabo yandika igitabo kierekeye amateka y' urwo rugendo yagiraiye muri afrika ndetse umutwe wa wa cyenda w' icyo gitabo cye amateka y' u rwa nako ya y' imiterere ye y' imigendere ye hano muri afrika abiita mu gifaransa au source du nil , igitabo kiandikaw mu bufaransa kaitwa au source du nil .
here i have a book by a white man called alexander arnold , a white priest , he wrote this book called les peres blancs aux sources du nil ; he is one of the people who took on speak 's ideology and he made it a rule , speak said that it was just a thought but those that copied it believed that the tutsi were not real africans and that they came from up there ||| hano ntafite igitabo cy' umuzungu witwa alexandre arnord umupadiri wera , yanditse iki gitabo kaitwa les peres blancs au source du nil ; n' umwe mu bantu bafashe icyo gitekerezo cya speek nawe akigira nk' ihame ndetse speek yari yavuze ngo yavugaaga ati ntatekereza ko , kiri igitekerezo ariko abandi bose bakoporoye baje bagira bati si ukutekereza niko bimeze abatutsi s' abirabura b' ukuri n' abantu baturutse ruguru iriya .
there is another book by albert pages entitled ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique ’ , that is where they all support ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique . ||| hari n' ikindi gitabo cy' uwitwa albert pages kiwa au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique ,
’ that is where i said that the himites of here or the reign of the banyiginya or rwanda of the tutsi but i honestly do not think it 's the tutsi but rwandans . ||| ubwo abo bose n' aho bashingair au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrika aba hamite naho rero nvuze rero y' uko abahano ingoma ya hano y' aba y' abanyiginya cyangwa se rwanda y' abatutsi ariko s' abatutsi mu by' ukuri n' ingiro y' abanyarwanda .
it was followed by everyone else . ||| kije kuba umwanda kije kukurikizwa n' abantu bose .
when colonialists came , there came another problem , colonialist of two different kinds @: there came those whom i call of the trouser , that is to say civilians but there were also of the dress that is the priests . ||| abakoroni rero baje , baje biraza kubyara n' ikindi kibazo kinavunaish rero uraumva , baje bafatanyaije abakoroni baje bari amoko abiri : hari abakoroni ba bo nita b' amapantalon n' ukuvuga baba basiviri ariko hari n' abakoroni b' amakanzu n' uko ari n' abapadiri ,
they came in collaboration with the priests and wanted them to help the rule africa properly , tell us about these people and the african we can use . ||| baraje rero bafatanya n' abapadiri ndetse bashaka kugira bati mutufashe kutegeka iyi afrika neza mutubwira abantu , abirabura tukuifashaish .
and others said "@ is that what is difficult ? ||| maze ubwo aba abandi bati na hari ikiruhije se ?
we shall help you ||| turabazi .
there are people , the tustsi who have acknowleged that they are a tribe that was made up by someone , join hands with the tutsi , they know how to govern so asks them your helpers . @" ||| hari abantu , abatutsi bamaze kuhamya ko ari ubwoko kandi byo umuntu ubihimbaye , mwifatanye n' abatutsi bazi kutegeka aribo mugira abafasha banyu .
that 's when there came a change in the leadership in 1926 and 1927 of a resident called mortohani , he removed the deputy chiefs of before who were the germans , that time that man dismissed 30 twa deputy chiefs , that time leaders were not supposed to be hutu or twa , so in that reform the twa chiefs were dismissed and their list can be found at shyorongi ||| nibwo rero haje kuba ivugurura ry' ubutegetsi muri makumyabiri na karindwi na gatandatu na karindwi ry' umu resident wi umu resident witwaga mortohani , akuraho haho hariho aba sous chefs ba mbere bari batangiye nyine b' abadage a icyo kihae uwo mugabo yanyaze aba sous chefs b' abataw mirongo itatu , kera abategetsi ntibagombaaga ngo abahutu batu a e muri iyo reforme yanyaze aba aba aba sous chefs b' abataw liste yabo iriho na hariya i shyorongi hari umutaw barabanyaze .
and dismissed all hutu and even tutsi who were short , and only the tall tutsi were left saying that they were the only ones who knew how to govern . ||| banyaga abahutu bose uwitwa umuhutu wese n' abatutsi bagufi bose hasigaza abatutsi bo hejuru ; nibo baitwaaga ngo n' abantu bazi kutegeka bamenyereye kutegeka .
and can help the white man to govern and they will be rewarded with wealth a live comfortably . ||| bashobora kufasha abazungu kubategekair bo bakaicara bakaryohairw bakamerairw neza .
they were helped in this by the priests because the priests were put in place to educate the africans , to treat them and they were the ones who initiated any form of development like building houses , they were the ones while building their quarters who brought bricks and they were the ones who started road construction . ||| uraumva ibyo bintu rero , ibyo rero babifashwamo n' abapadiri ho gato kuberako abapadiri nibo bari bashizwe kuigisha abirabura mu mashuli , kuvura ndetse no ni nabo batangiye no kukora utuntu twa developpement nko kaubaka amazu ehh nkaza missioni baubakaaga nibo bazanye amatafari nibo batangiye no kaubaka imihanda n' iki .
the priests were able to help because they were the ones who brought christianity and started teaching families about it . ||| abapadiri rero urabona rero impamvu banabafashe n' uko nyine baitwaaga ngo bazanye ubukrisitu baje kugira kutae , baraza rero batangira kuigisha imilyango batyo .
in their teachings they started up leadership schools , until it got to a time when the colonialists would take over leadership since they were always on the side lines ||| ehh kwa kukoresha abaturage muri ibyo by' amashuli n' iki biganaish nyine no gusha n' amashuli abyara ubutegetsi , biza kugera igihe noneho ehh abakoroni baza no mu butegitsi kuko ba ba babupanze .
how do you think they made the locals leaders and how did the rwandans react to this ? ||| umva uko bagize abaturage aba abategetsi se bo abanyarwanda babafashe batae ?
that 's what i want to tell . ||| nibyo ngira ngo nabyo ngirae .
first of all they removed the rwandan form of governance , where by the king was the over all ruler of the country , they removed the king and replaced by leopold who was a white man , and they would continuously refer to him as the king ignoring our king . ||| murabiumva baraje rero icyo bakoze n' iki cya mbere ? n' ukukuraho ubutegetsi nyine bwa kinyarwanda , umwami bamwita ubundi umwami niwe utegekaaga i gihugu noneho baramuhindura bamukuraho bati umwami hano tuvugaaga umwami w' abanyarwanda ahinduka leopard w' umuzungu , uwacu bamwita ngo ni mwami ,
the leaders became servants so that they could show that it is that and those who were doubting stop doubting . ||| bakaba bavuga le roi w' umuzungu et le mwami ariko uwacu nta akavugaw le mwami ehh . abategetsi baba baba abakozi ndetse kugira ngo nbigaragazae ko aribyo bitana n' uwashidikanya ntashidikanyae .
the king who was there was musinga and when he did not agree with them they chased him away and he died in congo where they sent him after they realised that kmememba where they had sent him at first was n't far enough and he died at moba ||| umwami uri uhari musinga atabiumvise neza baramwirukana agwa ku kahinga murabizi uko yapfuye yaguye i congo baramwirukanye ajya i kamembe ndetse basanze atari kure bihagije bamwohereza i kamembe nako i congo yaguye moba uwo n' umwami .
they replaced him with his son rudahigwa , who had to agree that he was to be governed by the white man and was thus baptised . ||| undi bashyizeho umuhungu we rutahigaw yagombye rero kuemera y' uko agiye kuyoboka abazungu ndetse abatizwa .
the priest classy had a role to play in chasing away musinga and putting in place rudahigwa , he had a big role to play even in consoling the tutsi at that time who were only top officials . ||| musenyeri classy yabigizemo ari ukuirukana musinga ari kushyiraho rutahigaw musenyeri classy yabigezemo uruhare cyane ndetse no kutonaish abatutsi icyo kihae abaitwa ngo n' aba cya ariko abatutsi bari aba aba bategetsi bo hejuru kusa . rubanda rugufi , abatutsi bagufi bahinga bagira batae ntibari ntibaitwaaga abatutsi ndetse noneho ibyo ari biri abantu biri imi imyuga babihi babishyiran' amategeko , babishyira no mu mpapuro .
that is when they came up with identification papers . ||| nibwo bahimbaye impa , bashyiraho impapuro .
you see , to put in place the malice tribes was for what ? ||| uraumva rero ko ibyo kuvuga ngo n' ubwoko nabyo n' ukushakisha n' urugomo bashyiraho kusa rwo kugira kutae .
what the colonialists brought is that malice to change rwandans who were from the same womb . ||| uraumva abakoroni icyo bazanye rero n' icyo kintu cy' urugomo cyo kuhindura abanyarwanda bava inda imwe .
and they said that they were tribes that had no relation and then it came to exist on the royal throne , and they became enemies because they are the ones who brought not sharing of power . ||| bakavuga ngo n' amoko atagira icyo apfaan ndetse noneho biza no biza no kubyaraw mu ngoma , baranangana kuko aribo bazanye no no no kutasangira ubutegetsi ;
before they used to share but they gave it to some , it was written and we shall talk about it in a while that those they gave power came to reject it because they used to say that did not share with others . ||| mbere barabusangiraaga none babuharira bamwe , bizanabianditse turaza kubivuga mu kanya y' uko babanri ba ba babuhaye baza kubizira ba kuko baza kubizira kuko bazaaga bavuga ngo mwacuze abandi ii .
the way the ancient leadership was , they used to share things , there was something which people do not like called ubuhake . ||| n' ubutegetsi uko buri busanzwe bumeze hariho nk' abaza ku kugira nk' ibierekeye nk' uko ubutegetsi buri bumeze kera nk' uko abantu basangiraaga ibintu hariho nk' abantu bashoreza , hari nk' ikintu abantu baanga kenshi kandi batavuga nk' ibierekeye ubuhakae .
ubuhake is something people despised later on , work was introduced by the white man ; the whip and the prison too . ||| ubuhakae n' ikintu abantu baiyamye nyuma eeh akazi n' ibintu bizanywae n' abazungu , ikiboko n' abazungu babizanye , uburoko n' abazungu babizanye kera nta buroko bubagaho kera nta kiboko kibagaho .
ubuhake existed , it was not a bad thing , it was similar to how one goes to ask for a job today . ||| ikirekae ikindi rero ubuhakae bubagaho nabwo babwi babivangitiranya ubuhakae s' ikintu kiri kibi biri ibintu byu mbese ni nk' uko ubungubu umuntu ajya kusaba akazi ,
when you go to ask for a job in the government , is that serving ? ||| iyo ngiye kusaba akazi muri leta eeh n' ubuhakae ?
if you are lucky you get to be a servant , no one ever got beaten for it and neither did anyone ever say that come and serve me , a servant would do it if they wanted to . ||| ugize imaan ndetse abona ubuhakae , ubuhakae ntibiri , ntibiri uku nta muntu wigeze akubitairw kuhakwa nta muntu n' umwe wigeze aza ngo ngwino ujyae kumpakwaho , umugaragu yagendaaga abishatse .
long ago in ancient kinyarwanda , ubuhake was like a ladder one would climb so as to reach those who were superior to him . ||| kera rero mu kinyarwanda cya kera bitaraza muri urwo rw' ubungubu , ubuhakae buri nk' urwego umuntu yururiraho kugira ngo ashyikaire urwego rwo rw' abamuruta n' ukwisunga ukuruta .
what would your superior help you with ? the money of that time was cows , what did he have that you did not ? ||| ukuruta rero yakufashaishaga iki ? amafaranga ya kera yari inka , umu yakurushaaga iki ?
he could support you and fight for you . ||| amafaranga ya kera yari inka , umu yakurushaaga iki ? yashoboraaga no kuku no kuku kukugarukair no kukurwanaho kera hari hatarabaho ubutegetsi buvuganair ku bantu bose ,
long ago , there was not yet any kind of leadership that could speak for all people , your boss or superior would save you and could even fight for you when treated unfairly . ||| shobuja cyangwa umuntu ukuruta akakukiza kandi akaba yanakurwanaho urenganyae . ubuhakae rero kiri ikintu kiza icyo kihae ku buryo bw' icyo kihae nyine , ifaranga rwa kera ryari inka , urabiumva nta ndetse abantu nta n' umuntu utahakagwa rwose n' umwami yahakagwa na karinga niko bavugaaga ,
ubuhake therefore was a good thing at that time , the money of that time was cows and everyone including the king used to serve , even karinga , that is what they said , the rich were the ones who were befriended because they had what was worth serving for , if you do not own anything , you can not be served ||| ndetse abakire nibo babaga bahaatswae kuko babaga bafite ibihakaiyew , rubanda rutatunze ntacyo ruhakwaaga . baravuga ngo hari intero bavuga ngo nibashaka kwiyenza bakavuga ngo ngo ngo ngo abantu bararenganyae ngo rubanda rugufi , ng' abahutu bakubaiswe ngo ngo ng' ubuhakae utatunze inka ntiiigeze aaa utashaka inka nta ntawe bigeze bakubita ngo jya kuhakwa utazishaka yarazirekaaga .
another thing is every rich person was supposed to have a stepping stone even rudahigwa used in rwabutogo , everyone had someone to befriend . ||| ikindi rero umuntu uu ukize wese yagombaaga kuba afite akeneye urwego azamukairho umuntu wese aki aki nzungize , ngirumpatse umuntu mbese na rutahigaw yajyaaga yirahira rwabutogouhh , buri wese afite umuhatse . ni nk' uko tuvuga nyine umugaragu w' imaan ,
as we say a servant of god you 're a servant to one who is higher than you , everyone has a person who he is higher than , just like when one fails to get a job , a jobless person is like . ||| umugaragu wu ukuruta umuntu wese aba afite uwo yisombe , mbese nk' ukunguku uzarebae uwabuze akazi , umushomeri uko aba ameze iii . icyo kintu rero cy' ubuhakae ni n' uko kusa nyine aba abazungu babishyizemo urugomo babiita uburetwa ,
honestly , ubuhake , dictatorship and whipping are not the same thing , you can ask about it if you wish but those are things the white man brought . ||| babigira itegeko bavenga n' ibya kazi nyine biravanga biba bibi rero . mu by' ukuri rero ubuhakae n' uburetwa n' ikiboko s' ibintu bimwe rwose uhh , n' uwaza kubibaza wenda azae kubibaza niba ashaka ariko ibintu rero abazungu bazanye mu magambo make n' ibyo , cyane icyavuyemo n' iki ?
and favouritism is one of the reasons as to why there are those who killed others , also it is to say that there are tribes that have nothing in common . ||| n' uko gusumbanya abantu icyo ni kimwe n' ukuitirair y' uko hari abaishe abandi ikindi cya ikindi n' ukuvuga ko hari n' amoko atagira aho ahuraiye ikindi n' ukuvuga nu ,
the first and most important thing is obviously to make us their slaves , they came and took our power and made us dogs . ||| icya mbere cy' ingenzi nyine n' ukutugira abacakara babo , bakaza bakatuambura ubutegetsi bakatugira imbwa .
they sent away the king and those who remained would be whipped while they were naked , they would make them lie down and whip them with no clothes on , annoying humiliation . ||| umwami bakavuga ngo genda bakamwirukana abasigaye bakaba mbese niba bazanye no kuza n' umuntu kukubita umuntu ba aribyo baita kukura impuzu , barazaaga bakabarambika bakabakubita baku ba impuzu n' ukukura ku myenda baga bakakubita baambaye ubusa .
they use to respect women but they would also tell them to kneel down and slap them , is that human ? ||| agasuzuguro kateye umujinya sha yemwe abagore nibo bata batinya ariko nabo barababwiraaga ngo pfukama mugorae , pfukama bakukubitae inshi iii ibyo bintu n' ibintu .
that is what one can speak about the colonialists ||| abakoroni rero n' icyo kintu ba nibyo umuntu yabavugaho .
i will talk about how they came and what resulted from it , the riots of 1959 i even have a book that talks about it here . ||| nraza kuvuga aa ukuntu baje ku icyo bibyaye nyine , iby' imvururu yo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda nfite n' igitabo kibivuga kiri ahangaha niho tuza kugera .
in a few words and maybe you can ask some questions but this is how i can say it . ||| ehh mu magambo makeya wenda muzae kaongeraho ibibazo ariko n' uku nbivuga .
i would like to ask you a question , there are many people who follow laws that are not comprehensive or that do not exist or they confuse themselves about certain things because they do not understand . ||| n' uko nri ngiye nri nifuje kubabaza ikibazo , hari abantu benshi bagendair ku mateka eh adasobanutse cyangwa se nvuga atariho cyangwa se wenda bakajya bibeshya ibindi bintu bitewe no kutasobanukirwa .
the king musinga was exiled in kamemba because he did not agree with the white man and after that as you told us they sent him into exile in moba in congo . ||| umwami musinga bamuciraiye i kamembe kubera impamvu , ntabwo yumvikanye n' abazungu bigeze aho nk' uko mwabitubwiye baza kumucira moba muri congo .
it 's clear that there were some things that they did not agree on . ||| biragaragara ko hari ibyo bataumvikanyeho neza n' abazungu .
and go to church , he could not understand that because it was not his faith and indeed that religion of god had no fault and they removed it and up to now it makes no sense . ||| ngo n' ajyae mu misa n' agirae atae ,
even i as a preist i 'm one of the people who fought this . ||| ibyo nabyo ntiyari kumenya iyo idini atari idini ya ya kandi koko idini y' imaan ntacyo yari ibaye ba ba bayihinyuraagaho n' ubungubu n' ubusaw uhh nnjyae nd' umu padiri nbabwira nnjyae nd' umwe mu bantu barwanyaije bimwe .
they came and said that our faith was based on idolatry and wrote about this in a book called "@ god is our father @" fighting this . ||| baraje baravuga ngo idini yacu ngo abanyarwanda basenga ibigirwamana ibyo n' ikintu nanditse n' igitabo kiitwa le dieux est du notre pere kirwanya ibyo .
after writting the book , "@ god is our father @" where at taught at the university in kinshasa , i asked the students and found out that all the blacks in africa especially in the sahara belive that there is something that created heaven and earth and they give several names but we called it god and we have this in common ; we did not worship idols . ||| maze no kuandika icyo gitabo nyine le dieu est du notre pere aho nigishaaga muri universite y' i kinshasa nbajije abanyeshuli nigishaaga nsanga abirabura bose bo mu mu muri afrika cyane cyane yo mu bicae byo munsi ya sahara bose baemera ko hari ikintu kiremye isi n' ijuru bakakiha amazina menshi ariko twe tukakita imaan ibyo tukaba tubisangiye ; ntitusengaaga ibigirwamana .
that distressed musinga because they insulted him and told him that he worshiped idols but a wise man like musinga could not accept this , i wanted to say that they kept the truth from him because he could not accept this and even his son merely took it because he believed that if he did not accept it he would end up like his father ||| ibyo rero musinga biramuvunaishaga kugira ngo baze bamutukae ngo n' umusenzi ngo na aa ibigirwamana agira koko bamuzizaaga ukuri ntiyabiemeraaga kandi umuntu ufite ubwenge nka musinga ntiyari kubiemera ii nri ngiye kuvuga ngo bamujijije ukuri , bamujijije ukuri kuko ntiyari kubiemera , n' umuhungu we ndetse yapfuye kuhendahenda kugira kuko yagize ati nintabigira nimbyemera barangira nka data .
on merely accepting this , the first thing he did was to be baptised , and accepted that rwanda should worship jesus , i 'm not saying that i 'm against it but that was musinga 's biggest crime , his removal from power and forcing the white mans religion that he did n't understand on him and calling him a fool , he was n't a fool he had his own god and honestly it was a true god and jesus did not come , instead came saying that i have not come to remove but instead i have come to affirm it . ||| apfa kuemera icya mbere yakoze nyine n' ukuemera kubatizwa , yemera n' uko u rwanda rugira arutura yezu simvuga ngo nrabirwanya byo ariko musinga yazize icyo kintu cy' ingenzi , kumukura ku butegetsi no kumutoza idini y' abazungu atazi cyane bakamwita ko ari umusenzi ngo ni abashenzi , ntiyari umushenzi yari afite imaan ye kandi koko niy' ukuri na yezu siyaje ahubwo yaje kuvuga ngo ntinje kubikuraho ahubwo nje kubyemeza ,
i wrote a book later , "@ i did not come to abolish but to affirm @" i did not come to remove what god had put in the hearts of your fore fathers and what they knew but i have come to fulfill it . ||| nanditse igitabo nyuma nyine , je ne suis pas venu abolir mais accomplir , je ne suis pas venu abolir ntinje kukuraho iby' imaan yari yarashyize mu mutaima n' abakurambere banyu ba bari bazi ahubwo nje kubiuzuza , ehhh .
you see musinga was a victim of the truth , and that he was wise amd he was a man of honest character , colonialists came saying that we were stupid and had no brains , that we were animals and that was hard for him to accept and that was his crime . ||| uraumva rero musinga yazize ukuri yazize y' uko yari azi ubwenge kandi yari umugabo kandi yari akwaije umuco wa kihanga w' ukuri uhh , abakoroni bari bazanye kutu baje bavuga ko turi ibicucu nta buengae turi ingegera turi inyamaswa ibyo rero biramuvunaishaga kugira ngo abiemerae uraumva nicyo yazize cyane n' ikindi , njyae niko nreba rwose n' ibindi wenda by' impande by' uko bashakaaga uboroheye ,
that 's what i think , other things maight have been because they wanted one who was easy going , baptized and willing to learn the white man 's things but he was old and they found that they could not get along with him . ||| ubatizwa akaiga iby' ikizungu undi yari ashaje wenda basanga atazabashobokair .
if you take a look at africa , rwanda and burundi were not the only countries that were colonised , other countries too were colonised . ||| noneho iyo ugiye kuitegereza muri afrika ntabwo u rwanda n' u burunri aribyo byakoronijwe byonyine n' ibindi bihugu bigiye bikoronizwa .
but you find that it was especially rwanda and burundi that had problems because even though the white man came , rwandans had away of ruling eachother , they had away of life and i ask myself , what made it possible for the white man to divide or to come up with with tribes amongst rwandans so as to divide them into pieces or like you said use the tutsi to rule for them . ||| noneho ariko mu rwanda n' i burunri cyane cyane usanga ariho hagiye haba ikibazo kuko nk' ubwo abazungu baraje basanga aa nko mu rwanda tuvugae abanyarwanda uko bari babayeho bari bafite uburyo bategekaan , bari bafite ukuntu babayeho noneho nkibaza ikibazo . n' iki kitumye abazungu bashobora kubasha kuteranya cyangwa kuhimba amoko mu banyarwanda kugira ngo babonae ukuntu babacamo ibicae cyangwa bifashaishe nk' uko ubivuze abatutsi kugira ngo babategekaire .
so why did they choose thetutsi because yuo realise that the most of the problems we have today are from the colonial time because the white man made up somethings to help them with their plans but why did it happen in our countries ? ||| noneho nkavuga nti kuki bahisemo abatutsi kuko iyo ugiye kuitegereza usanga ikibazo uyu munsi tufite kituruka muri kiriya kihae cy' ubukoroni kuko abazungu bafite ibintu bahimbaye kugira ngo bibafashe mu mugambi wabo ariko se kuki bibayeho muri bino bihugu byacu .
the example i can give on only rwanda and burundi is that we were the only ones who had good leadership and they saw that they could not just penetrate us like in other countries . ||| urugero ntanga nk' u rwanda no mu burunri kusa n' uko araitwae turi tufite nk' imiyoborere myiza baje bakabona batazatuinjiramo kusa nko mu binri bihugu .
i would have answered that later because we shall come to things of 1939 . ||| ehh ibyo nri kukikusubiza mu kanya iiyu uba uretse kuko turaza kugera ku bintu byo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda .
our misunderstandings are those things that came to be but i will come back to that problem in a while . ||| nyine icyo tupfuye na n' ibyo bije kubamo ariko icyo kibazo umuntu araza kukisubiza mu kanya .
honestly , if you take a close look at where they came up with tribes like you have said clearly , they came up with these tribes elsewhere but the problem became more complicated in the time they wanted independence . ||| mu by' ukuri ubigenzuye wenda ngisubirize aho iby' amoko babihimbaye nk' uko ubivuze neza , mu by' ukuri n' ahandi barabihimbaye ariko ikibazo kije gukara cyane cyane igihe cyo cyo kushaka ubwigenge .
that is why i was proposing to talk about it later because they came up with tribes here but they came up with other things elsewhere . ||| n' icyo kituma ngira iyo umuntu akivuga mu kanya niho biri kukunda kuko kuko naho mu by' ukuri hano bahimbaye iby' amoko ariko ahandi bahimbaye ibindi .
if you look closely you realise that along the way the catholic church or should i say the priest did not behave propery because they evidently showed crookedness , what was meant to be teaching people the word of god became politics and things did not go well . ||| ese icyo kintu cyo ariko noneho nyuma ureba ukasanga hagati hariya ntabwo ntinzi niba nvuga kiliziya katurika cyangwa niba nvuga abapadiri nabo ntabwo bitwaye neza kuko bagaragaje guhengama mu buryo bugaragara , iby' ari kuigisha abantu imaan bihinduka politique ukasanga noneho ibintu ntabwo bigenze neza .
i do not know what you can tell us in regards to the priest and church . ||| ntinzi ikintu mwatubwira ahongaho ku kintu kaerekeraanye n' aba padiri na kiliziya .
so as to simplify things , let us talk about it all , let 's talk about thing in 1959 because it is like talking about all these things because we shall mix things up and you will find that it is tiring . that is where we come to the priests and colonialists and ourmiunderstandings with them , it is speak 's ideologies and what i said before about befriending but that is something they needed to use . ||| eh kugira ngo tubyoroshye reka ibyo byose tubiganirae tuvugae ibyo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda bira birasa nk' aho bisubira muri ibyo byose kuko n' ubundi turavangavanga usangae biza no kuruhanya eh niho tuza ku ibyo by' abapadiri n' abakoroni icyo tupfa cy' ukuri kuko nibyo bya speek n' iki nk' ukuntu nbivuze mbere ku buhakae ariko icyo n' iki n' ikintu bari bakeneye kukikoresha .
they knew that they were telling lies but they honestly did not want to leave this place , they did not want to grant us independance , those are the things that became difficult as they tried not to grant independence . ||| bari bazi ko babeshya ariko bari bakeneye kugira ngo mu by' ukuri bangaga kuva hano , bangaga kutanga ubwigenge , ibyo n' ibintu bikazae bakajije cyane cyane bagira ngo baimaane ubwigenge .
i think if one is to talk about that , there are many thinga that are part of it . ||| eh noneho ngirango uwavuga ikibazo kierekeye ni hari byinshi bishamikiyemo . ehehehe
the little you have told us on the colonial period , there is a question we want you to answer on the catholic church . ||| icyo kihae cy' ubukoroni mutu mutubwiyeho incamake yacyo , icyo kihae cy' ubukoroni eh mwakitubwiyeho n' akabozo wenda muri butusubizaeho kajyanye na kiliziya katurika .
we shall talk about the riots of 1959 and the protests . ||| turakubita ku mvururu zo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda imyivumbagatanyo abantu benshi ubungubu babiita kwishi @:
there are those who call it riots , others call it a social revolution while others call it something else . ||| hari ababiita imvururu , hari ababiita revolution sociale , hari n' ababiita ukundi .
tell us about it and those who had an active role in it . who did it ? , what was their goal ? ||| ubwo rero muri bubitubwiraemo mutubwiraemo ababigizemo uruhare cyane , nonese bikozwe n' ande ? ese biganaishaga hehe ?
who were they ? ||| bari bari bande ?
yes , this is the of end result of all the questions . ||| yego n' ikibazo giko ngirango mubyo tuvuze byose iki niwo muzi wa simvuga ngo niwo muzi wa byose ariko niyo niyo masanganiro y' ibibazo .
the problem became evident the day that africa got tired of being a slave , the time it wanted independence and stop being slaves . ||| ikibazo kije gukara umunsi afrika irambairw ubucakara eeh n' aho ariko ihera nyine kubyari biyitangiraiye nicyo kitumye ngira ngo mbi nbibaze mbi nbanzae mbitazire ariko mu by' ukuri amasangano y' ibibazo n' ubwigenge by' afrika kuikura ubucakara ,
many people now know the history of africa and even read about it , that is an easy thing to talk about today . ||| muri afrika rero amateka murayazi n' abantu benshi barayasoma ubungubu n' ibintu byoroshye ku kuvugaw .
in the berlin conference , that is where the white man claimed africa as their land to do with it what ever they wanted , they especially needed raw materials for their factories so as to make machines and every thing else that they would use . ||| abazungu muri iyi confe conference de berlin niyo yatanze afrika ngw' ibae ubusitani bw' abazungu bikorerae ibyo bashaka cyane cyane bari bakeneye ii ibyo baita matiere premiere ibintu ba byo kuko mu nganda kugira ngo bacurae ibyuma n' ibindi byose bazakoresha ,
they found that africa had most of the things they could use and they decided on how they will share the world and africa was part of it . ||| basanga afrika rero ari ubutaka bwabo ariho hari n' ibintu byinshi ba ba bakuifashaish bagira inama rero bigira inama y' ukuntu bazaza kukabana isi , afrika ijyamo rero .
so the colonialists came here with priests and all the archaeologists and wrote the lengthy history of the colonialist which you all know . ||| ubwo rero aba baje ino abakoroni bazana n' abapadiri , bazana n' abandi bose babacukuzi bagira batae barakora amateka maremare murayazi y' ubukoroni .
there reached a time when africa seemed to be courageous and decided that enough was enough . ||| bigera igihe rero afrika isa nk' aho imaze kushira ubwoba igira iti birakabije ,
there was the ordinary colonisation like ours , where they were not harsh but there are those they would take abroad like to america , asia , what they call slavery . ||| birakabije bari baragize bamwe rero ubwo hari ubukoroni busanzwe nkatawe ndetse twe baratworoheye ariko hari abo bajyanaaga bakabajyana mu mahanga hakurya wumvise z' amerika , aziya iki abo baita esclavage .
we were lucky to have a man called rwabugiri who they named makare bwana mukare who resisted and fought , but later they came . ||| twebwe tugize n' imaan hari umugabo witwaga rubukiri bamwise makare bwana mukare aragomair ararwana abuza abara ..... bigira bite , ariko biratinda nyine ba baraza .
. ||| igihe rero cyo cyo muri za mirongo hafi ya za mirongo itangatu kuva muri za miro hafi bijya kuganaish muri za mirongo itandatu ,
in the period around 1960 , i think the first country to gain its independence was ghana . ||| ibihugu bya mbere ngira ngo niza ghana nizo zabanje kugira independance .
the white man tried to find away of not granting independance , those who wanted independence started coming together and forming political parties , they were called nationalists . ||| abazungu bashatse ukuntu bakuimaan ubwigenge bashaka rero ukuntu bazibya abirabura bari bakomye induru y' ubwigenge , abaitabairaga ubwo buigengae rero batangira kuigiraan no kuhimba amashyaka ya po po politique bayita nationaliste abantu bashaka ubwigenge .
most of us know that they included nkrumah , jommo kenyatta , there was the king of ethiopia haile sellassie . ||| bon abenshi turabazi nyine barimo ba nkurmah , barimo ba kinyata hafi aha ni ba jomo ki ni ba njomo kimata nyine hari umwami wa ethiopia haile sellassie .
close here we had rudahigwa , lumumba , rwagasore , you know all the names . ||| tuvugae n' ino rero nyine tuvugae tugae tugushae hano kwa rutahigaw iwacu tubigushae hafi na rumunba hafi aho na rwagasore hariya hepfo n' iki amazina yose murayazi .
into two parts because when you do this with tribes , for example if there are ten religions , there is no way you can divide them into two . ||| imigabane ibiri kuko iyo ugize amoko nk' ibi , tuvugae nk' amadini ntiushyira kw' idine hari amadini icumi kuko ntiubona uko ugabanyamo kabi ,
they always looked for away of having two factions because no one can fight if they are many factions . ||| iteka bashaka ukuntu habonekamo imitwe ibiri ntabarwana ari imitwe myinshi .
they looked for something to divide the country men into two , they call it dual . ||| bashaka ikintu kikatamo aa abene gihugu mwo kabiri , babiita ii douel ,
here they found that it was easier to use tribes even though they are three . ||| douel .
they put one aside say that it meant nothing so they left the twa alone , they considered the hutu and tutsi and gave one side arms and told them to fight eachother . ||| hano rero basanze amoko aribyo byoroshye n' ubwo ari atatu muby' ukuri rimwe bariigaije iruhande bati ntacyo rivuze abataw barabaihorera , baho abahutu n' abatutsi umwe babaha ingabo ya so ngo murwanae eeh n' ahandi bisho ,
there are places where they used religion like in sudan . ||| hariho aho bashyizeho idini nko muri za sudani ngirango bashatse abirabura n' iki .
the white man always wanted something that divided the country men into two opposing sides of which they would chose one side to help them . ||| iteka rero abira abazungu rero abakoroni bashakaaga ikintu kituma aba abene gihugu baba imitwe ibiri irwana bakafata igipande kibafasha rero .
that is the reason as to why they came up with tribes because it was easier . ||| iyi niyo mpamvu yatumye nyine bareba bahimba ubwoko kuko aribwo bworoshye kuko abahu abo baita abahutu n' ukuvuga ni majorite kuko majorite n' aba n' abakene n' abari hagati mubyu ubigenzuye kuko abahutu abatutsi abataw nyine na n' ibierekeye categorie ya ya y' ubukire ,
the hutu were the majority because the poor are always the majority , if you look closesly , the hutu , tutsi and twa were cartegories of wealth , and the very poor were the twa , and those who were average were mostly leaders and they were called the hutu , those who were very rich but few were the tutsi . ||| abakene cyane bakaitwa abataw , abo hagati bakaba ari bafite bafite abakene ariko biringaniye nibo benshi cyane ku butegetsi bwose bakaitwa abahutu , abakire cyane ariko ba bakeye nyine bakaitwa abatutsi .
that is what they did but if there had been an easier way of dividing them into two , they would have use it . ||| niko babigize rero bashaka ibyo ubundi iyo tuvugae basanga nk' idini ariyo yoroshye kukatamo kabiri niyo bari kufata ,
if they had found that regions were easier , that is what they would have done . ||| iyo bafata nko muri aa ahandi bakasanga uturere aritwo tworoshye niko bari kubigenza ;
like in sudan that is how they divided blacks and arabs . ||| nko muri a sudan niko bakase abirabura n' aba n' abarabu .
it is not that they prefered the hhhutu , it 's because it was easier to divide the tutsi and hutu . ||| ugenzuye s' ukuvuga ko bakunda abahutu n' ugu sibyo n' uko basanze kukata abahutu n' abatutsi byoroshye iyo babona ikindi bari kukikoresha nacyo ibigaragara n' uko atari ukuba mbere nibo bakase mbere baraje bashaka mbere bashakaaga ,
it is evident that they came looking for those who could help then rule . ||| bashakaaga ababafasha kutegeka .
they are the ones who broght the division between those who know how to rule and those who do not . ||| uraumva ba nibo bazanye rero kukatamo kabiri abazi kutegeka n' abatazi kutegeka abahutu bajya mu nbaw zitazi kutegeka ndetse babashyiraho n' ibicucu ntazi ubwenge ni babi n' ingurube byose n' iki n' ukurya kusa upfa kusukamo bakamira .
the hutu were cartegorised as dogs that did not know how to rule who were fools and had no brains , ugly and like pigs , they just ate what ever they were given . the tutsi were the good looking ones who had brains and knew how to rule . ||| abatutsi ni beza n' imfura bazi ubwenge bazi kutegeka ibintu nk' ibyo ,
then those they had given power , including rudahigwa who had collaborated , was a christian and not been like his father , who was the first to arise among those who wanted independence . ||| hanyuma igihe babasenzi rero bahaye bashyize kw' ibere niryo kosa harimo na rutahigaw umwami wabo bagize n' umukristu yari yarifashe neza ntiyari yarakuraije se eeh bavuze ubwiyungu rutahigaw aba uwa mbere ahaguruka .
when he went abroad and saw what was there , the gained courage and decided that he would go to the u.n.o and ask that his country be given independance , when he gained the wisdom of seeking independance , they felt like , "@ you dog , we made you important and now this ? @"@ ||| ati yeyeyeyeye agiye n' iburayi amaze kubona nibyaho ashirika ubwoba ati eheeee nzajya no muri l' o.n.u nsabae igihugu cyanjye kigengae , yibutse ubwenge bwo kuigenga ? bati wa nbaw we sha tukushyize inberae n' ibyo ?
, "@ wait and see ! ||| ati buretse rero tukuerekae ii buretse uko noneho araza avuga ati mwebwe abana b' abahutu mwarengana ye ,
. @" ||| icya mbere ni mwebwe muzi ubwenge ,
they came and said that the children of the hutu , were treated unjustly , first of all they are the knowledgable ones , they are well behaved , this country belong to them , they are the majority and that those dogs are not even true rwandans . ||| muranitonda , nimawe benegihugu erega nimawe benegihugu nimwebwe ba nyamwishi abandi ziriya nbaw zi si sin' abanyarwanda mu byukuri .
they needed that theory of speak which said that they were tall , light skinned . ||| bibinri bya speek noneho barabikeneye kaga theorie speek yavuze agira ngo ariganirair ngo ni barebare barasa nin' inyobae ndetse ubanza , baraasa n' abagara .
the white men said that that is what they saw . ||| abazungu bati aaaaa ese ko aribyo ntubona se ?
they said that the county belonged to the hutu and they said nothing about the twa . ||| ab' ukuri dore mwebwe ni mwe bene gihugu , benegihugu n' abahutu aba aba abataw bara barabihoreza ntibanabavuga abataw bati nimubihorere bati noneho rero bibaye bite ?
since they wanted independence , the white man said that the hutu should expel the colonialists starting with the first ones who were the tutsi , and they said that the river nyabarongo was a short cut to sending the tutsi back to where they came from , and that they would go after them . ||| ubwo rero mushaka ubwigenge mwebwe abatutsi icya mbere ni koko na bati tujyae kuri abahutu igihugu n' icyanyu mwebwe muirukanae abakoroni ariko muherae kuba mbere abakoroni ba mbere n' abatutsi mubasubizae iwabo , nibwo banahimbaye bati inzira ngufi murayizi ni nyabarongo mwo kasenya mwe , dore inzira iri hariya hafi nyabarongo . abatutsi basubirae iwabo tuzaba tujyenda nyuma nibyo tubanzae ariko tu tubasubizae .
that gave birth to a very bad problem which got worse . ||| nguko uko rero ukuntu ibyo bintu bigize bije kubyara ikibazo kibi cyane kirakara rero byose biza biirunda , hanyuma rero kugira ngo bikundae ntibiri byoroshye kugira ngo bikundae .
there is a book called ‘ mission au rwanda , ’ which was written by a white man called colonel guy logest who was flemish , i know him , he was here in kigali . ||| bimwe bavuga rero ngo ngo ngo kamparamaka ngo nako ngo ngo kuivumbura dore umugabo murebae iki gitabo mission au rwanda cyanditswe n' umuzungu witwa colonnel guy logest w' umu flamma nramuzi , nramuzi yari ari hariya i kigali .
he came from congo in 1959 for the first time , he was made the resident special . ||| yaraje muri cinquante neuf ( 59 ) aribwo bwa mbere avuye i congo araza bamuha ubutegetsi aba residence speciale ,
he removed all the leadership that was there and was colonial . ||| ubutegetsi bwose arabwicaza buri busanzwe ari ubw' abakoroni n' iki ari njyewe ninjywe uhawe u rwanda kubutegeka butavuguruzaw .
he came with orders to remove those dogs who were the tutsi and were not even rwandans from power and put the hutu . ||| nibwo aje rero bamubwiye bati maze rero ziriya nbaw z' abatutsi ndetse sin' abanyarwanda n' iki , bakuraeho ushyiraeho abahutu .
he therefore came and removed the tutsi without any reason and put the hutu nad he begun to burn ||| araza rero abishyira itegeko abatutsi bose arabanyaga tout simplement nta ntarunri rubanza puuuu nbaw nbaesaire abicaza bose , bose ku murongo ku murongo ntarunri rubanza . ashyiraho abahutu kusa bityo atangira kutwika .
this white man burnt my home in buhoro , white men without any black are the ones who came to burn my home with shooting , what they say as 1959 ... ||| uyu muzungu yatwikiye njyae ubabwira yatwitse iwacu i buhoro , abazungu nta mwirabura urimo nibo baje kutwika iwacu barasa . ibyo bavuga ngo cinquante neuf .................. texte manque ................ ntajwi ........ makeya ibyo bababwira ngo imyuvumbagatanyo n' iki ibyo n' ukubeshya n' amagambo . basanze batatanga ubutegetsi bati noneho tukuraeho ababusa aba ................ texte manque ............... ntajwi ........ yeeee parmehutu rero ........... ntajwi ....... ku mbehe bati dore .
we saw that if the tutsi had had bad leadership , they would have removed them . ||| kandi ubundi nyine tubonye y' uko niyo biba ba tuvugae niyo bavuga ko abatutsi bari bafite ubutegetsi bubi bari baba barabukuyeho .
instead they removed the king and put their oun king , rudahigwa without following the rwandan way of leadership . ||| ikigaragaza n' uko bakuyeho umwami , umwami bashyizeho rutahigaw nibo bamwishyiriyeho ntibamushyizeho bakurikije ubutegetsi bwa kinyarwanda .
he was not a king who ruled , he was a worker like others headed by the administration , the name they gave him was ‘ mwami ’ , and there was ‘ umwami ’ and ‘ mwami ’ . ||| ntiyari umwami utegeka yari umukozi nk' abandi yategekawaga n' ab' administrateur n' izina ry' ubwami bamwise mwami ,
in fact as we were praying in the church we would say that let us pray for our king leopord . ||| hakabaho umwami na mwami ndetse n' aba na nkatawe tusengaaga mu kiliziya tuvugaaga tusengaaga tusabaire umwami wacu leoporidi .
we did not say that let us pray for our king rudahigwa , we use to say that let 's pray for our king leopord the 2nd . ||| ntituvuga ngo tusabaire umwami wacu rutahigaw , turavugaaga tusabaire umwami wacu leoporidi ii uraumva rero igihe rero ubutegetsi buhindukiye kubera y' uko nyine abategetsi bashakaaga ubwigenge babuhaye utabusabaaga parmehutu biva rero kuby' amatora ,
when it reached the time that the leaders wanted independence , they gave it to those who were not asking for it , parmehutu , they forged elections for political parties and voted and built the republic of kayibanda . ||| bahimba amatora amashyaka y' amatora baratora , baratora bahi bakaubaka rero repuburika kayibanda yaka repubulika .
the first government which they put place was made up of hutu , tutsi and white men and parmehutu . ||| leta ya mbere gouvernement ya mbere yashyizeho yari ya nkuko nbivugaaga mu kanya yari ikizawe n' abahu n' abatutsi na na n' abazungu n' aba parmehutu .
what followed in that period were governments which had the mentality that the country belonged to the hutu who were called parmehutu and their followers . ||| ngira ngo nrebye mu by' ingenzi cyane by' icyo kihae ni nk' ibyo icyari kisigaye n' uko ibizakurikira ni leta zikurikiye zagiye zifite uwo muragae w' uko igihugu kibaye icy' abantu bamwe baita aba parmehutu eeh n' ababakurikiza bose .
it resulted in the tutsi being considered as bad and colonialists who should be killed . ||| bibyaye y' uko abatutsi babaye babi babaye abakoroni bacaiyew .
those who were able to flee fled , you know that that is when refugees , burning and killing came into existence , saying that the tutsi were foreigners . ||| aba abashoboye kuhunga bakahunga murabizi ni niho impunzi zatangiraiye , kutwika niho bitangiraiye , kuica niho bitangiraiye , mbese kuvuga ko umututsi atari igihugu ataarikae rwose ari kavantara ar' umunyamahanga .
it followed in schools and places of work and it resulted in the tutsi feeling as thoughthey were not at home . ||| ehh birakurikiraan mu mashuli , birakurikiraan mu mirimo mbese hose umututsi usanga atakiri atakiri iwe .
one can say that this did not get them anywhere , one can go through all these early governments of the republic if you wish that we continue . ||| ubwo rero umuntu akaba yavuga ko nta naho bigejeje wenda umuntu yaza na subira na kurikizaho izi leta za mbere za repubulika niba mushaka ko tukomeza .
in the history of 1959 that you have told us , there is a man who is often talked about who maight have played a role called peraudin . ||| ........... kuri ayo mateka mutubwiye , kuri ayo mateka mutubwiye yo muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda , umu hari undi mugabo ujya ukunda kuvugawmo cyane ubaye ngo ashobora kuba yaragizemo uruhare aah umugabo witwa pelode .
peraudin was my bishop when i was a priest , he is the one who ordeined me . father peraudin was my superior in nyakibanda , what i mean is that i know him . ||| pelode yari umusenyeri wanjye nbaye padiri kwa niwe wampaye ubumuseseridoti padili pelode yari yabaye na padiri mukuru wanjye munyakibanda , nramuzi rero nicyo bishaka kuvuga .
let me not only talk about pedoli but the catholic church . ||| ehh ndetse nekuvuga pelode wenyine reka nvugae nagurae ikibazo nvugae ukuntu bavuga kiliziya gatorika .
the role of the catholic church in all these things especially to with divisionism that happened amongst the rwandans which they called tribes . ||| uruhare rwa kiliziya gatorika muri ibyo bintu byose by' ibikubara bibaye cyane cyane by' amacakubiri , by' inzangano zabaye mu banyarwanda baise amoko ,
i think that is better because it would be an exageration if i only spoke of pelodi because he was not the only one involved . ||| ngira ngo nibyo byiza kuko kuvuga si pelode wenyine ni kuba ari kukabya ukavuga ngo ni pelode wenyine .
i told you a little while ago that the idea of there being three different tribes was written in books by the first priests . ||| ngira ngo nvuze mu kanya ukuntu igitekerezo cy' uko hari amoko atatu atandukanye cyane byanditswe mu bitabo byanditswe n' abapadiri ba mbere .
i showed them to you , one is by pages , another is by arnold . ||| nbibaeretse kimwe n' icya pages nkivuze ikindi n' icya arnold .
the other is ... , the other i said is by father classe . ||| ikindi n' icy' arasha n' icya ......... de l' axge .
the major role he played is saying that the tutsi were good at leadership and the fact that he was close to king rudahigwa . ||| ikindi nvuze ni musenyeri classe uruhare yagize cyane cyane mu mu kuvuga kaogeza ko abatutsi bazi ubutegetsi no kuba yari yegereye ibyo musenyae umwami rutahigaw .
he is the one who caused the king to leave queen kankazi . ||| ndetse niwe utumye amuta niwe umutandukanyaije na n' umwamikazi kankazi .
rudahigwa remained in nyanza but in order for the queen not to stay involved in leadership of her husband , they built for her a palece in shyongwe close to father classe for him to guard her from infecting her son with old ideologies . ||| rutahigaw aguma i nyanza ariko kugirango umwamikazi atazamugumaish mu bintu by' imitegekere by' iki by' umugabo we , bamuza bamwubakira ishyogwe hafi ya musenyeri classe ngo amuragirae amubuze kujya kuntuza umuhungu we , ibyo bitekerezo bishaje ehh .
they used to say that father classe was a friend of the tutsi while it seemed like peraudin was a father to the hutu ||| musenyeri classe rero bakavuga kera bavugaaga ndetse ko ari inshuti y' abatutsi . bikasa nkaho ari nkaho ehh aho bihindukiye rero abenshi bakavuga ngo pelode yabaye umwami yabaye mbese musenyeri w' abahutu niko bavuga cyane cyane .
they based this in the letter he wrote during the fast saying that ... , love and many other things but when one is talking about the role of someone , he must speak things which are clear and honest . ||| bakahera cyane cyane kw' ibaruwa yigeze kuandika yo ku y' igisibo yavugaaga ngo ................... ngo ibiganiro byose , urukundo ehh bakavuga n' ibindi byinshi ariko noneho iyo umuntu ajya kuvuga uruhare rw' umuntu agomba kuvuga ibintu biumvikana kandi by' ukuri iii ibintu nk' ibyo .
what i can honestly say is that pelodi was considered to be on that side because he opposed father classe . ||| njyae icyo nvuga muby' ukuri pelode ehh bamushyize muri urwo ruhande y' uko yagiye mugipa asa nkaho mbese yagiye mu gipande kidahuje n' icya musenyeri classe .
they say that there was a priest for the tutsi and a priest for the hutu but they did what they felt like , that is what i always say . ||| habayeho musenyeri w' abatutsi habaho musenyeri w' abahutu niko bavuga ariko bakoze uko babiumvaaga niko nvuga na buri kihae .
i heard them say that in the time of father peraudin , he was told by the colonialists that the rwandans were going to gain independence and the tutsi had been removed , like you see it 's over so chose to help tutsis , rather help the hutu and leave out the tutsi . ||| ngira ngo igihe cya musenyeri pelode niko numvise bavuga ngo baramubwiye abakoroni bati wowe wa mugabo we dore hagiye kuba ubwigenge kandi abatutsi tubaciye , urabibona birangiye hitamo ufashe abatutsi nako ufashe abahutu kandi u u ufashe hasi abatutsi ,
he was told to help the hutu and not to give the leadersip of rwanda to the tutsi so as to make it suitable for you . ||| fasha hasi abatutsi ufashe abahutu wime ingoma ya gihutu utegekae u rwanda bikundae bi bikutunganaire .
some say that he chose what was on mode like the rwandans say ... that is what he did , i can not judge him because i 'm not god . ||| bamwe bakavu ngo ya yahisemo ibigezaweho wa mukani w' ikinyarwanda kiteye , icy' ingoma yimaan . ubwo rero hagati y' uko yabiemeye n' ibyo yakoze n' ibyo yakoze kumucira urubanza s' indi imaan .
however what i see that is true without deffending only peraudin , it 's the fact that it happened when they are many priests who were working together with colonialists thinking that if they grant them independence they will expel the colonialists as well as the missionaries , you see that had that ideology in that it was even said at that time and it is written . ||| kikora icyo nbona cy' ukuri rero nvuga ntavugaiye pelode wenyine , n' uko bibaye koko hari abapadiri benshi bakoze bafatanyaije n' abakoroni bibwira bati nidutanga ubwi nihabaho ubwigenge bazairukana abakoroni ndetse bazairukana n' abapadiri ba missionnaire , urebye icyo gitekerezo barakigize buretse ko n' icyo kihae baranabivuze na henshi biraanditse .
kayibanda , besides being a christian , he was a brother , he was close to being a priest . ||| kayibanda uretse no kuba umukristu yari n' umufratiri ye , yagiye yi yaragiye no ku yageze hafi yo kuba padiri .
so you can also include him amongst those members who wronged the church . ||| ubwo rero nabo ubashyira mu mu bantu bana ba kiliziya bakosheje . kayi ,
habyarimana was also a seminerian and he also had sisters who were nuns . ||| habyarimana nawe yabaye umuseminari ndetse yari afite na afite bashiki be ba babenebikira ,
his father was a catechist , he was from uganda in bufumbira and he come with priests from rwaza , they even came to inaugurate the diocese of rambura and then he joined the seminary . ||| ise , ise yari ari umu catessiste yavuye , yavuye mu buganda i bufumbira azana n' abapadiri b' i rwaza baza no kushimira paroise ya rambura hanyuma aza mw' iseminari .
so if we said that the church wronged , jesus would be inclusive . ||| rero tuvuze ushyizemo kiliziya ko ye zu yagize ibintu bibi biri nawe arimo kuri urwo ruhande .
i just wanted to say that some members of the church are bad , indeed they did some things that brought divisions and they even got to a point of planning the genocide . ||| ntashaka kuvuga y' uko hari abana ba kiliziya rero babi koko bakoze ibintu by' amacakubiri ndetse bageza no muri genocide barabiteguye .
so in the group of ... even priests are included . ||| eh uraumva rero mu gipande cya cy' abaraique barimo n' abapadiri rero barimo .
let 's say if i give you an example maybe you can n't differentiate it from the genocide , this had started way before the genocide . ||| tuvugae nkubwiye nk' urugero nkubu wenda ntanuwabitandukanya rwose n' ibi bya genocide ibi biri biratangiye genocide yari yaratangiye .
you know that there are priests who were found guilty . ||| ubungubu muzi ko hariho abapadiri nyine ba baciriwe n' urubanza by' ukuri arusha mwarabumvise bahamye n' icyaha cy' uko babigize .
i wanted to mention a few name because i can n't mention those who were not found guilty because it would be wrong . ||| ndagirango nvugae amazina kuko ntinvuga amazina y' abantu batagize ruhamya kuko biba ari ugukosa . uraumva na pelode nanze kuerura rwose n' abapadiri nrabazi , nrabazi rwose nnjyae ubwanjye nzi rwose ariko ntawe nvuga nta nta kintu cya garagaye nravuga nk' ubu nyine nka arusha yemeje ko yaje akasenya kiliziya ye ari padiri mukuru akazaan ................... akagira atae .
you see i did n't want to sound sure about peraudin , and i even know other priests , i know them myself but i 'm not in position to mention any before evidence is revealed like before arusha confirms that he destroyed his church when he was the priest in charge ... you heard of nuns who are jailed in belgium , there are priests who are in jail , i can n't accuse him but there those i know myself who even wanted to have me killed . ||| mwumvise hariho ababikira bafungaiye mu bubirigi iii , hari abandi bafunzwe , hari abapadiri bafunzwe ntinmuhamya ariko hari abo nzi nnjyae ubwanjye hari nba uwari ugiye kunyicasha , kunyicisha njyewe ubwanjye .
but i can not mention him because he is not yet found guilty , you may say i 'm telling lies . ||| ariko ntinvuga ngo muvugae kuko ntawaciye urubanza mwavuga muti urabeshya uhh .
let 's say like in churches , the role of the catholic church i 'm telling you that is obvious and makes me sad and i even say it . ||| kuvuga rero y' uko ikindi rero tuvugae nko mu mu masengero mu kiliziya , uruhare rwa kiliziya nbabwira ru rugaragara ru ru runanbabaza njya nbivuga rwose ,
tell me , even if someone said it and repeated it , i mentioned it earlier and explained it on the radio . ||| nshi munbwirae n' uwabivuga akabisubiramo kandi nigeze kubivuga nrabasobanuraiye no muri kuri radio .
let 's talk about what happened in rwanda like during the time when the laws of parmehutu that talked about what agreed on . ||| tuvugae ibyabaye mu rwanda ahangaha tuvugae nk' igihe amategeko ya parmehutu yavugaaga kubyo baumvikana ko yanganaish abantu .
let 's talk about the time the radio gave confirmation that there is an enemy with a name . ||| tuvugae nk' igihe radio yavugaaga ikahamya y' uko hari umwanzi ufite izina . tuvugae nk' uko hari umusenyeri faucasse ,
let 's say like there is a bishop focas , you heard of him nikwize he said that a tutsi is naturally bad and he knows that character is created by god and no one disagreed amongst those bishops disagreed with him so that he says , one with whom we share god we do n't share a word , it 's exaggerating . ||| mwaramwumvise nikwigize yavuze ngo mutu umututsi ni ni mubi muri kamere kandi azi ko kamere yaremye n' imaan , akaba nta muntu wigeze amuvuguruza muri abo basenyeri bose ngo agirae ati wo tusangiye imaan ntitusangiye ijambo ati ibyo birakabije .
i was a refugee for 27 years , bishops used to write in books saying that there is no more room in rwanda , that those who left should look for room outside the country . ||| eh kaumva ko bashyizeho hariho nk' abanye hariho nk' impunzi zabayeho imyaka nnjyae nbayeho imya impunzi imyaka makumyabiri n' irindwi .
you know that every has has right in his or her country , in fact if the country has nowhere to settle its people , it looks for a solution . ||| bakaandika abasenyeri mu mategeko baaka hari ibitabo bajya baandika bakavuga y' uko koko bemeza ko mu rwanda nta nta mwanya usigaye eh abagiye bakwaiye kubashakira imyanya hanze kandi urazi y' uko umuntu wese aba afite uburenganzira mu gihugu cye ahubwo iyo i gihugu kibuze aho kituza abantu kibashakira uko kibigenza .
you would hear radio stations like rtlm saying such things like while people are listening . ||| nko kaumva mbese nka radio rtlm yavugaaga abantu bayumva .
these things did not happen , like me saying that it is a bad thing or the church . ||| ntibiigeze bibaho . nkanjyae rero nkavuga nti icyo ni ni ni n' ikintu kibi cyane kandi kirabahama . bande ? abantu ba kiliziya ,
but you see that i have not said the catholic church only , i 'm saying the church as a whole , those who speak for the church should have , at a certain point said no. ||| abantu kiliziya , abantu ba kiliziya . ariko uraumva ntabwo nvuze ngo kiliziya gatorika kusa nvuze abantu ba kiliziya nvuga ; abayivugair baba bakwaiye kuba barageze igihe bavuga bati ibi sibyo .
when you take a close look , they were small writings but nothing solid reflecting that the catholic church or christians that a particular mission or that priests or christians had a meeting or a walk to show that priest , christians or other people manifested it , no one went and stood up against what they had previously heard on the radio . ||| iyo ubigenzuye rero n' ukuandika udupapurooo tuta ariko nta kintu kiumvikana kihamya kigira kiti twebwe aa kiliziya gatorika cyangwa se tuvugae mbese n' abakirisitu ngo tuvugae ngo ni missionni iyi n' iyi cyangwa se n' abapadiri bakoze inama , cyangwa se n' abakristu bakoze inama bageze uru uru mubya haru bwo bajya ba nka nka nka nk' ingendo zo kwamagana ikintu ngo wunvae ko abapadiri n' abakristu n' abantu bagize banri bagize mani manifeste , bagize ikintu cyo kujya kwamagana ahagaragara ibintu baraye baumvise muri radio , ntibiigeze bibaho .
what i am saying is that the catholic church and their leadership were not brave . ||| ni bene nk' icyo kintu nicyo . naho nganaish rero y' uko kiliziya katurika wenda muri rusangae na no kubategetsi bayo . aho hantu habuze ikintu cy' ubutwari , cyo kuerura .
jesus would whip those who made the house of god unholy , in fact they killed people from churches and we simply kept quiet and run away . ||| yezu ya ya ya yajyaaga yaya yasangaaga baba bantuza hekaru akafata , akafata imigozi akakubita abantu ati insengero ry' imaan ; ahubwo biciye abantu mu masengero eh turaceceka turiruka kusa . uh turiruka kusa .
i am not saying that there are no people in the church that were holy , they are there including amongst the bishops , there are those who rejected it and it 's there in what i write . ||| simvuga ngo nt' abantu ba kiliziya babaya abatagatifu , simvuga ngo nt' abantu ba kilizi ; mbese bariho no mu basenyeri bariho , bariho babizize no mu byo nandika birimo .
there are those who clearly said it like bishop bigirumwami and many others but in general that is what i despise . ||| hari abavuze neza nka musenyeri bigirumwami turamuzi n' abandi benshi ariko muri rusangae nicyo ngaya ;
there are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where i always say we failed including myself because i am a catholic and a bishop . ||| tuvugae nko muri kiliziya katurika ikindi na hari abakosheje by' ukuri ariko bo n' abantu , n' abantu . aho rero hari ikintu nyine urebye tuba turebye mpora nbivuga tunaniwe . twebwe nrishyiramo kuko nnjyae ndi umuntu wa katurika kandi ndi umusaseridoti .
we failed , we could have been like saint peter and cried that we have failed in our place . ||| uh tunaniwe ; tuba turagize nka petero mutagatifi tuti tukarira tuti tunaniwe umwanya wacu uh .
i once spoke on the radio when we were being asked , i said that if someone ... meaning the catholic church ... they killed people while we were watching and what did we do ? ||| nigeze kuvuga muri radio hambaire batubaza , nravuga nti umva rero umuntu akushinze ubushyo nravuga kiliziya katurika ,
if you fail to fight it until maybe it even kills you , the one who left you with his cow , whenever he sees you and you run away , will never leave with others again . ||| wishi akushinze ubushyo ikirura kikaza kikaburya , ikirura ni ni n' iki kibaye nyine . abo bose baishe abantu tureba tugira tutae . iyo unaniwe kukirwanya wenda ngo kinakuicae wa wunri ukusize inka iyo ukibonye ukirukira nta nta zinri yongera kukushinga .
at least he says you are useless , let 's not say anything more . ||| nibura avuga ko uri ikigwari twekuvuga ko ,
this is where i can say the role of the catholic church was and it was something which was openly rebuked . ||| twekuvuga ibindi bikabije . aho niho nvuga ko yenda uruhare rwa kiliziya rubaye kandi hari ikintu cyagayitse mu by' ukuri biragaragara . ntinzi niba hari iki si ntakeka ko nta kintu nkaongera kirenze ibyo .
they used to go killing people here and there and there is a way they referred to them , i will talk about it in a few minutes , what did they mean by the cockroaches are coming ? ||| bigendaaga bica abantu hirya no hino bihauriraan n' ukuntu nraza kubivuga no mu kanya nyine ; iby' inyenzi ziraje n' iki .
they started killing people here and there and you could see that they are training to see it if can be possible , if there is someone who could do it without fear , if it would have no consequences or if it can actually happen . ||| batangira kuica abantu hirya no hino ubona ko harimo kwimenyereza kugira ngo barebae niba ba bikunda niba hari uwabitinyuka , niba ntacyo bitwara ,
how i can say in few words then , at first both republicans followed the plan of colonialists and fulfilled it and went on towards genocide . ||| niba bifata . uko nvuga mu magambo make rero , repubulika za mbere zombi zakurikije gahunda y' abakoroni ziranazuzuza zigenda zaiganaish muri genocide .
it means to separate rwandans , a tutsi is not rwandan and that he has to die . ||| bivuga kuvangura k' umunya , umututsi atari umunyarwanda kandi ko akwaiye kupfa .
and then they came up with a way of talking about him , the way he is , that he is bad , in all the ways they painted him to be a bad person and they taught it to others and it went into all kind of teachings that we know but they come to make it understandable that he does n't deserve to live . ||| kandi rero babishyiraho rero uburyo bamuvuga uko ameze , ko ari mubi , ku buryo bwose bamushyiraho ukuntu ari umuntu mubi cyane barabiigisha bijya mu nyigisho zose tuzi ariko zikaza zikaza zikaza zikaza zaumvaish ko atakwaiye kubaho .
basically i can say that that 's where it reached in few words . ||| mbese nvuga ko ari aho bigeze mu magambo nvuze mu magambo make cyane .
i have a question on the republics , when you look at the first republic and the one of kayibanda . ||| eh aho kuri za repubulika mpafite ikibazo . iyo urebye repubulika ya mbere n' iya kayibanda .
kayibanda was given power by the belgian colonialists . kyibanda was there for some time then habyarimana toppled him . ||| kayibana yahawe ubutegetsi urebye n' ababirigi b' abakoroni . kayibanda ntabwo yamazeho igihe habyarimana aramuhirika .
then the only thing i want here as someone who was there but when i look at this and the life in the genocide of 1994 , there is a way kayibanda was given the power but he would rule with them but when habyarimana come to power , when he toppled it . ||| noneho njyae ikintu ahangaha nshaka kusa nk' umuntu uhoze ariko nrebye n' ibi n' ubuzima muri genocide icyenda na kane , hari ukuntu kayibanda yahawe ubutegetsi n' ababirigi akayoboraan n' ababirigi ariko habyarimana aje ageze ku butegetsi ,
he had lived with french people . ||| aho abuhirikaiye we ubayeho umuntu ubanye n' abafaransa .
there are two things ; belgians look like the people who created that thing of hatred among rwandese , conflicts started and people started fighting each other . ||| n' ibintu bibiri ; ababirigi nibo basa n' abantu ba cree ikintu cyo cy' urwangano mu banyarwanda hazamo amacacubiri abantu batangira kuryana .
then after the republic of kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in rwanda and then habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the french who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 . ||| noneho nyuma ya repubulika ya kayibanda hari ukuntu binacecetse ubona ko rwose ububiligi busa nkaho nta kintu bukoze mu rwanda ahubwo noneho habyarimana azana ubutegetsi nabwo burimo ibintu by' amayobera n' ubugome bwinshi ariko abanye n' abafaransa ari nabo baje kugira uruhare mu mu myiteguro ya genocide muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 94 ) .
in a way , up to today you see how the french were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all . ||| kuburyo n' uyu munsi ubona ikintu cy' ubufaransa aricyo kihawe ubugome bwabo cyangwa se no kufatanya n' abantu kutegura genocide nibyo bihawe intebe cyane kurusha ababiligi kandi aribo bazanye ikintu nvuga ko aribo bazanye biriya bintu .
is there anything you can say about that ? ||| ibyo nta kintu ubitubwiraho .
that 's really a good question because i used to think about it a lot . ||| eh icyo n' iki n' ikibazo cyiza rwose kuko njyaaga nbitekereza cyane .
it 's true after the belgians were defeated during colonialism ; it was taken away from them , the white leaders left . ||| koko ababiligi bamaze kutsindwa kubu ku bukoroni nyine babwambuwe , abazungu bagiye b' abategetsi .
the french wanted to take over . basically they did n't want to give it all up . ||| abafaransa barabi bashaka kubiganzura . mbese bashaka ku kutabutanga bwose .
even if the french have many tricks , all the countries they colonised they gave them up without truly giving them up . ||| naho abafaransa bafite amayeri y' uko na ibihugu byose bagiye ba bakoroniza , bayitanga batayitanze . barayitanga ariko rero bashyiraho ikintu kisa nk' ikityo cyabo ,
they put something which seemed like their hand that was always there . ||| kisa nk' ikiganza cyabo batajya kihora ;
they looked for something the belgians seemed to have failed at , that is how i view it . ||| bakasanga nyine akomo .
but the french people worked together with habyarimana and even others . ||| urabona ibihugu byose byakoronijwe n' abafaransa ,
truly french people , the way it is , are wise who are generous . ||| barayitanga kandi bakayitanga batayitanze . bakashaka ikintu ababiligi bari bashushe nkaho batsinzwe niko nbiumva . ariko abafaransa bafatanya na habyarimana ndetse n' abandi mu by' ukuri abafaransa uko bimeze n' abanyabwenge batanga ,
when belgians granted independence it looked like they have given it out and nothing behind it but there would be something that would keep them around , they used the black leaders or the ones from asia because there are leaders but they were still there too . ||| ababiligi batanze independence basa nkaho bayitanze birangiye baragendakizatuma bahora bahari , bazayikoresha abategetsi b' abirabura cyangwa se bo muri asia kuko naho hari abategetsi ariko bahari .
here and in burundi and in congo as well . ||| hano rero mu rwanda no mu burunri no muri congo ndetse .
because belgium is a small country when they granted it they meant it but the french were thought that you can n't just let them go just like that yet congo has riches . ||| ababiligi kuko ari agahugu katoye bayitanze bayitanze ariko abafaransa bati a non non hoya ntabwo ushobora ku kugira ngo bagendae birangirae kandi congo irimo ibi irimo amafunguro .
they came and replaced them , the french wanted a way of replacing belgians because of the french language so as to add them on other french countries . ||| baraza barabasimbura rero , abafaransa rero bashaka ukuntu basimbura ababiligi ahari ururimi rw' igifaransa kugira ngo babaomekae ku binri bihugu by' abafaransa nyine .
so let 's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by french long ago . ||| noneho rero noneho tusubirae nyine mu tusae nk' aho tusanze n' abakoroni na n' ibihugu byo bya koronijwe n' abafaransa bya kera .
it 's like they replaced belgians so that they do n't just let us go . ||| uraumva nu ni nk' akantu kuko basimbuye ababiligi ariko kugira ngo bekutureka ngo tugende .
it 's as if they replaced them yet they had n't agreed on it . they did n't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that . ||| ni nk' aho mbese basimbuye kandi ntibabiumvikanyeho uuhh pardon !! ntibabiumvikanyeho n' ubungubu ndetse baracyahigitse .
actually whenever we disagree with the french , belgians do n't mind it , it makes them come back saying they got they took their place . ||| iteka n' iyo tutaumvikana n' abafaransa burya ababiligi ntibabianze cyane , bituma bagaruka bati mwadutwaye imbehe .
i guess that 's how i understand , it i did n't really think much about it . ||| ngirango niko njyae nbiumva ntinbitekereje cyane .
belgians left but the french refused since they did not go anywhere at all , instead they said this time since belgians are leaving . let 's put that little thing back in our pockets . ||| ababiligi baragiye ariko abafaransa baanga ku nk' uko bataigeze bagira iyo bajya rwose ariko bagira bati noneho ubwo ababiligi bagiye reka na kariya kantu tukasubizae mu mufuka wacu .
basically the francophone 's . ||| w' aba francophone mbese .
they told habyarimana that first all you are still young , it 's french language now . ||| babwira habyarimana bati uu icya mbere wowe uri umwana muto , n' igifaransa wa mugabo we .
they got close to him and convienced himto come . ||| baramwiyegereza baramuryoshyaryoshya baraza baramuha bati ngwino .
they told him not to worry that they were bringing wisdom and they were going to fight against the tutsi , they are the ones who do n't want to grant independence and there is nothing else , it was easy . ||| ikindi rero humura ni n' ubwenge bugiye kuza rero bagira bati ikindi rero n' ukurwanya abatutsi nibo bari kuanga kutanga independence nta kinri , biri byoroshye .
habyarimana as well had nothing against them because he used to say that you are nice people , we speak french . ||| habyarimana nawe ya ya ntacyo yabarwanyaagaho kuko yagiraaga ati muri abantu beza , tuvuga igifaransa .
i think it 's because french people replaced belgians and made us francophones . habyarimana was pleased with them and they would give him all he needed , that 's how i understand it . ||| ngirango n' uko abafaransa basimbuye ababiligi kugira kandi bakatutwara muri abo ba francophone habyarimana akabiishimira bakamuha amata ngira ngo niko nbiumva . uhh
there is something else that people say so often about kayibanda . the fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not rwandese and killing rwandans meant nothing to him . ||| hari ikindi kintu bakunda abantu bakunda kuvuga kuri kayibanda cyane kuba yarafatanyaije n' abazungu ko we atari umunyarwanda akaba kuica aba abanyarwanda ntacyo biri bimubwiye .
then he used it to bring conflicts among the hutu and tutsi with the help of the white man . ||| noneho yitwaza icyo kintu cyo kuteranya abahutu n' abatutsi afatanyaije n' abazungu .
kayibanda was really not rwandan . ||| kayibanda koko ntabwo yari umunyarwanda ?
he was neither tutsi nor hutu because he was not rwandan . ||| ntiyari umututsi ntiyari n' umuhutu kuko atari umunyarwanda .
to start conficts among themselves , with help of white people , i think it was fine with him . ||| kubateranya rero akabaryamishya afatanyaije n' abazungu , we numva ntacyo biba bimutwaye .
it was fine with him but , he was n't going to say it because it would not be easy to say he was a foreigner and he is bringing conflicts . ||| ntacyo biri bimutwaye ariko uraumva nti ntiyari kuvuga ko ntibiri byoroshye kugira ngo avugae ngo nd' umunyamahanga nje kuteranya wenda we niwe urikugira ati nawe nturi umunyarwanda ibyo byo ,
maybe he is the one who would be the one to say that you are not rwandan too however , he was supposed to hide that i think . ||| yagombaaga kubihisha ngirango .
maybe he did n't mind it but i do n't think the fact that he was from bukavu was enough for him . ||| wenda nti ntiyarabianze nti yara ariko ntinzi niba kuba yaravuye i bukavu aribyo biri bimuhimbaje .
that 's what i 'm saying . ||| eh siho nvuga .
i am saying that he felt like first of all he was not hutu neither was he tutsi . ||| nravuga ko we yumvaaga ko icya mbere ntiyari umuhutu ntiyari n' umututsi .
to create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him . ||| kuteranya abanyarwanda afatanyaije n' abazungu , kuri we yumvaaga abanyarwanda bamaraanye ntacyo bimutwaye . biba ...
no , it 's not him . if you want you can say it but i think it 's not the important thing really , it 's not important . ||| oya si wewe ushatse ubivuga ariko ngirango sicyo cy' ingenzi muby' ukuri , sicyo cy' ingenzi , sicyo cy' ingenzi .
i guess tutsi , let me tell you the good reason especially why he disliked the tutsi . ||| ngirango abatutsi , hinga nkubwirae impamvu cyane cyane abatutsi icyo yabangiye .
his dad came and served birasa , maybe he was mistreated , it 's possible that he has something against the tutsi who disrespected him , maybe the tutsi who his chief or his master , i do n't know . ||| ise yaraje ahakwa kwa birasa , wenda bamufashe nabi , birashoboka ko afite ikintu cyo kuvuga ko abatutsi bamusuzuguye . vuga uwo mututsi wenda umutwaye cyangwa se umuhatse simbizi .
another thing , there is something that made kayibanda hate the tutsi , only that you do n't know but he suffered from something , i know he had bad background in the school , he suffered from ............... , you can imagine ...... the hatred of tutsis had it 's origin . ||| ikindi rero hari ikintu mu by' ukuri kayibanda yatumye yanga abatutsi n' uko mutabizi yarwaye ikintu , nrabizi yagize amateka mabi mw' ishuli yarwaraaga isundwe uraumva . kayiba nrabizi byo kayibanda yarwaraaga isundwe . ibyo kuanga abatutsi byo bifite ikintu biturukaho .
he was sick of ........ , then that sickness of ..... in school but that one i 'm not sure if it was supposed to be mentioned here . ||| yarwaraaga isundwe , hanyuma rero isundwe ku mw' ishuli ariko ibyo ntinzi si byo si ntibiri bikwiriye kuvugaw ahangaha .
he used to fall sick of ..... but then really it 's not something good . ||| yarwaraaga isundwe hanyuma baba bityo ntabwo ari byiza cyane .
what i know is that in school , the priest , the bishops , i am a priest so i know peraudin it 's like i was his boss some time back . ||| icyo nzi n' uko mw' ishuli padiri , ba musenyeri pelode ndi padiri ii nramuzi nsa nkaho nmutegetse nnjyae kera .
he really did n't like being disrespected . ||| ikintu cyo kusuzugura yaracyangaga rero .
so to say that the tutsi used to be disrespectful is something that was common in the time of colonialism , they spread it all over that the tutsi were disrespectful , so he did n't like it . ||| kuvuga rero ng' abatutsi barasuzugura n' ikintu igihe cy' ubukoroni kiri kirakwaiye , barakikwaije ngo abatutsi barasuzura , icyo kintu yaracyangaga rero .
that 's why he created conflicts among them , saying he is not part of them and they are actually not even his brothers , so let them all die . ||| kuvuga rero ngo yarabateranyaije ngo ni ni bene rubanda ,
any way , if you want you can even say that with habyarimana , those issues are mentioned . he is also a foreigner if you do n't know , he is a mufumbira . ||| awa n' ubundi sibene mama barakashira . erega nago na habyarimana ubishatse ubivuga ibyo kibazo barakivuga . erega nawe n' umunyamahanga nimba utabizi , nawe n' umufumbira .
did you know the meaning of the word mufumbira , do you know that the kitchen helpers who are cooks are called the bafumbira . ||| ese uri uziko a aba ijambo ubufumbira , a uziko abakozi bo mu gikoni b' abatetsi babaita abafumbira .
it started with his father , he came from the bufumbira land and came as a cook of the priests , it went on and that 's how they called them bafumbira . ||| byatuuruutseee ( araseka ) kuri se wa habyarimana .
they are helpers called bafumbiras from bufumbira . ||| yavuye i bufumbira aza ari umukozi wo mu gikoni cy' abapadiri eh bi b' irambura ba babaita abafumbira batyo ni ba bakozi baitwa abafuuumbiiira ( araseka ) bib' ufumbira .
if you want you can also say that brought conflicts among rwandans because he 's not rwandan but that would be exaggerating . ||| wa ushatse uvuga nawe ngo ngo yateranyaije abanyarwanda kuko atari umunyarwanda ariko ibyo n' ukukabya , n' ukukabya .
he actually brought conflicts so he can have the power , no one can say that he did because he did n't go against the killings among rwandans . ||| yarabateranyaije mu by' ukuri kugirango abonae ubutegetsi , nta ntawabivuga ngo yabigize kuko ntiianze ko abanyarwanda bicana .
i too can n't tell if that 's the true reason . ||| njyae ntinmenya ko iyo ariyo mpamvu y' ukuri .
i can n't confirm that . ||| njyae simbyemeza rwose . eh
i think you can go on telling us about the attacks of the refugees . the ones who died because of being called their agents , how did it go ? ||| ngirango mwakomeza mutubwira ku bitero by' impunzi abazize kuitwa ibyitso byazo ese byo baje kugenda bite ?
i think even that would be part of it , truly , the genocide of 1994 itself ... ||| ngirango nabyo biba biri mubyukuri jenocide nyirizina ya mirongo icyenda na kane ....
i think that that is when habyarimana and his followers and the other political parties that had the same ideology of sharing the power went to the peace talk of arusha , as whole planning of genocide went on slowly by slowly up to the time it was triggered , it reached a point where habyarimana accepted but you could see that he did n't really accept , they said it and he said it in writings , others said that they were going to plan a genocide and then you could see them sign papers without meaning it . ||| ngirango naho rero habyarimana nabambari be n' amashyaka yanri bahuje umugambi wuko basangira ubutegetsi baciye mu mishyikirano ya arusha ngirango nuko arusha yaje ngirango nuko ibintu byo kutegura jenocide bije kuza nyine gato gato imbarutso yabyo kuko bigize igihe habyarimana yemera ariko ukabona yuko ataemeye bakabivuga nawe akabivuga akora ibipapuro abandi bakagenda bakabivuga bati tugiye kutegura jenocide ukabona barasinye ariko badasinye .
they signed without signing ; basically you find that arusha is the one that pushed the trigger ..... so the plane of habyarimana which was blown up i really do n't know who did it wish he could be known but i wanted that instead of the refugees that wanted to go back in the country and it could n't happen and they applied force then they looked for a way force should not be used and they started peace talk which also reached a point and they rejected it saying that they can n't share with refugees , we can n't share with inkotanyi so let 's look for a way of defeating them .... with those who help them and their agents . but its starting point then is cause even the others who help them are these political parties . ||| bagasinya badasinye usanga arusha mbese mubyukuri ariyo yasukumye imbarutso ............ indege ya habyarimana bahanuye urebye rero simbizi urebye ntinzi uwayihanuye niba yagaragara ariko nagirango aho kuanga tuvuze za mpunzi zashatse kusubira mugihugu bikananira zikashyiraho ingufu bakashaka ukuntu ingufu zitakora bakashyiraho imishyikirano nayo bikagera igihe imishyikirano bayanze bagira bati nti tusangira n' impunzi nti tusangira n' inkotanyi reka noneho tushakae ukuntu tuzinesha .... nbazifasha ibyitso byazo biri ariko imbarutso yabyo rero nuku nbazifasha banri naya mashyaka .
.... but the trigger of it all is the pretext of the plane of habyarimana , i do n't know who did it but whoever it is must have been the one who wanted to bust the first bullet of the genocide ... ||| tudahuje ...... ariko imbarutso yabyo ni ugutikuramo iturufu y' indege ya habyarimana uwayigize rero simuzi ariko uwo muntu agombae kuba ariwe ushakaaga yuko kuturitsa isasu rya mbere rya jenocide yeeeeeeeeeeee .
i think that there if there is any other problem , i think even if someone can be can be cutting short the reason for the beginning of genocide i think , maybe you come to talk about those who wanted it and those who did n't want it . so you can understand who wanted it . ||| ngirango aho ngaho niba hari ikindi kibazo ngirango naho umuntu yaba ahinaiye niyo mpamvu ngirango ya jenocide yikubitiro wenda ukaza kuvuga abayishakaaga nabatayishakaga niki abayishakaaga rero murabaumva abayishakaaga nibandae ?
who are those who wanted it ? they are sdr members , in real sense they are the ones who wanted all that in all times the ones who were behind him , who actually helped him were colonialists . ||| abayishakaaga hehehe ni mrnd n' abantu be abantu be ni bande ? ni ba sdr mubyukuri nibo bashatse ibyo byose mubihae byose abari bamuri inyuma bamufashije nyine abakoroni .
so i wanted to ... ||| ubwo rero ngirango .............
they would say that he is an ethiopian and the short cut is through the river nyabarongo , and no one made a sound . condemning things , what was left was to check if it 's really possible . ||| bakavuga bati ni umu ethiopia bati inzira y' ubusamo ni nyabarongo ntihagirae induru ivuga bati ibyo bintu birakatsindwa ikisigaye nukureba niba bishoboka koko .
..... they tried fighting back to see if really would n't work out the first time they started . when kayibanda had just started they got them out and made them shift .... he started by trying to make an area for the tutsi only .... and hutu , he did n't know that it would be possible to kill them and it 's true it would n't be possible if logist had n't come and white man had n't stood up because they knew that it was possible . they went on planning it slowly by slowly and even the people who thought it was horrible started doing it , actually that 's what happens ; what someone was terrified of goes on finding it normal and one could think that maybe when you do it you will be struck by thunder and when you do it nothing happens . ||| ....... bagerageza bakakozaho ngo barebae koko niba bianga ubaw mbere barabanje kayibanda akitangira babakuye barabimuye ..... yatangiye agirango agirae zone tutsirande ... na huturande ntiyari aziko bikunda kubica kandi koko ntibiri kukunda iyo logista ataza n' abazungu ngo bahagurukae kuko bari baziko bishoboka bagiye rero bakora imyitozo buhoro buhoro n' abantu bari baziko bizira barabitinyuka burya niko bigenda icyo umuntu yatinye akagenda akitinyuka ukagirango ahari nugikora inkuba irakukubita ntikukubitae .
like the ending to the other bad saying ; the more they shed blood , the more you get used to it and become fearless , when one gets so used to killing , it reaches a point where he is used to blood and he becomes like an animal , it 's high time ..... ||| akizawe no kurangiza wa mukani mubi uko bagenda bakora amaraso bamenyera batinyuka iyo umuntu rero amaze kumenyera kuica amaraso ageraho akayamenyera akamera nk' igisimba bageze igihe ..........
traditional courts ( gacaca ) of long ago and the ones of today can n't be the same because genocide ideology never existed then . what existed similar to gacaca , there used to be a meeting .... let 's say like a judgement of the communities . ||| eeeeeeeeehhh gacaca ya kera ni yubu ntibishobora kuba kimwe kuberako ikintu cya jenocide nti kigeze kibaho kera ibyabagaho ibijya kusa nka gacaca habaaga inama ..... tuvugae nk' urubanza rw' imiryango .
one by one but there times they would have mercy and revenge on bananas meaning ... they would cut it down and then it replaces someone but the family that killed would ask for forgiveness and ... and then the other law if revenging by killing the family in the name of revenging for theirs , they take it to the bananas so you can understand that long time many of those things existed , to punish crime and the criminal and forgiveness existed and these two still exist up to today . gacaca firstly has a fact that they should not go easy on them as in not praising them like they used to do before . ||| umuntu k' umuntu ariko habaaga iyo bagira imbabazi bakahora insina ni ukuvuga ............. bakayitema ikaba isimbuye umuntu ariko umuryango ubaishe usabaaga imbabazi ukatanga ikiru n' impongano hanyuma rero rya tegaeko ryo kuhora ryo kuica umuryango wishe bahorera uwabo bakahora insina uraumva rero kera harimo ibyo bintu byinshi kuhana icyaha nuwakoze icyaha n' imbabazi bibagaho ari ibyo ngibyo bibiri urebye no mubyubungubu nabyo birimo byombi birimo gacaca ifitemo icyambere cyuko batagomba kaorohair tuvugae mbese nukogeza nkuko babigiraaga hambaire .
it got a point and they said that it 's over for any tutsi , that he should die , i have forgotten ...... where were we ? ||| birangiye bigeze igihe rero bavugako umututsi birangiye agomba kupfa ariko nibagiwe ..... harya tuvugaaga iki ?
we were on gacaca comparing the gacaca before and that of today , if it 's true that gacaca will be productive and make the rwandan community rebuild itself ||| turi turi kuri gacaca turimo tuyigereranya na gacaca yahozeho niyubu niba koko mubyukuri gacaca ishobora kuzabyara umusaro ushobora kutuma umuryango nyarwanda wiyubaka nkuko biri biri ?
yes .... you understand old time things are not the same so we can say that would it be possible ? ||| eeeeeeeehhhh naho ......... uraumva nyine ibya kera si kimwe ubu noneho tuvuga tuti ubu se bizakunda ?
to reconcile then we can even say punishing first all even punishing itself involves those people you hear it sometimes , it includes punishing and reconciling ... there some people who have that thing of saying that gacaca does n't punish the ones who caused it are not punished that 's the problem , the fact that i was talking about . i had forgotten about the levels of leadership that i was actually part of the ..... levels of leadership is what i had forgotten just ... are the ones who were used . ||| kaunga noneho tuvugae no kuhana icyambere no kuhana ubwabyo birimo bariya bantu mujya mubiumva harimo kuhana no kaunga ........ hari abantu bafite icyo kintu cyo kuvuga ngo gacaca nti ihana ababiteye ntibahanawe nicyo kibazo kaumva rero nvugaaga iby' inzego nibyo biri binshitse ko nri ndi no muba ...... inzego niko kantu kari kanshitse mu kanya nravuga nti ababiteye nicyo gacaca iruhijeho ...... abenshi ntibibageraho abahanaw cyane ni abakoreshaijew .
who are those who caused it they are the ones on top .... who punished habyarimana maybe whoever that warned him is the one who punished but they are many who followed it closely let 's say the ones who helped them i 'm not saying their names so they do n't think i need anything from them , i do n't need anything from them but .... those who helped them are known and they are mentioned in the news papers ||| ngo ababiteye ni bande nabo hejuru nyine .... habyarimana uwamuhannye ninde wenda uwamuhanuye niwe umuhannye ariko hari benshi babaicunze tuvugae ababafashije simbavuga amazina simvuga ngo nrabavumba ntacyo nbavumbaho ariko ...... ababafashije murabazi baravugaw mu binyamateka niki .
those who helped interahamwe and the ones who helped in the killings are known many are not punished they are far they have means sometimes you hear arusha many of those are not even seen kabuga and the others are in france and they can n't be reached they are the ones who started it and they even sensitized the churches they some of them that i 've mentioned .... those who sensitized it that i 've mentioned some of them even wrote it in the books they taught it to children in schools saying that a tutsi is bad all those are the ones who deserve to be punished more than the others where will they get from ? ||| abafashije interahamwe na baishe bose kuica baravugaw abenshi ntibahanaw bari kure bafite amaboko ujya wunva arusha abenshi abo irega ntibaboneka bakabuga n' abandi bari mubufaransa ntibashyikairw nibo babizanye kandi baigishije ya madini hari abo nhoze nvuga ..... ababiigishije nnabavuze bamwe babianditse mubitabo babaitoje abana mu mashuri bavuga ko umututsi ari mubi abo bose nibo bakwaiye kuhanaw kurusha abandi bazabakura he ?
but you understand that it 's hard whatever the case i will chose the lesser evil . ||| nicyo uraumva rero biraruhije ariko rero ibyo aribyo byose ibibi birarutaan .
gacaca is the only possible and good solution rather to reconcile is understandable .... then to say something is to say that when you say that all hutus killed even me sometimes i say it once in while there are times i say it thinking it 's just a saying .... us who are going there we stand up confessing that we are hutus and we refuse to be painted black us we are going to have a group of hutus that confesses that they do n't agree with that and we separate ourselves from it and we are against it the people who betrayed us messed up our name ||| gacaca niwo muti ushobotse kandi mwiza nako kaunga byo biraumvikana ....... kuvuga rero ni ukuvuga ngo iyo uvuze ngo abahutu bose baraishe nangae rimwe na rimwe hari ubwo nbivuga nkekako ari nkibyo ukagira uti ...... twe tugiye hariya turahagurutse turemezako turi abahutu kandi turanzeko batusiga icyaha twebwe tugiye kugiye kugira agatsiko kabahutu kemezako ibyo tutabiemera tubiitandukanije kandi turabirwanya abantu batuhemukaiye bantuza izina ryacu .......
there are those it will n't come out of , i do not know yet what caused it , why is there a hutu who was made to feel that his purpose is that a tutsi should not live ? ||| hariho abantu bitazavamo icyabiteye rero ntintakimenya kuki hari abantu umuhutu batoje ko ineza ye ariko umututsi atabaho .
you were telling us about gacaca ||| mwarimo mutubwira ibintu bya gacaca .
gacaca will be better and it will arrive at the desired goal ||| ibintu bya gacaca nbona bizarushya mubyukuri ibyinshi izabigeraho .
honestly gacaca was the best prescription ||| mubyukuri gacaca niyo nvuze ko ariwo muti urushobotse .
and it 's the best , they are some things that will not be possible or that will be difficult ||| kandi nkeka ko ari nawo mwiza rwose hari ibitazashoboka ngirango bizaruhanya .
but this will be solved with time continues to teach . ||| ngirango nayo itazashora ngirango bizashoboraw n' igihe no kugumya kuigisha .
and to feel that it 's not important as even to those who have will die in it , that 's where the hatred and the poison ||| no kuzaumva nyine ko ntacyo imaze nbabifite bakazabifamo nicyo kintu cy' urwango ubwo burozi .
because he feels that the genocide can not happen , and that feeling remains in him ||| kuko atazamara yasiga ari umwe nta jenocide yumva izabaho icyo kintu kizamuhoramwo .
that state of heart will not be attained very soon by the gacaca , it will come with time , people and so on ||| uwo muti ngirango niwo gacaca itazabona vuba uzatangaw nibihae n' abantu niki .........
like the story goes , that he who time leaves behind ... ||| noneho rero nringiye nti kumukani nkuko mwabivuze ngo uzatangaw n' ibihe .
those generations were taught to kill for a long time ||| izo generation zagiye zihura n' ikibazo cyo kuigishwa ubwicanyi igihe kirekire .
i think it changing because now those that are being born today are being taught good things and those that were taught bad things are growing old ||| ngirango ziri kugenda zivaho niko nvuga kuko ubu abavuka uyu munsi barimo baraigishwa ibintu byiza abandi nabo baigishijwe ibintu bibi barimo barasaza .
i would thus like to ask the last question then we shall wind up , that 's all we will need . after the genocide ||| ubwo noneho nboneraeho nbaze ikibazo cya nyuma tunasoza ibyo aribyo byose tukeneyeko nyuma ya jenocide .
of 1994 , everyone who was present ||| y' igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda na mirongo icyenda na kane buri muntu uwo ari we wese uyibayemo .
who is alive today wishes to live in a rwanda that is harmonious without any divisionism ||| kugeza uyu munsi ukiriho yifuza ko yaba murwanda noneho rubanye neza rutarimo amacakubiri .
will develop or become a rwanda that 's doing well without any segregation . what message can you give those children ||| kuzaubaka cyangwa kuzaba mu rwanda rumeze neza rutarimo amacakubiri niyihe message mwaha abo bana .
since they are the future of rwanda on how they will be able to build a rwanda that is not characterised by any form of segregation ||| ko aribo rwanda rwejo kuburyo izabasha kaubaka u rwanda rutarangawmo amacakubiri ?
there is no message i can give that you do not know about , what i see is that we should follow what we are taught ||| uraumva nta messaga yakatangaza nba nfite nawe utazi tuesae tutazi icyo nreba nugukurikiza icyo nreba nugukurikiza inyigisho tuhabwa .
by our leaders that says that we have the same origin and are related so we should be one ||| n' ubutegetsi buriho ubungubu buvugako tuva inda imwe tugomba kutahairiza kumugozi umwe .
and we get the satisfaction that we deserve , most of the time that stuff about segregation was said those who did not share ||| kandi tukabona ifunguro ridukawiye tuesae kenshi na kenshi bya binri byamacakubiri bavuga ngo abasangira ubusa .
and called each other greedy ||| bitana ibisambo bikakubitairho nyine ko amadiri tuyayobotse yose .
honestly , it is all just talk that we are related and al created by one god , especially the christians who are many like i was saying ||| mubyukuri byose nugufiritira ngo tuvae inda imwe turemye n' imaan imwe cyane n' abakirisitu nibo benshi nhoze nbivuga .
many of those that believed in god committed crimes , ||| abakosheje benshi barimo nbaemera imaan intaho nimawe n' imaan tuzasanga .
it 's education that most important and that 's where people are taught unity ||| ni amashuri nirwo ruhongore urebye ni naho abantu bagomba kwigishiriza bakomeje ubumwe .
and whoever does n't understand , they help him understand , those that do not understand ... that 's what i can call it ||| hanyuma utanbiumva bakamufasha kubiumva , abatabyumva neza ..... nge niko nbiita .
thank you ||| murakoze .
we would like to ask you what happened during the genocide ; how you were called , how you responded , how you joined the attackers troops or if there is some one you strungled to death , generally tell us how you saw it . ||| twagirango tukubaze uko genocide yatangiye , uko mwahamagawe , uko mwitabiriye , uko ugiye mu bitero cyangwa se uwo uba urabashije kukubita akapfa mbese ukatusobanurair uko ubibonye
my name is bamporiki emmanuel i live in nyamata district in kibungo sector in the province of kigali rural . ||| nitwa bamporiki emmanuel , nkaba ntuye mu karerae ka nyamata , mu murengae wa kibungo mu ntara ya kigali ngari .
i am married and i have one child , and i am 31 years old . ||| nkaba ndi umugabo wubaatse ufite umwana umwe n' umudamu umwe , nkaba nfite imyaka 31 y' amavuko .
i witnessed every thing that took place in kibungo . ||| nk' umuntu uri utuye ku murengae wa kibungo mbere ... mu ntiambara ya 1994 , ntinri nrwaye ,
i followed up whatever happened during the day and in the night in that area in 1994 . ||| nri muzima ni ukuvuga ko ibyahabaye byose ... hafi ya byose nabikurikiranaga nkamenya ku ijoro n' umunsi uko bimeze . iriya ntiambara yabayeho koko ,
it is true that there was a war in 1994 and i must admit that i participated in this war with other different people with the object of killing tutsis and finishing them completely . ||| ndetse nza kuyigiramo uruhare , ndetse yitabairw n' abantu benshi ; yibasair ubwoko bumwe bw' abatutsi turi tuturanye . ijya kutangira ariko hakaba harabayeho isansilizwa ( sensibiliser ) ku buyobozi buri ku murengae ,
but before that , the local leaders had sensitized the locals to participate in the killing together with the help of the soldiers , who were later joined by the policemen in the sensitisaton . ||| ndetse haza kuifashaishw inzego za gisirikare , kuko hari abasirikare bagize uruhare mu kubwira abaturage ngo baitabaire ubwicanyi . ndetse n' inzego za gipolisi kuko hari bamwe na bamwe bari abapolisi z' ikiitwaaga commune icyo kihae bagaragaye muri ubwo bwicanyi .
all those leaders tried to persuade citizens to kill tutsis . ||| ndetse bagaragaye mu gusansibiliza mu baturagae , ko umututsi agomba kupfa ndetse biba ngombaw n' ibyo atunze bikaribwa ,
and if anything , to destruct all their properties and they assured us that no one would accuse us or follow up their cases . i will start by telling you what happened in that area . ||| kuko nta yinri nkurikizi yari kuzabaho cyangwa ngo bibae bikurikiraanw . ku ruhande rwanjye ngarukae inyuma gatoya rero .
generally the massacre started on the 9th . ||| nk' umunyarwanda uri utuye hafi aho ngaho , ku itariki ya 09/04/1994 kuri uyu murengae wa kibungo ahanini niho ubwicanyi butangiye ,
if i remember well it is when ndengeyeinka 's house was destroyed . they even tortured him . ||| kuko nibuka ko umugabo umwe uri utuye hafi ahangaha , niho yasenyewe amazu yitwaaga ndengeyinka icyo kihae aranatotezaw .
on the 10th the massacre continued . ||| noneho ku itariki ya 10/04/1994 birakomeza ,
some villagers from this area , together with the help of soldiers , attacked a certain centre called nyarunazi . ||| ubwo abaturage bo kuri uyu murengae bamwe na bamwe babifashijwemo n' abo bayobozi bari bafite intwaro za gisirikare nvuze haruguru , bagabye ... tugabye igitero , ahantu kuri centre ya nyarunazi .
so many people lost their lives in that attack . ||| icyo gitero kigwamo abantu benshi ,
i can remember some of their names . ||| ndetse nraibukamo amazina ya bamwe ,
there was ndekezi , bikino , sango and rubangiza . ||| harimo umuturage uri uhatuye witwa ndekezi , uwitwa bikino , uwitwa sango ; n' uwitwa rubangisa .
in that time you could see that people knew what they were doing and they did it with all their efforts . ||| bigaragarae rero ko abaturage bari bamaze kucengeraw n' ubwicanyi koko by' ukuri ; ndetse bazi ikibajyanye , kuko bagendaaga bazi ikibajyanye ko kuri ukuhiga umututsi .
it did not stop there , on the14th april in 1994 . ||| ntibiciraiye aho rero , ku itariki 14/04/1994 nibwo i ntiarama ku kiliziya , tugabyeyo igitero kikomeye cyane . ariko mbere yo kugira ngo kigabaweyo habanje kuba ihauriraan ry' masegiteri yari agose ntiarama ;
that was when we attacked ntarama at the church . ||| n' ukuvuga kibungo , kanyenze , rurindo na musenyi .
but before we went there , we held a meeting with people who lived in the sectors that surrounded ntarama that is ; kibungo , kanzenze , rurindo , musenyi , people from other neighbouring districts like ; gitarama district , kanombe and butamwa commune plus so many other people from here and there . ||| ndetse yemwe n' abavuye mu nkengero z' aka karerae , ndetse yemwe n' abavuye mu zinri ntara . nvuga nk' abaturage bavaaga mu ntara ya kitaarama , abavuye mu kihoze ari commune kanombe ,
we had to meet in one place near ntarama , led by a policeman called subuhindo who used to live in kanzenze . ||| mu kihoze ari commune butamwa nkiri kigali ngari , n' abandi benshi baturutse hirya no hino . bibaye ngombaw rero ko dukusanyirizwa hafi ya ntiarama , duyobowe n' umu ajida witwaga sebuhindo uri utuye ahantu ku kanyenze .
i remember very well that we arrived there on the14th . ||| tugezeyo rero i ntiarama kuri izo tariki cumi n' enye , nraumva nbiibuka neza nk' umuntu uri uhaibereye , cumi n' enye z' ukwezi kwa kane .
most of the tutsi who were being hunted had fled to that church . ||| abantu , abacitse ku icumu ... abaitwa abacitse ku icumu iki kihae , n' ukuvuga abari abatutsi icyo kihae ari nabo bahigawaga , benshi bari bauzuye muri iyo kiliziya arimo bahungiye .
most of the soldiers and policemen we were with started planting bombs around the church and throwing grenades in the church . ||| bamwe mu bapolisi bari barimo muri icyo gitero tugabye yo , ndetse n' abasirikari turi kumwe bari bafite intwaro zikomeye ; barabanje bazishinga hafi y' ahaegereye kiliziya imbunda zirasa kure , babanza kuteramo ibisasu .
we did not stop there , but we also went and entered the church . ||| ntibiciraiye aho rero turamanutse kuri uwo munsi tugerayo , tugera i ntiarama ku kiliziya ,
we found that some had already died because of the bombs . ||| biumvikana ko ibyo bisasu biri biishe bamwe muri bo bari barahungiyemo . batangiye kutatana bavuyemo bamwe bari hepfo abandi haruguru abandi biruka biraumvikana bari batewe . turahageze abatapfuye tukabica ,
so we started killing others using machetes , clubs . honestly one has to say that . ||| abandi bagatemagurwa abandi bakakubitaw ubuhairi ,
that time the tutsis were killed very harshly and the truth must be said . ||| mbese muri rusangae abanyarwanda bari bihishe muri icyo kihae b' abatutsi baraishwe ku buryo bugaragara , ku buryo bitari ibanga . nnjyae rero nk' umunyarwanda uri uhageze nitabairiye ubwicanyi , nta kinri kiri kinjyanye biumvikanae .
i was also there with the intension of killing and i should say that i also participated and i killed an old man using a club . ||| n' ubwo hariho ubuyobozi buri bunjyanye , ariko bigaragara ko ngezeyo ,
for that reason i was imprisoned for six years . ||| ndetse nkagira uruhare kugeza ubwo nbifungaiyew imyaka itandatu . nfungaiyew ko aho ngaho i ntiarama nhishe umuntu w' umusaza mukubise ubuhairi muri icyo gitero ngiyemo .
after all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile . ||| noneho birangiye intambara ibaye nk' ihagaze ho gatoya habaho ihunga ,
when we returned the country i was imprisoned by the current government because i had participated in the massacre that took place in murambi . ||| tuhungutse ubuyobozi tusanze mu gihugu buranfunga , banyagiriza ko nri nragiye ahongaho i ntiarama .
later , i admitted and i said the truth on what i did in murambi and the people i was with . ||| nbiemera nk' umunyarwanda ugiye yo koko , ngaragaza ukuri kw' icyaha nkoze ntakiciye ku ruhande , ndetse ngaragaza n' abo tukifatanyaije . ngamije kugirango ukuri kugaragarae ,
i had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow rwandans , so i felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it . ||| kuko kuba abantu barapfuye baraishwe kandi baicwa n' abandi banyarwanda , biri ngombaw rero ko ngaragaza uruhare rwanjye . nk' ubu rero nicaye ahangaha nk' umuntu uciye inberae y' ubutabera , ariko nbuca inberae nirega nemera icyaha cyanjye nkoze ,
i was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but i had already admitted and i had said the truth on what happened and the people i was with and i was released after that rule that was given by the president . ||| ndetse ngaragaza n' abo tukifatanyaije . nza kuca inberae y' urukiko rumpa igahano cy' imyaka irindwi , kugeza kuri iyi saha nrakirangije ; nfunguwe na ririya tangazo rya perezida wa repubulika ,
but it does not mean that i have forgotten what i did . ||| ariko nfungurwa n' igihano nrakirangije . kusa bitavuze y' uko nibagiwe icyaha nkoze cy' uko nba nkubise impiri umusaza umwe mu gitondo nri nrimo i ntiarama ahongaho .
i remember very well that i killed that old man on that morning when i was in ntarama and i am always ready to say the truth of what happened in ntarama . ||| nkamwica , nkabifungairw nkabisabair imbabazi . nkaba niteguye isaha n' isaha kugaragaza ukuri kw' icyaha nkoze . kuko ahanini nta kinri nmarair ubutabera uretse kubwereka ukuri ku bibaye nk' umunyarwanda uri uhaibereye .
besides the ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ? ||| uretse icyo gitero cy' i ntiarama nta binri bitero uba uraigeze witabira ?
that centre , but i participated by giving them support like bringing back people who were trying to escape and others would kill them . ||| uretse icyo gitero cy' i ntiarama ntabwo aricyo cyonyine ubwo ni bibiri , hari ikindi gitero nbanje kuvuga cy' i nyarunazi centre nbanje kuvuga kiguyemo bari bantu nvuze inberae , haruguru ; n' icyo gitero cy' i ntiarama ku kiliziya .
but i believe that i would also have killed them myself if the people i sent them to had not killed them . ||| ubwo ni ibitero bibiri ngaragayemo . mu by' ukuri mu gitero cy' i nyarunazi nta ruharae ngize mu kuica umuntu , ariko ngize uruhare mu bufatanyacyaha bwa sensibilisation ,
i should admit i did terrible things by stopping these people maybe if i had not stopped them they would have escaped and be able to survive . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo kutera ingufu abandi . ni ukuvuga ngo niba umuntu aciye hariya nkaba nramuhize undi akamukubita ubuhairi , ahanini ninjye uba waramwishe . ibyo rero kubiirega ni byiza kuko wenda iyo ntahagarara hariya ,
i still admit that i participated in the genocide in public and killed someone using a club . ||| yari kuhamenair akahita akahunga . ariko kuba nri mpahagaze bigaragara nk' umwicanyi . kusa uruhare rwanjye nrugize i ntiarama kumugaragaro , ubwo nicaaga uwo muntu mukubise ubuhairi .
it 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . but you participated in only two ; that of ntarama and nyarunazi . why did n't you participate in several others ? ||| bigaragara y' uko ibyo ari byo byose ibitero bibaye byinshi , ariko wemera ko ... ko witabiriye ibitero bibiri kusa , icy' i ntiarama ni icy' i nyarunazi kubera iki ibindi utabiitabairaga ?
sincerely speaking in ntarama ... i never knew who it was . ||| mu byukuri i ntiarama ... ntabwo nmenye uwo ari we .
and the reason why i did know him , in ntarama several people gathered there ... to be sincere , they were very many and i guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there identity cards for one to tell who was who . ||| impamvu ntamenye uwo ari we , i ntiarama hahungiye abantu benshi cyane .
well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the id to know who was who or where he was coming from . ||| kandi mu by' ukuri abantu bari bahari ntabwo nbashije kuba wenda ... ntinzi ko hari n' uwahunganaga indangamuntu kuburyo umukora mu mufuka wenda umaze no kumwica .
the main theem was killing . ||| yenda ushobora no kuishakira udufaranga . ushobora kumwica umara kumwica ukaba ukora mu mufuka ugirango urebae ikikutunga birashoboka . ariko ibyo ntibibayeho wenda ngo mbe nramenye ;
and our motto was to finish the ethenic of tutsi ... looking for ids by then , was nosense . ||| ni naka w' i bunaka habaagaho kuica kusa . kubera ko intego yari ukumaraho ntabwo .... kushaka ibyangombwa ntabwo biri bifite agaciro , agaciro biri ukuica umuntu tu .
point was in killing only because that was the deal . ||| kubera ko uri wo mugambi .
do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations . ||| nta mpamvu wunva yaba yarabaye mbere ya genocide , ukurikije y' uko ubutegetsi buri buriho bwashishikarizaga abantu ikintu cy' amacakubiri ,
to the extend that , if one had a bias in the tutsi would ... ? ||| ku buryo nawe uba uri ufite akantu gato k' urwango ku bwoko bw' abatutsi igihe ... ?
if i consider that war ... as a person who followed up everything yet i was mature by then . ||| ubundi nkurikije iriya ntiambara nk' umuntu wabikurikiye kandi narinshiye akengae nri mukuru .
we live in peace with our neighbours . i did not have any hatred for tutsis because i had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years . ||| abantu turi tuturanye tubanaaga mu mahoro nta rwango nri mfitiye abatutsi , kuko turi tumaraanye imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe y' amavuko , turi tubanye mu mahoro .
but the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of habyarimana . ||| kusa bijya kukomera intandaro urebye yo kugirango abantu bapfae aha ahantu tutuye , igihe havugawaga ko habyarimana yaba yapfuye inzangano zahereye kuri uwo munsi cyane cyane .
we sensed segregation among people that particular day . ||| ukasanga bari udututsiko ubundi abandi mbese akoba kaje mu baturagae .
people started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at tutsis as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the tutsis . ||| noneho kubera ko abanyarwanda benshi baumvaaga ko bakunze umubyeyi wabo , ndetse n' ubuyobozi bukabigiramo uruhare bakaumvikanaish ngo perezida wanyu yapfuye kandi yishwe n' abatutsi ni ukuhaguruka rero namwe mukamurengera . kubw' ibyo rero njyae nta rwango nri mfitiye abatutsi , kusa intandaro yabaye igihe gito cyane kijyanye n' iryo hanuka ry' indege ya habyarimana bavuga ko yapfuye .
and so you should stand up and defend him . ||| urebye niho kupfa kwabo kugize ingufu , gusansibilizwa kwabo kugirango baicwae abayobozi babigizemo ingufu cyae cyane aho habyarimana apfairiye
you have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . that means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed . ||| utubwiye ko ubu ufite imyaka 31 bishaka kuvuga yuko mu kihae cya genocide uri ufite imyaka 21 kuko imyaka 10 irashize .
well before the genocide there used to be several political parties . ||| ese mu kihae cya mbere ya genocide haigeze kubaho ibihe by' amashyaka ;
can you tell us the one you belonged to ? ||| uba uri uri murihae shyaka ?
how did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ? ||| iby' amashyaka ubiumvise kutae nk' umuntu w' umusore uri ukifite imbaraga wunvaaga ushobora kuitabair ibintu nk' ibyo biri bifite imbaraga mu gihugu ?
yes i was old enough to join any party i wanted to join and by then i was a member of mdr . i was there as any other rwandan , and because i was illiterate ; i could not get any good post . ||| ubundi nk' umuntu w' umusore icyo kihae nri nfite uburenganzira busesuye , ndetse nraumva nta n' itegeko rinbuzaaga kujya mu ishyaka nk' umunyarwanda .
but what i know is , that party disliked the tutsis so much . i had told you that i did not have any hatred for tutsis . ||| uraumva ? kusa haruguru nbanje kukubwira ko nta rwango nri mfitiye abatutsi , ariko cya kihae cy' amashyaka ari nayo ntandaro y' intambara ,
but most of these parties always taught us that the only enemy we had was a tutsi . ||| amashyaka amwe n' amwe yagendaaga yigisha abayoboke bayo ko umwanzi ari umututsi aho ava akagera .
though you did not have any hatred for the tutsis . ||| nonese ku bw' umwihariko m.d.r ako kantu kaba karasaga nkakutera ku mutaima wenda ko nubwo utanze umututsi ariko umututsi atari mwiza ,
when mdr was teaching you how tutsis were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ? ||| hari ako yaba yaraigeze ku kuigisha mu buryo buziguye cyangwa butaziguye ?
i did not attend most of mdr meetings . ||| kusa ntabwo m.d.r ntabwo nigeze njya mu manama yayo menshi cyane .
but i remember some time when sebuningo oswald ; he was the representative of the party in kibungo sector . ||| kusa nibuka ko uwari uyihagarariye witwaga sebuningo oswald uri utuye hano muri uyu murengae wa kibungo ,
he held a meeting at kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto . ||| yigeze kukoresha meeting hano kuri centre ya kibungo , atuigisha amatwara y' ishyaka atubwira intego zaryo n' umugambi w' ishyaka n' iki byose . ariko bigaragara yuko bianze bikunze hari uruhande ribogamiyemo kuko rigushaaga ku kintu baita ngo hutu . iyo hutu iyo habayeho kuvangura ubwoko ubu n' ubu ,
but one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . and the whole meeting was about the "@ hutu . @" therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights . ||| uraumva ko hari ubundi buhaejwe butafite ijambo muri icyo kihae .
thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide . ||| bigaragara ko bianze bikunze amashyaka yaba yaragize uruhare mu kutegura iriya intambara , no mu kuyigisha mu bari abayoboke bayo .
during the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ? ||| mu kihae cya genocide se icyo kintu cy' amashyaka mwakibonaga mutae ?
the troop that attacked ntarama was very big and so powerful and i should say many people died in that attack . ||| nsubiye haruguru gatoya kiriya gitero cy' i ntiarama cyo ku itariki 15/04/1994 kiri igitero kikomeye kandi kiri igitero kiguyemo abanyarwanda ... abantu benshi cyane . abanyarwanda bose bari barimo bihishe muri icyo kiliziya nraumva nta uvuyemo .
i do n't even think that there was anyone who survived . ||| ahari n' uvuyemo ni ku bwa nyagasani ntinzi uburyo yaba yararokotsemo , kiguyemo abantu benshi cyane kaitabairw n' abantu benshi .
in case there is one , it would have been through god 's mercy . ||| nk' aha ntuye nk' umuntu uhavukaiye ntawe nyobewe izina ,
i remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking ntarama . ||| benshi mubo tugiye tujyana ngenda ngaragaza nk' amazina yabo . abo nibuka nk' uwo nshinjae witwa sehene sylivestre tuburanaiye rimwe mu idosiye nfite nburanaiyeho , ubu nawe yaraburanye yarakataiyew .
i accused sehene siriveste , sindikubwabo gilbert , karangwa charles , they all admit that they killed . ||| nraibuka uwitwa sindikubwabo gilbert , uwo nawe turi kumwe nawe yiemerair ibyaha bye yakoreye aho ngaho . nraibuka uwitwa karangaw charles uwo nawe turi turi kumwe n' abandi banyarwanda benshi batuye hafi ahangaha baiemerair icyaha ,
plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something . ||| uretse ko wenda batabonye umwanya wo kugira icyo bavuga .
but i accused so many people and that shows that i was not alone . ||| ariko nshinjae benshi kandi noneho icyaha barakiemera kuko bageze aho ngaho ndetse bagaragaza uruhare rwabo . ku bw' ibyo rero ntabwo icyaha nka kiriya nba nrakikoze njyenyine ,
and i realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing i can do to pay the fine of what i did . ||| kandi niyo nba nrinri kumwe n' abandi si ngombaw kugirango nbahishaire . ikigamijwe n' ukuri uwo baishe nta wunri musanzu ntanga uretse kugaragaza ukuri k' ukuntu yishwe n' uko nbigenje .
during the war i was not being hunted . so , i was free as a rwandan . ||| kuko igihe cy' intambara ntinhigawaga nri nfite uburenganzira bwose nk' umunyarwanda w' icyo kihae .
therefore , i witnessed whatever happened and i feel that i should say the truth about what happened . ||| kuvuga ukuri rero ku bibaye ni ngombaw ,
because the majority of rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . and survivors do not know everything because they were hunted . ||| dore ko abanyarwanda bari muri iki gihugu abenshi ni abari ba ... abarokotse nabo nta kuri kuhagije bafite kuko icyo kihae barahigawaga .
others are rwandans who came from exile . ||| abandi n' abanyarwanda agiye baturuka hanze y' igihugu . nabo bakeneye amakuru kandi nta hanri bayakura uretse kuyabwiraw ntawe abanyarwanda turi mu gihugu icyo kihae .
they were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . the only alternative is us who were free by then . ||| ndetse amahirwe akaboneka mu kihae hari uwiyemereye icyaha nkanjyae uzi ukuri koko ku bibaye .
and fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector . ||| nkababwira ukuri ku byo nkoze , ku byo nemera , ku bo tufatanije ndetse no kubinri byose bijyanye n' itsembabwoko ribaye kuri uyu murengae .
there is some thing we call ; "@ asking for forgiveness @" and what we call "@ admitting what you did . @" ||| hariho ikintu cyo kusaba imbabazi no kuemera icyaha nyine .
therefore , i would like to ask you about the survivor ; there are some survivors who do not know those who killed their relatives , and though they survived , they are always hurt about what happened to their people . ||| none nagirango nkubaze , kuko hari abantu bicaiyew abantu ariko batazi ababaishe . icyo kintu mwaba mutekereza kutae uko kikorwa mu buryo bwo kusaba imbabazi nk' abantu barokotse mu mwanya .... kuko nabo barahemukaiyew muri icyo kintu ;
i would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? have you ever asked them to forgive you ? ||| wowe hari icyo uba uragerageje kukora wenda kusaba imiryango y' abarokotse baba bari muri aka kacae imbabazi .
it is true that those people faced horrible things and they lost their people , which is very sad . ||| abantu barokotse bahuye na ririya tsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba bakarirokoka bahuye n' ibibazo bikomeye cyane . barahaizawe bikomeye cyane , ndetse bicirwa ababo , ku buryo biteye agahinda .
personally i do not know the family of the person i killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families i decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general . ||| nk' umunyarwanda rero ugize uruhare mu itsembabwoko ; umuntu nishe mubyukuri simuzi n' umuryango we sinywuzi . ariko yari umunyarwanda , kandi umunyarwanda wese ahagarariraw na leta .
but we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like rwiheza innocent . ||| bibaye ngombaw ko nsaba imbabazi nrirega nsaba imbabazi ubutabera , n' abanyarwanda bose muri rusangae . ariko by' umwihariko ngendaaga mpura n' abanyarwanda bamwe n' abamwe aho nri nfungaiye bazaaga kutusura mu magereza . barimo uwitwa rwililiza innocent nraumva ahari mu muzi .
he was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector . ||| gutyo akagaragara nk' uhagarariye abacitse ku icumu ku murengae ,
we would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise . ||| ntawe tukamubwira ibitekerezo byacu ko tutufite umugambi wo kusaba imbabazi abo tuhemukaiye , tufunzwe tuemera icyaha , tusaba n' imbabazi .
but the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ gacaca level . @" ||| ariko noneho gahunda ya leta iriho kuri ubungubu n' ubwo ntashoboye kubona umuryango w' uwo muntu nba nraishe hari icyo baita gacaca . gacaca rero tuteganya yuko mu kihae kiri inberae gitoya aho leta izapangira gahunda y' uko igiye kutangira ,
in gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ i am sure we know family per family ] . ||| ko tuzaicara , tukafata imiryango y' ingo zahigwagwa ituye ku murengae ,
then we will count . ||| nta na umwe tutazi urugo ku rundi .
it would be more or less like a census . ||| tuvuga ngo abantu bari muri uru rugo bagiye hehe ? tukakora ikintu kimeze nk' ibarura nta rugo rusigaye .
then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies . ||| ababashije kuboneka muri bo tukagenda tubabwira uko tugiye tubakorera ibyaha . uko abana babo bagiye bapfa ;
well i can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried . ||| abo tugiye tuba ... nvuga ko ari nko kubajugunya kuko nta uhambwaaga icyo kihae .
hence they exhume and rebury them officially . ||| tuhagaragaza bakashobora kushyinguraw mu cyubahiro ,
in that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything . ||| bityo bikatuma nibura nubwo umuntu we yapfuye , ariko akaumva yuko koko ufite ubushake bwo kumubwira uko ibintu bigenze utamukinze .
on behalf of the servivors , it is agony to loss their beloved ones . ||| agira agahinda ko kuba yarapfushije umuntu , noneho yagira agahinda ko kuba yarabuze irengero rye akarushaho kugira agahinda .
and when they add on not knowing where those people died , it hurts a lot . ||| tuiteguye tutashidikanya ko muri gacaca ejo bunri ,
in the gacaca corts that are going to take place in the next few months , we planned to come together as rwandans and say the whole truth about what happened . ||| tuzaicara nk' abanyarwanda ahanini tuburanye n' ubwo tushyize ukuri ahagaragara .
we will tell the truth to the survivors and we will pread for forgiveness as much as we can . ||| tuzagaragaza ukuri ku bibaye , tukabibwira abantu barokotse tukabasaba imbabazi zibaho zose ,
the crime we committed we will never do it or think about it again . ||| ko icyaha kibaye tutashobora kaongera kukikora no kukitekereza .
we will tell them the truth about all the people we killed and how they were killed . ||| tubagaragariza ukuri ku bantu babo ukuntu baishwe ,
those whom we still remember where they were dumped , we will show them to those who survived . and those that we do n't remember ; because they are some who died from here and there . but we shall use "@ saying the truth @" as our weapon to calm them . ||| abashoboye kumenyekana aho bashyizwe tuka habaereka .
saying the truth is nothing much rather than showing people what we did and put everything in open . ||| abo tutazi ubu nyine ... wenda hari benshi bagiye bagwa hirya no hino , ariko biibura tukabahumuriza tuifashaishije ukuri .
we have to avoid keeping it as a secrete believing that once you are released from prison , you are going to enjoy out there forgetting the main reason why you were released . ||| ukuri nta kunri rero n' ukugenda tugaragaza ibyo bintu tukoze bikajya ahagaragara ntibibae ubwiru ngo babae barafunguye umuntu bavuga ngo urireze n' ugera hanze kubera ko wibereye ... utangirae kuigirair umunezero wo hanze ngo wibagirwe ikintu kitumye ufungurwa .
we are ready to say the truth in gacaca . ||| turi tayari rero kuzagaragaza ukuri muri gacaca .
what do you feel about people who criticise the genocide . ||| ubona kutae abantu basa n' aho bapfobya genocide yabaye ,
people who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of genocide ? ||| bahakana ibyaha cyangwa se basa n' abanakina no ku mubyimba ku bantu ba ... barokotse genocide ?
up to this moment , some rwandans believe that genocide is just a simple fight . a fight like that between two drunkards who start it up and maybe one of them dies . ||| kugera kuri uyu munsi hariho abanyarwanda bafata itsembabwoko nk' aho ari imirwano isanzwe , imwe ihuza umuntu n' undi wenda bamaze kunywa , bakarwana wenda bakaba bakuicana .
the same people say that there was no genocide . ||| bakaripfobya bakavuga ko ritanabayeho .
i as a rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , i admit that there was genocide in rwanda . ||| njyae rero nk' umunyarwanda uri mu gihugu itsembabwoko nriemera nk' iryabayeho .
i do n't deny it . ||| ntabwo nrisubiza inyuma .
yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" and they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @" ||| bariho rero ubwira uti @: ' nyamuneka dore abantu barapfuye , ' bakaba bavuga ngo ni ukusubiraanmo .
one group of rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed . ||| abanyarwanda barahaizawe , noneho biongeye hahigaw ubwoko bumwe baraicwa buratotezaw .
up to this day leaders in the former government are behind it . ||| kugera kuri uyu munsi abayobozi bakomeye bariho icyo kihae babigiramo uruhare .
yet those of us they were leading in different places by then , admit it as a truth that genocide happened here . ||| bamaze kubigiramo uruhare na n' uyu munsi ntibabiemera ko bibayeho . kandi twebwe abo bayoboraaga babajyanye hairyo no hino aho ngaho tubiemera nk' ukuri ,
we have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was genocide . ||| tubifitiye inyandiko mvugo tukoze zigaragaza ko itsembabwoko ribaye .
those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country . ||| abantu bapfobya rero itsembabwoko n' ukusubiza igihugu inyuma ,
there is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her . ||| nta wunri musanzu bamarair igihugu , uretse kukisubiza inyuma .
we admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light . ||| twe tuemera ko itsembabwoko ribaye , ndetse bamwe turigiramo uruhare ku mugaragaro .
as a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful . ||| nkaba numva ku bwanjye abo bantu bakina abacitse ku icumu ku mubyimba bavuga ko ibyabaye ntacyo bimaze , abo ngabo rwose ni abashinyaguzi . nibasigeho kuko ibyabaye biteye agahinda .
instead they should unit together with the rwandans who are ready to say the truth . ||| ahubwo bafatae ingamba , barebae ukuntu bakuegera abandi banyarwanda bavuga ukuri ,
and together tell people what happened and how it happened . ||| bagendae babacengezaemo ukuri kw' ibyabaye n' ukuntu bigiye bigenda .
they should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime . ||| baumvae ko umuntu ataibeshyera niba urireze wireze ibyo ukoze ntabwo ... nta munyarwanda ufite umugambi wo kuibeshyera ngo bigirae icyo bimugezaho .
this means that , there was genocide . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo rero itsembabwoko rirabaye .
then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there . ||| ahasigaye tushyirae ukuri ahagaragara , kandi tubwirae n' abo bose bavuga ko ritabayeho ko ribaye .
preach them how it took place repeatedly . but not keeping quiet about it . ||| tubaigishae uko rigenze , tubisubiraemo twe kubiceceka , tubivugae hose , buri wese yumvae ko itsembabwoko ari ribi ,
until when everyone will learn that genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country . ||| ko icyo cyaha kitakwaiye kuzaongera kubaho mu gihugu cyacu .
thanks a lot . ||| urakoze hari ikindi kintu numva nshaka kukubaza ,
i would like to ask you about those who participated in the genocide yet they are not imprisoned . ||| ku bantu bashobora kuba barakoze itsembabwoko kandi bakaba bakiri hanze .
you may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ? ||| wenda ushobora we ku giti cyawe kuba ntabo uzi , ariko ntabo uba uzi wenda bashinjwa ubungubu bakaba bakidegembya ndetse hano hanze muri iki gihugu ?
yes there are there . up to this moment in my document i mentioned so many rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed . ||| eeh nk' ubungubu mpagaze ahangaha , nko ku idosiye yanjye nfatae urugero hari abanyarwanda benshi .... abantu benshi tugiye tufatanya , bataigeze bagera muri gereza ngo bafungairwe icyaha bakoze .
some of them are out there and i remember them . ||| bari hanze koko bamwe na bamwe , nraumva nbaibuka .
when they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily . ||| iyo anbonye koko ubona agize akantu kuko araibuka .
"@ though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did . ||| akavuga ati @: « uriya muntu nubwo agenda bwose tukoranye icyaha kandi we yarakifungaiyew ,
he is lucky he was released . @" ||| yagize n' amahirwe yenda arafungurwa . »
that is what they say . one can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . and it is true their time will come and they will be put in open . ||| ukabona ko afite akantu ko kutinya yuko bianze bikunze igihe kizagera , igihe cye nawe kikagera akavuga akashyiraw ahagaragara ;
because i will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . i do n't intend to hide the genocide . ||| kuko ntinzamuhishair niyo yaba ari papa nta mugambi nfite wo kuhishair itsembabwoko . ku bw' ibyo rero abo bantu bakiri hanze bidegembya ,
therefore , those who are still out there , i would like to remind them that gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime . ||| urukiko gacaca rugiyeho mu gihugu cyose , kandi rutanga uburenganzira bw' uko uwaba wiyiziho icyaha nk' icyo yagombye kukigaragaza hakiri kare .
those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . but they should also have the courage to say the truth . ||| kugirango urukiko nirutangira ruzamugiraire imbabazi rukurikije ko yabivuze mbere , nabo bagombye kugira ikintu k' ishyaka ,
saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed . ||| bakaumva ko kuvuga ukuri bitavuga ngo n' ukuica umuntu .
if it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true . ||| iyaba aribyo iyi leta y' ubumwe iriho yari kufata uwishe nawe akaicwa ,
instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did . ||| ariko siko bigenze ahubwo bibaye ngombaw ko uzi ikintu akivuga akakitangaho n' ubuhamya .
therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only . ||| kuvuga rero genocide ntabwo ari ukuvuga ngo umuntu yaraishe kusa ,
there is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth . ||| tukeneye byinshi , tukeneye ubuhamya , tukeneye ukuri .
so , you killed some one you better say it . ||| kuba rero uraishe umuntu ugomba kubigaragaza ,
because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the genocide . ||| ariko no kuba waramwishe ukaba ukidegembya mu gihugu kandi ubizi neza ko hari abo mwakoranye icyaha , nabyo bigaragaza ko ukishyigikiye itsembabwoko .
was he arrested ? ||| ubu arafunze ?
no , nobody knows where he fled . ||| oya ntawe uzi iyo yahungiye .
the other people that i knew died . ||| uwo nrinzi wunri ... abandi bagiye bapfa ,
but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area . ||| undi uriho ukidegembya tusangiye n' idosiye , nvuga ko ari nk' umuyobozi w' akagari muri iki kihae we ari hanze .
we normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released . ||| uwo turahura tukaganira ariko iwe yarahahunze ntahaba aho amaraiye kufungurwa .
after being released he disappeared ? ||| afunguwe yahise agenda ?
yes , he disappeared . ||| yego , yahise ajyenda .
where did he flee ? ||| ubu yahungiye he ?
he lives up there ... in the former kanombe commune . ||| aba hakurya ahantu ... ahahoze muri commune kanombe .
in case he is needed by the authorities i can get him face to face . i know his adresses . ||| ariko ubu inbona nkubonae ku buryo isaha nmushakira nmubona , kuko niba ubuyobozi bumukeneye ngenda nkamuzana , nkaba namwerekana adresse ze nrazizi .
does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why i asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide . ||| ni ukuvuga ko witeguye kuba wa ... kuzatanga ubuhamya , ku bantu bose bashobora kuba ... kuko jyewe impamvu nkubajije abantu b' abayobozi ndetse nkubazamo n' abantu bize , n' abantu uba uvuga uti bagiraaga n' uruhare mu kukangurair abantu genocide ,
can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy . ||| abo bantu ushobora kuba ubabona nabo babateraaga inkunga kandi bari hanze ahangaha bakidegembya .
it would be possible to find them , since the government is putting in a lot of efort in getting those people who participated in the genocide hidding out of the country . ||| abashobora kuboneka nk' ubu leta ifite umugambi wo kushakisha abo bose bakoze itsembabwoko bakiri hanze y' igihugu .
for example if i had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to arusha it is better . ||| nk' ubu numvise ngo yafashwae yenda ngo yajyanywe arusha ,
if it means to go and witness in arusha i can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond rwanda . ||| naho njyayo kuko ukuri kwanjye ntabwo kugarukaiye ahangaha .
lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called issac . he lives in ririma . ||| abandi bo bari hafi yanjye , nk' uwo muyobozi bizimungu isaac ari i riraima ni ukuvuga ngo aramutse ashatse kuhakana ,
if he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , i can hurry to go there and convict him . ||| ubutabera bukankenera naho nkuihutair kujyayo . mweraka iki ? mubwira nti ibuka wa munsi cya kihae turi aha n' aha ufite imbunda utubwira ngo tujyae inberae tutsembae umututsi nta kinri amaze n' ukumwica . ibyo bikamwumvisha y' uko ,
i would remind him whatever he did while i was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period . ||| nubwo akwepakwepa ariko hari abo bafatanyaije icyaha . ubu rero nriteguye ,
i feel that even the government is delaying me because i am very ready to say the truth on what happened and i feel that i should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too . ||| ahubwo ku bwanjye numva ahubwo leta iri kuntindair . bibaye ngombaw ni isaha ku isaha ubuhamya bwanjye bugera no kuri abo ngabo nyine nramutse nbabonye nkabaumvaish . wenda ahari nabo bahindukira nabo bakavuga ukuri .
in conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors . ||| mu kuanzura nagirango ugirae icyo ubwira abanyarwanda , cyangwa undi muntu wese utekereza ushobora kuzareba ubu buhamya ndetse harimo n' abongabo bakoze genocide , ndetse unabishobora ukagira icyo ubwira abacitse ku icumu .
what i can tell rwandans in general , is that "@ it is true there was genocide in our country . @" ||| icyo nbwira abanyarwanda muri rusangae n' uko koko itsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba ribaye muri iki gihugu cyacu .
and so many people died ; more than one million people died as it is shown in the statistics . ||| rihitaanye abanyarwanda benshi , basaga miliyoni ( 1000000 ) nk' uko imibare ibigaragaza haruguru .
and all those people were killed by their fellow rwandans . ||| kandi ibyo byose bikozwe n' abandi banyarwanda ,
which was done in broad daylight . ||| bikorwa ku manywa y' ihangu ,
i believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the rwandans . ||| nraumva abanyamahanga babigizemo uruhare wenda ari bakeya , ariko ku bwanjye mpamya abanyarwanda aribo bahemukaiye abandi banyarwanda .
therefore i believe that rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ rwandans ] . ||| nkaba nbasabaaga rero abanyarwanda , cyane cyane abagitsimbaraye ku mutaima wo kutagaragaza ukuri ,
so , i am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it . ||| ko bagombye kuvugaish ukuri ku bibaye , kuko nta yinri nkaunga tukeneye ku munyarwanda uri muri iki gihugu , uretse kugaragaza ukuri ku bibaye . abanyarwanda baraishwe izuba riva ,
because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . people were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open . ||| ni ngombaw ko tukagaragaza na none izuba riva uko bigiye bigenda . abantu bagitsimbaraye rero nibave ku izima ,
therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth . ||| baumvae yuko ukuri gukenewe , kandi ko bianze bikunze umusanzu we ari ukugaragaza ukuri .
to the genocide survivors i would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible . ||| abacitse ku icumu nabo , nagirango mbe nbabwira yuko tubasabye imbabazi tuivuye ku mutaima .
which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history . ||| kuko icyaha tukoze n' icyaha kitasanzwe niko nbiita mu mateka y' isi ,
in the past , rwandans used to be kind . ||| ariko abanyarwanda kera bajyaaga bagira umutima w' impuhwe ,

it was here in murambi where we were on a night patrol together with other soldiers . we were making light so as to reveal the enemy passing by . ||| aha i murambi turi turi ku irondo , turi kumwe n' abaserire , tucanye ngo tureba umwanzi , ngo atahita .

it took place in our home village in gashiha cell , in muganza sector in karama commune . ||| turikoreraaga iwacu mu cyaro serire gashiha ... secteur muganza , commune karama .
who organized it ? briefly explain to us about the patrol , before you tell us what happened in murambi . ||| nk' iryo rondo ni bande bari bararitegetse ? tusobanuraire gatoya mbere y' uko utubwira iby' i murambi ?
a certain local leader whose name was anastase uwihanyanye organized it . he had got an order from ngezahayo the burgomaster . ||| irondo ryari rirategetse na responsable anastase uwihanganye . abitegetswe na bourgmestre ngenzahayo .
we patrolled with other local leaders in shifts and whoever would try to dodge would be punished . ||| turikoranaaga na ba nyumbakumi na responsable , tugahinduranya kurara . utariraye yarahanawaga ,
it was an order from the authorities that we should hunt for the enemy . ||| tuhigaaga ... ngo turahiga umwanzi . niko batutegekaaga .
what was his name ? ||| witwa nde ?
he was called kabera . ||| witwa kabera .
the number of attackers had really increased ; it was about 8 o'clock in the evening . ||| abantu ... igitero kiri kimaze kuremera , ari kinshi . icyo kihae hari ninjoro , biri bimaze nko kuba nka saa munani z' ijoro .
then we were told that the tutsi were in murambi . ||| abantu ari benshi , baratubwira bati @: "@ noneho dore abatutsi bari hano hakurya i murambi , nimwihinduranye ,
then we were asked to put on eucalyptus leaves since they might also come while camouflaged . ||| muambarae inturusu . ati @: bataza ... ati @: kuko ,
then we wore the eucalyptus leaves . ||| ati @: nabo ... ati @: hariho igihe bakuambara inturusu , cyangwa bakaambara ibirere ,
it was a command from the counselor . ||| ati @: nimwihinduranye , ati @: muambarae inturusu . @"
when we reached there , we found a man called xavier . ||| tuca inturusu , turazambara , tubitegetswe na responsable na conseiller . tuhageze nhasanze undi muntu ufite imbunda witwa saveri ,
he had a gun ... he is also in prison . ||| nawe arafunze , uri ufite imbunda . batujya inberae ... bon ,
after sometime , a certain man came from murambi and told us it was no longer possible because we were few . ||| turahaguma . haza umuntu uvuye hano i murambi , aravuga ngo @: "@ byapfubye ,
that we should leave and come back another time . ||| ngo @: turi bakeya , ngo @: nidutahe tuzagarukae undi munsi . @"
therefore , we did n't attack on that day . ||| ntiitwa ... ntibaza ku ... ntituhatera ... ntibahatera turi kumwe n' abo ba ... bafite imbunda bari baturi inberae ,
we went back home with our leaders . ||| twe tufite impiri n' i ... n' imipanga . uwo munsi kuri cumi n' umunani [ 18 /04 /1994 ] , tusubira imuhair .
on 21st they told us that things had worsened that we should go back to murambi . ||| kuri makumyabiri na rimwe [ 21 @/ 04 /1994 ] turaongera ... turi ku irondo ati @: "@ noneho bikomeye , ati @: nimuzae tusubirae i murambi ,
at that time we went back and the number [ of attackers ] had increased . ||| ati @: itariki n' iyingiyi . @" turaza tuza turi benshi noneho ,
i was with our local leader called senkware and another one called serujangwe . ||| ndi kumwe ... abo tubyukaanye iwacu , nri ndi kumwe na nyumbakumi witwa senkware , ari hanze ; ndi kumwe n' uwitwa serujangwe ,
all of them are out . ||| ari hanze nawe ...
what do you mean by saying that , "@ he is out @"@ ? ||| kuvuga ngo @: "@ ari hanze bisobanuye iki ?
does it mean out of the country ... ? ||| ari hanze y' igihugu ... ?
not arrested ... i mean they are not imprisoned . ||| ntafunze ... yee , abo ntibafunze .
but they are in the country ? ||| ariko bari ino ?
yes they are all inside the country but out of jail . ||| bari ino . abo bose bari hanze .
we came . ||| turaza igitero kiri kiremereye .
we were in a large group led by the man called ngaje who was a supervisor in nyanza . ||| turaza n' abo ... musirikare witwa nkaje yakoraaga i nyanza yari umusuruveya [ urinda gereza ] afite imbunda y' igiti [ iriya y' igiti , itari icyuma ] , afite irimo amasasu . n' uwo saveri turi kumwe .
then we held a meeting with two local leaders and both of them are brothers ; we are together here in prison . ||| conseiller noneho aturemaish inama , na responsable turafunganye [ ni na mukuru wanjye ni n' ishumi yanjye tuva inda imwe ] . narabimwemeje yanga kubiemera . ku buryo banyirukanaiye n' umugore ntawe uhari ngo kubera ko nvuga ibyo .
i told him to confess but he refused . ||| ubwo responsable atushyiramo iyo nkuru , na conseiller atushyiramo iyo nkuru , ati @: "@ nimuzae ati @:
and in return , they chased away my wife because i was trying to make them confess . ||| bourmestre ngezahayo , atubwiye ko @: bianze bikunze , ngo @:
those two leaders convinced us that burgomaster ngenzahayo had a written command from the mayor , which was saying that we had to go to murambi to kill the tutsi in order to save our people . ||| abonye urupapuro , prefet yamwoherereje ‘ bukibaruta ’ [ izina rya prefet ] yuko muri muganza iwacu , tugomba kutabara abandi ngo @: tukaza i murambi ;
we came here on 21st and gathered up at a nearby school . ||| ngo kuica abatutsi . @" turaje kuri makumyabiri na rimwe [ 21 /04 /1994 ] . kuri cumi n' umunani [ 18 /04 /1994 ] igitero kiri cyapfubye tuje kuri mmakumyabiri na rimwe [ 21 /04 /1994 ] . tugeze ku w' akato hano hakurya ... ubwo ngubwo tubumbiye hamwe tuesae hano hakurya ,
we were commanded to wear eucalyptus leaves , then we moved from kiribi up to here . ||| ku gashuri kari hano hakurya .. tuambaye inturusu babidugetse , turaza , turi ikiriri ,
we met people from mudasomwa there and many other people who had been gathered from many other places using a lorry . ||| ngeze hari ... hano ... ahangaha turi abantu benshi , tuhahurair na mutasomaw , imodoka zatunze abaturage , abaturage bari benshi cyane ... benshi cyane ... abaturage .
therefore , when we got ... here , they told us to stand up and go to murambi . ||| ubwo ngubwo tumaze kugera hakurya ahangaha . bati @: "@ noneho nimuhagaruke mujyae i murambi . @" turaza turi abaturage benshi .
we had two people among us who had guns ; it was xavier and ngaje . ||| abantu bari baturimo babiri , bari bafite imbunda , aribo baturi inberae . uwitwa saveri yari afite imbunda .
we were with the counselor and other local leaders and one of them was called sebukima innocent , the other one was called senkware venuste . ||| uwitwa nkaje yari afite i mbunda . tuza turi kumwe na conseiller , turi kumwe na nyumbakumi witwa sebukima innocent . turi kumwe na nyumbakumi witwa senkware venuste ;
uwihanganye was also there . ||| turi kumwe na responsable uwihanganye .
we were many people from different sectors like muganza and kiraro . ||| turaza n' abaturage benshi cyane . ba cellure kira ... secteur kiraro , na secteur muganza . amasecteur atandukanye .
they gave us the rules to follow and we were immediately told to wear eucalyptus leaves . ||| ubwo turaza batuha amabwiriza ku w' akato . tuambara inturusu .
we went with our machetes up to murambi and stopped beside that house without a roof . ||| turaza tufite impiri n' imipanga . turaza tugeze hano i murambi tuhagarara hano hari inzu itasakaye , y' amatafari .
for how long did the killing take place ? ||| iyo ntiambara ... ubwo bwicanyi bumaze nk' igihe kingana iki ?
the killings stopped at 4:00 a.m. , when it was almost dawn . ||| ubwo bwicanyi bugejeje saa ... bugejeje saa cyenda ... bugejeje saa kumi . bugiye kucya , niho bugejeje , saa kumi .
that is when the shootings stopped . ||| amasasu nibwo yazimye .
what happened afterwards ? ||| nyuma hakurikiyeho iki ?
they [ interahamwe ] started looting their property and stealing bags from the dead bodies . ||| nyuma hakurikiyeho ... hakurikiyeho ... ... barasahuye , babambura ibikapu , babisahura intumbi .
during that war that took place , which role did you play ? ||| none se nkawe muri iyo ntiambara yabaye , ibikorwa byawe ukoze ni ibihe ?
did you kill some people ? ||| ese hari abantu wishe ?
the role that i played ... i killed some people . ||| ibikorwa biangae ? nrabaishe .
how many did you kill ? ||| nka bangahe ?
i killed two people . ||| nishe babiri
what about those in your company , did n't you see them killing ... ? ||| abo mwari kumwe se ku ruhande rwawe bo ntabo ubonaaga bica ... ?
yes i did . the local people we were with would get any tutsi who would try to escape and kill him or her with a club ... i was with them ... ||| abo turi kumwe b' abaturage uwacikaga ku icumu agiye kucika , nabo babaicishaaga ubuhairi . abo baturagae turi turi kumwe .
if you consider the size of murambi , were you all on one side ... ? were you surrounding it all ... ? how was it ? ||| ugereranyaije urabona uko murambi ingana . mwari muhagaze ahantu hamwe ? mwari muyizengurutse ... biri bimeze kutae ?
after the soldiers reinforced the [ murambi ] natives , they continued with the war . ||| abo ngabo b' abaturage . bamaze ... ... abasirikare bamaze kaubaha ingufu , bari abaturage benshi , nibo bagendaaga bagira ... basonga .
i am asking you whether you surrounded the whole area or whether you were in one place . ||| nyine ndi kukubaza urareba murambi , igihe mwicaga . mwari muhagaze ahantu hamwe , cyangwa mwari muzengurutse ikigo i nyuma ?
soldiers are the ones who surrounded the area but citizens were just beside that house . ||| abasirikare bari bazengurutse ikigo , bari kurasa . abaturage bahagaze kuri iriya nzu . ariko abatutsi bamaze kuhunga birukaatse ,
but when the tutsis started running interahamwe followed them in that school and even in the homes they where they were hiding and started hacking them . ||| abaturage barabairukankaije , babasanga mu kigo . babasanga no mu mazu bihishemo , barabatemagura .
you personally , did you kill anyone you knew before ? ||| wowe ubwawe hari abantu wishe uri uzi ?
i did n't kill anyone i knew but there is some tutsi neighbour who was killed while i was seeing . even counselor budengeri was present . someone killed that tutsi a painful death while i was watching . ||| njyewe ubwanjye nta bantu nishe nri nzi , ariko hari umututsi turi tuturanye bamwishe nreba . hari n' undi mukonseye witwaga budengeri , hari umuntu wamwishe urushinyaguro nreba
what about those you killed , how did you kill them ... how long did you take to kill people ? ||| abo wishe ubaishe utae ... ubaishe mu kihae kingana iki ?
the people i killed ... i hit him with a club and he died right way . ||| abo nishe ... nmukubise ubuhairi ,
the same for the other one , i hit him with the club and he immediately died . ||| ahita yuma . undi nawe mukubita ubuhairi , ahita yuma .
what interval of time did you kill them ? did you kill them at the same time or it was at different times ? ||| ubaishe mu hagati y' igihe kingana iki ? ubaishe mu mwanya umwe , cyangwa ubaishe nko mu masaha atandukanye ?
i killed two people ... i killed them in ... as i 've just said , i hit him with a club and he immediately died . ||| abo nishe babiri , nbaishe ... nk' uko nvuze , ako kanya nmukubise ubuhairi mu mutawe , ahita apfa .
what time was it ? ||| hari saa nkahae , icyo kihae ?
i killed him towards morning . it was around 4:00 a.m. ||| njyae namwishe , bugiye kucyae mu gitondo , nka saa ... nka saa kumi za mugitondo .
did you get time to properly identify whether he was a tutsi or not ? ||| ubonye umwanya wo kumwitegereza , ngo umenye ko ari umututsi ?
i believe he was a tutsi because there was no hutu among them . ||| ni umututsi , kuko nta muhutu uri uhari .
and when did you kill the second one ? ||| naho ukurikiyeho wamwishe ryari ? wamwishe saa nkahae ?
like this ... i killed both of them at the same time . ||| uku ... bose ni igihe kimwe .
did you kill them in a few minutes interval ? ||| ubaishe mu minota mikeya ikurikiraan ?
i killed both of them in a few minutes interval . ||| nbaishe mu minota mikeya ikurikiraan .
what if that person did n't die , would you recognize him today if you met him ? ||| tuvugae niba uwo muntu ... aah , yarabayeho nyuma , ushobora kuba uragize ngo yapfuye ariko akaza kubaho . umubonye umumenya ?
i do n't think i would recognize him because there were people of all kinds . ||| mubonye kuko hari hahungiye ingeri nyinshi ,
so i would n't know him . ||| ntabwo nmumenya .
you do n't even remember his looks ... ? are n't you able to say , "@ the person i killed looked like so and so ? @" ||| ntabwo ujya wibuka nk' ukuntu yasaga , ngo uvugae uti @: "@ umuntu nkubise yasaga atya ? @"
i think i remember what he looked like . ||| uko nbiibuka , nibuka uko yasaga .
did you know where they came from ? ||| ntabwo uzi aho abo bantu bavaaga ?
i did n't know where they came from ; they had fled to murambi . ||| abo bantu ntabwo nzi aho bavaaga . bari bahunze . bahungiye i murambi
did you have any reason for killing them ? ||| none ku bwawe nk' icyo kihae wamwicaga wunvaaga umwiciye iki ?
it was just because of the bad leadership that forced us to kill but otherwise i would not have killed them . ||| numvaaga ku bwanjye bitewe na ... bitewe ... na leta mbi , yari ya ... n' abategetsi ubutegetsi bubi buri buri bwa ... butushutse ngo tuicanae , niyo mpamvu yabinteye , ntabwo ubundi nri kubica .
you have recently known that it was a bad leadership because now there is a good one . ||| kuba ari ubutegetsi bubi , ubizi ubu . kuko hari ubundi .
i believe if you had known before that it was a bad leadership you would not have killed them . ||| icyo kihae iyo umenya ko ari bubi ntabwo uba urabaishe .
therefore there should be other reasons that forced you to kill ; would you tell us some of those reasons that might have forced you to kill . ||| hari impamvu yinri y' icyo kihae utari umenya ko ubwo butegetsi ari bubi yatumye ubica . ni iyihe mpamvu ?
the reason i killed them is because the authorities ordered us to . they said , "@ there is only one enemy and you must kill him or her , and if you do n't , you yourself shall be killed . @" ||| impamvu yatumye nbica icyo kihae . impamvu yatumye nbica icyo kihae , ni uko icyo kihae bavugaaga bati @: "@ nimu ... hariho ubwicanyi , bavuga ngo @: umwanzi n' umwe . @" kandi tubitewe n' abategetsi , bati @: " utamwica , utaica abatutsi . ati @: nawe turamwica . @"
from your personal point of view , did they appear like your enemies ? ||| nonese ku bwawe abo bantu uri uraigeze ubabona ari abanzi ?
we never had any conflicts between us . ||| abo bantu nta n' ikintu tupfaaga . ntinri no kubica ... nta n' ikintu tupfaaga ntinri kubica , ni uko kusa ... ni nk' ibintu ... ahari ... sina ... nka ... kugirango nicae abo bantu ,
in fact i would n't have killed them if it were n't that they told us that if we did n't kill them , they would definitely kill us . ||| baravugaaga bati @: "@ utamwica bati @: ntawe turamwica . @"
are you trying to say that if you had refused to kill then , you would have been immediately killed ? ||| urashaka kuvuga yuko iyo icyo kihae , abo bantu utabica , uri kuhita wicwa ako kanya ? hari uwakugiye inyuma aravuga ngo @:
is there anyone who came to you and said , "@ if you do n't kill , i will kill you . @"@ ? ||| "@ nutabica ntakuica ? @"
that is why i realized that what i did was very bad and reported myself . ||| abo bantu iyo ntabi ... abo bantu ... niyo mpamvu nnjyae numvise ibyo bintu ari bibi nkabiirega ,
i killed innocent people who had n't done any thing wrong to me . that is why whenever i think about it , i become very miserable because i killed my fellow people yet they had n't done anything to me . ||| abo bantu nbaishe nta kintu na kimwe bankoshereje , nta na kimwe , ku buryo nnjyae binteye agahinda yuko nishe bagenzi banjye , nbahoye ubusa .
so if you had let them pass and you had not hacked them they might have been alive up to now ? ||| ni ukuvuga yuko iyo abo bantu baza kuza , ntubaturae impiri yawe , ukayireka aho uyifite bakatambuka , bari kubaho .
yes they would be alive . ||| bari kubaho ,
if i had n't killed them , they would be alive today . ||| iyo ntabica bari kubaho .
maybe they would have survived through god 's mercy . ||| iyo nbareka banguye ho simbakubite impiri , yenda bari kubaho ... kuko iyo nbareka bari kubaho ... bari kurokoka , kubw' imaan yabo .
so that means that you did it voluntarily and no one forced you ? ||| ni ukuvuga ko ni wowe ubaiiciye , ntabwo ari ukuvuga yuko ari undi ukushyizeho agahato ngo bicae ?
i was convinced by those people to go to that place . when i reached there my savagery led me to killing those innocent people . ||| abo bantu ... nica abo bantu , nri nje mu ... aho ngaho nyine twahu ... nahurujwe nzanye n' abongabo , hanyuma bitewe n' umutima wanjye , w' ubunyamaswa mpita nica abo bavandimwe .
so it was out of your own will ? ||| ni ubushake bwawe ntabwo ari undi ... ?
no one forced me , it was out of my own will and that is why i apologize for what i did . ||| ibyo bintu nta muntu ubintegetse , ni ubushake bwanjye , niyo mpamvu nbisabair imbabazi .
how did you know the people you tormented and who are they ? ||| abo uzi ubamenye utae ? abo wiciye uzi uvuga ni abahe ? ubamenye utae ?
they were our neighbours just in the nearby area . ||| abo nzi niciye , hari abo ... n' abo muri serile tuturanye .
did you kill other people from that same area ? ||| muri serile muturanye hari abandi wishe ?
yes there are some people i killed . ||| hari abo nishe .
how many people did you kill altogether ? ||| abantu bose wishe hamwe ni bangahe ?
i killed a certain child called kagina and a man called manama . ||| abo nishe , nishe umwana witwa kagina . mwicana n' umugabo witwa manama [ kayihura ] . kagina twaramwishe ... kagina yari yihishe kwa muramu wanjye .
kagina was hiding at the home of my in @-@ laws . ||| yihishe kwa muramu wanjye , umuhungu witwa kayihura ati @: "@ hariya hepfo hari umwana uhaihishe , ngiye kumuzana ,
then a certain boy call kiyihura found me standing in front of my coffee plantation and told me , "@ there is a child who is hiding at the place of your in @-@ laws , he is an inkotanyi [ rpf member ] i am going to bring him so that we kill him . @" ||| ni inkotanyi . @" nri ndi ku mutawe w' ikawa zanjye , arambwi ... noneho aranbwira , ati @:
he went and brought him . ||| "@ uriya mwana wihishe kwa muramu wawe , ngiye kumuzana , tumwice . @" aragenda aramuzamura ,
he made him pass by a place called muhora in muhungo when we reached there we found six other men . ||| amaze kumuzamura , amunyuza ahantu , ku muhora mu bahungo , tuhahurair n' abandi bagabo bageze kuri batandatu .
then we took the boy , kayihura and cyprien ntakirutimana who is in jail today , tied him up with ropes made out of tough grass and drowned him in the river . ||| umwana turamujyana , uwo kayihura n' undi witwa sipiriyani ntakirutimana arafunze , baramuboha n' inshinge bamuroha mu ruzi .
from all you have said , it sounds like other people drowned that kid in the river , but you are saying that you killed him . ||| ko wunva ari abandi bamuroshye mu ruzi , wowe ukaba uvuga ko wamwishe ,
so what do you mean ... ? ||| icyo ushaka kutubwira n' iki ?
what do you mean when you say that you killed him ? ||| ... icyo ushaka kurubwira ni iki ?
you told us that other people drowned him ; they tied him with grass made out of ropes but in no time you are telling us that you killed him ... ||| uratubwira ko hari abandi bamuroshye mu ruzi . bamuhambiriye n' ishingae , kandi mukanya utubwiye ko wamwishe ...
that child called kagina was taken and the people who took him killed him while i was there . ||| uwo kagi ... mwana witwa kagina , twa ... baramushoreye , bamaze kumushorera , abamwishe bamwishe mpari .
which means that if they never killed him , i would have killed him myself . ||| kuko iyo batamwica , nnjyae ubwo nri kumwica .
did you help them ? ||| urabafashije ?
i did not help them . ||| nibo bifashije ,
but i was just standing watching . like the way i 'm standing now . ||| ariko nri mpagaze nk' uko mpagaze uku ,
they drowned him while i was watching and we were together . ||| bamuroshye nreba . turi turi kumwe .
okay , tell me now ... the people you killed yourself how many are they ? ||| none nbwira . abantu wowe ku giti cyawe ... ubwawe , wishe ni bangahe ?
do n't worry , if you do n't remember them it is okay . ||| niba utabaibuka nabwo nta kibazo ..
the people i killed myself ... they are ... [ counting with fingers ] i killed three people . ||| abantu ubwanjye nishe ku giti cyanjye ... abantu ku giti cyanjye nishe ... nishe ... umwe [ asa n' ubara ku ntoki ] nishe batatu .
those are the people you killed with your own hands ? ||| wiyiciye n' amaboko yawe ?
yes , those are the people i killed with my own hands . ||| yee niiciye n' amaboko yanjye .
there are the two others from murambi you told us ... ||| hari abo utubwiye babiri b' i murambi .
well , there 's another child i killed myself . ||| yee , hari undi mwana nnjyae niiciye umwe .
after killing him ... i hit him with a club and threw his body in the river . ||| maze kumwica nmukubise ubuhairi mujugunya mu ruzi .
how did you see him ? ||| uri umubonye utae ?
explain to us . ||| gira icyo utubwira utusobanuraire .
we were looking for his father and failed to get him . ||| uko nri mubonye , turi tugiye kureba ise ... ise . ise tumubuze ,
but i saw the son . therefore i decided to kill the son . ||| nbonye umwana ndamwica .
were you with other people ? ||| hari abandi mwari muri kumwe ?
we were three but i 'm the one who killed him . the other men whom we were together did n't . ||| turi turi kumwe bagabo ba ... babiri nnjyae wa gatatu , ariko umwana ninjye wamwishe , abo ntibamwishe . turi turi kumwe ,
i am the one who killed him . ||| ni jyewe wamwiyiciye .
my question is , during that time when you were killing him , what was your main reason of killing him ? i mean , not now ... but then , what was going on in your mind ? how were you feeling inside ? ||| none icyo nkubazaaga . igihe wamwicaga wunvaaga umwiciye iki ? bitari ubu . icyo kihae uko uri umeze mu mutawe wawe ,
what was your attitude ? ||| no mubikorwa byawe . wunvaaga umeze utae ?
at the time when i was doing it , i had wild thoughts that made me think we were hunting ... wherever i saw a tutsi i would kill . ||| mu bikorwa byanjye icyo kihae uko biri bimeze ... kumwica ku giti cyanjye , numvaaga umutima wanjye , uri umeze nk' umutima w' inyamaswa . ari ... uvuga ngo ... barahiga ... ahari umututsi ... nicae .
so you felt like you did not have any interactions with the tutsi ... ? i am asking you ... did you feel like you did n't want to interact them ? ||| mbese wunvaaga abatutsi ubavanyeho amaboko ? ... ... ntakubaza ? wunvaaga abatutsi ubavanyeho amaboko .
by then ... imagine i had killed an innocent child who had n't done anything wrong to me ! ||| icyo kihae kugirango nicae uwo mwana , nta kintu tupfa , nta na kimwe , ureba nd' umuntu ukuze ,
you can see i am an old man ... that was really a very bad thing to do . ||| uwo mwana kugira ngo muicae , nnjyae ubwo uraumva ko nta kintu namwiciye , uraumva nkoze nabi .
you mean there 's no one who is imprisoned ? ||| nta n' umwe ufunze ?
there 's no one in prison . at least no one from my family , maybe my neighbours . ||| nta n' umwe ufu ... ufunze . abo tuva inda imwe ... abo tuva inda imwe ntawunri ... nta muntu nzi ukoze jenoside , keretse abaturage turi tuturanye .
you have told us that you killed the tusti because your leaders forced you to . so personally what did you think of the tutsi before the genocide ? ||| umaze kutubwira ko wishe abatutsi , bimwe ari abategetsi ubibabwiye . ubundi nkawe umuntu witwa umututsi umubonaaga utae mbere ya jenoside ?
before the genocide , the bad leadership of that time influenced us . they used to convince us that our only enemy was the tutsi . ||| mbere ya jenoside , abategetsi babishishikarizaga cyane , ngo @: umwanzi ngo @:
so we were forced to believe it and yet it was not true . simply because the government was sensitizing us all the time . ||| ni umwe , tukabibona ko abo bantu ari abanzi bacu , kandi ari nta kintu tupfa , tubitewe n' ubutegetsi burimo bubidushishikariza buri kanya .
when did they start telling you that ? ||| ibyo batangiye kubibabwira ryari ?
they started telling us that after habyarimana 's death . ||| ibyo batangiye kubitubwira habyarimana amaze kupfa .
we are asking you how you used to find the tutsi before habyarimana 's death . ||| noneho turi ku kubaza , mbere ya habyarimana . wowe ubonaaga umututsi kutae ?
before the genocide we would intermarry , i even have a sister who got married in that ethnic group . ||| intambara itaraba . intambara itaraba , turi turashyingiraanye , turahanye abageni ,
we were friendly . ||| nfite na mushiki wanjye uri urahashatse . turaganiraaga .
so you used to look at them as if they were your relatives but later on you changed your attitude towards them ... i guess you know something about the war that took place in 1990 , is n't it ? ||| none ... ubabonaaga nk' abavandimwe biza kuhinduka . nkeka intambara ya za mirongo icyenda [ 1990 ] urayizi , cyangwa urayumvaaga itangira . wigeze ubiumva ?
yes i heard about it . ||| nrabiumvise .
during that time , did n't you see signs , which showed that in the future there would be genocide in rwanda ? ||| muri kiriya kihae . nta bintu by' ibimenyetso wigeze ubona , ko jenoside ishobora kuzaba mu rwanda ?
we could hear that there was a war going on towards kibungo . that there were people coming from exile who were fighting against the people they found in the country . but for us in gikongoro it was peaceful . ||| muri icyo kihae muri za mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] , numvaaga bavuga bati @: "@ hepfo iriya za kibungo , ngo @: hari mirwano ... imirwano bari kurwana . @" hanyuma icyo kihae tuumva ngo @: bari kurwana bitaragera ino . tusangira nabo tusabana amazi , bavuga bati @: " ni abanyarwanda bari kutaha iwabo , bari kurwana n' abandi . @"@ ino ku gikongoro , intambara yari itarahagera .
therefore , you never saw any signs of the genocide ? ||| ku buryo nta bimenyetso wigeze ubona ko jenoside ishobora kuzaba ?
i started seeing those signs after habyarimana 's death . ||| ibimenyetso ... ntangiye kubona ko jenoside igiye kuba , habyarimana amaze kupfa .
is that the time you saw signs ? ||| niho ubibonye ?
yes , that 's when i saw some signs ||| niho nbibonye .
let me ask you ... you have just said that all changed after habyarimana 's death . ||| hari icyo nkubaza . uvuze ko byose bihise bihinduka habyarimana akimara kupfa .
which changes did you experience after habyarimana 's death ? ||| ni iki ubona kihise kihinduka cyane kuri wowe , habyarimana akimara kupfa .
and how did you handle those changes ? ||| mbese uba urabiifashemo utae ?
after habyarimana 's death , i was at a place where i was working as a watchman . ||| habyarimana akimara kupfa , hari ahantu nraraga izamu ry' umugabo nrariraga , noneho nzakuza ... nzakubona ahantu bari kutwika amazu ,
as i was coming from mudasomwa to buy irish potatoes , i met a tutsi woman who asked me , "@ gaspard , how come those houses across are burning ? ||| nvuye mu mutasomaw kugura ibirayi . nraza nyura ku mugorae w' umututsi , aranbwira ati @: "@ ese gaspard ,
what is happening and why are you running ? @" ||| ati @: ko nruzi hariya batwitse amazu , ati @: bimeze bite ... kandi ukaba wiruka ?
then i told her i was from buying irish potatoes from gasharu . ||| nramubwira nti @: nvuye kugura ibirayi ku kahair ,
but i told her that i had left houses being burnt up there . ||| nsize amazu ari gushya hariya haruguru , nti @:
i told her how i met some men taking cow 's there in mushishito . ||| mpuye n' abagabo bikoreye inyama z' inka , nti @: hariya mu mushishito .
then i told her , "@ since you are my neighbour i will tell you what is going on . ||| nti @: ariko bitewe yuko nkuzi uri umuturanyi wanjye , nti @:
from now on , i will never work as a watchman anymore . ||| ngiye kubikubwira ariko uyu munsi ntinongera kurara izamu .
they are killing the tutsi ! @" ||| nti nbonye ari abatutsi barimo bica ! yee nti @: ni abatutsi barimo bica . ati @:
then she thanked me and immediately left ; she never slept there in her home . ||| "@ urakoze . @" nti @: nibo ... nti nibo barimo bica . ubwo yahise afumyamo ntiiongeye kurara ahongaho .
i also went home and stopped moving around . i stayed at home . ||| ubwo nnjyae , nhise ntaha njya imuhair nva ku zamu , njya imuhair .
after realizing what was about to take place , did n't you at least think of what you should do to help your neighbours since you had even intermarried ? ||| none ukimara kubimenya se nta gitekerezo ... ko wunvaishe ko abatutsi baicwa , nta gitekerezo uba uragize , cyo kurwana kubo mwari muturanye ? ko unavuze ko hari abo mwari mwarashyingiranywe ?
my neighbours ... when they heard about it , they all fled . some came here to murambi . ||| igitekerezo cyabo turi tuturanye , bamaze kaumva ibyo ngibyo , bahita bahunga . bamwe bahungira hano ... bahungiye hano i murambi .
you told us that here in murambi was a horrible massacre . after the killings do you know of something else that followed in your home village ? ||| utubwiye ko hano i murambi habaye ubwicanyi buhaambaye . nyuma yuko ubwo bwicanyi buba hari ibindi bintu uzi byakurikiyeho ? mu kituragae iwanyu ...
after the murambi battle , no more killings took place . ||| nyuma y' intambara y' i murambi , nta bunri bwicanyi bubayeho ,
the french troops intervened and stopped it . ||| hahise haza abafaransa , bahita babuhosha .
did the french find any tutsi around ? ||| abafaransa basanze hari abatutsi bakiriho ?
they found all the tutsi already dead . ||| abafaransa basanze abatutsi barapfuye .
it sounds like the french came to cover up the deeds of those who went to exile ? ||| ni ukuvuga ko abo bafaransa icyo bakoze ari ukugirango ... bakingaiye ikibaba abantu bahunze ?
yes they just wanted to cover up on what those people had done but the tutsi had already died . ||| yee , bakingaiye ikibaba abantu bahunze , ariko abatutsi barapfuye .
do you remember when the french reached here ? ||| hagati abatutsi ... bambe abafaransa wibuka igihe bagereye ino ?
i do n't remember ... ||| ntabwo nkaibuka , ntinkaibuka .
maybe it was within a short time after the catastrophe that happened in murambi ... ||| ariko hari igihe kihise mo i murambi hamaze kubera ishyano ?
they found when all tutsi from murambi had already died . ||| basanze abatutsi b' i murambi barapfuye .
when you estimate , what time do you think it was ? ||| ugereranyaije ni nk' igihe kingana iki ?
if i estimate ... the tutsi died ... i heard that the french had reached kibuye and within a short time i heard that they had reached gikongoro . ||| ngereranyaije ... ngereranije abatutsi barapfuye ... abafaransa numvaishe ngo bigeze ku kibuye , ngiye kaumva numva ngo na hano ku gikongoro bahaje ,
but that was less than a month time after the tutsi had been murdered . ||| ariko nta kihae cy' ukwezi kishize , abatutsi bamaze kupfa .
that is not what i was asking . i know you 've changed and you are a good person . ||| oya , ntinkubaza ko ubaye umuntu mwiza ibyo nrabiemera .
but i was asking whether you remember what you did ... what 's the most painful souvenir ... ? ||| ntakubaza uraibuka ibyo ukoze ... ikintu kikubabaza ...
what i remember that always hurts me are the innocent people who were killed . ||| ikintu kibi kinbabaje cyane , nibuka abantu bapfuye bazize akarengaane , bazize ubusa .
well , those who died were all innocent . ||| bose bazize akarengaane bazize akarengaane .
but as a person who was in murambi , what would be the souvenir that you will never forget ? ||| ariko turaibuka hano nk' umuntu uri uri i murambi . ikintu utazaibagirwa ,
something you ever think about , maybe blood that dropped on you ... ||| wenda se n' amaraso yakuguyeho ...
what i can never forget are the people who died here , killed by wrong doers . ||| ikintu ntazaibagirwa , ni abantu baguye hano , baishwe n' abantu b' abakizi ba nabi .
i mean you personally . let me give you an example . ||| kuri wowe reka tukuhae urugero .
let 's say you have a wife and you quarrel frequently ; you quarrel once , twice , three times and finally you fight . ||| ushobora kuba ubana n' umugore wawe , mukajya mutongana , rimwe , kabiri ,
and maybe she hits you with a burning charcoal or you hit her toot . that can stick in your mind maybe because it is what hurts you the most in the whole fight . now , comparing that example to this situation . ||| gatatu . mukazarwana , ariko noneho rmwe ukazibuka yakuteye ikishirair cyangwa wowe ukimuteye . akaba ari cyo kikubabaza .
you came to murambi , is n't it ? ||| na hano i murambi urahageze .
so tell me among all the horrible things you did or saw , what do you remember ... something that stuck in your head ? ||| sibyo ? nbwira mu bikorwa bibi byose ukoze , cyangwa n' abandi n' icyo ubonye . icyo ujya wunva kikusigara mu mutawe ujya ubona .
maybe a memory about hacking somebody or somebody you saw being crushed by a grenade . that is all we need to know . ||| wenda se ni umuntu utemye , ni uwo ugize ni uwo se ubonye ashibukanwa na gerenade ... nicyo tushaka kumenye .
an incident that you will never forget . ||| icyo utazaibagirwa wowe ...
the thing i will never forget is seeing people being crushed by grenades . ||| ikintu ntazaibagirwa , ni abantu nbonye batera grenade bakabica .
i will never forget that . ||| ikintu ntazaibagirwa ...
what happened ? ||| bigenze kutae iyo grenade ?
a grenade was thrown to them and they died . ||| barayibateye barapfa .
how did they open the grenade ... ? how did you see them dying ? ||| bayifunguye kutae ... ubonye imipfire yabo bapfuye kutae ...
what i saw about their death , they fell down and died slobbering . ||| imipfire yabo nbonye bikubita hasi , bazana urufuro .
that is all i saw . ||| nicyo nbonye .
is that all you saw ? i mean the worst thing you saw ... it might be an event that took place in the twinkling of an eye ? ||| ikintu nicyo wunva ... nicyo wunva ubonye kibi ... kibi ... nko mu munota umwe ... ?
the two men i killed myself is the worst thing i saw happening in the twinkling of an eye . ||| ikintu nbonye kibi ... kibi cyane ku munota umwe . ni abo bagabo babiri niiciye .
i will never forget that , in my whole lifetime . ||| ntizaibagirwa ku isi ,
yet they were innocent . ||| kandi mbajijije ubusa .
what do you remember about that event , which always comes back to your mind ? ||| icyo ubiibukaho ni iki kihora kigaruka ...
what i recall ... is the fact that i killed them . ||| icyo nbiibukaho ni uko nbaishe ,
i killed them with clubs and they died right away . ||| nbaicishije ubuhairi , bakahita bapfa .
whenever i recall it , i feel so sad . ||| nrabiibuka nkagira agahinda kanini cyane , nbica nbarenganyaije ari bagenzi banjye .
they were my people but i killed them . instead of hiding them i killed them . ||| ntabahishe nkabica ,
whenever i think about it i feel so sad . whenever i remember that i killed them ... that is why i ask god to forgive me . i always ask for forgiveness because i killed my comrades yet they were innocent . ||| njya nbiibuka nkagira agahinda kanini , yuko nbaishe , nkaba nbisabair imaan imbabazi .
i killed them because of the wrong mentality we were fed then . ||| yuko bagenzi banjye nbaishe nta kintu nbaziza , mbajijije ibitekerezo bibi biriho buri kihae ... icyogihe .
do you think about it often ? ||| ujya ubitekerezaho buri munsi ... ?
yes i often think about it and it fills me with misery . because of those two men i killed yet they were innocent . ||| nrabitekereza buri munsi cyane , nkagira agahinda cyane , kubw' abo bagabo nishe mbajijije ubusa .
you personally told us that you killed . ||| ku bwawe utubwiye ko wishe ,
there are some events that you still remember clearly and you admitted what you were accused of . how do you look at that crime especially when people accuse you to have participated in the genocide ? ||| hari n' ibyo wibuka neza . uzi ko wemeye icyaha nk' ubu ibyo bakurega ... icyo cyaha wunva ... ubifata utae , iyo bakubwiye ko ukoze jenoside ?
no one forced me to pleade guilty . i reported myself as my conscience did n't leave at peace because i knew what i did was very wrong . no one forced me i did it willingly . ||| ibyo biha , ni jyewe ubiireze bitewe n' umutima wanjye yuko nkoze ibintu bibi . nta muntu wabimpase ni jyewe ubiireze .
i reported myself in my home area and talked about what i did in murambi . ||| nza kubiirega ibyo muri selire , nza no kuvuga ibya hano i murambi ,
i saw so many innocent people dying in murambi . ||| bitewe n' uko nhabonye abantu bapfuye bazize akarengaane .
wrong doers killed them although they had not done anything wrong . those people had fled to murambi . ||| baishwe n' abakizi ba nabi , babahoye ubusa bahahungiye .
i reported myself about it before anybody reported me . ||| nza kuhairega nta muntu uhanreze ni jyewe uhaireze .
having participated in the genocide or being called a genocidaire , does it make you feel embarrassed ? ||| ku giti cyawe se , kuba urakoze jenoside , cyangwa bakuita ko ukoze jenoside , wunva ko ipfunwe bikuteye ?
having participated in the genocide ... personally i feel that , i did wrong . ||| kuba nrakoze jenoside , numva ku giti cyanjye , nrakoze nabi ,
and , it was due to the bad heart i had . ||| bitewe n' umutima mubi nri nfite . nyuma leta , iza kuvuga iti @:
later the government said , "@ you killed , tell us how you killed then we shall forgive you . @" ||| "@ mwarishe , ni muvugae ukuntu mwishe , tubabarirae . @"
then i thought about it and decided was going to say how i killed and then be pardoned by the government and by god . @" ||| nza kuibaza nravuga nti @: ngiye kuvuga ukuntu nishe , nzababarirwae ... ... banbabarirae n' imaan inbabarirae .
you know there is something called ‘ justice ’ that is being practiced in rwanda , concerning the genocide that happened . ||| ku bwawe se , ubu uzi ko hariho ikintu kiitwa ubutabera . cyane n' imanza nyinshi ziba mu rwanda ni izijyanye n' ibya jenoside ubona ubutabera bwo mu rwanda ,
so how do you think justice should be done ? ||| bugombye kukora iki ?
how should they go about it ? ||| kuri iki ... , ku bwawe . wunva bugombye kukora kutae ?
on my behalf , justice in rwanda ... i suggest that the government forgives me because i always try to simplify its work by confessing and convicting those who do n't admit their participation in murambi killings . ||| ubutabera bwo mu rwanda kuri njyewe , bitewe ko nvugaish ukuri , nkashinja abantu bataemera ibyabaye hano .
i say everything truthfully and i help the government by telling what happened here and what i personally got involved into . ||| nkabivugaishmo ukuri , nkafasha leta ntinyirushye nkavuga ibyabaye ,
therefore the government should forgive me . ||| n' ibyo nkoze @: nraumva , yanbabarira .
because i say the truth about what happened without giving them a hard time . ||| yuko nvugaish ukuri ibyabaye , ntayiruhije .
besides being forgiven , personally after all that happened in rwanda , what kind of justice should be done ? ||| usibye kuvuga ngo @: uzababarirwa ku giti cyawe . ariko se , ubutabera wifuza nyuma y' ibyabaye mu rwanda , wunva buba ari ubuhe ?
it is ‘ justice ’ that unites all rwandans . ||| ni ubutabera bwunga abanyarwanda ,
so that we can build our nation and stop what happened from happening again . ||| tukaubaka igihugu cyacu , ibyabaye nibyongere kuba .
we should build our nation and make it look like it was before people died . ||| tukakiubaka kikamera nk' uko kiri kimeze , na mbere abantu batarapfa .
you have just talked about unity and reconciliation . ||| kuri wowe ... uvuze ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge .
what do you think about unity and reconciliation ? ||| ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ubuumva utae ?
how do you expect it to work ? ||| wunva bukora kutae ?
i think unity and reconciliation should unite the rwandans so that they live in harmony the way they lived before . ||| ubumwe n' ubwiyunge nuko bwa kaunga abanyarwanda , bukabasubiza ... bukabasubiza ... bu ... ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ni uko bukaunga abanyarwanda , bakasubira bakabana nk' uko biri mbere ,
people should live with those they betrayed and ask for forgiveness . ||| bakabana n' abo bahemukaiye , bakabasaba imbabazi .
do you think that unity and reconciliation are possible after all that happened in rwanda ? ||| wunva se nyuma y' ibyabaye byoroshye kugira ngo ubumwe n' ubwiyunge buzageraweho ?
i know it 's hard to unite and reconcile after what happened in rwanda . ||| ibyabaye , ntabwo biri byoroshye ,
but again , the government is working hard so that people may say the truth about what happened in order to reconcile . ||| ariko leta y' u rwanda ntishaka kukora nk' ibyabaye , irashaka kaunga aba ... kaunga ababikoze , ngo bagaragazae ibyabaye ... ukuri .
you have told us that you confessed ; now we want to ask you whether you asked for forgiveness to the people you hurt . did you go to them , especially the survivors ? ||| ese ku bwawe ko wireze ukaemera icyaha ... utubwiye ko hari bamwe ukoreye icyaha , bamwe baba bararokotse uzi . urabaegereye ?
yes , there is a woman to whom i asked for forgiveness ; she was happy and she thanked me for having told her about the people i killed , she said she did n't know them . ||| yee , hari umugore negereye mubwira ukuri , mubwira nabo niciye , aravuga ngo @:
and then she said there was no problem with her ... i told her about who killed her family members and she said she did not know them . ||| ntiyari abazi , kuba ... mugaragariza imiryango ye yapfuye ati @: " rwose ati @: nta kibazo . @"
what does it mean when one says there is no problem ? ||| kuvuga ngo ntakibazo , bisobanuye iki ?
she said to me , "@ i did n't know those who killed my relatives . ||| ati @: "@ ntinri nzi abanyiciye ,
now you have told them to me and in fact we are neighbours . @" ||| nune urabagaragaza turaturanye , ati @:
she told me that they always deny that they did n't kill them . ||| ubwo ngubwo ... ati @: kandi babihakana ukaba ugaragaza ababaishe , ati @:
she appreciated me and said , "@ you say the truth , keep it up and do n't change . @" she told me to keep saying the truth like i had said about her family . ||| nraumva uvugaish ukuri . ati @: uzakomezae uvugae nk' uko uvuga , iyo miryango yanjye yapfuye . @"
but i am asking you if you think it is easy ? ||| ariko ntakubaza urabona byoroshye ?
being easy ... people should forgive those who did wrong to them since the majority is ready to forgive . ||| kaoroha kugirango abantu batangae imbabazi z' abantu babiciye , kuko ari benshi bazaitanga ,
maybe those who do n't accept their roles in the genocide yet there are evidences should be punished because they do n't want to expose the truth . ||| abaanga kuemera ibyaha by' ibyo bakoze kandi bibahama bakabahana , kuko baba baanga kugaragaza ukuri .
you have admitted the crimes you committed and always regret what you did . ||| kuri wowe umaze kuvuga ibyabaye unagize mo uruhare . urimo uvuga ko ubungubu bikukoma ku mutaima ukabyicuza ,
now according to you , how do you find the future of rwanda ? ||| ubundi u rwanda urubona utae , mu kihae kizaza ?
rwanda is no more like the former rwanda . children of rwanda today think about building their nation . ||| u rwanda ntubona ko rwa ... rutari nka mbere , abana b' u rwanda bashaka kurwubaka ,
they do n't think about doing things like what happened in the past . ||| batashaka kukora nk' ibyabaye .
the government is teaching the children how to live in peace with one another , how to work ... i do n't see genocide happening again . ||| mu kihae kizaza abana barimo bavuka barimo babaigisha kubaan n' abandi , bakabaigisha kukora , nrabona nta tsembatsemba rizagaruka .
you know very well that rwanda lost so many things and very many people . ||| nk' ubu ubwawe uzi u rwanda rutakaje abantu , rutakaza n' ibintu .
so in case you were released , what would be your contribution as far as unity and reconciliation or development in rwanda is concerned ? ||| nk' ubu uramutse ufunguwe , uruhare rwawe utanga , haba mu bumwe n' ubwiyunge , haba mu bikorwa by' amajyambere ni uruhe ?
i think i would go and try to live in peace with the people i tormented and since i 'm a farmer , i would try to work with them as we try to help one another . ||| uruhare ntanga ni uko nkuegera abo nhemukaiye , kuko ndi umuhinzi yenda tukaguzanya ; tukasangira nk' uko tusangiraaga ; nkabasaba imbabazi ; tugahingirana ; tukatuererana nk' uko biri bisanzwe .
when you consider what happened , do you feel like you are a rwandan ? ||| ukurikije se ibyabaye , ujya wiyumva ko uri umunyarwanda ? ... ntakubaza . ujya wiyumva ko uri umunyarwanda .
yes , i feel i 'm a rwandan . ||| nrabiumva .
thank you , would you please remind us your name ? ||| urakoze . harya ushobora kaongera kutuibutsa amazina yawe .
my name is ayirwanda gaspard . ||| nitwa ayirwanda gaspard .
how long have you been in prison ? ||| ubundi umaze igihe kingana iki ....
i have been in prison for five years and eight months ||| nfite imyaka itanu n' amezi umunani .
thank you . ||| urakoze
thank you too . ||| namwe murakoze .
ayirwanda ? ||| ayirwanda .
yes please ? ||| karamae .
listen , we all learnt ... all of us were taught about unity and reconciliation . ||| umva nkubwirae . tuesae turize tugiye tuigisha ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ,
we understood and even practiced it . ||| turanabiumva tunabishyira mu bikorwa ,
in fact this is what we are doing right now . ||| ni nacyo turimo kukora .
but as human beings we have hearts and brains . ||| ariko tugira umutima n' ubwenge .
therefore , i am not asking you about what you were taught . ||| ntinkubaza ibyo bakuigishije ,
i am asking you according to your conscience and beliefs . ||| ntakubaza amarangamutima yawe . ntakubaza uko ubiumva . wowe ubwawe ,
on your behalf , if one said that they are going to bring someone who killed your child , would you be that kind to him ? ||| umuntu akuiciye umwana , bamubwiye bati tuga ... tukarurae uriya muntu ukuiciye umwana ,
or would you say that you do n't even want to see him ? ||| wunva ushobora kumugirair izo nbabazi ? cyangwa uvuga uti @: "@ uyu muntu njyae ukwe simushaka @"@ .
such a person ... the majority forgives and others do n't . ||| uwo muntu abenshi bamwe barazitanga , abandi bakazimana .
i 'm asking you personally , i 'm not asking you about others . ||| wowe ubwawe , nkubajije wowe ubwawe , simvuga abandi . wowe ubwawe ari ibyakubayeho ,
if it was a true story that happened to you , let us say one time you went home and found your child 's body lying there dead . can you forgive that person who may have killed your child ? ||| utaha ukasanga umwana wawe bamwishe . uwamwishe umubabarira ?
personally there is a time i forgave someone who killed my wife . now he has been released . ||| njyewe ubwanjye , nigeze nokuzitanga hari umuntu unyiciye umugore , nramubabarira ubu ari hanze .
but it was n't during genocide , that person used poison and she died . ||| ariko si muri jenoside , ni uburozi yamuhaye , arapfa .
but later we reconciled and started sharing everything ; we would invite each other for events . ||| ariko ubu turasangiraaga tukaan ... tukasangira tukatumiraan .
therefore i would forgive him . ||| nnjyae nzimuha .
my heart would be at ease to forgive him . ||| bitewe n' umutima wanjye uba ugarutse , nzimuha .
well that is all i wanted you to tell me . ||| yee , ni icyo nagirango unbwirae .
now would you tell us in brief , your life experience ; you told us that you have been in prison for 5 years and 8 month , which means you were arrested in 1999 . ||| hanyuma , mu magambo make nragira ngo unbwirae imibereho yawe ... utubwiye ko hashize imyaka itanu n' amezi umunani ufunze , ni ukuvuga ko ufunzwe nko muri mirongo cyenda n' icyenda [ 1999 ] .
i was arrested on the 26th july 1998 . ||| nfunzwe icyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] , itariki 26 z' ukwa karindwi .
after the genocide stopped in 1994 , what kind of life did you go through ? please tell us in brief . ||| mbere y' aho kuva muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , aho ubwicanyi buhagarariye , utubwira ubuzima uciyemo mu magambo make ?
in 1994 after the war when all tutsi had died , people were wild . ||| muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] intambara imaze kuba abatutsi barapfuye , abantu turi tufite umutima nk' uw' bisimba .
everyone in gikongoro was bad except me . ||| turi tufite umutima ... kuko abantu bari muri gikongoro usibye njyewe , ntabwo bari bameze neza .
i want to know if you fled . ||| ntashaka kukubaza . wigeze uhunga ?
no i did n't flee . ||| ntinhunze .
what hurt me were the neighbours i had whom i would no longer see . ||| noneho nbabazaw n' abaturanyi turi tuturanye ,
that caused me a lot of pain in my heart . ||| bikatuma nnjyae binbabaza ntabwo nri meze neza mu mutaima wanjye .
did you continue to live your life in the village like any other villager ? ||| ukomeje kubaho ubuzima busanzwe bw' umuturage wo mu kituragae ?
yes i lived a normal life but i was n't happy at all because of the innocent people who had died . ||| yee . nkomeje kubaho ariko umutima wanjye ... nkaumva umutima urarya , nnjyae umutima wanjye ntiuri umeze neza , bitewe n' abantu bapfuye turi tuturanye .
in the place where you lived , how many ruined houses were there ? ||| nk' aho uri utuye ubonaaga nk' amatongo angahe ?
where i lived , there were about six houses in ruin . ||| aho nri ntuye nbonaaga nk' amatongo ageze kuri atandatu .
whenever you would see them , would n't they remind you of something ? ||| iyo uyabonaaga se , hari icyo bikuibutsaaga ?
yes they would remind me of something because whenever i would like to send my children to my neighbours for some water , i could not because they were no longer there and yet there used to be people whom we would talk . it would really hurt me . ||| byarakinyibutsaga , iyo nahataramiraga , iyo noherezaaga abana kujya kuharahura no kusaba amazi . nkabura aho njya kuyasaba , nkabura n' uwo tuganira , kandi twaranaguzanyaga no kuhinga , numvaaga muri njyewe umutima wanjye utameze neza . agahinda karanyicaaga , kubera kubura abo bavandimwe .
meanwhile , according to what you have said , it seems like it took long before you were arrested . but you are not telling us your life during all that period . ||| hagati aho utubwiye ko usa nk' uwafunzwe bitinze .
from 1994 to 1998 ... until you were arrested . ||| icyo kihae nabwo utubwirae kuva icyanda na kane [ 1994 ] kugera icyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] , ukuntu bije kugera aho urafungwa .
what happened is that , the lady whose child i killed was a hutu but she had married a tutsi . so she reported me to the authorities and then i ran away from my home . ||| ukuntu bigezeho ... ukuntu bigezeho , uwo niciye umwana yari umuhutukazi uri ushatse ku mututsi aza kunrega .
i let my home and i would sleep in bushes . ||| noneho nanga ... ntahunga nkazajya nrara mu bihuru ndaraguza . nta urugo rwanjye .
when did she report you ? ||| yakureze ryari ?
she reported me in 1998 but whenever they would come for me , i would run away . ||| yanreze icyo kihae muri mirongo cyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] . baza kunfata bakaambura .
were you hiding in the bush ? ||| ubaga mu gihuru ?
yes i was hiding in the bush . ||| nbaga mu gihuru
near your home ? ||| hafi y' iwawe ?
near my ... i would go to a place called rukondo and then i would come back at night while no one was seeing . ||| hafi y' i ... njyaaga za rukondo , nkatembera nkapagasa , nza nkaza ninjoro atareba .
i would stay in the house for the whole day , and then go back when no one was aware . ||| bukacya nkamara nko mu nzu nihishe , ubundi nkagenda ntawe ubizi .
were they arrested too ? ||| nabo baje kufataw se ?
they were not arrested . ||| ntibafashe bari hanze .
they are out there in their homes . ||| bagarutse iwabo ,
i am the only one who is in jail among all people we collaborated in the killings . ||| ni njyae bafashe njyenyine . tufatanyaije kuica .
how were you arrested ? ||| uje kufataw utae ?
how the arrested me ... they got me from home where i was digging . ||| uko nfashwae , nri nrimo mpinga imuhair ,
when they took me to the commune and imprisoned me . ||| baza kunfata ubwo bahita banjyana kuri komine . bahita banfunga ,
and when i reached there , i immediately i admitted that i committed the genocide . ||| mpageze mpita nemera ko nishe .
who arrested you ? ||| ni nde ukufashe ?
the counselor arrested me ; the one who brought us here in murambi . ||| nfashwae na konseye uwo nguwo , utuzanye hano i murambi ,
together with the local leaders they arrested me . and that tutsi survivor who married a hutu lady . ||| nfataw na banyumbakumi , nfataw n' uwo mututsi na none nici ... ucyuye ... ucitse ku icumu , ucyuye uwo mugorae wabo .
you have told us that you were arrested by the counselor , is it the one who brought you during the time of killing ? ||| utubwiye ngo @: konseye uwo nguwo ni umukonseye wigeze kubazana mu kihae cy' ubwicanyi ?
yes he is the one . ||| yee , niwe unfashe .
did you talk about it in the testimony you gave ? ||| wigeze mu buhamya bwawe ...
in my testimonies and in my documents he is there . even in the testimony i testified in cyanika i mentioned him . ||| mu buhamya bwanjye no kuri dossier yanjye hose ariho . no mu kianika nrabuvuze ku kibuga .
that was in kibuye . in my document all of them are mentioned . ||| kuri dossier yanjye , abo bose bariho .
what could be the reason why they are not arrested and you have told us that some are leaders ? ||| nonese nk' mpamvu ubona bo batafataw , unatubwiye ko harimo umuyobozi ni iyihe ?
i said it for a long time and they said that they will arrest them in gacaca but i do n't know why they do n't arrest them . ||| nrabivuze igihe kinini , baravuga ngo @: bazabafatair ... bazabafata muri gacaca niko numva bavuga . nrabivuze baanga kubafata simbizi .
you as a person who s in jail , when you hear about such ... a leader in your sector ... it means that he is the one who gives orders yet he is supposed to be the one revealing the wrong things . ||| hanyuma se nkawe , nk' umuntu uri muri gereza , iyo wunva hari ... umuyobozi uyoboye umurenge w' iwawe , ubwo ni ukuvuga ko ariwe utanga amabwiriza niwe ugombye kugaragariza ibibi .
you are very sure that you all participated in the genocide . ||| uzi neza ko mwakoranye ikibi .
what do you thing about your sector ? ||| ubwo ni iki uba utekereza kuri uwo murengae wawe ?
if i were given the opportunity to go back to my area , i would go pointing out the people we were with and even though that leader is among , i would name him too . ||| ntekereza kuri uwo murengae wanjye , ni uko nzahagera nkahagarara mu ruhamae rw' abantu , njyenda mpagurutsa umuntu tugiye tuica ... tufatanyaije ubwicanyi . n' iyo na konseye yaba ayoboye iyo nama , nawe namu ... nmuvuga ... nmuvugaho .
i just wanted to know how you feel about the leadership in your sector in this time of your absence . ||| nyine nshatse kukubaza ubu , ku miyoborere y' umurenge wawe , ubungubu utahari .
well , a place like my home sector , which is lead by a genocidaire , i suggest that person should be arrested . ||| nk' umurenge wanjye uyoboraw n' umuntu uba yaraishe , nbibonamo yuko uwo muntu bamufata .
i am just asking you what you think about it . ||| ndi kukubaza uko ubitekereza ?
what i think about someone who is leading my home sector yet he killed , i guess he is doing nothing . ||| icyo ntekereza nk' umuntu uyobora yaraishe . akayobora , ku bwanjye numva nta kintu ari kukora .
i think he should first go to solidarity camps and try to forget what he did because he did many things . ||| keretse uwamucisha mu ngando , akikuramo ibibi yakoze . kuko yakoze byinshi .
so you think if he went to solidarity camps he may change ? or maybe he went there but you are not informed ? ||| kuri wowe uraumva agiye mu ngando uri kaumva agiye mu ngando hari icyo yahindura ? cyangwa yanagiyemo ntabwo ubizi .
he has not yet gone there . ||| nta ngando arajyamo kuko ... yajya mu ngando se atae ,
how can he go there yet he was not arrested ? ||| kandi atafunze , ari hanze ?
but there are camps purposely for leaders . ||| hari ingando zijya zibaho z' abayobozi .
he ignored and never admitted what he did , unless the truth is revealed and then his crimes will get him to jail . ||| ibyo yakoze arabiirengagiza ntiyabiemera , keretse ukuri kugiye ahagaragara ibyaha bikamufata .
of all what you have just said what would you suggest ? ||| kubyo umaze kuvuga se ubungubu ni ikihae cyifuzo cyawe utanga ?
based on all i have said , my wish is to let people know that all the bad deeds i did were of the past government . ||| kubyo maze kuvuga , ikifuzo ntanga ; ni uko ibyo nkoze biri bibi muri leta ya mbere .
and , now in this government of unity and reconciliation , i would like to testify what happened . ||| none kuri leta y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ikaba ... na ... nshaka kugaragaza ukuri kw' ibyabaye .
and the truth i would like to show is how my heart was renewed and now i am human and i can live with other people . ||| nkaba ukuri ngaragaza ni uko nkarura umutima ... umutima wanjye ubaye muzima , ku buryo nbana n' abantu .
together we can build our motherland rwanda . ||| tukabana tukaubaka u rwanda rutubyaye ,
we should reveal the truth about what happened and live with those whose beloved ones we killed . ||| tukagaragaza ukuri ku bibaye tukabana n' abo tuiciye .
who is kabombeki ... ? ||| kabomboki ni nde ?
he is the zambian ... anyway i do n't remember well which country he is the president of ... ||| ni perezida yari yahaje perezida wo muri zambiya , ntinzi ... hari haje umuperezida ntinzi uwo ariwe .
is it thabo mbeki ? ||| ni thabo mbeki ?
yes , the president came while i was there . ||| yee ,
by then bizimungu pasteur was the president of rwanda . i remember all of us came here and by then i was not yet imprisoned . and when we came here , i remembered all the bad deeds that i did here . ||| ariko aha haje umuperezida nri mpari . icyo kihae perezida uri uhari yari bizimungu pasteur . turahaje turi abaturage nri ntarafungwa . nibuka ibibi nhakoreye ,
they had come to see the remains of people and several other things . but my heart was haunting me . deep down in my heart something was telling me , "@ you too came to attack here ! @" ||| ariko baje kureba amagufwa , n' ibiki byose ... ariko umutima wanjye unkomanga , nti nnjyae nrahaje .
and i knew that once they get me i would say the truth . ||| nti banfata nzirega ,
and indeed i admitted everything willingly . ||| nhise nbiirega ntawe ubinbwiye .
of course if i had denied no one would have known what happened . ||| iyo ntabivuga nta uri kubimenya ,
therefore , i admitted everything personally so that even those people whom we ... ||| ni njyae ubiivugaiye ku giti cyanjye , kugira ngo na bariya bantu twa ...
had you ever confessed before they came to arrest you ? ||| baza kukufata se uri urabivuze ?
no i had n't , but i confessed immediately after i had reached the commune . ||| baza kunfata ngeze kuri komini mpita nbivuga .
but if you had not been arrested , would you have confessed ? ||| ariko iyo batakufata ntabwo uri kuzabivuga ?
i they had n't arrested me , reporting and admitting my deeds ... if they had n't got me ... if someone convicted me saying , "@ you were with us during those acts of killings . @" i would immediately have accepted it . ||| iyo batanfata , kuirega no kuemera icyaha ... iyo batanfata iyo hagira ubinshi ... uza kuvuga ati @: "@ nawe turi kumwe nri kuhita nbiemera . @"
what if she had n't known ? ||| iyo ataza kubimenya se ?
did you want to report yourself ? ||| uri ufite umutima wo kuzirega wowe ubwawe ?
if she did n't know , there is a place i went to ... at the local leader 's ... there at the counselor 's place . he was my relative because i was born there in gikongoro . ||| iyo ataza kubimenya , kubera ko nri nzi hari ahantu nri ngiye kwa responsable , kwa konseye hariya ... mwene wacu hariya kuko nvukaiye hano ku gikongoro .
therefore , he advised me to go and report myself that they would reduce my punishment in case i did so . he told me that i should say all the roles i played in the genocide and stop living in the bushes . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ uzajyae kuirega bazakugabanyiriza . ati @: "@ uzavugae ibyo ukoze byose ,
i had started developing scale like those of a frog . ||| ati @: uvae mu gihuru dore umaze kuzana amaga nk' ayo igikeri ati @:
therefore i assured myself that if i report myself , my punishment would be reduced . ||| ujyae kuirega bazakugabanyiriza . @"
so in my plans i knew i would report myself because i had noticed that things had become worse in my life . ||| nri nfite imigambi yo kuirega , kuko nri maze kubona merewe nabi .
have you ever seen people 's corpses that are lying here ? ||| imirambo y' abantu bari aha urayibonye ?
i saw them ; they were very many . ||| yari myinshi cyane , nrayibonye .
when did you see them ? ||| uyibonye ryari ?
i saw them in the morning when they had just died . ||| nyibonye ... nyibonye mu gitondo bamaze kupfa . babarashe .
that time when the presidents came here , did you also go to see the corpses ? ||| igihe ba perezida baza ahangaha ugiye kureba nawe imirambo ?
when the presidents came , no citizen was allowed to go there . ||| igihe ba perezida baza ahangaha ntibatumye abaturage bajya yo .
it was only the presidents . ||| nibo bagiye kureba .
but there is a rumor around that , after they had killed those people , did they rush to bury them ? ||| hari inkuru zivuga yuko bamaze kuica abantu bahise bajya ku bahamba .
yes they buried them immediately . ||| bahise bajya ku bahamba .
what were they using ? ||| bakoresha n' ibyuma ntinzi ...
tractors . ||| yee , bya torotoro .
did you play any role there ? did n't you come to help others ? ||| ntacyo ugizemo uruhare muri ibyongibyo ntabwo wigeze ufasha abandi kuhamba ?
no . ||| oya .
but you got that information ? ||| ariko ayo makuru urayazi .
yes , i got that news . ||| yee ayo makuru nrayazi .
i only know that information of how they were exhuming them from that place where they had buried them . ||| ayo makuru babataburura niyo nzi . aho bari barabahambye hariya .
the citizens had refused to ... exhume and rebury the remains . therefore , the current government ; this government of unity and reconciliation had to pay them to do so . ||| abaturage bari banzae kaubaha ... kuza kubataburura babahemba amafaranga leta ... iyi leta y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge .
okay , thanks . ||| ok , urakoze
how they came ... they came on friday , that is how they came and then we saw a flame of fire we were at the market , they said that they were burning tutsi belongings then we moved a bit because the other side was burning , when we came that night we found houses had been burned and the neighboring houses were also burning and then i sat down , i had people to but people were no longer alive , ||| uko baje , baje ku itariki ari kuwagatu ku ijuma , niko baje noneho tubona inkongi y' umuriro turi ku isoko inkongi y' umuriro iravuze baravuze bati batwikiye abatutsi , noneho ii noneho tuigira haruguru , hakurya hariya haba harashya , hakurya hakurya hariya haba harashya , noneho rero tuje nijoro , tusanga ingo zahiye , runo rugo rwo hirya rwa rurimo gushya , noneho rwa rugo rwo hirya rurimo gushya n' abandi , noneho nraicara , mpicaye nkaba nri nfite abantu banri , ariko bataribo ,
they were not tutsis ? ||| batari abatutsi ?
yes , i asked them what is going on . ||| yeee , nrababwira nti ibi bibaye n' ibiki ?
they said that tutsis have been attacked , how have they been attacked ? ||| bati abatutsi batewe ,

so i said @: ‘ that is how it is . ’ and then i told the others , ‘ listen to me kids . ||| nti nuko ereo nubwo ,
the war has begun and you all should go home . i do n't want to die with you ’ then i sent some of the kids at home . ||| noneho babanri nrababwira nti umva rero bana iyi ntiambara ibaye muesae mujyae iwanyu ntago nshaka kuzapfaan namwe , abana bamwe , nrabaohereza barataha ,
that night passed and on the following day , i saw them taking a young boy ... they came to me and said @: ‘ there is where ... they sent student 's books ... when he came home from school with many books brought by a boy of about his same age . ||| noneho njyewe nguma hano , ngiye kubona nijoro ntasiba kuwunri munsi nbona bamanukaanye umwana w' umuhungu araza aranbwira ati jyae nti ati hariho aho bairukanye ibitabo by' umunyeshuri , avuye kuiga ibitabo byinshi noneho bizana umuhungu umwe ungana nuwo na uwunri .
i kept the books and after keeping them i saw someone called wellars coming . ||| noneho ibitabo nrabibika ariko nbibika hariya , aba ariho nbishyira , muri iyo nzu hirya , noneho maze kubihashyira ngiye kubona nbona uwitwa wellarisi araje ,
i took him in the house and asked him where he had been then he said that he was from kigali . i asked him @: ‘ when did you arrive ? ||| mushyira munzu nti uvuye he ? ati nvuye ikigali ,
habyarimana died yesterday but one ... when did you come ? ||| uje ryari se ? ko habyarimana yapfuye ejo bunri uje ryari ?
’ he said , ‘ i came yesterday ’ . i put him into the house and locked the door . ||| ati nje ejo , mushyira mu nzu ntakinga ,
many more people came in the house and among them were girls . ||| noneho hazamo undi , hazamo undi , hazamo undi , hazamo undi nbona abakobwa ,
i said to myself @: ‘ if i put these girls and the men together and that they get discovered , they will tell everything they know . ||| nti aba bakobwa nimbateranya n' abagabo bakazaza bakabasanga aha bazahita babivuga !
girls are not good at talking . ||| nti abakobwa ntibagira ururimi rwiza , nti bahora baba bafite ururimi rubi , noneho wa mukobwa nramubwira nti umva rero reka nzae ,
’ then i made some traditional medicine and gave to one of them and told her to drink and smeared the other with it . ||| nsekuye imiti umuti nramuha nti wumywe , maze kuwumuha kuwunywa , undi nrawumusiga ,
stayed with one of them and i told the rest to go home . ||| noneho nrabwira bose nti nmutahae , ntasigaraan nuyu ! nibwo nsi
who were those you told to go home ? ||| abo ubwiye kutaha ni bande ?
were they tutsis ? ||| abatari abatutsi ?

i remained with the other one tied her to my clothes like this , we walked around together when i went out of the house there she was with me and thought to myself there is nowhere i am going to reach with these children with this young girl , and they said that we will get her from you when i went to fetch water they would say that we will get her from you and i said that you will n't get her ! ||| tujya mu nzu tukajyana tujya hanze tukajyana , nravuga nti ntaho nzajya n' aba bana nuyu mukobwa , bati tuzamukuambura , njya kuvoma bati turamukuambura nti nti mumunyambura !
why get her from me she is a hutu do you think she is a tutsi ? ||| mu munyambura se k ari umuhutukazi n' umututsikazi ?
when i went to fetch water i found corpse all round , i said this is a tragedy in my home so they came closer and closer and i asked them what is this that you are doing ? ||| nragenda njya kuvoma nsanga uko babigenje nbona imirambo hepfo , nbona iyinri hepfo , njya kuvoma nti iri n' ishyano nti ngibyi by' iwanjye , noneho baraza ,
they said that if i say what i had seen they would kill me on my way to the market . ||| baraza , baraza , baraza , noneho bamaze kuza ,
on my way to the market they surrounded me but i had drunk my medicine and i had some in my hands . ||| nrababwira , nbwira umuntu umwe nti biriya mukora n' ibiki ? bati ukavuga ngo biriya bakora ngo tuzakuica ugiye ku isoko , nibwo ngiye ku isoko uwunri nibwo ntanze antanze asanga nanyweye wa muti wanjye ,

presidential guards who had come from kigali came i got some fuel from them and i said that if anyone ever came to get anyone in my house i will burn them . ||| noneho haza bajepe baturutse ikigali , umujepe umwe mwaka lisansi , maze kumwaka lisansi , nti nibangira mu nzu bakurikiyemo abantu nzabatwika nkuko nabo baje kuntwika ,

................ ||| ................

i took them there , and then when i got back i would skip a day . the next day something would itch and i would go back and say is it over crowded . ||| nkabajyanayo , noneho na na gera aha , nva kwa sezikeye ngera aha nsiba rimwe ubaw kabiri akantu ka kanrya nkaongera nkasubirayo ,

i want to ask you , the time the presidential guards came with the interahamwe , how did you do it for them not enter into the house ? ||| nagirango nkubaze mu kihae abajepe bazaaga n' interahamwe , ubigenzaaga utae kugirango bainjiraemo be kuinjira mu nzu ?
i said that nyabingi would eat them ! ||| nvugaaga ngo nyabingi irabarya !
i could try and called these things and shake other things to . ||| narajegezaga ibintu nkabihamagara nkajegeza ,
i would say nyabingi will eat you ! ||| nti nyabingi ibaraye !

i got up and started knocking like this ! ||| nkahaguruka nkakomanga ntya !
and things would shake with these bracelets and they would run . they ran and they called the interahamwe and presidential guards . ||| bikajegera n' imiringa ibingibi , bakiruka , bamara kuiruka bakagenda nibwo baongeye bahamagaye interaha nibwo bahamagaye abandi bajepe ,
one presidential guard came in saying that they wanted medicine ; i asked them what kind of medicine do you want ? ||| umujepe araza bo baza bavuga bati turasha umuuti ? nti umuti ki ?
they told me the medicine they wanted , i went and got it for them . ||| bati turashaka ibitungurusumu nti reka nzae njyae kubizana ,
i had prepared porridge i gave them and we drank and then i told them , what if i opened the door will you look inside ? ||| noneho nkaba nashigishe ikikoma , nrabaha , turanyaw , nrababwira nti niko ye ?
they said yes , i opened the door and i asked them do you see any person in here ? ||| bati , nkingura urugi , nti murarora ? bati iii ubu se mureba hari abantu barimo ?
they said no , then why do go telling people that i have people in here , as an old woman you think i can hide someone ? ||| bati oya , kuki se munteza abantu bavuga ngo nfite abantu ? ubu ndi umukecuru nhisha umuntu ?
can i know how to hide a child or a woman ? ||| nmenya kuhisha umuntu w' umwana cg umugore ?
i thought that if i said a man they would suspect it so i did n't say it instead i said children and women . ||| nravugaaga ngo nimvuga ngo n' umugabo , barabikeka nabo , noneho nkanga kuvuga abagabo , nkavuga abana ,
so i said i will send you an animal and beasts to eat you . ||| abana nti mubareba bati iii , nti nuko rero nzabateza igisimba , ibisimba bibaraye .
that 's when they got up and went just before they got out of sight they brought back those logs doing this , they made roadblocks and at night i went and got it and used it as firewood and those in the house were scared . ||| nibwo bahagurutse , noneho baragenda bageze hirya baraongera bazana biriya bitiii bagira batya , bariyeri nijoro nragenda nrayizana nrayicana , abari munzu barampamagara bati jyae ?
they told me not burn a roadblock ? ||| kucana bariyeri ya banri ?
and i said to them , then why do they burn you ? ||| nti wese ko bakucana ?
i said it 's not possible ! ||| nti ntibishoboka !
wellars is the one who called and i told him not talk about me again . ||| wellarisi niwe wampamagaye . nramubwira nti ntiuzaongerae kunvuga ,
i went where the cups were i brought them i took them . ||| nza aho ibikombe biri nkazaan nkajyana , nkabashyira ,
i said you should n't come out ! ||| ntimukasohokae !
you should urinate and defecate here ! ||| mujyae munnya aha ! munyara aha !
i took the wastes and they said we are killing you , i said is there worse death than this ? ||| nkabijyana bati ko tukuishe se ? nti hari ukupfa kurenze uku ? akaba ariko nbikoresha , ubwo rero nrabitunganya ,
that 's how i did it after doing that , other came presidential guards came they gave me a girl that came from mugina . ||| maze kubitunganya , noneho haza abandi bajepe bampa umukobwa uturutse ku mugina .
they said that , take this girl we are giving her to you because you were good to us . ||| bati uyu mukobwa rero bati mujyanae , turamukuhaye , nawe utugiraiye neza ,
after the war we will come ask for her if it does n't end and you die together fine ! ||| intambara nishira tuzaza tumukubaze , nidashira mukapfaan basi ! nuko rero haza ibintu by' ibimamara biigize ashwi ,
then there came some stupid guys , they told me to give them the girl and i said it 's impossible , i can n't give you this girl , is she yours ? ||| nibwo banbwiye bati tuhae uyu mukobwa nti ntibishoboka uyu mukobwa simubaha , nti n' uwanyu ? bati uramutuha ? nti ntibishoboka !
they said that you will give her to us ! ||| umukobwa ati umva ! aho kugirango bakuicae , reka banjyanae ! nti ntibishoboka ,
and the girl said to me , instead of them killing you let them take me ! ||| nti reka nbanzae nsengae , nzana umusali nshyira hano , ntasenga , nravuga nti mana nbera hafi ,
i it 's said impossible , i said let me first pray and i brought my mat and prayed and said god be near me and rescue me , the girl got out of the house and she went with them , while they were undressing her the inkotanyi ( rpf ) there like pa pa ! ||| ntabara , nibwo umukobwa asohotse bajyanye , umukobwa igihe bakimwambura imyambaro , inkotanyi ngo pa pa pa pa !
there they were , and the others were like wait the girl escaped . ||| nibwo zivuze , nibwo inkotanyi zije , noneho babanri ati buretse , nibwo bagiye umukobwa abacitse .
after she escaped they came and shot me , when the interahamwe came from up there with guns and some grenades . ||| amaze kubacika nibwo baje nibwo banrashe ,
they pointed them at me ; i was sited somewhere here i said all that is nothing ! ||| nibwo interahamwe zimanutse zituruka hariya haruguru n' imbunda na twa masotera baratera baratunga nrareba nicaye bene hano nti na ‘ ayubusa ! nga apu nuko bagenda batyo ,
they left their guns here and there and the others came , i went up there with a girl called bebe we went to fetch water and the inkotanyi came and said @: ‘ hey ? ||| imbunda bagenda bazaita aha , izindi bazaita hariya , babanri baraje , nzamukaan na wa mukobwa witwa bebe tu tujya kuvoma inkotanyi ziraza ngo niko ?
’ i said ‘ yes ’ ‘ why are you fleeing ? ||| nti iii ! ngo kuki utahunze ?

i always saw this when i was a child my parents used to hide tutsis , the war has not only been now ! ||| nbibonaaga ndi umwana nbona iwacu , bahisha abatutsi , intambara ntago ibaye ubu !
it was always there even before you were born ! ||| yarahoze mutaranavuka ! mu bufundu ,

mama came home from grinding sorghum and they hide two me in the fermentation pit and covered them with sorghum flour , do n't you think i was seeing , a child comes from their mom . ||| mama , mama bavuye kugesa uburo aba abo wa wunri bamushyira mu rwina bashyiramo abagabo babiri mu rwina barenzaho uburo , ubwo se sinaroraga ? umwana umwana ava mwa nyina .
how old are you ? ||| harya ubundi ufite imyaka ingahe ?
i was born in 1912 ||| nfite imyaka miro , nvutse muri cumi na kabiri .
that means in ........... ||| ubwo nukuvuga ni muri .....
i am 90 something ... ||| nfite mirongoo icyenda n' ingahe
two ? ||| n' ibiri
two . ||| n' ibiri
bikerinka was also killed ? ||| bikerinka nawe baramwishe
you see now your old and children have been seeing this . ||| hanyuma nkawe , ngiye kukubaza , urareba utubwiye ko ukuze , hari abana bagenda bareba ,
have you ever visited any place that went through the tragedy ? ||| hari ahantu wigeze usura habereye amahano ? ngo ......
the tragedy took place , i came from murambi ||| ahabereye amahano mvuyeeee imura imurambi intuza
murambi ||| imurambi
murambi ||| imurambi
in gikongoro ||| ya gikongoro
in gikongoro ||| uuuuh , . ya gikongoro
you looked and soon the tragedy that elapsed ? ||| urarebye witegereza ishyano riguye ?
up to now i am afraid , did n't i count ? ||| uuh , nubu ntinkikoma , ntinbaze , se ?
were n't you there with me ? ||| ntituri kumwe ?
but you did n't reach ? ||| ariko wowe ntiuhageze ?
i counted thousands , i counted forty thousand and they told me to stop , because i look a muslim among . ||| nri kumwe nbaze ibihumbi , nbaze ibihumbi mirongo ine baranbwira bati rekeraho , kuko nbonyemo n' umusilamu ,
that 's it we are asking about the white according to what happened to rwanda do you think they played any role in that ? ||| nyine turakubaza icyo ubwira abazungu n' iki kubierekeye uru rwanda ubona hari uruhare bagiye babigiramo ?
no , i did n't see any white man killing . ||| oya , nta abazungu nbonye baishe , uuuh
but in history as time goes on they could have done something to stop it . ||| ariko nyine iyo amateka agenda igihe yagiye aba wenda hari icyo bari kukora kugira ibyo babikingirire ?
yeah , it 's history i also could have done like they can do , just like they saved us that 's what i can thank them , they saved us let them keep on saving us , save the leaders , save those that they are above , save like this , like they took my picture , they say that this old woman is insured ||| iii samateka nri kukora nkuko nabo bayakora , nuko batutabaye , n' icyo nbashimaiye , baratutabaye , n' ubu bakomezae batutabarae , batabarae abategetsi , batabarae abo basumba , batabarae nkuku , nkuku banfashe amafoto , bavugae bati uyu mukecuru arashingaanye ! banshingaane ,
so i ask you another , what is your message for this not to ever happen again , what can you tell the people ? ||| hanyuma ntakubaza inama muri rusangae yo kugirango nk' ibi ibyabaye bitazaongera kubaho n' iyihe nama uha abantu
just to pray to god ||| ni ukusenga imaan .
nothing else in the standard of living ........ ||| nta kinri ubona mu mibanire ...
it 's just to pray but for me i will n't live with them because they killed my child and later my husband . ||| n' ukusenga imaan ntaho njyewe ntinzabana nabo kuko banyiciye umwana ejobundi umuhungu , banyicira n' umugabo .
so do n't you think reconciliation is required ? ||| ntabwo se wunva ubwiyunge bwo ko bukenewe ?
let them reconcile , let them bring them out and after bringing them out , those who steal they catch him and shot him on spot . ||| nibiyunge , nibasohoke babashyirae hanze , nibamara kubasohora , bose babashyirae hanze , uwibye bakamufata bamurasaire aho .
you think someone who does something again like that should be killed ? ||| wowe wunva ko uwakongera kukora ikintu nk' iki ngiki ari ukuicwa ?
his to be killed because he says that i will kill and i will later be freed from prison , what will happen to me ? ||| n' ukuicwa ! kuko aravuga ati ko nzaica , nkafungurwa , nzaba iki ?
if you do something and your caught let them kill you . ||| ni niba ukoze ikintu bakaba bakufashe , nibakwice ,
that 's what you think ; you think there should be tough punishments ? ||| nibyo ubona mbese ubona ko hakwaiye kubaho ibihano bikomeye ?
very tough punishments , some aside then says that somebody was killed , what he did we should n't do the same . ||| n' ibihano bikomeye bikazae , uwo hakurya avugae ati kanaka yishe none ibyo bakoze , nitubikora bakatufata ntawe baratuica !
so someone like of long ago did you ever hear the racism things when they started ? ||| hanyuma se nkawe wa kera wigeze wunva ibi bintu bya amoko igihe yagiraiyeho ,
me ? ||| jyewe ?
how did it happen when they were starting racism ? ||| bigenze kutae bayashyiraho ?
someone who was greater than the other they would , they would talk about him and say that , that tutsi should n't live . ||| uwarutaga undi bara , uwarutaga undi baramu baramuryaniranaga bakavuga bati uriya mututsi ntakwaiye kubaho
so those who were rich were called tutsis ? ||| mbese uwo babonaaga yifite bamwitaga umututsi ?
yeah , he would be wealthy . ||| yiiiii , ubonaaga yifite ? babona uri umuhinzi ukora babona uri umuhinzi ukora ? bati uriya n' umututsi ,
when they could see you as a cultivator doing that kind of work ... then that one is a tutsi with cows , kill him and we still his belongings , then take over his . ||| atunze inka , bati nimumwice , tumwibe , tugirae tutae tujyae mu bye
so you can tell that this thing of racisms went according to how rich one was ? ||| mbese ubundi uraumva ko ibintu by' amoko bigiye bijyaho bikurikije nu nuko umuntu yari akize ?
it was according to what you had , in other words they were all like brothers and sisters and you had your sister and when you saw them being greater than you and doing something for that person and they gave them a cow and you like that tutsi is being granted that you should kill them . ||| uko yari afite , uko yari ameze ubundi bose bavaaga indi imwe , ukagira mwene nyoko ukavuka wamukibita amaso . ubona akuruta agiye kwa she agiye hariya yakorera uriya akamuhereza inka ati shyuuu ati wa mututsi baramuhaye ati umwice , nta kunri
then that can make you tell us how people killed each other because of property . ||| bituma noneho ushaka kutubwira uko cyane abantu bagendaaga bapfa ibintu ?
according to the property ... how they were ... you would set your eyes on your brother . ||| bapfaaga ibintu , uuu bapfaaga ibintu ,
when he become bigger than you and he worked for a someone that rewarded him with a cow , you say the tutsi has been rewarded . kill him . no other alternative ||| umuntu nkuwo mwana muri kumwe babona uko asa , babyara undi mwana ba batasa , bati uriya bamubyaraanye n' umututsi kandi ise wabo ari umwe ,
so to you see things that happened in rwanda ||| mbese ubwo n' ukuvuga wowe ibintu ubona bibaye mu rwanda
what happened in rwanda is from long ago ||| ibyabaye mu rwanda ni bya kera
it 's beyond your imagination . ||| birakurenze ?
it 's beyond my imagination . ||| biranrenze , uuuh
but still rwanda needs to live . ||| ariko se na none uru rwanda ko rukeneye kubaho
we need to live , who likes you ? ||| tukeneye kubaho , ua uzakukunda ? ubu ngubu bira biraruhije , nibabafungure kusa ,
now it 's difficulty , let them free them from prison , let them come home and build for those that they destroyed for and after that they live and anyone who put his head up they put him back to jail and never let him out . ||| baze bagae iwabo bakorae uwo basenyeye bamwubakire , uwo basenyeye bamwubakire , nibamara kumwubakira nibyo babanae , uwa uwiteye hejuru bamufatae bamusubizaemo ntazavamo azavamo ntabwo azavamo .
so what about the gacaca courts you know it since long ago ? how do you think it should work now days ? ||| naho nko se kubierekeye gacaca unayizi yakera , iyubu ubona yakorwa itae ?
the one of today , listen many of those who killed are already dead ! ||| iyubu , iyubu , umva , gacaca y' ubu abenshi baishe barapfuye !
some of them committed suicide even mine just near here on that street they buried them here on the yard they saw that they were left and said that his old woman is going to report us and they committed suicide ||| bagiye baiahura , yewe n' abanjye banteraaga no hirya aha kuru uyu muhanda bahambyemo abantu hano ku muharuro , ku muharuro wanjye hano babonye ko bapfuye baravuga bati uriya mukecuru ubwo asigaye aratuvuga bahita baiahura .
but what can you really tell us so that our gacaca can go accordingly and people live together ? ||| ariko se nk' impanuro utuha kugirango gacaca igendae neza abanyarwanda baongerae babae abanyarwanda ni mpanuro ki ?
mostly we want o know about he truth ||| cyane tushaka kumenya nko kubierekeye ukuri
truth , the truth is for them to bring the other machine ||| ukuri , ukuri n' ukugirango bazanae cya kiuma
how is it like ? ||| kimeze kutae ?
it 's there do n't hide it from me , you do n't know that i am telling those who are in that camp bring them , free them and the put the machine on both sides and those who participated will be seen , and they should call me also . ||| kirahari , kirahari mwimpisha , we ntubizi jyae nrabwira abarimo hariya muri kiriya kigo babazaane babafungurae bazanae icyuma babashyirae icyuma hirya no hino uwakoze icyaha wese azazamo , nnjyae bazampamagare , nnjyae bazampamagare
really or you want to tell us in reconciling there those who were watching ? ||| ubwo cg urashaka kutubwira ko ibintu byo kaunga harimo harimo ababibonaaga ,
there are those who were watching , ||| eee , harimwo aba n' ababibonaaga ,
or you want to tell us that the things of reconciliation there those who were observing it ||| n' ukuvuga ngo abo babibonaaga bashobora kugira umuganda batanga bakasobanura uko ibintu bigenze ?
there those who saw it . ||| eee bakabivuga , uuuh
on your behalf what do you think was the cause of the genocide to the people ... ? ||| hanyuma se nka wowe ubona cyane icyatumye iyi genocide iba abantu baaka .........
selfishness , selfishness and wanting to have other people 's belongings , they could say , we do n't want this one , he is educated , he 's been to europe , my brother mussa twagirimana is stuck in europe . ||| n' inda nini , n' inda nini no kujya kuzaungura , bakavuga bati uyu ntitumushaka , uriya yarize ,
where he went long ago when they wanted to kill him and now he is still there . ||| agira amashuri agira kujya iburayi agira ku hari na da na musaza wanjye uheze iburayi , witwa mussa twagirimana yaheze iyo yagiye ku bwa kera bashaka kumwica ubu niyo ari .
so you think most of it is based on greediness ? ||| urabona ibyinshi bishingaiye noneho ku mururumba inda nini
it 's greediness ||| n' umururumba !
so for that not to happen again what can be done ? ||| hanyuma se kugirango ibyo bitazaongera ingamba zafataw n' inki izihe ?
let them come and cultivate , let them come and work those who do bad things ... have accidents , he who says that i want this or i hate this is should be taken ||| nibaze bahingae , baze bakorae , ugize nabi ugize impanuka imutwarae , ugira kuvuga ati ntashaka ibi n' ibi no kuanga undi agendae bamujyanae .
what advice can you give us ? ||| hanyuma se nkawe nk' inama ubwo utuha ya nyuma
the last one , free those who say that they did n't kill , since we did n't kill let us free . ||| iya nyuma nimufungurae ba bariya ba ba banzae kuvuga bati ntago tuise , none ubwo tutaishe wenda muturekerae ibyo kandi koko harimo aba abataishe bavuga bati ntituishe , harimo uwarebaga ,
there some people who say that they did n't kill , and indeed they did n't kill , some were watching there is also my son who is in ririma son of bekerinka , also called kabanyura , he had hidden a person and later he was killed , so he was asked , people came to your home came and killed him where were you ? ||| harimo n' umuhungu wanjye uriya uri ahantu iririma mwene bekerinka , witwa nta kabanyura , we yazize ngo yuko uwo yari yarahishe mbere nyuma asubiyeyo baongeye bagarutse bica uwunri baramubaza bati ngaho , tubwirae abaje iwawe bari baje kuica wa muntu arihae ?
he said , i do n't know it 's them who killed him , tell us who were they ? that is what has gotten him stuck in there . ||| umuhungu ati ntabwo nbizi ko aribo bamwishe , ati tubwirae abo aribo ? nicyo kimuhejejemo .
and many others but those who say we did kill when they did . ||| n' abandi n' abandi n' abandi , naho abaishe koko bavuga bati twaraishe baraishe ,
but the simple like him in prison . ||| ariko akantu ka gaci kaciye bugufi ka kantu ka ka nyamuherairw , kakaba kafunze ,
the great say we killed but he did n't let him stay in prison . ||| bariya bakomeye bavuga bati twaraishe kariya nigaheremo , ntabwo kaishe .
you told us that you managed to hide many people , how did they survive ? where did you get what to feed them ? ||| ubundi ahangaha , utubwiye ko uhishe abantu benshi babagaho kutae ? ubonaaga ibyo kubagaburira kutae ?
it 's you who did n't want me to feed you and you also see what they were eating , beans , they were eating sweet potatoes . ||| si wowe unzae ko nkugaburira , ngo nawe urebae ibyo baryaaga ? baryaaga ibishyimbo , baryaaga ibijumba , uuuh
where did you get them ? ||| ushoboraaga kubikura he se ?
just nearby ! ||| aha munsi y' urugo rwanjye , uuuh
your neighbors were n't helping you to ....... ||| nta baturanyi bakufashaaga ku .....
gosh ! those who killed , if you said anything they would report you and thus you would have given up some one . ||| aho re ! n' uwicaga undi yarazaaga nkuku wa umubwira nkuko unbwiye ukagira uti iii ubwo akaba aramutanze , ntacyo nkomaaga ,
i could n't say a thing . ||| ntacyo nvugaaga .
so you never asked for help from you neighbors ? ||| mbese ntabwo wigeze wiyambaza abaturanyi ?
no , only one to whom i took people to . ||| reka da ! uwo niambaje nuwo umwe njyanaagayo umuntu
what did you fear ? ||| ubwo utinyaaga iki ?
i feared that they would report me . ||| ntinyaaga ngo batanvuga , uuh
how did you manage to feed these people for a month ? or they had little to eat . ||| ako se nko muri icyo kihae nyine ibiryo uko kwezi kose ushoboye kubibona kurinda kurangira cg baryaaga dukeya ?
but was it a month ? ||| ariko kuri uko ukwezi ko ari amezi abiri ?
it was two months the last two months . ||| intambara yamaze amezi abiri .
i had beans , i had sweet potatoes . i cultivated , i was still young . ||| nri nfite ibijumba nri nfite ibishyimbo nrahingaaga nri nkiri muto
but there is also like those who used to get out and go ? ||| ariko harimo wenda nbasohokaaga bakagenda ?
no , except the one that escaped , up to now he is in jail in gitarama because they rooted his belongings . ||| aka uuuuu , kieretse ucancitse ,
he was a tutsi they burnt his belongings . ||| uwancitse umwe n' ubu arafungaiye igitarama kuko baramusahuye n' umututsi bari banamutwikiye muri icyo kihae nvuga ageze hano hakurya yigura ikimasa ,
at that time when he left they caught him and he gave them a bull for them to let him go so he was told to bet up a corpse . ||| baravuga bati ngaho rero kubita umurambo ,
he ran off but now his in jail yet never killed . ||| ngo akubita umurambo nicyo bamufungaiye , ntawe yishe , ariko akaba afunze .
so his in prison only for what he accepted to do ? ||| ubwo afungaiye nyine ibyo ngibyo yemeye kukora .
yeah , that is it , after we came home from exile . it 's me who went to the government told them to come and get the corpse from my front yard . ||| iii , nibyo kikora dufu tuje tuhungutse nijyae ugiye muri leta nti njya guhuruza nti nimuzae munkuraire imirambo inberae yanjye
thank you ||| urakoze

what happened here ? the important events to start with . the first trench . ||| ibyabereye aha nkaha ariko ibyagomba kubanza nibiriya irya niyo tranche ya mbere ,
the first trench is over there . ||| tranche ya mbere hirya hariya nyitangirae ?
start with how everyone came . ||| mbese tangira uko abantu baje byoseee
ok , the first section there , there was a man who was a friend of mine who i used to build for , then i went to that side of electrogaz , they were saying that their employees were saying that they heard them say that they were going to kill him , a pastor in fact he was a chaplain shyogwe there at bishop musabyeimana , then they said how they were going to kill him but i had talked to my burundian friend who told me how frodebu used to dig holes . ||| ok , tranche ya mbere hirya hariya , hari umugabo w' inshuti yannjyae kera najyga nubakair , noneho nza kujya hariya hirya kuri electrogaz ,
i thought of hiding him and i looked for trees and dug this hole four meters deep five meter wide , and i dragged the ground like this and then i took off the ceiling of the house and i took it to the hole and covered it . ||| bavuga ko abakozi babo bavuga baumvise ukuntu bari bumwice , w' umupasiteri , mbese yari omoniye ishyogwe hariya kwa musenyeri musabyimana , ubwo bavuze uko bari bumwice ,
i added more dust to an extent that rain could n't penetrate through . ||| ariko nkaba nraganiriye n' umuntu w' umurundi anbwira ukuntu ba baciye imyobo abaforodebu bihishaagamo nnjyae numva kabisa ngomba kumuhishamo ndawucukuraaaa , ncaka ibiti umwobo wa metero enye hariya hari hafite metero enye kuri eshanu , nkajya ntinda gutya kabisa , nrangije nkuraho plafond y' inzu yanjye nragenda nsasaho maze kusasaho ,
i went and brought him . ||| nshyiraho ibitaka kuburyo nta nvura yageraagamo , njya kumuzana ngiye kumuzana ,
he gave me another man from ntogwe called emmanuel twagirayezu , and he told to come back and tell him . ||| ampa undi muntu witwa emmanuel twagirayeze w' ntongwe , ubwo aranbwira ati uzagarukae kunbwira , ubwo nsubiyeyo , ,
after some time when i went back i found more people that had come among them was the daughter to kabiligi , ancila , she knew me we had been together in school . ||| nsanga abndi batu bari bahahungiye harimo umukobwa w' uwitwa kabirigi , ancila , we yaria nzi turi turiganyae ,
she asked me to take her with me , she had two children and one of her late sister . ||| aranbwira ati nnjyae ugomba kunjyana , yari afite n' abana babiri n' umwana wa mukuru we upfuye ubwo nrabazanaan nbashyiramo hariya ,
i brought them and put them in there to now there were five of them , a man named bugene from over there , he could always come to see me with the interahamwe and they did n't recognize any thing , they came and searched my house nothing was in it . ||| maze kubashyiramo ubwo ari babaye batanu , umugabo witwa bugenae wa hano hakurya , mbese ubwo bakajya baza kunreba mbese interahamwe ziza kunreba ntizirabukwae , bakaza bakareba hano munzu ,
no one was in there and there was nothing to eat for them yet the people were out there in the hole . ||| bakasanga inzu mbese nta kintu kirimo , nta muntu urimo nta nicyo barya kirimo ariko bibereye hariya muri uriya mwobo .
then bugene with whom we went way back came of fear at to ask for refuge for his people . ||| ubwo bujene nawe tukaba turi tuziraanye aza kubinsaba kubera ubwoba icyo kihae umuntu bafataaga yarahishe abatutsi barabicanaaga ,
at that time people who they found hiding tutsis they would kill them all , i did n't believe him i thought he was a spy . ||| noneho nnjyae nbona amaze nk' umuntu ungenza nramuhakanair ,
i said no up to when he told me that he had people and he did n't know what to do with them . he told me that they were about to come and demolish his house . ||| kugeza ubwo yaje kubinbwira mbese numva nawe ko afite abantu yabuze uko agira nbwira ngo bari buze kumusenyair , ni hakurya aha ,
i said ok if you are willing , there is no making choices on one person to another and dying was all the same if they found me with five or sixteen it 's all the same , i told him that and he helped me digging some more ||| nramubwira nti niba ubyiyemeje , mbese kuko uraumva nta kurobanura umuntu n' undi byose yari umuntu kandi kupfa byose ni kimwe , jyae nravugaaga nti uko bansangaan bano batanu nuko bansangaan cumin na bane niko bigenda , ubwo nramubwiye araza anfasha kucukura uno mwobo wa hano twa
what time did you dig ? ||| mwucukura ryari icyo kihae ?
we started digging at eleven when they had stopped the patrol and we finished at two in the morning . ||| ubwo tutangiye kuwucukura satanu z' ijoro irondo ritashye , tuwurangiza samunani turatindaho ,
i removed my ceiling and we used it to cover the trench . ||| kabisa ubwo nvanaho plafond ,
we ceiled it with soil and i had many .... trees and the charismas trees there i brought them used them to prepare it and then we covered it since the hole was towards that banana tree . ||| tushyiraho , tumaze kushyiraho turasiba , nri nfite ibiti hano by' imivumu na siple nrazana ntasasair hano hari insina kuko umwenge uri uri mu nkuni hano y' insina tumaze kuhasasair mbese abantu bajya baza ntibagirae ikintu babona ,
those who came in for searching could n't see a thing . the people were in the holes outside . ||| nbaje gusaka hano munzu hano ntibagirae umuntu basangamo bibereye mu myobo ,
at times when it used to rain i would get them out and put them into my house even the other residences could see them but it would be raining and when the rain is almost over , i would hurry up and get them back into the holes so that no one ever saw them . ||| usibye ko imvura iyo yagwaaga nbavanaagamo nkabashyira munzu mbese abaturage bakababona ariko imvura igaw ariko hariya hakurya , ariko imvura yahita nnjyae ngatanguranwa nkabazanamo , kuburyo nta muntu wigeze arabukwa ,
a time came when the war ended and the inkotanyi arrived they got them out and we went to the part which they had conquered . ||| ubwo igihe kiza kugera intambara irarangira , inkotanyi zaigeze ino nibwo bavuyemo , tuhita tujyana tuca muri iriya zone inkotanyi zari zafashe nuko ,
i came back in july after the war . ||| ngaruka inaha mu kwezi kwa karindwi , intambara irangiye .
in beating they must have been people spreading rumors ? ||| ariko ubwo kukukubita hari nkababaga batanze udukuru
people would have said it those who saw them going for shelter , and they would say that people go for shelter in there yet after we look for them we do n't find them , that was the puzzle . ||| eeee , n' abantu babaga batanze amakuru babaga babonye bavamo bagiye kaugama noneho bakavuga bati abantu bajya kaugama hariya imvura yahita tujya kubareba ntitubabonae , niho ikibazo kivaaga ,
people say that some were found in there hiding , and neighbors helped you . ||| hari ibyo bavuga hari igihe hari igihe hari abigeze kuvumurwa , noneho abaturanyi murafatanya ,

that time when they found them , i had a big brother with some others like thomas and the citizens . they helped me and it led to nothing . ||| icyo kihae baravumbuwe , nri nfite mukuru wanjye anrwanaho nbanri baitwa ba thomas n' abandi baturagae banrwanaho , kuburyo nta kintu bifashe .

the daughter to murebwayire , she was tired of being in there and got out and when she saw people with machetes , she came back running and got back may be they were watching her . ||| eee , hari akana k' uwitwa murebwayire kari karambawiyewmo mbese kavamo kajya hanze noneho kabonye abantu bafite imihoro kaza kiruka kajyamo abant hari bakareba ,
the people then saw her it was like at 1 pm , they came and removed the cover . ||| noneho abaturage bahita bahabona hari nko mu masaa mu ma sa saba , abaturage bakabonye rero bahita baza babikurho ,
the rpf had arrived in this area so nothing happened and no one was hurt . all the fourteen are still alive . ||| ariko fpr yari yageze inahangaha bifata ubusa nta numawe wigeze agira icyo aba , bose uko ari cumi na bane bose bariho .

and i said "@ safari for you how do you see it @" he usually had news about mrd ||| nravuga nti safari se wowe urabibona utae nawe yagiraaga amakuru yari muri mdr .
we remained there and the assailants climbed up with whistles ||| twe tuba turasigaye mukanya gato igitero kiba kizamutse naga n' amafirimbi .

that time we had said that in case they come where shall we pass ? ||| icyo kihae turi tuvuze tuti nibaramuka bari mubantu baje turaca hehe ?

towards the methodists but people came knocking on safari 's door ||| agana mubametodiste ariko abantu barazamutse baraza bakubita kurugi rwo kwa safari .

that time those with whom we were together and with whom i also lived ||| icyo kihae nabo turi turi kumwe ariko tubanaaga .
and we were surprised ||| turavuga tuti karabaye turapfuye .
and said that this day we might be killed or flee ||| turavuga tuti uyu munsi tushobora kuicwa cyangwa tukahunga .
then morning came , when morning came ||| ubwo bigera mugitondo bigeze mugitondo .
i saw safari because i was on the side that face his home ||| tuza kubonaan na safari kuko uraumva nri kuruhande rureba iwe .

darkness fell and we put a ladder over here and they put one over there ||| burira urugo tushyira urwego hirya bashyira urwego hino arasimbuka .
and was followed by the wife and 2 male children ||| hakurikiraho umugore we n' abana be babiri babahungu .
there was no one girl at the time when they came home and we stayed there together ||| nta mukobwa icyo kihae uri urimo baza murugo tugumana aho ngaho murugo .
then we called so and so is dead ||| noneho turatefona bati kanaka arapfuye kanaka arapfuye .
that time i remember there was a relative of mine who lived in nyamirambo who they killed along with her children ||| icyo kihae nraibukako hari umuvandimwe wange ubaga i nyamirambo bamwishe n' abana .
so we stayed there with the workers ||| ubwo tugumana aho ngaho nraumva n' abakozi bari bahari ariko hashize .
my relative was called francoise and worked at the hospital ||| umuvandimwe wange yitwaaga francoise yakoraaga kubitaro .
and she had a husband called sevuma vicent ||| akaba yari afite umugabo witwaga sevuma vincent .
they lived in nyamirambo near the person with whom serushyana the owner the house in which we live stayed . ||| bari batuye i nyamirambo hafi y' umuntu uncumbikiraaga serushyana nyiri iyi nzu turi tufite .
he had another house in which they stayed that serushyana in nyamirambo and in front of it is where they lived ||| yari afite indi inzu babagamo uwo serushyana i nyamirambo inberae niho bari batuye .
someone called they had shot her and all her children ||| umuntu aranterefona ati baramurashe n' abana barabaishe bose .
it was around 11 o'clock ||| hari nko mu ma saa tanu gutyo rwose .
because they lived next to each other i told him , check for me because i have been told that they have killed people there ||| kuberako bari baturanye aho inberae nramubwira nti wandebeye ko banbwiyeko abantu babaishe aho ngaho .
and he told me not ask him about cockroaches ||| aranbwira gutyo ngo sumbaze ibintu by' inyenzi .
in a short while that 's when we started the car ||| ubwo mukanya gato nibwo imodoka turi tushyizeho .
because we said that come what may they are going to attack us ||| kuko tuvugaaga tuti uko bigenda kose baraza kutwataka .
we had to pick ||| ubwo turi tubaye nkabashyizeho ibintu by' amarondo .
who are those who can come ? ||| tuti abantu bashobora kuza nibandae .
so it was either oscar or my brother ||| ubwo ari .... oscar ari murumuna wanjye .
because when you were at home you could see behind as we had done during the time of bucyana ||| kuko iyo ubaga uri murugo urebaaga inyuma nkuko turi turabikoze kukihae cya bucyaan .
it was n't outside the door , for us we were in the house ||| ntabwo ari inberae y' umuryango twe turimo munzu .
so that we know who is coming ||| kugirango tumenye abantu baza kuza abo aribo .
then we would go outside and stand in the compound behind then look outside ||| noneho tukajya tuhagarara murugo inyuma tukareba hanze .
this way and the other way on the path behind ||| tukareba hirya no hino muri aka gahanda kari hano inyuma .
and we keep switching , so that we would see who was coming ||| tukasimburaan ariko twagirango turebae ni bande baza kuza .
after a while that young man ruzagiriza and emmanuel came and said that we have heard a car , a car is coming ||| hashize akanya uwo musore ruzakiriza nuwo emmanuel baraje bavuga bati tuumvise imodoka , imodoka iraje .
the car came and stood behind while they jumped over ||| ubwo imodoka ije iba ihagaze inyuma bo baba barasimbutse .
they jumped over where they put the ladder they fell behind ||| basimbutse aho hagati bahashyize urwego bo bahita bagwa inyuma .
the children remained there with the his wife , the children got a problem ||| abana nabo basigara aho ngaho n' umudamu we abana bagira ikibazo .
that 's what happened and they were wondering if they should go or stay with their mother , you could see that they had a problem ||| niko biri bimeze noneho bakavuga bati se tugende tusigaraane na maman ubonaaga bafite ikibazo abana .
they were male children , i do n't know their names but they are men now ||| abana babahungu ntinzi amazina ariko babaye abagabo .
so the shooting continued and as they shot ||| ubwo uraumva amasasu yariho avuga bakirasa aho ngaho .
if we are going to die we shall not all die from here so jump over and go ||| nrababwira nti niba tuza gupta ntabwo tupfair tuesae aha nkaha nimusimbukae mugendae .
"@ follow your father , " said ruzagiriza . the others had also left ||| mukurikirae papa wanyu ubwo ari uwo ruzakiriza n' abandi bari bagiye .
i remained with his wife , i do n't know if she is around and she said that you are not leaving me ||| nsigaraan n' umudamu we ntinzi niba ari aha nkaha umudamu ati ntabwo unsiga .
"@ i will not leave you , but if stay in the house those shooting will shoot us from here @" i said ||| nti ntabwo nkusiga rwose nti ariko nituguma munzu aha nkaha abo barimo barasa barahita baturasair aha nkaha .
so i told those young men "@ climb over and follow your father i looked for my brother and saw that he had left ||| ubwo nbwiye abo basore nti namwe muzamukae mukurikirae papa wanyu nrebye murumuna wange nsanga yagiye .
even the boy with whom we lived had left , that when the old lady told me that mucyo you are also leaving me ||| umuhungu tubanaaga nsanga nawe yagiye ubwo umukecuru nibwo yanbwiye ati mucyo nawe ugiye kunsiga .
i told her that i was n't going to leave her and we looked for a place , behind there was a toilet , we entered and locked ||| nramubwira nti ntabwo nkusiga ubwo tushatse ahantu inyuma hari toillette tujyamo turafunga .
and kept quiet , then we heard a car leave ||| turaceceka ubwo mukanya gato tugiye kaumva tuumva imodoka iragiye .
when it left ....... she told me that we should n't go out ||| igiye .............. aranbwira ati two kuvamo .
that if you go out they will kill us , i went to look over the other fence to see what had happened ||| ati nusohoka baratuica njya kureba hejuru ya rwa rugo kugirango turebae uko bimeze .
because she could not climb over the other place and fall behind ||| kuko nanone hahanri turi kuca kuko ntabwo yari kurair rwa rwego ngo angwae inyuma .
i was looking for a place where we could hide ||| ubwo nagirango nrebae ahantu tuza kuihisha mubyaha nkaha .
the one who is around , etienne munyabigoga lived besides us ||| arahangaha etienne munyabigoga yari atuye gutya iruhande rwacu .
he still lives there , i checked again and i heard the other coming come ||| nubu aracyahatuye nrangije nraongera nrareba nrebye mukihae nkireba ya modoka nanone numva iraongeye iragarutse .
where i left the other lady ...... they made hard for me , they shot and shot ||| hahanri nri nsize wa mukecuru .... ariko baraongeye bararashe , barashe .
they shot and made things hard for me , they left and we went outside to check ||| bararashe baraongeye baragiye tugiye hanze turareba .
when did n't any other coming back ......... @"@ where do you think we should go ? @" ||| noneho tuumva ntayinri igarutse .................... none se urabona tujya hehe ?
i told her and that there was a place we could go to ||| nramubwira nti hari ahantu numva tuza kuhungira .
i was thinking of mukuza 's and i told her that if you feel we can go together , come and we go ||| ntekerezaaga aha hariya kwa makuza nramubwira nti niba wunva tujyana uzae tugende .
after a while that 's when they started shooting at snd ||| hashize akanya gato nibwo batangiye kurasa hariya kuri snd .
and i said there is a place we were supposed to go , if you feel we can go together , come and we go ||| nravuga nti ariko hari ahantu tugombaaga kujya kuihisha niba wunva tujyana uzae tujyane .
and she said that let me leave you to go i can see the others have left so you can also look for a place to go ||| ati reka nnjyae nkurekae ati nrabona abandi bose bagiye ati nawe urebae aho ujya .
........ i do n't know where they took her , maybe it 's ghazi ... ||| ......... ntinzi ahantu bamujyanye ubwo niwe ghazi .
but they told us that they are going to the methodists over there ||| ariko batubwiraaga yuko bagiye mu ba metodiste hirya .
that 's when we started communicating with kayije who was over there and i told him that we should leave when it 's still early , he had also called me ||| ubwo nibwo tutangiye kuvugana na kayije uri hirya mubwira nti ibintu ko bigomba kuva aha nkaha hakiri kare nawe yari ya nterefonnye .
we planned come back when its dark ||| twapanze kugaruka inyuma bumaze kwira turebaeko tugaruka .
in the evening that 's what happened , that time we told prosper over there , a young man who worked for us ||| nimugoroba niko bigenze icyo kihae tubwiye prosper uriya , usore utukoreraaga .
to go ahead and check if there were people near there ||| ngo ajyae inberae aturebaire niba nt' abantu bari hafi aho ngaho .
and he sloped until he reached near here ..... ||| aramanuka kugeza igihe agereye hano hafi ......
there is a question i would like to ask you ||| hari akabazo nshakaaga kukubaza .
those cars and those who were shooting there anyone who you knew ? ||| izo modoka n' abantu barasaga nta muntu mwabimenye ?
there was n't anyone we knew but they told us it was an army car ||| nta muntu twa menye kuko ariko batubwiraagako ari iyagisirikari .
they shot but we never got to know them but i do n't know if there is anyone who knew anyone ||| barashe gutyo icyo kihae ntabwo tubamenye ariko ntinzi niba hari aba bamenye .
for me i did not see them because that time we were together safari 's living room ||| njyae ntinnababonye kuko icyo kihae turi kumwe muri salo na safari .
the others are the ones who kept watch outside ||| abandi nibo barimo bareba bareba aho hanze .
manuel and ruzagiriza . later we came to flee and let mukuza 's ||| manuel na ruzakiriza nyuma tuje kuhunga tuva kwa makuza .
he could n't walk ...... they told us that he was killed ||| ntiyabasha kugenda .... baza kutubwira ko bamwishe .
they attacked mukuza 's , i do n't know where he hid ||| baje kuhatera kwa makuza noneho we ntinzi ahantu agomba kuba yarihishe .
but i do n't think he died from mukaza 's , that he climbed up ||| ariko agomba kuba atarapfairiye kwa makuza ngo yaje kuzamuka .
and passed by etienne 's and went to hide at a place where he had hidden at the time of bucyana ||| aca iruhande rwo kwa ba etienne ajya kuihisha ahantu yari yarihishe kukihae cya bucyaan .
i do n't know where they were hiding ||| ntinzi ahantu bari baishishe .
my brother who is here he can say he was the one with whom they hid ||| nuko murumuna wange atari aha ngo abivugae niwe bari bajyanye .
my brother is called mucyo emmanuel ||| murumuna wanjye yitwa mucyo emmanuel .
that what they told me , they told that he was killed there ||| ibyo nibyo baje kunbwira baje kunbwirako yaje kuhaicirwa .
the person who told me this was called leopold , i do n't know if he is around ||| umuntu ubinbwiye n' umuntu witwa reopord ntinzi niba ari aha nkaha .
leopold who worked around here , where there was a bar called leopold . ||| reopord ukoraaga aha nkaha hari akabari yitiwa reopord .
i do n't know if he is still alive , people around here can help me ||| ntinzi niba akiriho abantu baha banfasha .
we met after when was alive ||| tuje kuhura nyuma ariho ?
we would to know if there is anyone here who knew leopold ||| turasaba abantu bazi reopord niba ahari ?
all his names ? ||| amazina ye yose ?
people knew he lived here ||| abantu baramuzi yari atuye ahangaha .
we reached mille collines ||| icyo kihae tugeze muri mille colline .
they said that we might be in the ceiling , yes i had left my car and they brought fuel and set it on fire ||| bavugako tushobora kuba turi muri prafo yeeeee nri nsize imodoka ihari noneho bazana essence baratwika .
but that time we were n't there ||| ariko icyo kihae ntabwo turi tuhari .
we were in mille collines and i called etienne 's ||| turi muri mille colline nje guterephona kwa etienne .
and it was answered by his daughter that 's when i found out that they were burning our place , that they are burning your place ||| nitabaw n' umukobwa wabo nibwo yanbwiye ati hano barimo barahatwika ati iwawe hahiye .
but what happened there even if i was n't around , but those two young men were around ||| ariko ibyaho ngaho nubwo ntari mpari ariko bariya basore babiri bari bahari .
prosper and is ..... they were around and they told me that after we left there were bricks ||| prosper na si ..... bari bahari baje kunbwirako tumaze kugenda hari ahantu hari amatafari .
they removed and went in between and then covered it ||| bacuye bakajyamo hagati bakaongera bakarenzaho .
in that they will tell us what happened . they burnt the place and finished ||| kuburyo ibyabaye aho ngaho baza kubivuga ariko baratwitse barangiza .
they were workers ||| bari abakozi .
who were around and they told us what happened ||| barahari baraza kutubwira ukuntu bigenze kuko bari bahari .
we left mille collines and went to kabuga ||| tuva mille colline tujya i kabuga .
among the people there i was able to go with my brother ||| mubantu turi kumwe rero aho ngaho uwo murumuna unjya tubashije kujyana .
to mille collines and that 's how he survived ||| mille colline nubu ariho yararokotse .
but that young man with whom we lived ruzigiriza did not survive ||| ariko uwo musore we tubanaaga ruzakiriza ntabwo yabashije kurokoka .
i would like the people who know how he died to tell us ||| noneho nagirango nsabae abantu bazi uko yapfuye nibo bazabitubwira .
that 's what they told us that they threw him in a hole ||| niko batubwiraagako bamutaye aho ngaho mucyobo .
another thing i heard was that among the people they burnt there were some people who lived behind ||| ikindi numvise nuko ngo mubantu batwitse harimo hari abantu bari batuye inyuma .
that there were some night watchmen from mironko 's ||| ngo hari ngo n' abazamu ngo bo kwa mironko ahari .
that maybe who were told to hold some things and failed , iron sheets and all ||| ngo kuburyo babashije kufata ibintu bikabananira kuvamo utubati niki .
whatever i forget the others will help me ||| ibyo nribugendae nibagirwa abandi baraza kunyunganira .
i did not see a lot there we were at makuza 's that 's when i saw people jumping out ||| ntabintu byinshi nbonye aho ngaho turi turi kwa makuza nibwo nbonaaga abantu basimbuka basimbuka bavamo .
and i felt that many people had died ||| nje kaumva ko hapfairiye abantu benshi cyane .
and those who were not able to leave died in it ||| ubwo abatarabashije kugenda abenshi bapfairiyemo .

he was led the group of attackers and they said that they should burn the house because there is no where they could have gone ||| niwe waruyongoje icyo gitero baraza baravuga ngo bayitwikae ntahantu babonye ho kujya .
we put some wooden planks up and then covered with more bricks ||| tushyiraho utubaho hejuru tufata andi matafari turenzaho .

the house was burnt while were there , then they got the car and tried to open it but failed ||| inzu baba barayitwitse ishya turaho bafata imodoka kufungura birabananira .
after failing to they pushed it then burnt it over under the road ||| bimaze kubananira barayisukuma bayitwikira hariya munsi y' umuhanda .
so the house burnt up as we were in the bricks , when it got dark that 's when we pulled ourselves out and went see a man called etienne ||| ubwo inzu irashya tuba aho ngaho mu matafati noneho bumaze kwira nibwo twasetsurutsemo tujya kumugabo witwa etienne .
we went to see etiene and slept there besides his car in the compound ||| etienne turahaba tujya kuri uwo mugabo etienne tuhageze turaharaye turara iruhande rw' imodoka ye iri mugipangu .
the small one that was there , then during the day we would sleep in the kitchen but he seemed not to take this well ||| mu gatoyota kari kahari ubwo buracya tukarara mugakoni kahari ariko tukabona ntabwo abireba neza .
he was n't happy about it at all ||| ntabwo yari abiishimaiye kabisa .
when we realised he was n't happy what we did was ||| ubwo tubonye atabiishimaiye ikintu tukoze .
she hid us ||| yaratuhishe .

we are neighbours up there but here there is boy who might know all her names ||| turaturanye hariya haruguru ariko hano hari umuhungu ashobora kuba azi amazina ye yose .
and we lived there , after which we fled together ||| ubwo turahaba kabisa , tumaze kuhaba tuza kuhungaan nawe .
and went to the police post , she called an relative of hers who was called ndindiriyimana ||| tujya kuri burigade aterefona mwenewabo uriya baitaaga nrindiraiye imaan .

they burnt it , then burnt safari 's house and at kayije 's ||| baratwitse baza kutwika no kwa safari batwika no kwa kayije .

thank you , you can sign your statement ||| urakoze ushobora gusinyira inyandiko yawe .
thank you , you can go back to your seat ||| murakoze ushobora kusubira mu mwanya wawe .
i do not remember precisely the day they attacked ||| umunsi bateye nraumva ntawibuka neza .
because we left on the 7th and left at night ||| kuko tuhavuye ubwo ni kuyakarindwi turagenda tugenda ni joro .
and went to mukuza 's where we spent the day , so they must have attacked at night but there are some people who can tell us ||| tujya kwa makuza turahairirwa bagomba kuba barahateye nijoro ariko hari abantu bahari batubwira .
i do n't remember it but there are some who can tell us ||| nraumva nta wibuka neza ariko barahari batubwira .
also i would like you tell us when ruzagiriza came back to where you lived if you remember ||| akandi kabazo nagirango nkubaze n' itariki ruzakiriza yaba yaragarukaiye aho mwari mutuye niba uyibka utubwira .
yes , after he jumped , i remember i remember they disturbed me when they got back ||| yeeeeeee amaze kusimbuka nraibuka iryo joro baraongeye baragaruka .
but i saw my brother here and he told them because he was the one they were waiting for ||| ariko murumuna wanjye nmubonye ahangaha arabibabwira kuko niwe bari barikaumawe .
he was the one with whom they were with ||| niwe bari bari kumwe basigaraanye .
we went below the church ||| turagenda noneho tugeze haruguru munsi y' urusengero .
there was a white man who lived there , he might have been the pastor ||| hari umuzungu uri uhatuye ashobora kuba ari umu pasteur ahari .
and he seemed well acquainted with safari 's sons ||| akaba abahungu ba safari ngirango bari basanzwe baziraanye ahari .
a pastor of which religion ? ||| umupasteur wirihe dini ?
he was the pastor of that area because he lived behind the church ||| ni umupasteur waho kuko yari atuye inyuma y' urusengero .
the church up here which was methodist ||| urusengero ruha haruguru rw' abametodiste .
and they told us that they were going to seek refuge there ||| hanyuma batubwiyeko bagiye kusaba ubuhungiro yo .
we remained behind the fence , there was a fence made of shrubs and we remained behind it ||| twe tusigara inyuma y' urupangu hari urupangu rw' imiyenzi tusigara inyuma yarwo hanze aho .
and let them in , after a while safari also went over ||| arabaemerair ubwo ako kanya na safari aba arahageze .
and he also entered but we remained outside because they asked to wait ||| nawe ahita yinjira twebwe tusigara aho ngaho baratubwira ngo turindirae .
they came to tell us after a while ........ ||| baza kutubwira hashize akanya umuhungu we mut .....
he entered the methodist pastor 's place ? ||| yinjira kwa pasteur wa ba metodiste ?
yes the problem was that we would all enter an they would find us and kill all of us ||| yego ikibazo ngo kiri kihari nuko tushoboraaga kuinjira bakaba batusangamo bakatuiciramo tuesae .
that 's when his son went back and closed the door ||| ubwo nibwo umuhungu we yahise asubirayo ahita afunga umuryango .
so we remained there ||| ubwo turahagumaye .
what was that boy 's name ? ||| uwo muhungu yitwa nde ?
muhirwa ||| muhirwa .
its muhirwa ||| ni muhirwa
so we remained there till evening around 3 o'clock and that 's when the shooting started at the parliament ||| ubwo turahagumaye kugeza kumugoroba mu ma saa cyenda nibwo batangiye kurasa kuri snd .
so we remained in hiding there , i was at 5 o'clock when te safari 's came out ||| ubwo tuguma tuihishe aho ngaho bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi nimawe nibwo ba safari baongeye barasohoka .
and i thought that they were going to see their mother , and they immediately came back with her ||| noneho ngirango bagiye kureba nyina , nyina wabo bahise bagarukaan .
they entered and we asked them if we could also enter ||| baraza barainjira turababaza niba tushobora kuinjira ntawe
and they said no ||| baratuhakanair .
then it started to become dark at around 6 o'clock ||| ubwo butangiye kuhumana bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi nebyiri .
they had attacked gatera 's ||| bari bateya kwa katera .
we got there when they had already left , no one was there ||| tugezeyo baba bamaze kugenda nta muntu numawe uhari .
prosper is the one who told us that they had sloped to mukuza 's . ||| uriya prosper niwe utubwiyeko bamanutse bagiye kwa makuza .
that 's what we asked him to do , to check this path down here ||| ubwo nibwo tumusabye ngo aturebaire iyi nzira ya hano hepfo .
to see if we can pass ||| arebaeko tubasha kutambuka .
he went ahead of us checking for us and we got to mukuza 's door , they opened for us and we entered ||| atugenda inberae aturebair hanyuma tugera k' umuryango wo kwa makuza baratufungurair turainjira .
we spent 2 days there ||| ubwo aho ngaho tuhamaze iminsi ibiri .
we left there after finding out that they burnt our home and killed kayije 's children and wife ||| tuza kuhava bamaze kumenyako ngo bahatwitse murugo bamaze no kuica abana ba kayije n' umudamu .
i think this is where my testimony ends ||| nraumva ubuhamya buangae bugarukaiye aho .
thank you . go back to your seat if there are no questions . ||| urakoze ushobora kusubira mu mwanya wawe niba inteko ntacyo ikubaza .
what jean de dieu said i agree is what happened ||| ibyo jean de dieu yavuze byose nrabiemera niko bigenze koko .
but there is a decision i wanted to give ||| uretseko hari decision nshakaaga kutanga .
that day when the shooting took place and things looked bad ||| uwo munsi barasa ubona ibintu bimeze nabi .

and went to mille collines ||| tujya muri mille colline .
we went to mille collines but because there were many people ||| tugenda muri mille colline ariko kuberako abantu bari benshi .
we entered in groups , there are some people who remained who were the near cars there ||| tugiyemo mubicae donc hari abantu basigaye abari baegeranyae n' imodoka zari zihari .
that time i entered in the first group and oscar remained ||| icyo kihae nge ngiye muri groupe ya mbere oscar we yarasigaye .
they came back for the second group but he was left because there was n't enough room ||| iyinri groupe ya kabiri bagarutse kuyifata nabwo arasigara kukberako imyanya yari yabaye mikeya .
would mucyo like to say something ? ||| mucyo arashaka kugira icyo avuga .
i wanted to talk about where i parted with that comrade , so the rest will speak after ||| nge nagirango nagirango nvugae aho tutandukanaiye nuriya muvandimwe ubwo abandi bazavuga nyuma yaho .
the car came back , the person in it asked for ose the brother to joshua ||| tusigaye imodoka iragaruka , igarutse yaraje uwarurimo ahamagara ose murumuna wa josue .........
that "@ where is ose ? @" ||| ati ose ari hehe ?
i was next to oscar that time ||| icyo kihae oscari turi tuegeranyae .
i told oscar that we are the ones who were now he car is back , this is our chance ||| nbwira oscari nti urabona nitwae turi tusigaye none imodoka iragarutse niyo occasion tufite .
to go because this place will be attacked and it was clear that this would happen ||| yo kugenda kuko aha nkaha baraza kuhatera kandi koko biragaragaraaga .
because the interahamwe were passing below where we were in trucks pointing at us ||| kuko interahamwe zacaaga epfo tubaga tuzireba mu ma kamyo bose batutunga urutoki .
and everyone was jumping over mukuza 's which showed that they were going to attack the place ||| kandi n' abantu bose bariho basimbuka bava kwa bagwa kwa makuza kuko birakaraga ko bari buze kuhatera .
i told him this is our chance to escape come and we go ||| nramubwira nti iyi niyo occasion tubonye yo kuhunga jya tugende .
he delayed and yet this needed to be done fast because everyone was running saying that it was only one car that had returned ||| arajijinganya kandi biri ibintu byo kuihuta kuko ubwo abantu bose bari bamanutse biruka uvuga uti ni imodoka imwe igarutse yonyine .
also people started saying that those from kanzayire are being killed so people are jumping over the fence to mukuza 's ||| ikindi abantu batangiye kuvuga ko abo muri kanzayire babica bakasimbuka urugo bakagwa kwa makuza .
i stood with him and then told him "@ you see ||| tuza kuhagararaan na oscar nramubwira nti oscar urabireba birangiye .
they are going to attack this place we should look for a way to leave ||| barataka aha nkaha tushakae ukuntu tuhava .
others have left and might not come back and we left here @" ||| abandi baragiye bashobora kutagaruka twe turasigaye .
that we should look for a way to leave and that we met the car coming back ||| tuti tushakae ukuntu tuhava nibwo tuhuye imodoka igarutse rero .
when it came back and said ose people sloped in big numbers so that they could get in ||| igarutse ubwo bavuze bati ose abantu bamanuka bari benshi kugirango bajyae kuyijyamo .
and i oscar that this is our only chance , if people get in before us we will not be able to leave ||| nrababwira nti oscar iyi ngiyi niyo chance yacu niba abantu batutanzemo ntago tubasha kugenda .
he fumbled around and i left , i remember at the door way and i turned around again and said , oscar you are staying here ||| arajijinganya , ajijinganyije nge nba ngiye nraibukako tugeze mu muryango hagati nraongera ntahindukira nramubwira nti oscar wowe urasigaye .
but after he said everyone else came ||| ariko mukihae akivuga gutyo abo bantu bose baba baraje .
that 's when he told me "@ for me i 'm leaving so you should go and if you live then you live and if i live then i live @" ||| nibwo anbwiye ati nge nragiye igenderae nubaho ubaeho nnjyae nimbaho nbaeho .
where it was coming from was it supporting you ? what kind was it ? was it from the army ? ||| aho yari iturutse yari igiye kubarengera ? yari bwoko ki ? yari iya gisirikari ?
was it for a relative , what was it ? ||| yari iy' umuvandimwe yari iyi iki ?
it was a suzuki but makuza would know better ||| kari agasuzuzuki ariko makuza ntinzi niba ari ahangaha ahari we yabimenya .
however it was a suzuki because two groups were taken and many of makuza 's cars were taken but what came back was a suzuki ||| ariko kari agasuzuki kuko hagiye ibyiciro bibiri imodoka zaragiye ari nyinshi za makuza ariko kagarutse kari agasuzuki .
i think is some else who can give a more detailed account , so honourable president can you give mucyo 's employee permission to speak ||| ngirango hari undi mutangabuhamya tubonye kdi nawe ushobora kutuha za precisions uri umukozi wamucyo nawe nyakaubahaw president mwamuha ijambo .
i am called udahemuka silivani and i live in kimihurura ||| ngewe nitwa udahemuka silivani ubu ntuye ku kimihurura
so you should swear that you are going to say is the truth ||| hanyuma rero uraza urahiraeko ibyo ugiye kuvuga ari ukuri .
i could say that what happened this neighbourhood as he said before the slightly genocide ||| nukuvuga ngo ibintu bibereye muri iyi quartier nkuko nawe yabivuze mbere ya jenocide ho gato .
happened as we were watching ||| bibaye tureba .
me and a man named prosper lived there together ||| njyae n' umugabo prosper tubanaagayo .
and what mucyo told us as were together there ||| ibyo mucyo yagiye atubwira turi kumwe nawe aho ngaho .
as they tried to commit the killings we talked about it together ||| barimo bashaka kukora ubwo bw' icanyi tubivuganaagaho nawe .
because the night habyarimana died he called us together in the sitting room ||| kuko muri iryo joro habyarimana apfuye yatuteranyairije muri salo .
and told us what to do and we immediately dressed up in what we could wear at that time ||| aratubwira ati tukorae iki tuhise tuambara imyenda umuntu yari ashoboye kushyira k' umubiri ako kanya .
about those car that came , because i could only describe what i saw i agree with prosper ||| iby' izo modokari zazaaga kuberako uko nbisobanuye niko nbibonaaga ndi kumwe nuwo prosper .
..................... me and prosper hid in a small room ||| amashoka , amahiri ngewe na prosper ubwo tuihindaiye mukazu kari kari murugo .
on the fence it was made of bricks ||| k' ikikoni kari ak' amatafari .
we cut through the bricks and entered when we saw attacking our home ||| amatafari turaciyemo ikintu ..... tuinjiramo tubonye batatse urupangu .
there were something up and we put bricks on top and entered ||| hari hariho ibiti hejuru tugerekaho amatafari tujyamo .
when they entered the compound and there was the car of this man jean de dieu ||| bamaze kuinjira mugipangu hari imodokari yuyu mugabo mucyo jean de dieu .
and in the house the phone was ringing and they said without doubt these people are in this house ||| ya ........... ariko ubwo munzu telephone niko ziri gusona zisona bakavuga ngo bianze bikunze aba bantu barimo .
they tore the doors down and entered oscar 's place where they threw a grenade ||| inzugi baba baraziciye bainjira ahari umuryango kwa oscar bateramo grenade .
we could look through a breach between the bricks and look outside . ||| twe turebair muri ayo matafari ntawashoboraga kuzamuka ngo arebae hanze neza .
we did not know how he died , as that man prosper said we were together with the other old lady in the house ||| ntabwo ntawe tumenye urupfu rwe nkuko uriya mugabo prosper yabivuze turi kumwe nuwo mukecuru munzu .
after this man etienne betrayed us and told us to look for a place to go and leave ||| uyu mugabo witwa etienne amaze kututererana akatubwira ati mwashatse ahantu mujya mukava hano .
what happened at etienne 's place , had you sought refuge in that place ? ||| kwa etienne bigenze kutae mwari mwahahungiye ?
mucyo 's place was burnt and by evening it was properly burnt ||| twebwe haje gushya kwa mucyo bigeze k' umugoroba wa joro hari hamaze gushya neza .
and we saw people coming to loot while were still that house ||| tukabona abantu baraza kuhasura sura cyane kandi turi tukiri muri iyo nzu .
i told prosper that this place is being looted a lot ||| noneho nijyae ubwiye prosper nti aha hantu urabona barimo baraza kuhasurasura cyane .
"@ hold on etienne betrayed them and can you can you explain yourself to them ? @" ||| itondae etienne yarabatereranye atae ubisobanura ?
when night fell and we went to his place hoping to knock at his door because it was dark ||| etienne ubwo tubonye ijoro riguye tujya iwe tushaka kugirango tumukomangaire tubona burije cyane .
we went to his place but decided not to knock at his door .... under a rundown truck ||| tugiye iwe tuanga kubakomangair .... munsi y' ikamyoneti yapfuye itakora .
when we saw it was morning that 's when we knocked at their door ||| tubonye bukeye murukerair nibwo tubakomangaiye .
his wife and daughter were around and they covered us and put us in the boys quarters near the toilet behind ||| madamu we n' umukobwa we bari bahari baratuakira batushyira mu ka annexe kaegeranyae na ws inyuma .
i would like you to give the names of his wife and daughter if you remember them ||| yeeeeeeeee nagirango nuvuga madamu cyangwa umukobza uzae kuvuga amazina ye niba uyibuka .
i do not remember them very well but i feel people who can help me and tell me ||| ntabwo nyibuka neza nraumva hari abantu bashobora kuba banyunganira baka yanbwira .
the wife brought us some tea and told us that they did not know that where we there and we said that we were , etienne was not around ||| ubwo umudamu yatuzaniye na kacyayi aratubwira ati ntabwo turi tuziko rwose hariya hantu mwari murimo tuti niho turi turi etienne ntiyari ahari .
i short while etienne came and found us there , they told him there are some boys who live with mucyo ||| ubwo mukanya gato etienne aba araje arahatusanze baramubwiye bati hari abahungu babanaaga na mucyo .
he entered the house .... but when he got out we could already see that we were an inconvenience ||| yinjira munzu ...... ariko aho asohokeye twe turabibonye ko tufite ikintu tumubangamiye .
after telling him this prosper got out of that boys quarter that we were in and called the old women who lived next to etienne ||| nbimubwiye muri annexe aho nri ndi ubwo prosper yarasohotse muri ako ka annexe ahamagara umukecuru uri uturanye nuwo mugabo etienne .
the old woman could get up , i do not remember her name ||| umukecuru kandi araha ashobora kuhaguruka nraumva ntazi izina rye neza .
i do not remember it , it 's been a while ||| ntinkiriibuka hashize igihe .
"@ old lady we have asked for assistance from etienne and he has betrayed us @" we told the old lady the problem we had ||| umukecuru tuiambaje etienne amaze kututererana umukecuru tumubwira ikibazo tufite aratubwira ati .
"@ come and live here there is no problem @" she said ||| nimuzae mubae muri hano nta kibazo .
we stayed there until someone noticed that we were the only ones left in the neighbourhood ||| aho hantu turahabaye kugeza igihe umuntu abonye ko tusigaye muri quartier twenyine ntabanri bantu bakihari .
i do n't know if that person was a relative , i do n't know if it was a friend ||| yiambaza umuntu ntinzi niba ari mwenewabo ntinzi niba ari umuntu w' inshuti ntinzi .
he was called augustin , he was the chief of staff of gendarmerie ||| yitwaaga augustin yari chef d' etat major wa jandarumori .
another thing that i can add concerning the man oscar who lived next to this man ||| ikindi nshobora kuba nongeraho kubierekeye umugabo oscar uri uturanye nuyu mugabo .
i personally when i was still with prosper that woman 's house we never left the house ||| njyewe ubwange nkiri kuri uriya mudamu turi munzu ngewe na prosper ntabwo tugeraaga hanze .
but people passed outside who interahamwe running that they were going to kill people and passed above that house ||| ariko abantu bahitaaga aho hanze b' interahamwe biruka ngo bajyae kuica abantu bahise haruguru yurwo rugo .
i heard them say "@ that man with long legs who lived above here , we put him in a hole over there ||| numvise bavugango uriya mugabo ngo w' amaguru maremare ngo uri utuye haruguru aha ngo tumushyize mu cyobo kiri hariya .
blow the pastor 's place , " that the one who lived with the dark skinned man , and it is this mucyo jonah who they were talking about ||| munsi yo kwa pasteur ngo umwe uri uturanye na wa mugabo ngo w' igikara ari we uyu mucyo yohani bashatse kuvuga .
it was oscar they had killed , when i eaves dropped on what they were saying as hid at the old lady 's place ||| ariwe na oscar baishe nbiumvise ndi kuri uriya mukecuru ariko ntabwo nri ndi ahagaragara .
did you see where they were going ? ||| abo bagendaaga ntabwo ubabonye ?
i was in the house and the person i told this was prosper that they are talking about a man with long legs and dark skinned , is n't it oscar ? ||| njyae nrinri munzu umuntu nbibwiyeho ni prosper nramubwiye nti sha abo bantu bavuga ngo umugabo wamaguru maremare w' ikiyobae ubwo si oscar .
what i was able to here and follow up is that ||| mbega ibyo nshoboye kaumva nibyo nshoboye kukurikiraan nibyo .
you may stop there , there are some people who have questions on what you were talking about ||| uba uretse hari abaifuza kukubaza kubyo uvuze .
when he came after around 15 minutes he knew that we were around and he jumped behind the house and then into the house ||| aje hashize nk' iminota nka cumi n' itanu yamenyeko tuhari yikojeje inyuma y' inzu araongera yikoza munzu .
and found us there and because he knew us he told us that help me and leave this place and find a place to go or something ||| noneho arahatusanga kuko yari atuzi aratubwira ati mu nbabarirae muvae hano murebae ahantu mujya cyangwa se murebae ukundi mubigenza .
and that when me and the man prosper came to a decision ||| naho nje nuriya mugabo prosper niho tufataiye umwanzuro .
and the youngster who worked for the man oscar because we were together ||| n' umwana ukoreraaga uwo mugabo witwa oscar kuko nawe turi kumwe aho ngaho hariya .
where is he ? ||| ari hehe ?
they shot near the house of this old lady and the people who fled . they run away and he also left ||| we baje kutera igisasu hafi yuru rugo rw' uyu mukecuru mubantu bari bahahungiye biruka yirukankamo ahita agenda .
because i was into politics for a while ||| kuberako nri ndi muri politiki kandi nri maze igihe nyitangiye .

they brutalised most followers , even those here in kigali were stopped ||| bagakomeretsa abayoboke benshi bari baje nab' i kigali hano mu mugi bakabatangira .
i was the stadium holding a microphone with radio rwanda around ||| niriwe rero niriwe ku stade kikora nfashe micro nvuga na radio rwanda ihari .

i slept at agatha 's and called home telling them how the situation was ; i do n't know how they handled it . ||| nraye kwa akata nterefona murugo nbabwira uko bimeze ntinzi uko babigenje .
i think i came back on a sunday the 20th and on monday they shot gatabazi felician . ||| nragaruka ubwo hari ngirango kucyumweru hari itari makumyabiri kuwambere n' imugoroba barasa katabazi feliciani .
i remember i was in my living room and i heard my wife saying that what she said has started ||| nraibuka nri iwanjye muri salo numva umugore wanjy aravuze ngo ibyo yavuze biratangiye .
the 22nd was a tuesday as honourable mucyo jean de dieu was saying ||| itariki makumyabiri na kabiri hari kuwa kabiri nibyo nyakaubahaw mucyo jean de dieu yahoze ababwira .
that morning , { 22nd } they killed bucyana at mbazi next to their place and behind their place . ||| mugitondo icyo kihae ku itariki makumyabiri na kabiri ngo bica bucyaan i nbazi hafi y' iwabo ni inyuma y' iwabo .
we did not know they killed bucyana though those of snd got that place ||| bica bucyaan ariko twe ntitubimenye ariko aba snd ba kominitse uwo mwanya .
they spent the night shooting but we were n't aware of what they shooting at ... there at kimihurura but we did not know what it was . ||| baraye barasa ariko tutazi ibyo barimo .... hariya ku kimihurura tubireba ariko tutazi ibyo aribyo .
that when they killed at gikondo on 22 february 1994 ||| icyo kihae rero nibwo baishe igikondo kuri uwo munsi itariki 22/02/1994 .
they killed 53 people on gikondo hill ||| baishe abantu mirongo itanu n' abatatu k' umusozi wa gikondo .

those counted dead on this hill of gikondo are 53 people . ||| baishe abantu barabaruye , abantu mirongo itanu n' abatatu kuruyu musozi wa gikondo .
maybe on 22/02/1994 , i was supposed to be the first person killed . ||| ku itari 22/02/1994 icyo kihae rero wenda nri mubambaire bagombaaga kupfa .
even gatera karipoforo , i can say that i did not know gatera was alive , he has already been sentenced to death ||| nkatera karipoforo nravuga aho tutuye ntinrinzi ko katera ariho ariko yari asanzwe yikomawe kuko bari baramuciraiye urubanza rwo kupfa .
claiming that him and rwigema spent the night shooting in kigali town ||| bamurega ngo ko yaraye arasa mu mugi ikigali we n' uwitwa rwigema n' abandi .
then it 's said he heard people trying to bring ethnic divisionism ||| noneho ngo yumva ngo abantu ntinzi ubwo bashakaaga gukkurura amacakubiri .
they is a way they said and you got what they want to imply ||| hari uko bavugaaga abantu bakabamenya .
safari they were saying that they are coming to kill me at exactly 11:00 ||| bavugaagako baza kunyica saa tanu zauzuye .
because we are interested in knowing the truth about the genocide , i want you to reveal their names ||| nagirango nutanga ubuhamya kuberako turashaka kumenya ukuri kuri jenocide abo bantu nutabavuga ...
i do n't know the names of those people , but he { my brother } told me they were speaking "@ urukiga @" ||| abo bantu simbazi amazina ariko yaranbwiye ngo bavugaaga ikikaiga .
my wish is for you to spell out the names you know , because it is a good example ||| nifuzaaga yuko abantu uzi ubavuga ? kubera yuko n' urugero rwiza .
because if others testify while not revelling the names , it will be a problem as we shall not get to the truth ||| kubera yuko abaturage nibumva yuko bagomba kuvuga basimbutse amazina biba ari ikibazo ntabwo tugera kukuri .
he did n't tell me their names but he told me that they were speaking "@ urukiga @" ||| ntabwo yanbwiye amazina ariko yaranbwiye ngo bavugaaga ikikaiga .
safari ||| aranbwira ati urapfa saa tanu ubwo hari nka saa mbiri na makumyabiri ubwo tuhise tuvugana na nyakaubahaw mucyo .
safari at 11:00 ? and he answered , "@ at 11:00 @" i asked whether he has proof of what he was saying and he said "@ i 've told you you 'll be killed at 11:00 @" ||| nti saa tanu ati saa tanu nti ubifitiye kihamya ati barakuica saa tanu niko nkubwiye .
i ran out of ideas and became very confused asking myself what i can do . and he told me , "@ flee @"@ . ‘ where can i go ? ’ i asked , " i do n't know @" he answered ||| nbura uko ngira ndacanganyukirwa nti ngirae ntae ati hunga nti mpungire he ati ntabwo mpazi .
i remember he asked me whether i had some money and i asked my wife , "@ do you have money ? @" i told her to give it to me . all the children were at home . ||| nraibuka icyo kihae yaranbajije ati ufite amafaranga nbaza umugore nti ufite amafaranga .... nti yazanae abana bose bari bakiri murugo .
my daughters and sons ran to his place in remera and he gave us more money ||| abakobwa baangae n' abahungu baangae tunyarukair iwe i remera atuha andi mafaranga yiongeraho .
i asked myself where i will flee to and my heart told me to go to my place of birth ||| nibaza aho ndi buhungirae agatima karaza kati jya iwanyu .
i was wondering where i will pass ? what if "@ kugiti cy'inyoni @" is locked and i 'm known by the people of kimisange ? ||| nibaza aho nribunyurae setiba yafunze kugiti cy' inyoni noneho kuberako nri maze igihe ngenda mubaturagae ba kimisange .
i fought mrnd and came back here climbing there at the top next to rebero and passed through kariyeri and i came back to kamisange ||| nrwanya mrnd ngaruka ino nzamuka hano haruguru hafi ya rebero nca muri kariyeri ngaruka kimisange .
your honour i 'd said that i will give a long testimony because you can see that i know a lot of things ||| nubundi nyakaubahaw president nvuzeko nzabutanga buri naburebure wumviseko nzi ibintu byinshi .
it is then that we were attacked after he told me , i fled ||| noneho icyo kihae nibwo tuterawaga amaze kubibwira ntahunga .
i passed through the same paths i told you earlier , to that place under that .... and crossed ||| nca ayo mayira nbabwiraaga mpinguka hariya munsi ya ..... nraambuka .
later they indeed attacked as he had warned me . they came home and destroyed and they broke windows ||| nyuma baratera koko nkuko yaka binbwiye baza iwanjye barasenya bamenagura ibirahure .
they went to gatera 's and raped one gloriose , i normally see her around . ||| baragenda bajya kwa katera bakorayo amarorerwa umwana witwa gloriose uri uhari njya nbona akunda kuza hano .
she will tell you what happened , what i wanted was to tell you was that at that time we were attacked by people selected from here , gikondo . ||| azavuga uko bigenze icyo nshakaaga kuvuga rero nuko icyo kihae bisa naho twatewe n' abantu batoraanijew hano igikondo .
i later learnt that fupi son of gakara was among the assailants . in fact i one time met him ||| uwo nmenyemo ngarutse n' uwitwa fupi mwene gakara nje no kugira ntya nramubona n' amaso yanjye .
he was among the assailants ||| yari muri icyo gitero .
where did you live ? ||| uri utuye hehe ?
close to here at a place called salo , behind here , all residents of gikondo know it , all those you are seated know it ||| hano hirya hafi yaho baita salo aha inyuma abanyagikondo bose barahazi abo mwicaranye bose barahazi .
i knew only those who were among the attackers ||| abantu bari muri icyo gitero nibo nshoboye kumenyamo ........
i could say 53 people died in the genocide ||| abantu mirongo itanu n' abatatu tubarako bapfuye murwego rwa jenocide .
there a times we refer to the people of 1994 together with those who died ||| hari igihe tuvuga abo muri mirongo icyenda na kane tukabagira nabo banri bapfuye .
you said that they were victims of the genocide , i would like you to explain this ||| nagirango usobanurae uvugako bazize jenocide ubisobanurae neza .
they were victims of genocide because i know that despite the fact that they called it revenging bucyana , but bucyana was a sdr ||| bazize jenocide kuko nziko icyo kihae nubwo ubundi biitwaaga kuhorera bucyaan ariko bucyaan yari sdr .
cdr was a political party that openly hated tutsis with divisionism , they killed tutsis then ||| sdr ryari ishyaka riikoma abatutsi kumugaragaro rivangura icyo kihae baishe abatutsi .
when w ego there , i should skip the part when habyarimana died ||| tugeze rero ubwo wenda nsimbukae aho ngaho kukihae habyarimana apfa .
habyarimana died and i found out around 9 pm ||| habyarimana apfa nrabimenye nabwo hari nka saa tatu z' ijoro .
i went to gatera karopoforo 's and asked him if he knew what happened and he said he did not ||| jya kwa katera karipoforo nramubwira nti umenye ibyabaye ati ntabwo nbimenye .
that the plane was shot down , "@ we should we flee to ? @" he asked and i said we could pass butamwa up to bugesera ||| ati bite nti indege barayihanuye ati none tuhungae tuhungirae he nti nraumva tuca ibutamwa tukagera mubugesair .
because i have a land there and i felt the locals could help us cross over the lake ||| kubera iki nfite isambu hariya numvaaga abaturage batwambutsa mu mazi .
that 's what i thought at that time and he wondered whether we should go and see kayije in the middle of the night ||| niko nibazaaga icyo kihae ati muri ikigicuku aribaza ati tujyae kureba kayije .
i climbed up and woke kayije up and talked but failed to come to a decision . in the morning there was a law passed on radio that no one should leave where he is ||| turazamuka tubyutsa kayije turavuga tunanirwa kufata icyemezo mugitondo nibwo radio yatanze itegeko ngo nta muntu ugomba kuva ahari .
we stayed in the house and at 11 o'clock on the 7th a woman from ndera came ||| tuhera mu mazu dutyo tumaze kuhera mu mazu rero mu ma saa tanu itariki indwi umudamu w' inrera araza .
"@ who told you that ? @" i asked "@ by my child in town @" she answered ||| gutyo nti ubibawiyew nande ati n' umwana wanjye uri mu mugi .
i started to feel more scared and i told myself to hide at kayije 's ||| ntangira kaumva noneho ubwoba bwiyongereye nibwo nibwiraaga kujya kuihisha kwa kayija .
...... the woman told me "@ going to kayije 's , is far you see passing in front of my place up to in front of kayije 's ||| ....... umugore aranbwira ati turajya kwa kayije ni kure urabona kuca inberae y' iwanjye ukagera inberae yo kwa kayije .
i can not dream of it @"@ ... the fence was there and he was also being sought after and i could not go there ||| ..... ho ntinharota ..... cloture yari ihari nawe yarahigawaga ntinshoboraaga kuba njyayo .
up to when i felt those with whom we shared a problem were the ones i could flee to ||| kugeza ubwo nkaumva abo numva duhuje ibibazo aribo nhungiraho .
i decided to go to mucyo , i could go twagiramungu 's with whom we were neighbours ||| ntekereza noneho kujya kwa mucyo nshoboraaga kujya kwa twagiramungu turi tuturanye .
but i never thought about it , and that 's when i fled to mucyo 's ||| ariko ntinigeze nbitekereza noneho niko kuhungira rero kwa mucyo ngezeyo rero baje kurasa .
i remember he the time he called nyamirambo tears filling his eyes ||| nrabiibuka icyo kihae aterefona i nyamirambo amarira amubunga mu maso .
there is another time when they came to my place during the day with soldiers to kill me but did not find me there ||| hari nubundi bigeze kuza iwange kumanywa n' abasirikari nabwo kunyica barambura .
that 's when i climbed while hiding in bushes , i think with the oscars but we did not flee together ||| nibwo nuriraaga nyine nragenda tuihisha murubingo ngirango nba oscar ariko ntabwo tuhungaanye .
but we did not flee to the same place , some gathered together and others did the same ||| ariko ntabwo tubunze hamwe bamwe babunraga ukwabo abandi ukwabo .
they fled to the bushes ..... they gathered in the bushes and the children followed me and we gathered there ||| babunze murubingo .......... wose mbunda murubingo abana baraza barankurikira baraza turabunda .
in the evening i saw someone draw the curtain ||| noneho bigeze mu kabwibwi nbona umuntu uvanyeho rideau .
that 's what the other youngster said , a white man drew the curtain and i went ... and the children and the white man said that we should not leave the house ||| niwe wamwana yahoze avuga umuzungu avanaho rideau nragenda ni .... n' abana umuzungu ati ....... nti ntabwo tuva munzu .
he called the msgr and asked "@ what 's your name ? @" i told him and he said "@ there is someone called safari who has come to seek refuge here what should i do ? @" ||| aterefona musenyeri ati witwa nde ndamwibwira ati hari umuntu witwa safari uje kuihisha hano nbigenze ntae ?
ruhumuriza said that if they find out that he is a round they will kill you ||| ruhumuriza ati baramuka bamenyeko yahageze byo byonyine barakuica .
i think it was god who led me there .... a bag , and murenzi sloping conversing and my heart told me ||| ahubwo kera n' imaan ya nyoboyeyo ........ agacupa na murenzi tukamanuka tuganira umutima ukanbwira .
you should hide there , i could see a big house behind but that 's not where i hid , i had at that one 's place ||| uzihishe hariya nbonaaga ikizu kinini kiri inyuma ye ariko siho nihishe nihishe kuri uwo .
up to when i survived , honestly that is what happened , what i want to explain is that on the 7th ||| kugeza rero ubwo npakiraiye mubyukuri nuko bigenze icyo njyaaga kusobanura nuko le 07 .
the 12th .... i was surprised at 10 that you are going to be killed ||| itariki makumyabiri nebyiri ......... mbese nratunguwe saa yine ngo urapfa saa tanu kandi ni wowe uri bupfae .
they attacked at another time but no one in the area was killed ||| icyo kihae baraje batera isahinda ariko nta muntu baishe muri quartier .
i think if they had seen me they would have killed even if they had seen karipoforo they would have killed him ||| ngirango iyo banbona bari kunyica niyo babona karipoforo bari kumwica .
that what they had planned on the 22nd of february , after that date was a whole different story ||| nicyo bari bagambairiye uwo ku itariki 22/02 nyuma yizo tariki byo biri ibindi rero .
they did not discriminate they killed in row , that all i wanted to add ||| ntabwo barobanuraaga baricaaga k' umurongo nibyo nshakaaga kaongeraho kusa .
for the methodists and when night fell they threw a grenade in it ||| rw' abametodiste bigeze nijoro bateramo grenade .
people died in it while i was lying in the corridor and he told me to sit in the corridor with my legs straight ||| abantu bapfairmo nrambaije muri korodoro aranbwira ati wicare muri korodoro urambye .
and i sat and he came and told me that where you refused to go , you were right they are killing people there ||| nraicara ndarambya araza aranbwira ati hahanri unzae kujya ufite ukuri barimo barahaicira abantu .
that 's all i wanted , to add on the testimony concerning the date 22nd ||| nibyo nshakaaga kusa kaongera kubuhamya bwerekeranye n' itariki makumyabiri nebyiri .
and the 7th only of april of 1994 ||| n' itariki indwi yonyine y' ukuakaane muw' igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na kane .
i would like you to repeat what happened on the 22nd ||| nagirango usubiramo usubiramo ibyo ku itariki makumyabiri n' ebyiri .
there is a point where you said "@ at first you wanted to flee to kayije 's but it was far ||| hari aho mwavuze muti ubwambere nshatse kuhungira kwa kayije ariko nbona ari kure .
and i went to mucyo 's @" and you added "@ i was neighbours with a man called twagiramungu ||| nuko nerekeza kwa mucyo wongeraho uti nri nturanye n' umugabo twagiramungu .
what made you do this ? ||| ese nimpamvu ki zabikuteye ?
listen , he was with mugezi so do you think i could seek refuge from a man who was with mugenzi knowing that we did not agree ||| umva yari kumwe na mugenzi none se uraumva nri kuhungira k' umuntu uri kumwe na mugenzi nziko mugenzi tutakivuga rumwe .
did not trust him because he was amongst .... people with whom we did not agree ||| nuko nta kaizerae narimufitiye kuko nrinziko ari muri ..... tutavuga rumwe .
that 's not all , even the time of bucyana they destroyed my house ||| kandi rero sicyo kusa n' igihe cya bucyaan baza kunsenyair .
during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected ||| igihe cya bucyaan turi tufite amarembo afatanyae .
during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected ||| baza kuntera irye yararifunze ntinmenya n' impamvu .
i wondered could n't it be that when they come to kill the do not mistake his place for mine ||| umva nribajije nti ese none si ukugirango abazaza kunyica batazayobera iwe .
that 's what i thought ||| niko ntekereje .
on the 7th , i was at ..... it 's like we were watching them , it was the 7th of april 1994 ||| itariki indwi ibyo byo nri ndi kwa cyo ubanza twabacunze ntaho mbese n' itariki ya karindwi z' ukuakaane muri mirongo icyenda na kane .
it was around 1 o'clock because honourable mucyo had people keeping watch ||| hari mu ma saa saba wa mukani kuko nyakaubahaw mucyo yari afite abantu bacunga .
because when i called him that i 'm coming to seek refuge at your place and he told that "@ do n't come forward @" ||| kuko muterefonnye nti ngiye kuhungira iwawe yaranbwiye ati ntucae inberae .
that there are people watching ||| ati hari abantu bari gucunga noneho impamvu kutwika bari baziko ngo tukiri mu mazu .
because they watched us they thought we had n't gone anywhere and were still in our houses . ||| kuko baducungaga ngo bari baziko ntaho tugiye turi mu mazu kuko baducungaga .
the day before yesterday is when i came to know this when i went to kigarama to testify . ||| ejobundi niho nbimenye ngiye mukigarama mukutangayo ubuhamya .
in the gacaca court of kagarama i found out that twagiramungu who was my colleague who was my neighbour ||| muri gacaca ya kigarama niho nmenyeko twagiramungu barinaba mugenzi wanjye tuturanye .
burnt my house because they thought that i was in the ceiling but i did not know that up that day . ||| ngo bantwikiye ngo baziko ndi muri prafo nge nri ntarabimenya kugeza uwo munsi .
yes we shall call you so that give a detailed testimony . ||| yeeeeeeee tuzabahamagara kugirango mutangae ubuhamya burambuye .
testimonies related to the crime of rape are not given in public . ||| hari icyaha kijyanye no gusambanya ubuhamya bwacyo ntibukiraw kumugaragaro .
any witness ... ||| umuntu wese ufite ubuhamya
let 's try to restore the society . ||| tugeragezae kusubiza umuryango ku murongo
this restores rwandan society in some way . ||| bigerageza kaongera kaubaka umurango nyarwanda
in order to achieve this , gacaca courts have been established as a strategy . ||| hafashwaeho ingamba nk' inkiko gacaca
in gacaca courts each and every rwandan is required to tell the truth ||| inkiko gacaca aho umunyarwanda wese asabaw kuvugaish ukuri
about the genocide , what he saw , his own contribution and what he has heard of it ||| kuri genocide yabaye kubyo yabonye , uruhare rwe ibyo yumvise
investigating on its implementation , perpetrators , ||| tumenya uko yakozwe , tumenya abayigizemo uruhare
as well as its damages , so that this may serve as a foundation ||| tumenya ibiangiritse ibiangaijew , noneho bikatuha intambwe
and then give us courage to really restore the society ||| noneho bikatuha imbaraga zo kaongera kusaan umuryango .
in reconciling rwandans , the tripartite people ||| tuunga abanyarwanda ya nbaga y' inyabutatu y' abanyarwanda
so that they may live in good relations again , so that they may live together again being aware of what had broken them up . ||| ikaongera kubaan neza , ikaongera kubaan izi ibyayihekuye .
it is within this context that we always gather here all ||| ni muri iyo gahunda ya buri munsi tuteranair hano tweseuko tuhari
in order to remind each other what happened all over rwanda ||| kugirango tuongerae twibukiranye ibyabaye , bibaye mu rwanda hose
especially in rugenge sector . ||| ariko specifical tunongerae kuibuka ibyabaye mu murengae wa rugengae
during the genocide , rwandans often went to hide in places where they used to go to pray god ||| aho abanyarwanda bajyaaga basanga imaan niho bagiye bahungira mu bihae bya genocide .
thinking they would find the very god who used to help them . however it was not the case ; most of time they were killed there . ||| baziko basangayo ya mana yajyaaga ibafasha siko bibaye ahenshi bicaiyewmo
those places are catholic churches and others . ||| muri izo nsengero mu za kiriziya n' ahandi
particularly , many people died in sainte famille . ||| muri st famille by' umwihariko haguye abantu benshi cyane
as you will be realizing , it remains even unknown to some that people who died in the church . ||| nkuko muza kubikurikirana , nkuko abandi batanabizi , hari abaguye murusengair
they had come to hide ; others joined them and went to the church courtyard . ||| bari baje baruhungiyemo hari abandi baje babasanga bajya ku kibuga
some who went out were killed and others were thrown grenades at . ||| kizengurutse urusengero absohokaga baicwa abandi bateraw amagrenade
some were picked one after another and killed . i hope by today we will listen to ||| abandi bakurawmo bakaicwa ngirango rero uyu munsi turaza kukurikiraan

as it has been demonstrated ; major general munyakazi , in the time , i think ||| nkuko bayagaragaye ko generale majoro munyakazi ngirango icyo kihae yari
he was still major ; was in charge of the gendarmerie at sainte @-@ famille . rutabana in question ||| akiri majoro yayoboraaga abajandarume bari kuri st famille , uwo rutabana
is one of the people who escaped fights at gisozi . he and his colleagues came ||| n' umwe mu baturagae baambutse imirwano ku gisozi we nabagenzi be rero baraje
and formed a fighter group at sainte @-@ famille . they had guns . of course they were not trained . ||| bashinga umutwe wabo kuri st famille bafite imbunda uraumva n' abaturage
to explain to us his relationship with rutabana , how the two groups ||| atusobanuraire imikoranire ye na rutabana , uburyo iyo mitwe yombi
were established at sainte @-@ famille , how people were killed . ||| yari kuri st famille kandi abantu baicwaaga umunsi
that is the reason why we have called him as a witness . ||| icyo nicyo tushakaaga tumuhamagaye nk' umuntu uje kutanga ubuhamya
we have not called him for trial . ||| muri urwo rubanza ntago tumuhamagaye nk' umuntu uje kuburana
unfortunately , he received the invitation belatedly whereas he himself had asked ||| kubera ko ubutumire twabwohereje bukagerayo butinze we akaza kuisabair ko
to share with us some experiences at the level of nyarugenge district . now , we may go over to him . ||| hari ubuhamya ashobora kutanga mu rwego rw' akarere ka nyarugengae nraumva
in case he is needed somewhere else such as in cells , such institutions will invite him ||| tumuha ijambo kusa wenda abandi bazamukenera mutukari nabo bazamutumira
on their own . ||| ku giti cyabo ,
without delaying , we go over to him . ||| tutatinze rero nraumva tumuha ijambo akagira icyo atubwira
the floor is his . he should start by what he did . ||| n' amatwi ye tumuhaye umwanye rero atubanzirizae kubyo yakoze .

from 1959 , the government favored killers of tutsis . in other words , it enthroned impunity toward any who kills a tutsi in rwanda . ||| yahaye abaishe batutsi kuturuka mu 19959 n' ukuvuga ko yimakaje umuco wo kutahana umuntu wishe umututsi mu rwanda ,
the government of rwanda and mrnd , the then leading party , refused the repatriation of refugees . ||| leta y' urwanda gouvernement y' urwanda na mrnd ishyaka rya leta banzae ko impunzi zitaahuka ..

the government of rwanda in power since 1st 1990 till december 1991 ||| gouvernement yo ku itariki hari gouvernement yagiyeho yari iriho kuva ku itariki ya mbere 1990 kugeza mu kwezi kwa cumi na kabiri 1991 .
had major general habyarimana juvenal as the president of the republic and ministers from mrnd as it had been for many successive governments by the way . ||| president wa repuburika generale majoro habyarimana gouvernement z' urwanda zagiyeho zariho ba minister ba mrnd ,
the genocide of tutsis started on october 1st 1990 . ||| genocide y' abatutsi yatangiye itariki ya mbere z' ukwacumi 1990 .
the extermination of tutsis started being put into practice on october 1st 1990 ||| umugambi wo kurimbura abatutsi muri 1990 ku itaraiki ya mbere z' ukwezi kwa cumi 1990 nibwo iyo gahunda yo kurimbura abatutsi yatangiye kushyiraw mu bikorwa .
the government of rwanda and mrnd , the then leading party , started killing tutsis in rwanda because every rwandan and all leaders at all levels adhered to mrnd hence had to execute the orders from the mrnd central committee and its president . ||| leta y' urwanda na mrnd ishyaka rya leta batangiye ubwicanyi bw' abatutsi mu rwanda kuko umuturage wese yari muri mrnd abayobozi bose mu nzego zose bari muri mrnd kandi bubahairizaaga amabwiriza ya commite centrale ya mrnd na president wayo .
on october 1st 1990 , the strategy of bringing fake accusations against tutsis started being used by the government of rwanda and mrnd who faked the charge of betrayal against tutsis so that hutus might exterminate them in very short time under pretext that tutsis who were in rwanda collaborated with inyenzi hence had to be arrested and killed . ||| ku itariki ya mbere y' ukwezi kwa cumi 1990 , iyo methode yo kubeshyera abatutsi yarakoreshaijew na leta y' urwanda , gouvernement y' urwanda , mrnd bahimba ibinyoma babeshyera abatutsi kugirango abhutu bicae abatutsi mu kihae gito yane babeshyeye abatutsi bo mu rwanda ko ari ibyitso by' inyenzi bigomba kupfa nk' umwanzi uteye urwanda kugirango bafatawe baicwae .
tutsis were wrongfully accused of keeping guns and bullets to kill hutus all over rwanda . ||| babeshyeye batutsi ko bafite imbunda n' amasasu byo kuica abahutu mu rwanda hose ,
they were wrongfully accused of keeping inyenzi 's guns and bullets and having transmitting and receiving sets to communicate with inyenzi . ||| babeshyeye abatutsi ko bafite stocs z' imbunda n' amasasu by' inyenzi kugirango bafatawe kandi baicwae , bafite za radion , emetteur , recepteur ,
all this intended to arresting and killing them . it was said that , in their murderous operations , tutsis had identity cards model iv drawn and printed in sisi evariste 's printing house ||| bavuganairagaho n' inyenzi muri za operation zo kuica abatutsi bafite indangamuntu model ya kane zakorewe kwa sis evariste muri imprimerie .
so that inyenzi might kill hutus who had identity cards model iii . ||| ngo inyenzi zizabonae uko zizaica abahutu barai bafite irangamuntu yari yanditseho model ya gatatu ,
tutsis were also wrongfully accused of having dug graves in their houses in which to bury hutus after killing them . ||| babeshye abatutsi ko mu ngo zabo hari imyobo bacukuye bazatabamo abahutu bamaze kubica .
the government of rwanda headed by habyarimana lied to rwandans and foreign countries that the rwandan army had just beaten inyenzi and their accomplices having invaded kigali and that the invaders had been caught with their guns and many bullets as well as transmitting and receiving sets . ||| leta y' urwanda gouvernement y' urwanda biri biyobowe na habyarimana , yabeshye abanyarwanda n' amahanga , n' abanyamahamga ko ingabo z' urwanda zatsinze inyenzi n' ibyitso byazo zateye mu mujyi wa kigali ko bafatanyawe imbunda n' amasasu menshi na za radion emeteur recepteur ,

in kigali , the arrested people were taken to nyamirambo stadium and had to be killed in the shortest future because they had been called the enemies of the whole country . ||| mu mujyi wa kigali abantu bafashwae bajyanywe muri stade inyamirambo , bagombaaga kupfa mu kihae cya vuba vuba kuko bari baiswe abanzi b' igihugu ,

in october 1990 , colonel rwagafirita who was a member of mrnd central committee and gendarmerie deputy chief staff always said that all tutsis living in rwanda had to be killed because they were the enemies of the country and accomplices of inyenzi . ||| muri octobre 1990 colonel rwagafirita uri menbre wa commite centrale ya mrnd akaba na chef d' etat major adjoint wa gendarmerie , buri kihae yavugaaga ko abatutsi bari mu rwanda bose bagomba kupfa kuko ari abanzi b' igihugu bari hamwe n' inyeznzi .
according to them , all tutsis had to be arrested and killed in the shortest future without any trial . he always said that and it was realized that he told it french confirming that tutsis were in small number , that they would easily be killed . ||| kuribo abatutsi bose bagomabaga kufataw bakaicwa mu kihae cya vuba nta rubanza ibyo yarabivugaaga buri kihae kandi biragagaye ko yabibwiraaga n' abafaransa avuga ko abatutsi ari bake ko bazabica ,
he said it in the parliamentary report submitted to general jean valle who was in charge of the french military commission . ||| ibyo yabibwiye muri rapport ya commission parlementaire generale jean valle w' umufaransa uyoboraaga commission militaire y' abafaransa .
he [ general jean valle ] also told the commission that he had known this from rwagafirita himself . ||| yabibwiye commission avuga yuko colonel rwagafirita yabimwibwiriye .
in october 1990 , colonel serubuga who was a member of the central committee and rwandan army chief staff said that he had just found the alibi to kill all tutsis on october 1st all over rwanda . ||| mu kwezi kwa cumi 1990 ,
he always said that , confirming that tutsis were the enemies of the country . ||| colonel serubuga uri menbre du commite centrale akaba na chef d' etat major aggee w' arme rwandaise yavuze ko abonye uburyo ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwezi kwa cumi bwo kuica abatutsi bose mu rwanda ibyo yarabivugaaga buri kihae ko abatutsi ari abanzi b' urwanda ayo magambo yayabwiraaga n' abafaransa ,
he even said it to french in his own words that tutsis would all die . ||| ko abatutsi bazapfa bose .
it is clearly stated in the parliamentary commission report that the then ambassador to rwanda said that he had been told those words by colonel serubuga . ||| muri rapport ya commission parlementaire ambasaderi uri mu rwanda yavuze ko ibyo bintu colonel serubuga yabimubwiye ,
clearly both colonel serubuga and colonel rwagafirita who commanded the army and gendarmerie headquarters had already told french that tutsis would be killed . ||| nkuko rero bigaragara ari colonel serubuga , ari na colonel rwagafirita bategekaaga icyo kihae etat major y' arme na etat major ya gendarmerie bari bayibwiye abafaransa ko abatutsi bazaicwa .
even in october 1990 the then defense attache colonel rene darny wrote in his report that seven hundred thousand tutsis would die in rwanda in such a way that the issue was raised in the french parliamentary report . ||| ku buryo mu kwezi kwa cumi 1990 , uwari attache de defense colonel rene darniyatanze rapport avuga yuko hazapfa abatutsi mu rwanda ibihumbi maganarindwi abishyira muri rapport ye kuburyo bivuzawe muri rapport parlementaire y' abafaransa .
the reason why people were not exterminated in 1990 as it had been planned is that other countries and embassies put pressure on habyarimana and obliged him to release people showing that they were innocent . ||| icyatumye abantu batapfa 1990 ngo abantu barimburawe nkuko biri byateguwe amahanga za amabassade zari ziri hano mu rwanda zatangiye kushyira pression kuri president habyarimana ngo afungurae abantu bose kuko baerekanye yuko yari yabafataiye ubusa .
when they went to gikondo police station , they realized that the guns , transmitting and receiving sets were just a story invented to put fake accusations on tutsis . ||| bagiye kuri brigade ya gikondo basanga ziriya mbunda na za emmetteur recepteur z' amaradio ari ibintu by' inkinamico yakinnyae byo kubeshyera abatutsi .
that is why i wanted to deeply explain this problem in order to make you understand well . ||| niyo mpamvu munbabarirae , nshatse kugirango iki kibazo nkibasobanuraire mukimenye .
during all this time , that government carried out genocide of tutsis . ||| muri icyo kihae iriya gouvernement yakoze genocide y' abatutsi .
it carried out the genocide of tutsis in october 1990 in mutara and byumba . it carried out the genocide of tutsis in january 1991 in kibirira , gisenyi and the genocide of bagogwe in january 1991 in ruhengeri and gisenyi . ||| yakoze genocide y' abatutsi mu kwezi kwa cumi 1990 mu mutara muri , byumba yakoze genocide y' abatutsi mu kwezi kwa mbere1991 muri kibirira ku gisenyi , habayeho genocide y' abagogwe muri janvier 1991 mur ruhengeri na gisenyi .
other countries started denouncing those killings by the government of rwanda . ||| amahanga yatangiye kwa magana buriya bwicanyi bukorwaaga na leta y' urwanda ariko leta y' urwanda gouvernement y' urwanda mrnd banzae amasezerano ya serre yashyizweho umukono ku itariki ya makumyabiri n' icyenda z' ukwezi kwa gatatu 1991 ,
however , the government of rwanda and mrnd refused the agreement of nsele signed on march 29th 1991 and kept planning the extermination of tutsis in rwanda . ||| ahubwo bagumya kutegura umugambi wo kurimbura abatutsi mu rwanda .
from october rpf had always denounced that genocide of tutsis carried out by the government of rwanda and headed by mrnd for successive terms . ||| kuturuka mu kwezi kwa cumi rero fpr yamaganye buri kihae iriya genocide y' abatutsi yakorwaaga na gouvernemeny y' urwanda na ziriya gouvernement za mrnd ,

the president of the republic was major general habyarimana , the prime minister was nsanzimana and ministers were mrnd members . ||| president wa repuburika yari generale major habyarimana , gouvernement y' urwanda yari iyobowe na premier ministiri nsanzimana abaministiri bari abo muri mrnd ,
the prime minister was from pdc . ||| na ministiri yari uwo muri pdc .

strategies used to exterminate tutsis include blacklisting them in order to kill them . here is the problem you usually encounter probably . ||| methode bakoresheje ; methodes na strategies bakoresheje kugirango barimburae abatutsi , hari ukukora amalisti y' abatutsi bagombaaga kuicwa ,
i am going to tell you all of that because i have come here for that . ||| kuko ibyo mukunda kuhura nabyo ibyo byose ngiye kubibabwira nicyo kinzanye hano .
blacklisting tutsis and bringing fake accusations against them so that they get killed by hutus , publication of ten commandments of hutus so to make the latter hate and then kill tutsis , convincing hutus at all levels that any tutsi living in rwanda or in exile is an enemy that needs killing , setting barriers in all paths even in cells all over rwanda so to hunt every tutsi and prevent him from escaping , searching houses in order to find where tutsis might be hiding so kill them , ||| kukora amalisti y' abatutsi no kuhimba ibinyoma ngo abtutsi baicwae n' abahutu , kuemera kutangaza amategeko icumi y' abahutu kugirango banjye abatutsi kandi batangirae kuica abatutsi , kuerekana kuereka abhutu mu nzego zose ko umututsi uri mu rwanda no hanze y' urwanda aho yahungiye ari umwanzi ugomba kupfa , kushyiraho sytem yo kushakisha umututsi ngo atabacika bashyira za bariyeri mu mayira yose ari muri cellule mu rwanda no gusaka mu ngo no mu yanri mazu bashakisha aho umututsi yihishe ngo bamwice .
giving out guns in the population of all communes all over rwanda which guns were to be used in order to exterminate tutsis , establishing militias interahamwe of mrnd and impuzamugambi of cdr intended to kill tutsis on the barriers and where they might be hiding , training interahamwe and impuzamugambi in order to invade houses of religious people of the catholic church , churches and schools where tutsis might have gone for escape so kill them in a very short time . ||| kutanga imbunda mu baturagae muri za komini zose zo mu rwanda izo mbunda zigamije kurimbura abatutsi , kushyiraho za milices mrnd interahamwe , na cdr impuzamugambi zo kurimbura abatutsi kuri za bariyeri naho bihishe , kuigisha interahamwe n' impuzamugambi kutera ibigo bibihaye imaan za kiriziya . amasengero amashuri , abatutsi bahunze bihishemo ngo babicae bose mu kihae gito .
convincing hutus that they are above tutsis and that killing the latter , raping tutsi women , burning their houses , seizing their property shall not be punished in rwanda . blacklisting tutsis was a strategy that started being used since 1961 and 1973 by mdr parmehutu . ||| kukangurair abahutu ko bari hejuru y' abatutsi , ko kuica abatutsi , kufata abatutsikazi ku ngufu , kutwika amazu yabo , kutwara imitungo yabo , kuangiza imitungo yabo ntawe ubihanairw muri leta y' urwanda , kukora amalisti y' abatutsi bitangiye ari methode yakoreshaijew kuturuka mu 1961 , 1973 , iyo methode ikoreshaijew na mdr parmehutu .
the method was also used by mrnd chaired by habyarimana juvenal on october 1st 1990 . the president 's office had an intelligence department that kept the lists of tutsis to be caught and killed at once because inyenzi had invaded rwanda . ||| munyakazi iyo methode yakoreshaijew na none na mrnd yari iyobowe habyarimana juvenal ku itariki ya 01.101990 presidence ya repuburika yari ifite service de l' enseignement yari ifite ayo malisti y' abatutsi bagombaaga kuhita bafataw bakaicwa kuko inyenzi zari zateye urwanda .
i think i have already told you that on october 1st 1990 , the government of rwanda used the strategy of charging tutsis of fake accusations in order to abuse their reputation . ||| munyakazi kubeshyera abatutsi no kuhimba ibinyoma ngo abatutsi baicwae n' abahutu , ngirango mu byo nbabwiye nbabwiye ukuntu ku itariki ya mbere .10.1990 leta y' urwanda na none a gouvernement y' urwanda bakoresheje iriya methode na strategies kugirango bahimbaire abatutsi ibinyoma ,
i will repeat it because the very accusations took four years . ||| ngiye kaongera kubisubiramo kuko ibyo binyoma birakomeje muri kiriya kihae cy' imyaka ine .
no , people are making noise . you may tell them to keep quiet ! ||| oya nuko barimo barasakuza mwababwira bakaceceka
please hold on ! hold on please ! ||| tuumvikanae ,
remember the instructions we have already read . ||| tuumvikanae mumenye ko tusomye amabwiriza tugendairho ,
let him finish . ||| murekae abanzae arangizae .
on september 21st 1992 , chief staff nsabimaana told soldiers in the army that every tutsi living in rwanda was an enemy . ||| ku itariki ya makumyabiri na rimwe , y' ukwezi kwa cyenda 1992 , chef d' etat major nsabimana yabwiye abasirikare bose bo muri arme rwandaise ko umututsi uri mu rwanda no hanze y' urwanda ari umwanzi .
this ideology had already existed since 1963 and had just been put into writing by the army staff . ||| iyo ideologie yari isanzweho kuva mu 1963 , uretse ko etat major yayishyize mu nyanriko ,
political parties such as mrnd , cdr , mdr power , and pl power with their lists had convinced their members that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed . ||| amashyaka mrnd , cdr , mdr pawer pl pawer n' amalisti yabo baigishije abayoboke babo ko umututsi uri mu rwanda no hanze yarwo ari umwanzi ugomba kupfa ,
in order to locate the enemy and prevent him from escaping , barriers were set in all paths in cells of rwanda . ||| kushyiraho system no kushakisha umwanzi ngo atabacika bashyiraho za bariyeri mu mayira yose ari mu macellule mu rwanda no gusaka mungo ,
houses and bushes were also searched to se where a tutsi might be hiding and kill him . ||| no mu bihuru bashakisha aho umututsi yishishe ngo bamwice .
this method was used since april 6th 1994 till july 4th 1994 and cost many lives of tutsis in rwanda ||| iyo methode bayikoresheje kuva kuva ku itariki ya gatandatu mu kwezi kwa kane 1994 kugeza 04.07.1994 iyo methode rero yatumye hapfa abatutsi benshi mu rwanda .
because the population in cells was ordered to settle on the barriers , be on patrol all nights looking for a tutsi in order to kill him . ||| kuko bategetsi abaturage bo muri cellule kujya kuri izo bariyeri , kukora amarondo mu ijoro ryose bashakisha umututsi ngo bamwice ,
this method was called self and common defense . this was just fancying other countries so that they might not denounce it but the method was actually intended to exterminating tutsis in rwanda since it had been put that a tutsi is an enemy to be killed . ||| iyo methode bayise auto defense et commune bajijisha kugirango amahanga atabamagana ariko iyo methode yari ikabije kurimbura abatutsi mu rwanda kubera yuko bari bavuze ko umututsi ari umwanzi ugomba kupfa .
guns had also been given out since october 1st 1990 . the guns intended to exterminate tutsis . ||| imbunda nazo zaratanzwe kuva ku itariki ya mbere mu kwezi kwa cumi 1990 zigamije kurimbura abatutsi ,
the establishment of mrnd and cdr militias was illegal as far as rwandan law was concerned . ||| za milices zashyizweho za mrnd na cdr kandi biri binyuranyije n' amategeko yo mu rwanda ,
interahamwe and impuzamugambi were also trained . from 1959 , tutsis had been escaping to houses of religious people , churches and schools of the catholic church and could survive ||| baigishije interahamwe n' impuzamugambi kuturuka 1959 abatutsi bahungiraaga mu bigo by' abihayimana kiriziya , gatorika amasengero , amashuri bararokokaaga .
because the population feared to kill tutsis in those houses . ||| kuko abaturage batinyag kuica abatutsi muri ibyo bigo ,
mrnd and cdr trained interahamwe and impuzamugambi to attack those houses , churches and schools of the catholic church and kill in very short time the tutsis in . ||| mrnd , cdr , baigishije interahamwe n' impuzamugambi kujya mu bigo by' abihayimana za kiriziya gatorika mu masengero mu mashuri bakica mu kihae gito abatutsi bose barimo .
now here is what i saw at goma when i was exiling with far people though people may say that is not necessary , i am afraid ... ||| kubierekeye ibyo nbonye kuri goma kuko nambuka nye na far icyo kihae nuko nimbivuga wenda abantu baravuga ngo si ngombaw .

as far as the killings of tutsis from october 1st 1990 to december 31st 1994 are concerned , the reaction was that all reports showed that those killings were carried out by the government of rwanda together with far , authorities at all levels as well as a big number of the population . ||| gouvernement y' urwanda na far n' abayobozi bo mu nzego zose n' abaturage benshi .

munyakazi munyakazi i drew a report saying that there was no gun found , illegally possessed by a single tutsi because there were tutsis who possessed guns that they had been given by the government ||| munyakazi munyakazi nkoze rapport ko nta mbunda n' amasasu bibonetse byasanganywe umututsi mu buryo butemewe n' amategeko kuko hari abatutsi bari bafite imbunda bari barahawe na leta y' urwanda ,
i reported that no gun stores , bullets , transmitting and receiving sets were found in tutsis ' houses . i also went to gikondo police station . i found out that the guns showed to be taken from tutsis were worn and greased . ||| ko nta stock z' imbunda , n' amasasu byasanganywe abatutsi ko nta radio n' imwe yasanganywe umututsi , ngiye no kuri brigade ya gikondo nsanze imbunda baerekanye ko ziri kuri brigade ya gikondo ,
they were kept in small stores of the rwandan army . we asked gendarmes who were around . they told us that the guns had been brought by gd soldiers commanded by lieutenant @-@ colonel nsengiyumva . we met there some agents from embassies who had come to see the guns ||| izo mbunda zari zishaje zirimo amavuta zari zibitswe mu du stock zibitse mu mangazini y' arme rwandaise tubajije abajandarume bari baraho batubwira ko zizanywae n' abasirikare ba gd yayoborawaga na lieutenant colonel nsengiyumva icyo kihae tuhahuraiye n' abakozi bamwe bo muri z' ambassade bari baje kureba izo mbunda .
i handed it in to habyarimana 's regime ||| nyishyikairije leta ya habyarimana
is it before the war ? ||| ni mbere ?
yes , before ! i told you that it was on 4th and 6th . ||| ni mbere nkubwiye ko ari ku itariki ya kabiri no ku itariki ya gatandatu ,
that is the time when we met agents from embassies , which started putting pressure on habyarimana saying he was bringing fake accusations against tutsis in order to have the alibi to kill them . ||| akaba ariho tutangiye na z' embassader turahahurair batangira kushyira kuri pression habyarimana ko arimo kuhimbair abatutsi kugirango abonae impamvu yo kubica .
i do n't know whether you are through so that we may ask you another question ! ||| ntinzi niba uri urangije ngo tukubaze ikindi ?
not yet . i 'm still developing what you have asked me about .... ||| nracyakomeza kubyo unbwiye ko

did you do anything ? ||| hari ibyo ukoze ?
on april 6th 1994 i was the commander of muhima military camp and kigali mobile group commander . the mobile group was a unity of the national gendarmerie in charge of protecting radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef . ||| ku itariki ya gatandatu , y' ukwezi kwa kane 1994 , icyo kihae nri commanda camp muhaima , nkaba na commanda wa groupe mobile , hano muri kigali groupe mobile yari unity ya gendarmerie nationale yari ishinzwe kurinda radio rwanda , television y' urwanda , rwandatel , banque nationale , na minadef .

what i did as the mobile group commander is to give the order to gendarmes to protect radio rwanda , rwanda television , rwandatel , the national bank , and minadef as well as the population and religious people who were in saint @-@ michel cathedral . ||| banque nationale , na rwandatel kurinda abaturage , abihay' imaan , bari muri cathedrale st michel .

now we want to know ; what was your role in all that ? you have absolutely said you did not do anything wrong . would you explain to us ? ||| ni inshingano abajandarume uyoboraaga bari bafite noneho turagirango utubwirae uruhare rwawe ni uruhe muri ibyo bintu uretsemba uti ntabyo nkoze unatusobanuraire .

i protected religious people and all others who came there . ||| abihayimana bose bari muri cathedrale st michel n' abandi bose bahaje bose barabarinze ,
displaced people who were at gisimba 's were taken from nyamirambo to saint @-@ michel cathedral because it was known that it was protected by gendarmes under the command of lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . ||| impunzi zo kwa gisimba bazivanye inyamirambo bazizana muri cathedrale st michel kuko bari baziko harinzawe n' abajandarume bayoboraw na lieutenant colonel munyakazi
let him talk so to explain what we will ask him . ||| murekae atubwirae murekae atubwirae kugirango tusobanukirwae nibyo tuza kumubaza ,

i now go to something else ; as the commander of muhima military camp . ||| havae nkomezae noneho nvugae ibindi , nka commanda camp muhaima ,
at one time , nyarugenge territory company came to settle next to muhima military camp . it used to stay in the police 's place today . ||| haje compagnie yi teritoriale ya nyarugengae yari iruhande rwa camp muhaima aho ikorera hariya hari police ,
though nyarugenge territory company belonged to kigali formation , i gave them orders . ||| nyihaye amategeko yo kujya kurinda impunzi iyo compagnie territoriale nyarugengae yari ira groupement kigali , iyo compagnie territoriale yari iya compagnie kigali ariko nyihaye amategeko ,
i ordered captain nyiribambe to go and protect the people who were in hotel de mille collines , in sainte @-@ famille church , in saint @-@ michel cathedral , i beg your pardon ! ||| amategekonahaye capitaine nyiribambae yo kujya kurinda abaturage bari kuri hotel mille colline , eglise st famille ,
it is rather saint @-@ paul centre and lycee notre dame de citeaux . ||| cathedrale st michel pardon centre st paul na lyce notre dame de citeaux .
the gendarmes of the company protected hotel de milles collines . they were with lieutenant @-@ colonel mwangi of minuar . ||| kuri hotel mille colline abajandarume biyo compagnie territoriale barayirinze bari hamwe na lieutenant colonel mwangi wo muri minuar .
on june 27th , the army staff command displaced people who were ... those who had stayed were displaced pretending that other activities were to be established there . ||| ku itariki ya makumyabiri na karindwi z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu ,
it was said french would come to settle in kigali . ||| etat major d' arme yakuye abantu bari .................. yabakuyemo abari basigaye baitwa ko bagiye kushyiramo ibindi bikorwa kuko bavugaaga ngo abafaransa bagiye kuza hano muri za kigali ,
in that time , the territory company had no responsibilities because the hotel had just been seized by rwanda army staff command ||| icyo kihae nta responsabilite iyo compagnie territoriale yari ikifite kuri iriya hotel kuko yari yamaze kufataw na etat major y' arme rwandaise .
on the 10th , hotel de milles collines was repeatedly attacked by interahamwe militias because it sheltered people called rpf accomplices . ||| ku itariki ya cumi hotel mille colline yatewe inshuro nyinshi n' interamwe , kuko yari irimo abantu baitaaga ngo n' ibyitso bya fpr ,
however , the gendarmes of the company together with the mobile group who were at hotel de milles collines , as i told you , fought against interahamwe ||| ariko abajandarume biyo compagnie bari kuri hotel mille collines na bajandarume ba groupe mobile bari kuri izo position nbabwiye barwanyaije interahamwe .
on june 17th 1994 , the interahamwe militias came in a very big number and succeeded to enter the hotel . they broke doors and started getting people down in order to kill them . ||| ku itariki ya cumin a karindwi y' ukwezi kw agatandatu 1994 , interahamwe zaje ari nyinshi cyane zishobora kuinjira muri hotel mille collines zisatura inzugi zitangira kumanura abantu ngo zijyae kubica ,
i was called and i went there . i found two families that had just been taken to the reception desk to be killed . ||| barampamagaye , ntahurura nsanga hari imiryango ibiri n' abana babo bari bagejeje kuri reception bagiye kubica ,
i may even tell you the families so that you may ask them yourself . ||| ngirango niyo miryango nyikubwira kugirango uzabibarize .
there was the family of murindangabo embroise and one of habiyakare . they all saw that i was coming for their help ||| hari umuryango wa murindangabo embroise , hari umuryango habiyakare bose bari bari aho nagho babonye ko nje kubatabara .
when i was at hotel de milles collines on 17th , there was father uwimana the priest of saint @-@ andre parish who had escaped to saint @-@ paul center but went to hotel de milles collines after . ||| icyo kihae ndi kuri hotel mille collines ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi hari harimo padiri uwimana utegekaaga st andre ahungira muri centre st paul nyuma aza kujya muri hotel mille collines ,
he saw me at the hotel ; i even gave orders to go for help to people who were at saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille and chase interahamwe who were going there to kill them . ||| yabonye ndi kuri hotel mille collines nnatanze n' amabwiriza kugirango batabarae bairukanae interahamwe zari zigiye kujya muri centre st paul et st famille kujya kuica abantu bari barimo .
father uwimana told me @: "@ i can see that you still have a human heart to help people . i want to beg you one thing ; i want you to go for help to people who are at saint @-@ paul center who are going to get killed by interahamwe . they are at father vermerie 's @"@ . they were sitting down in the caves at bishop vermerie 's . ||| padiri uwimana yaranbwiye ati nrabona ukifite umutima muntu wo kutabara abantu ndagirango nkusabae ujyae muri centre st paul kutabara abantu interahamwe zigiye kuica bari kwa padiri vermerie bari baicaye muri za cave zo kwa musenyeri vermerie .
he had been with the people in saint @-@ paul all the day , refused to be taken with others and went to bring fake accusations against me in the church saying that i was going to kill those i had taken with me . ||| uwo munsi yari yirirwanye n' abantu bo muri centre st paul arahunga yanga ko mutwara ajya mu kiriziya kunbeshyera ngo abo ntwaye ngiye kubica ,
all those people are still alive . investigations have proven that . they are all alive . ||| abo bantu bariho kandi hakozwe z' enquete abo bantu bariho bose .
because i was at saint @-@ michel cathedral , on 18th and 19th i was asked by priests to take saint @-@ vincent and assumption sisters as well as religious brothers who were in procure and bring them to saint @-@ michel cathedral so that they might stay together . ||| ku itariki ya cumi n' umunani ku itariki ya cumi n' icyenda , baransabye bati ndi kuri cathedrale st michel bansabye yuko abapadiri yuko tufata ababikira ba vincent bariya , abasomusiyo ababikira bari bari muri procule n' abafuraire bose ngo nbajyanae muri cathedrale st michel bose babae hamwe .
i took all of them to the cathedral . nothing bad happened to them . they are all alive , invite them ; they will tell you . i did not harm them . ||| bose nrabatwaye nbageza muri cathedrale st michel bose ntacyo babaye bariho nabo mwazabahamagara baka bibabwira ko nbatwaye .
meanwhile , the gendarmes i had transferred to saint @-@ paul center and sainte @-@ famille had another duty given to them . ||| kuva ku itariki noneho abajandarume nsize kuri centre st paul no kuri eglise st famille hari akandi kazi nbahaye ,
it had not been evoked but we have to evoke it for the moment . displaced people comprised two parts @: there were displaced people who were for the government outside the church , to the primary school and to joc . ||| nubwo abantu batakavuze tugomba kukavuga , hari impunzi mu bicae bibirihari impunze za gouvernement zishyigikiye gouvernement hanze harya ku kibuga ukakomeza kuri ecole primaire ukakomeza muri joc ,
these ones could walk without any problem . ||| zatemberaaga uko zishaka ,
there were others who were hiding in the church and saint @-@ paul center who could not have neither food nor water . ||| hakaba n' izindi mpunzi zari zihishe muri eglise st famille no muri centre st paul zitafite ibiryo zitafite n' amazi .
father hakizimana , praised for having helped a lot displaced people , together with father galican as well as other priests they were together , told me the problem . ||| padiri hakizimana bashima cyane ko yarwnye ku mpunzi zo muri centre st paul yangejejeho icyo kibazo nba padiri galican , bose bari kumwe ,
they said that they sheltered displaced people but did not have means to get water and food . ||| bati munayakazi tufite impunzi ariko tubuze uko tubona amazi tubuze uko tubina ibiryo ,
there were interahamwe there and they could not leave so to bring food from caritas stock at nyamirambo , saint @-@ andre and ... the place where the church built a very big house ||| interahamwe turabura uko tuva hariya ngo tujyae kuzana ibiryo muri caritas bafite muri stock inyamirambo muri st andre na hariya baubatse inzu yabo ikomeye cyane y' igorofa .
they asked me to give them gendarmes to help them get food for displaced people . ||| utubwirair abajandarume bakajya bajya kutuzanira ibiryo n' amazi kugirango tugaburirae izi mpunzi ?
i accepted that gendarmes at saint @-@ paul center and sainte @-@ famille went to fetch water for the displaced people . ||| nrabiemeye abajandarume bari bari centre st paul egise st famille nemeye yuko bajya kuvomair impunzi ,
they even went to bring food for them . even though these things are not often evoked the priests who were there may tell you that the gendarmes did that work . ||| bajya kubazanira n' ibiryo nubwo ibyo bintu bitakunzawe kuvugaw ariko abapadiri bari hano barahari nabo bazabibibwirair abajandarume bari bahari babikoze ako kazi bakakoze .
something else i did as far as helping people is concerned is running a secret operation with father hakizimana . in our secret operation , we were well @-@ suited that the food would be taken from sainte @-@ famille stock and sent to king faycal hospital and hotel meridien through red cross because there was no food . ||| ikindi na none nkoze mukutabara abntu mu ibang ryacu nri mfitanye nba padiri hakizimana tuemeye ko ibyo bairyo biva muri iriya stock ya st famille tukabiohereza kuri loi faycal no kuri hotel miridien biciye kuri croix rouge kuko nta bairyo bari bafite ,
we wanted to secretly take the food from caritas stocks at nyamirambo and bring it in the area controlled by rpf . we would proceed like that . ||| tushakaaga kubivana inyamirambo tukabinyuza muri stock za caritas mu ibanga bikomeye tukabizana muri zone ya fp ,
we did it exactly that way . ||| niko bimeze niko bigenze .
priests who present , that is the secret . you have been asking what we did . ||| abapadiri bari hano iryo ni ibanga kuko kuko muravuga ngo tukoze iki ibiryo abantu bo muri loi faycal ,
i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , accepted to send in a deep secret the food eaten by people in king faycal , in hotel meridien . even my seniors asked me about that and i denied it because it was a very deep secret . you can see that i was a good @-@ hearted man ; i did not even want people to starve ||| bo kuri hotel miridien bariye jyae lietenant colonel munyakazi nemeye mu ibanga rikomeye kubioherezayo kuburyo rwose n' abandi n' abayobozi banjye barabinbajije nrabihakana kuko ryari ibanga rikomeye cyane muraumva ko jyewe nta mutaima mubi nri nfite kuko ntashakaaga ko n' abantu baicwa n' inzara .
do you think you are through ? ||| muraumva murangije ?
have you said that the mobile group at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ... ||| utwemereye ko groupe mobile ya st famille na st paul
definitely ! ||| yego
was n't it that way ? ||| siko biri bimeze ?
i gave orders ||| amategeko niyo nri ntanze
alright ! ||| yeee ,
before that , i want to start by the reason why we had invited you though you did not get the invitation .... ||| noneho rero tutari tugera aho nea ngirango tukitangira n' impamvu yatumye tukutumira bwa mbere wenda ubutumire bukaba butarakugezeho
i did not get it ||| ntabwo bungezeho
we want to know your relationship with ... as you explained , there were two groups at sainte @-@ famille . ||| twagirango tumenye imikoranire yawe nkuko ubisobanuye kuris t famille imitwe ibiri ,
one of gendarmes of course under your command , and another of the population who were armed . was n't it that way ? did you explain it that way ? ||| hari umutwe w' abajandarume nyine mwayoboraga hari n' umutwe w' abaturage bafite intwaro siko biri bimeze siko ubisobanuye ?
you had the responsibility to protect people as you said . how come that there were armed people killing others who were running away because of their ethnic group ? i think you all know that . you have also explained it . ||| abaturage bari bafite intwaro utubwiye ko uri ufite inshingano zo kurinda abaturage none hakaba hari abaturage bafite imbunda bicaaga bagenzi babo bahunga kubera ubwoko bwabo ngirango ibyo murabizi nawe ubisobanuye .
before we get deep into the matter , we would like to ask you about rumors about you so that you may say something about it as well . ||| tukubaza rero tutari tuinjira neza ngo tuumva neza ibyo bakuvuzeho nawe ugirae icyo ubitusobanurairho gatoya ,
would you say something about your relationship with armed people who had escaped from fights at gisozi ? these people set barriers in roads and arrested people who went to sainte @-@ famille in order to kill them . ||| utubwirae utubwirae imikoranire yawe nabo bantu bavuye ku gisozi bahunze imirwano nabo bakaza bafite imbunda bashyiraho amabariyeri batangira abantu bahungiraaga muri st famille kugirango babicae ,
how can you explain it given that your protection did not save lives since all people who were at sainte @-@ famille died ? ||| ndetse bikaba nta nicyo binatanze abantu muri st famille barashize ubwo uragira icyo ubitusobanurairho ku mikoranire ,
you shall explain to us the above relationship and tell us the importance of your gendarmes considering that people died every single day . ||| unatubwirae icyo abajandarume mwayoboraga bari barinze aho ngaho kandi abantu barapfa buri munsi ?
i am afraid you have not understood me well ! i told you that i commanded the mobile group . ||| buriya ntago unyumvaishije jyae nyoboraaga groupe mobile ,
i also told you that the mobile group watched over saint @-@ michel cathedral . do you get me ? ||| iyo groupe mobile nbabwiye ko yarinze cathedrale st michel uranyumva ?
i told you there was no problem at saint @-@ michel cathedral . ||| noneho kuri cathedrale st michel nkubwiye ko nta bibazo biigeze bihaba .
i told you that the gendarmes protected the population there . whether gendarmes went there from time to time , whether they were connected with them , captain ntirugiribambe may explain it to you better . i ensure you that i had no connection with the interahamwe who attacked sainte @-@ famille church and saint @-@ paul center . ||| jyae nkubwiye ko abo bajandarume barindaaga abantu iyo bazi amategeko abajandarume baragiye bajyayo baba barakoranye nabo uwo capitaine ntirukiribambae yazabikusobanurair ariko jyewe ntabwo nigeze nkorana n' intehamwe zateye kuri eglise st famille cg kuri centre st paul .
do you accept that many people died at saint @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul sir ? ||| nyakaubahaw uremera ko st famille na st paul haguye abantu benshi ?
of course ! i do know that people died there ||| hapfuye abantu nrabizi .
so , the task you had given to your gendarmes was to protect who exactly ? ||| none se munshingano mwari mwahaye abajandarume zari izo kurinda bande ?
the population , yes i know ! ||| zari izo kurinda abaturage nrabizi
which population ? ||| abahe baturagae ?
one that had escaped there ||| ? bari barahungiye aho ngaho
in the church and at saint @-@ paul center ? ||| mu kiriziya no muri st paul inberae ?
isn ’ it ? ||| sibyo ?
tell me first what those reports are so that i may have the idea of those accusations brought against me as you are saying . ||| banza unsobanuraire ayo ma rapport nyamenye ibyo banrega noneho nkusobanuraire uko ibyo bintu biri bimeze kuko nkuko ubivugaaga
i just wanted to explain to you so to have the same understanding of things . ||| ubundi nagirango nkusobanuraire ,
this is not a trial . it is just information collection ||| tuumvikanae ntabwo ari urubanza n' ukumenya amakuru .
you have just said yourself that this is not a trial ! ||| waavuze ko atari urubanza ,
on june 17th , i read in newspapers that i headed the interahamwe 's attack to sainte @-@ famille . ||| ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu nbonye nbonye mu binyamakuru baraanditse ngo nijyae uri uyoboye icyo gitero cy' interahamwe zateye kuri eglise kuris t famille ,
it is impossible @: at that time , rpf had carried out an operation and took people from saint @-@ paul . the interahamwe became angry and decided to attack all institutions . ||| ibyo ntago bishobokaicyo kihae fpr yakoze operation yo kukura abaturage muri centre st paul interahamwe bararakara bavuga ko bagiye kutera ibigo byose ,
they attacked hotel de mille collines , sainte @-@ famille church and tried even to attack saint @-@ michel cathedral . ||| bateye hotel mille collines , batera eglise st famille bagerageza no kujya kutera cathedrale st michel .
as a commander , i already told you what i did . i was told that the doors of hotel de mille collines had just been broken and that people had already been taken up to the reception desk . ||| jyae nka commanda rero nkubwiye uko nkoze baranbwiye ngo kuri hotel mille colline barangije kusatura inzugi , bagejeje abntu kuri reception ,
this was my reaction @: i quickly ran from muhima military camp to hotel de mille collines . ||| reaction nkoze ni iyihe ?
i immediately brought the interahamwe 's attack to heel and the very gendarmes chased the interahamwe who were taking people from sainte @-@ famille church and making them enter the procure . ||| ngombaaga kuva mu kigo cya muhaima nkirukira kuri hotel mille collines nhise posha icyo gitero cyo kuri hotel mille collines kandi abo abajandarume nibo bairukanye izo nterahamwe zari zikuye abantu muri eglise st famille zibinjiza hagati ya st famille na procure .
you can see well that saying i headed the attack is pure lies because i was at hotel de mille collines . here are even people who saw me . i can see them here . there is uwimana and others . i was not part of that attack ; i was at hotel de mille collines . ||| uraumva ko jyewe icyo gitero bavuga nri nyoboye barabeshya kuko nri muri hotel mille collines nbanbonye barahari hari uwimana hari abo bose niho nri ndi icyo gitero ntago nri nkirimo kuko nri niberae muri hotel mille collines .
we would like to ask you a question sir ! ||| nyakaubahaw turagirango tukubaze ,
still about saint @-@ michel , can you really confirm that no single individual died there ? i know one who died there . his name was semuhungu . he worked in the national bank ... i mean banque de kigali . ||| wenda kuri st michel muvuze ko nta muntu uhaguye murabihamya ? hari umuntu nzi uhaguye witwa semuhungu ukoraaga muri banque nationale ,
i think he first worked in banque de kigali and shifted to the national bank after . ||| banque de kigali yakoraaga muri banque de kigali ngirango aza kukora muri banque nationale nyuma .
the man died there . ||| uwo muntu yarahaguye , .
okay , let 's just forget about that one . let 's come back to the issue of sainte @-@ famille . ||| wenda uwo reka tumwihorere ariko reka tuongerae tusubirae kuri st famille utwemereye ko ukijije abari muri st michel ,
you have just confirmed that you saved people who were in saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines because the gendarmes could protect them . why did n't the gendarmes protect sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul center and let such people die ? talk about that that very minor issue then we give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . ||| na mille colline kubera abajandarume bashoboraaga kurinda abo bantu none kuri st famille no kuri st paul abo bajandarume n' iki kibabujije kuharinda hakapfa abantu bangana kuriya n' akantu gato kusa noneho wenda tukatanga ijambo ku baturagae bakagira icyo babivugaho
i told you that the gendarmes i sent to mille collinnes , sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul belonged to the nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation . ||| jyewe nkubwiye yuko abajandarume nohereje kuri abajandarume nohereje kuri abajandarume bari bari kuri hotel mille collines , eglise st famille , centre st paul bari aba compagnie territoriale yari nyarugengae ya groupement kigali .
do you mean that protecting sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul were not within your duties ? ||| muri groupe st famille na st paul ntago uri uhashinzwe ?
they were under nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation ||| hari abasirikare ba compagnie territoriale ya nyarugengae ya groupement kigali .
who was the responsible ? ||| ishinzwe nde ?
each formation had its own commander ||| ishinzwe nu buri groupement yari ifite commanda wayo
what was his name ? ||| yitwaaga nde ?
his name was lieutenant @-@ colonel kanimba . he was there temporarily but he normally belonged to kacyiru military camp ||| icyo kihae yitwaaga lieutenant colonel kanimba ayikorera ariko yari bloque hariya ntuza muri camp kacyiru niho yabaye bloque .
what about what you said that you once arrived at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ? ||| ibyo watwemereye ko ugeze st famille na st paul
of course i did ||| ngezeyo rwose .
did n't you realize anything strange ? ||| ntacyo ubonye ?
i was with father uwimana from hotel de mille collines . we went together to father veneche 's and we carried people who were hiding at father ... bishop veneche 's in the pickup . this took us two rounds of times . ||| nri hamwe na padiri uwimana tuvana kuri hotel mille colline tujyana kwa padiri veneche tutwara abantu bari bihishe kwa padiri kwa musenyeri venesh tubatwara inshuro ebyiri muri cammionet .
please sir ! ||| president nyakubwahwa kuri iyo tariki 17.06 ,
we learnt from the case of a prisoner going by the name of rutabana that he killed one 186 people picked from the church where gendarmes settled . there was a barrier too ; can you tell us that you really arrived there ? ||| tubona ko igihe tuburanaishaga kwa mufungwa witwa rutabana yasobanuye ko yishe abantu ijana na mirongo inani na batandatu bavanywe mu kiriziya inberae abajandarume bari ku muryango kuko ari bariyeri yari iri kandi muratuemerair ko uwo munsi mwahageze koko ?
i arrived at saint @-@ paul and mille collines ! ||| ngeze kuri centre st paul no kuri hotel mille collines .
do n't you think you can explain those things to us ? ||| ibyo bintu ntacyo ubitusobanurairho ?
i mean the 186 people killed on that day . ||| byabo bantu ijana na mirongo inani na batandatu baishwe kuri iyo tariki ?
you know ... when only one person dies the whole area can get informed in one day . ||| kuko byo abantu bangana gfutyo bapfuye ngirango umuntu umwe iyo apfuye apfuye nkahangaha nraumva iyi quartier yose yarara ibimenye ,
did you never know anything ? ||| wowe nta kintu wigeze ubimenyaho ?
explain to us ! ||| tusobanuraire
i told you that i was at hotel de mille collines . ||| jyewe nkubwiye yuko nri kuri hotel mille collines ,
by the way , why are people shouting when i am explaining ? ||| ariko se ko abantu bari kusakuza kandi nrimo kuabsobanurira ?
they should keep quiet . ||| bacecekae ,
keep quiet ! we are about to give them the floor . ||| bacecekae tugiye kugera turabaha ijambo ,
we only want you to explain that minor issue . ||| mukanya nako kantu nagirango usobanurae .
in the testimonies you received people said that i headed the attack ! ||| abantu baravuze ngo abantu muri ubwo buhamya bakuhaye baravuze ngo nijyae uri uyoye icyo gitero ,
i told you that on june 17th i was at hotel de mille collines . we had been fighting the interahamwe there all along the day . from there i went with father uwimana to pick people from father veneche 's .... bishop veneche 's . i carried them in two rounds in my pickup . ||| jyae nkubwiye ko ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi y' ukwezi kwa gatandatu jyae nri kuri hotel mille collines tuirirwa turwana n' interahamw zo kuri hotel mille collines nhavuye njyana na padiri uwimana kujya kuzana abantu bari bari muri kwa padiri veneche kwa musenyeri veneche nbatwara inshuro ebyiri muri cammionet ,
surprisingly , mp rugema said that i was going to kill them . ||| ariko depite rugema yavugaaga ngo ntwaye abantu muri cammionet ngo ngiye kubica .
there were your gendarmes ||| hari abajandarume bawe
i did n't know it ||| natago nbimenye
eeh ... i got it ! the man and his family died . he lived near saint @-@ michel ||| eeh uwo muntu yarahaguye n' umuryango we kandi yari atuye iruhande rwa st michel
according to the report i had from the priests , no one of the people who had escaped to saint @-@ michel cathedral died . i was told that . ||| na rapport nbonye abapadiri bampaye banbwiye ko abantu bahungiye muri cathedrale st michel nta muntu uhaguye niko njyae abapadiri banbwiye .
let 's go on ! ||| reka tukomezae ,
let 's give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . you have actually talked about everything . let 's now listen to the population ; you will get their views as well ||| tutangae ijambo ku baturagae tuumvae icyo babivugaho ubundi ibindi byo inteko yo ibyinshi ugiye ubivaagaho ariko nonehoi reka tuhae ijambo abaturage kugirango wunvae .
allow me to add something ! ||| buretse nongerae ngirae icyo nvuga
try to be brief ||| ariko muri makeya ?
in a word , i would like to ask you to carefully investigate this case . ||| muri makeya , ngirango ibi bintu mubikurikirane neza ,
some days earlier , at the tenth anniversary july 2004 , all the survivors who were living in that area praised the government authorities for having saved them . ||| ejobundi mu kwezi kwa karindwi 2004 , abacitse ku icumu bose bari bari muri iriya zone ku isabukuru y' imyaka icumi bashimaiye abayobozi b' igihu ko babatabaye ,
their representative said @: "@ you should also thank also lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi who came to us for help @"@ . you may make noise yes , but i am not lying ! the division commander who delivered the message is here himself ; he might explain it to you . ||| uwari ubahagarariye yaravuze ati mushimirae na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ututabaye ntabwo nbeshya nimushaka musakuzae commanda wa division uri uhari yabagejejeho ubwo butumaw ari hano abibasobanuraire ,
it is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . the very people who were praising me just some days ago ! ||| n' urubanza kukourimo kunbaza ngo ugiye kubwira abantu ngo banzae banshinjae kandi ejobundi nibo banshimiraaga
i did not mean to accuse you , sir ! ||| nyakaubahaw ntabwo nvuze ko bakushinja
they have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me . ||| ejobundi nibwo banshimaiye kumugaragaro banantumaho ngo baranshimira .
that is a good thing . any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it . ||| ibyo ngibyo ni byiza ni ngombaw ,
i have not said that people must accuse you . we only have to let the two sides speak . we go to the court panel first and listen to their views . ||| k' umuntu ukoze neza baramushimira ibyo rwose ntago nvuze ngo abantu bakushinjae n' ukuvuga ngo tugomba kutanga ijambo kumpande zose ngiye kubanza mu ntaeko kugirango tuumvae nabo icyo bavuga .
you said that you gave orders . ||| uvuze ko utanze amategeko ,
did you give orders and did not follow them up ? ||| utanze amategeko ntiwayakurikirana ?
the problem arises there . more than 180 people died but you did n't know it . however , we know that when a person dies of a car accident in an area , we all come to see . ||| aho hantu harimo ikibazo hapfuye abantu barenga ijana na mirongo inani ntimubimenye mutuye muri kigali kandi umuntu wo muri quartier apfuye imodoka imugonze tukahurura nk' umunyarwanda uri ukomeye mu buyobozi bw' icyo kihae mwagombaga kuba mwarabimenye ?
as a high @-@ ranked rwandan in the time , you should have known that . ||| mwagombaga kumenya ibyo bene wanyu bakoze ,
you should have known what your colleagues were doing . tough the territory company was commanded by someone else , you had enough power yourself . you can see that we did not get the point well . ||| nubwo iyo compagne territoriale yari iyobowe n' undi arko mwari mufite ubushobozi bukomeye aho rero ntago uvuga ngo tusobanukiwe .
i think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you . ||| ngirango yagirango akufatae mu mugongo akwreke ko nta gahunda tushyizeho yo kukushinja .
he also reminded you that , as a leader , you should have known the death of the people you have been asked about . that is his point . ||| kandi akuibutsa kugirango wibuke neza anakuereka niba abo bantu ubajijwe baranapfuye nk' umuyobozi ugombaaga kumenya imipfire yabo bantu nibyo yakubwiraaga ,
we go over to someone else ||| reka tuongerae tutangae ijambo ahubwo .
thank you mister president . according to the information we have ... there is a prisoner called rutabana who told us that you usually used to come to sainte @-@ famille with father munyeshyaka and that you were aware of all the things the prisoner could do . i want to ask you mister munyakazi ; do n't you think you might have forgotten that information and that you have just been reminded ? ||| murakoze president w' inteko twagirango tubaze bwana munyakazi mu makuru tufite hari umugororaw witwa rutabana uri utuhaye amakuru ko ibihe byinshi mwakundaga kuba muri kuri st famille muri kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka kandi ko ibintu uwo mugororaw yakoraaga byose mwabaga mubizi ayo makuru ntimwaba mwayibagiwe tukaba tuyabaibukije ?
it is also said that you might have taken some bodies and that the place where you took them is still unknown . you may also tell us about that . thank you ! ||| murakoze ko hari n' imirambo mwaba mwarajyanye bataba baramenye aho mwayijyanye ? nabyo mwabitubwira ?
thank you . ||| murakoze ,
i never drove that red bus . ||| iyo bus y' umutuku ntayo ngendaagamo rwose ngendaaga muri hilux y' umweru .
i had a white hilux pickup . even my driver belonged to the national gendarmerie . i never travelled in the red bus . you can see it is someone else they are talking about not lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . ||| iy' umutuku ntabwo nigeze nyigendamo n' umushoferi wanwaye wanwaraga ari muri police nationale ntabwo ngenze muri bus y' umutuku ubwo uraumva ko hari undi muntu bavuga utari lieutenant colonel munyakazi .
let 's forget about that ; the red bus never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . ||| icyo ngicyo tukikuraeho iyo bus y' umutuku ntabwo yagendaagamo lieutenant colonel
no this is a trial . it is being proceeded right now ! ||| turimo kuburana niho bigeze rwose ubu ngubu
it is not a trial . he has just asked his question in his own way but this is not a trial . ||| ntago ari ukubaraan wenda uretse ko ikibazo kibajije uburyo bwe ariko si ukuburana
that question must remove all confusions . the red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . ||| icyo kibazo kikuraeho byose na confusion zose iyo camionnet y' umutu babonye ntabwo yigeze igendawmo na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ,
the second thing i did n't mention , i guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , is that i see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas i did my best to protect them . ||| ikindi cya kabiri ntakubwiye ba nyakaubahaw mugize urukiko gacaca nrimo kubona bahimba ibintu ngo babingerekaeho kandi nrakoze uko nshoboye ngo nbatabarae .
once saint @-@ famille church was being fired at . i myself went to sainte @-@ famille church to console the population . we took sick people and they went to be treated in red cross infirmary . red cross was chaired by kayiranga in the time . ||| ikindi igihe bombe zagwaaga kuri eglise st famille nraje ubwanjye njya muri eglise st famille njya kuhumuriza abaturage ngiyeyo tufata abarwayi croix rouge yategekawaga na kayiranga bajya kubavuza muri croix rouge ,
i never travelled in the red car . remove that accusation completely . ||| iyo modoka y' umutuku rwose bababwiye ubwo icyo kirego mukinvanaeho kivaeho ntinigeze nyigendamo .
that is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , sir ! of course if it is one . ||| nyakaubahaw icyo n' ikirego uzaburana niba kinahari ,
we have not come for trial . you should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself . ||| ariko wunvae ko ntakuburana n' ukugirango tumenye kusa tusobanukirwae ntagobwo tuje tuje kuca urubanza tuje kukira ubuhamya bwawe nkuko wabwisabiye .
you are asking me what you 've been told though . ||| ariko murimo kunbaza ibyo babwiye
of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial . ||| yeah , barakubaza bagirango basobanukirwae kusa ariko si ukuburana ,
i go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well . ||| reka mpe undi mugenzi wanjye akubaze .
court panel according to rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp ||| na rutabana uri ushinzwe kutanga ibiryo mu nkambi y' impunzi gira icyo utubwira
it was not an accusation . he just wanted to know . ||| ntabwo kiri ikirego yagirango amenye ,
food can not be an accusation because everyone eats . ||| uraumva ibiryo byo atri ikirego kuko ntawe utarya .
he is saying i and the interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people . ||| aravuga ko nkoranye niyo nterahamwe kutanga ibiryo kandi lietenant colonel uri mu ntiambara ntabwo yabona igihe cyo kujya kutanga ibiryo mu mpunzi .
court panel i want to ask a question . mister colonel munyakazi has just examples such as mille collines , sainte @-@ famille , and saint @-@ paul and he tried to help rwandans everywhere . ||| nagirango mabze ikibazo kikaubahaw colonel munyakazi yatanze ingero muri mille collines , muri st famille , no muri st paul , ahantu hose yagiye agerageza kugirair neza abanyarwanda ,
probably he was doing that during the day . i would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action . ||| yabikoraaga ku manywaibyo aribyo byose nagirango mubaze niba hari abantu babanyamakuru baba barabonye icyo kikorwa cyiza yakoze .
thank you ! ||| murakoze
right ! ||| eeh ,
about that question ... do you mean rwandan journalists or foreign ones ? ||| abanyamakuru bo mu rwanda cg bo mu mahanga kuri icyo kibazo ,
about that question ... about that question ... from 1992 ... from 1994 ... if you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people . ||| kuri icyo kibazo , kuva muri 1992 ,
all of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living . ||| kuva muri 1994 niba mwarabonye ibitabo biandikawaga byose abantu bakundaaga kuvugawmo abajandarume bagize uruhare mukutabara abantu tuitwaaga nabo bose bangag kubivuga kubera ibihe turi turimo ,
however if you read the book le droit de vivre by hibert , you can see that book shows well that hotel de mille collines was protected by gendarmes according to the investigations . that is why people did not die there . that is what the book says ||| ariko iyo usomye igitabo cya auteur le drpoit survivre cyanditswe na hibert cyo kierekana yuko kuri hotel mille colline harinzawe n' abajandarume muri za enquete bakoze akaba ariyo mpamvu hatapfuye abantu niko icyo gitabo kibianditse muri za enquete zabo .
there was an american who was with gisimba 's displaced people in saint @-@ michel cathedral . we had taken him from nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral . ||| kuri cathedrale st michel hari umunyamerika uri hamwe na ziriya mpunzi zo kwa gisimba nawe tumuvanye inyamirambo tumuzana muri cathedrale st michel ,
even gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major karangwa ||| no kwa gisimba na gisimba uriya aziko abajandarume major karangaw ariwe ziriya mpfubyi zose uzigejeje muri position zanjye ,
unfortunately this is not evoked . ||| ariko ibyo ntabwo babivuga ,
for the time being , however , people should know the action took place . when people arrived there , some were even told not to say they had been saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi because he would be charged of killings later . fortunately there are gacaca courts ; you have given me the opportunity to tell you that i had given orders to the gendarmes of hotel de mille coliines . ||| ariko ubu nibura abantu bamenye ko icyo kikorwa kibayeho noneho rero bageze hariya bamwe baranababwiraaga ngo ntibazavugae yuko bakijijwe na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ngo kuko bazamushinja ubwicanyi ,
i had given orders to people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . i also gave orders to gendarmes to go and fetch water and bring food . you have known that too . you can see that i did not intend to plot against tutsis ||| ariko inkiko gacaca zirahari mu mpaye uburyo bwo kubabwira yuko abo bajandarume bari bari kuri hotel mille collines nri nbahaye anbwiriza mpa amabwiriza abantu bo kuri cathedrale st michel mpa amabwiriza abajandarume yo kuvoma amazi no kuzana ibiryoniba nibyo murabimenye ubwo murabona yuko nta mugambi wo kugambanair abatutsi nri nfite .
yes sir , that was perfect . what you did at mille collines was perfect ! what you did is also recognized . ||| nyakaubahaw ibyo nibyiza ibyo ukoze kuri mille collines ni byiza urabishimwa , n' ibintu ukoze nabyo urabishimwa ,
just because of the power you had in the time , we get curious and worried and we are obliged to ask you questions in order to know . ||| kusa hari impungenge tuba tufite ku kintu kuko tuumva ko uri ufite ubushobozi bwo kukimenya tuka kikubaza ,
we would also like to ask you to stand appropriately in front of the court panel . this is because people fear even to ask due to your dignity . ||| turakusaba ko kubera igitinyiro cyawe uravuga abantu bakagira ubwoba bakatinya no kukubaza wifate neza inberae y' urukiko ,
no , by standing appropriately i do not mean standing that way . ||| kuifata neza ntabwo ari ibyo byo kugira gutyo uvugae utuje ,
; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity . they have said you are an important person so they have much respect for you . ||| abantu bataikanga batafite ubwoba cyane ko bavuze ko uri umuntu ukomeye n' icyubahiro cyawe . ,
if you feel tired you may even sit down so that they may ask you . ||| n' igitinyiro ufite niba unarushye ushobora kuba wicaye gatoya bakakubaza
you know sir ... may the court panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in kigali . however , i had prepared it . i hope you will allow me that . ||| nyakaubahaw muri uyu mujyi wa kigali nuko wenda mutanyemereye urukiko rutanyemereye ariko wenda murza kumpa uruhushya nzae kubibabwira kuko nabyo nri nbiteguye ,
when you check well that structure and see how i did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area ..... ||| iyo urebye uko unity zari zimeze hano mumujyi wa kigali ukareba ukuntu nkoze ukuntu nshoboye ngo nshoborae kutabara bariya bantu bari bari muri kariya kacae
this is not a trial . the other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened . ||| kuko si ukuburana kandi uriya we yabitiranyije kusa tukubwiraaga ngo ujyae utumara impungenge kuko hari ibyo tutazi cyane cyane ko uri umuntu ugenda ahantu hose uzi ibintu byinshi bigiye biba
so , we want you to provide us with explanations . this is not a trial . it is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . we are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . we give the floor to someone else ||| noneho ubitusobanuraire ntago ari ukuburana nta nubwo ari inzira tushatse kugirango uburanae twebwe urukiko rw' umurenge nta nubushobozi tufite bwo kukuburanaish ntabwo tufite ubushobozi bwo kukuburanaish na butoya kubera icyubahiro cyawe ntabwo twebwe tufite ubwo bushobozi reka tutangae ijambo kumuntu umwe mubagize inteko hanyuma tujyae ku banri .
court panel thank you . just out of curiosity tell me about three questions @: you have been evoking mrnd a bit a lot ; would you please let us know which political party you belonged to ? ||| murakoze kumpa ijambo nagirango nkwibarize utubazo duatatu tw' amatsiko cyane cyane tuumvise utsindagira ishyaka mrnd ushobora kutubwira ishyaka uri urimo ?
second @: you told us that you drew reports denying the accusations brought against tutsis . so i want to ask you ; as a high @-@ ranked personality of then who could go abroad at times , how many tutsis have you warned ? ||| icya kabiri utuibwiraiye ko utanze rapport zihinyuza ibyo babeshyeraaga abtutsi reak nkwibarize nk' umuntu uri ufite ubushobozi ujyaaga no hanze uganiraaga n' abantu utuha nk' abatutsi nkabangahe uba uraburiye ?
third @: you told us about a man called ntirugiribambe . where can we find him ? ||| icya gatatu nagirango nkwibarize utubwiye umugabo witwa ntirukiribambae ese tumukura he ?
what was his responsibility ? ||| ese yari ashinzwe iki ?
thank you . ||| murakoze
the first question concerns the political party i belonged to . ||| munyakazi icya mbere unbajije ngo ishyaka nri nrimo ,
according to the rwandan constitution in force till june 10th 1991 , all rwandans including you adhered to mrnd . surely it was the same for you . ||| kugera ku itariki ya cumi . 06.1991 hari hariho iegeko nshinga abanyarwanda bose nawe uri muri mrnd nawe niko biri bimeze abantu bose bari bari muri mrnd ,
all people adhered to mrnd . even you because any rwandan did . ||| nawe uri urimo kuko umunyarwanda wese yari muri mrnd ,
after june 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . soldiers did not adhere to any political party . ||| nyuma yo ku itariki ya 10.06.1991 hagiyeho itegeko rishyiraho amashyaka menshi , abasirikare nta shyaka bajyaagamo ,
the second question you asked is about reports i drew and how many tutsis i might have warned . ||| icya kabiri unbwiye ngo uri unbajije uti izo rapports ukoze ngo nvuga abatutsi nburiye .
i drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . i was told to verify . ||| izo rapport yuko barimo kubahimbair nzikoze kuturuka ku itariki ya mbere igihe batangiraaga kufata ibyitso banbwiye ngo nkorae verification ,
i committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . i did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at sisi evariste 's . ||| kandi nraemeye n' umutima wanjye nvugaish ukuri nkora uko nshoboye kugirango ba extremiste batajya kukoresha izindi rangamuntu muzinri imprimerie ngo bazitiraire sisi evariste
i also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . that is why they started putting pressure on habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating tutsis and start releasing people . ||| kandi izo rapport nkoze nubwo tubivuganaaga n' abakozi bo muri embassade bazaaga kutubaza uko situation imeze niyo yatumye bashyiraho pression president habyarimana kugirango uriya mugambi wo kurimbura abatutsi utakorwa ,
people were released . ||| batangirae bafungurae n' abantu ,
there are even people who were released . habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore you should check those who are being released @"@ . ||| n' abantu batangiye kufungurwa n' abafunguwe barahari president habyarimana yaravuganga ngo nimuongerae kufungura mujyae mureba abafunguwe
in april 1991 ... it would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing tutsis for fake accusations . ||| mukwezi kwa kane . 1991 ariko iyo tutakora izo rapport tukajya muri uwo mugambi wo kufunga abatutsi tubahimbair turi kuba tukoze nabi ,
i am telling you ; the report served a lot because i told foreigners that we had verified and found out that tutsis were innocent . ||| jyae nkubwiye ko iyo rapport yagize akamaro kuko nbwiye abanyamahanga nti ntawe tukoze verification tusanze barabeshyera abatutsi .
what was the third question again ? ||| icya gatatu n' ikihae ?
ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of nyarugenge . he exiled to zaire . i do not know where he might be right now . ||| uwo ntrugiribambe yari commanda wa territoriale ya nyarugengae yarahunze yagiye muri zairae ntabwo aho ari mpazi .
thank you ! ||| murakoze .

in 1990 , i do not remember the month and date , he co @-@ presided over a very big conference i attended at kimihurura . he was with renzaho tharcisse . ||| muri 1990 igihe ntiibukaho amatariki n' ukwezi , icyo kihae batukoresheje inama ku kimihurura ai kumwe na renzaho tharissise batukoresha inama ikomeye cyane batubwira ngo ,
they told us that any rwandan living in kigali had to return to his or her place of birth . ||| umunyarwanda utuye umujyi uwo ariwe wose afite kusubira ikigali aho avuka ,
otherwise , they had enough soldiers in all over the country and bullets so that every rwandan would be shot at . ||| nimba bitashobotse ko bafite abasirikare bahagije mu gihugu ko bafite n' amasasu ko umunyarwanda uwo ariwe wese azarasaw isasu ,
renzaho ended saying @: "@ a word to a wise is enough ! @" this saying was a puzzle to us . ||| icyo kihae re nzaho arangiza avuga ngo birengae niwowe ubwira !
we could not figure out what it meant . many of us could not know what this intended to . ||| ako kantu katubereye urujijo kuburyo tutazi icyo kahamuraga ndetse benshi turi tutaramenya icyo bishaka kugeraho ,
i beg your pardon , i want to be very brief . ||| ubwo nyuma yaho ntashaka kuvuga muri makeya munbabarirae , nyakaubahaw muyobozi wa jandarumeri iyco kihae uri umukuru wa jandarumeri ,
a long time after , you , the then gendarmerie commander , joined us somewhere in sainte @-@ famille . ||| utusanze ahntu muri st famille uranzi jyewe ?
do you know me ? do you ? ||| jyewe uranzi ?
you know sir ; i do not have anything against you . i would advise that you accepted all that has been said and that you consider as lies . we are many witnesses for that . you know that we only wanted to remind each other . ||| nyakaubahaw jyewe nta kintu npfa nawe imaan inbabarirae ariko icyo nzicyo ibyo bavuze bose ukavuga ngo barakubeshyera ushatse utubabarira kuko turahari turi benshi urabizi twagirango twibukiranye amakuru murakoze .
we shall give to each speaker minutes not to go beyond . ||| abo tuha ijambo bose turabaha iminota batarenza
i was born in ubumanzi cell , rugenge sector , nyarugenge district . thank you . ||| nvuka mukakari k' ubumanzi , umurenge wa rugengae akarere ka nyarugengae urakoze nyakaubahaw kuba mumpaye ijambo
wait a bit ! ||| ba uretse , ba uretse ,
you first raise your right hand and swear @: "@ i , your name , swear to god that what i am going to say is true @"@ . ||| urabanza uzamurae ikiganza cy' iburyo uti jyewe izina ryawe ntanze imaan ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri
i , gasasira jean marie maurice , swear to god that what i am going to say is true . ||| jyewe kasasair jean marie mourice , ntanze imaan ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri
tell the truth then ! ||| ngaho tubwize ukuri
thank you mister president1 even though we have been given few minutes , i would like to ask to be given the same minutes as him because we are all equal before gacaca . ||| murakoze nyakaubahaw president nubwo mutuhaye iminota mike twagirango tusabae tunganye nk' iyo kuko inberae ya gacaca tuesae tungana
in fact , he asked to give his testimony . we can not give you the same minutes as him considering your number . try to look behind you ; there are other people . we might even receive testimonies from five people . ||| mu by' ukuri uwo tuhaye umwanya yisabaiye kutanga ubuhamya umwanya tumuhaye ntabwo tuwunganaish nawe reka uko mungana subiza amaso inyuma urebae wenda harai n' abandi bari butuhae ubuhanya batanu ,
you can see that the testimonies can not take such a time unless you want to tell us stories from 1959 as well ! ||| ubwo se ubwo buhamya bufata igihe kingana gutyo keretse nawe niba ushaka kutubwira kuva muri 1959 ?
in case you want , say , to evoke something wrong he did , just go straight . ||| kutubwira ikintu kigenze niba wenda hari ibyo umuvaho by' icyaha yaba yarakoze ugwae ku cyaha neza utagombye kukata cyane ngo unyurae inyuma
he had his own car . the red one usually rolled before his . ||| yari afite iyo agendamo iyo yari imuherekeje yazaaga mbere imodoka hilux itukura yari yanditseho komini nyarugengae ,
the car bore the script commune nyarugenge ... mrnd commune nyarugenge . do n't you all know those cars in this city ? ||| mrnd komini nyarugengae izo hilux se ntabwo muzizi muri uyu mujyi ?
the car bore the script commune nyarugenge above which mrnd and commune nyarugenge was below . ||| imodoka itukura yanditseho ngo komini nyarugengae hejuru habanzaaga ngo mrnd ,
such pickups were known in this city . people who were at sainte @-@ famille may remind each other . ||| munsi hakazaho ngo komini nyarugengae izo hilux zirazwi hano mu mujyi abazi st famille abari st famille turibukiranya .
when he came to sainte @-@ famille he was always accompanied by interahamwe . but he had his gendarmes as he already said . ||| icyo kihae mu nterahamwe zazaaga zimuherekeje we yazaaga we yifitiye abajandarume be nkuko yabibibwiraiye yayoboraaga muri camp muhaima ,
it is surprising , however , that , as a commander of muhima military camp , he did not mention the name of munyeshyaka among the priests but only limited himself to celestin . ||| iyo bazga muri st famille yababwiye abapadiri bose ariko bitangaje nk' umuntu nka munyakazi uri major ayoboye gendarmerie hano ataigeze nraimawe adukomoreza kuri munyeshyaka akivugair celestin ,
you all know what munyeshyaka did in this country . ||| munyeshyaka muzi ibyo yakoreye iki gihugu ,
we always say his name . he is even known abroad . munyakazi usually came to munyeshyaka 's office where they held meetings together with another priest who was the army chaplain in esm . ||| tuiribwa turirima isi n' amahanga munyeshyaka , munyeshyaka yarainjiraaga akainjira kwa munyeshyaka mubiro bye bakakoreramo inama n' undi musirikare baitaaga homonie ubaga aturutse muri sm .

we will tell you the names of the army chaplain in other cessions . mister president , i am now going to tell you the names of people who were taken from sainte @-@ famille and how they were taken . ||| iyo bamaraaga kuinjiramo icyo kihae nta kinri kikurikiraaga uwo homonie amazina ye tuzayabaha mu bunri buhamya nyakaubahaw president reka rero nbabwirae abantu bakuwe muri st famille n' ukuntu bagiye bakurawmo .
shortly before april 28th , this man came to sainte @-@ famille . he went to munyeshyaka 's and they killed people . i call upon people who were in sainte @-@ famille to remember well . ||| mu kwa kane mu matariki ashyira hafi kuri makumyabiri n' umunani munyakazi uyu nguyu yarainjiye muri st famille ajya kwa munyeshyka bica abantu , abantu bari st famille mubiibukae ahangaha ,

in regard to the attack i am going to talk about , -@ i have already told you that the interahamwe had all come uphill @- it is clear that it had already been planned since they all met there ; what means they were coming to kill tutsis at sainte @-@ famille @: those from muhima , rugenge and gikondo were all present . ||| muri icyo gitero ngiye kubabwira nbabwiye ko interahamwe zazamutse bigaragara ko ari ikintu kiri cyapangiwe umunsi umwe kuko biri bivuzawe ko baje kuica abtutsi bo muri st famille , interahamwe za rugengae zari zihari iza muhaima ni za gikondo kuko hano muri st
i would like also to tell you , mister president , people who died in sainte @-@ famille church . ||| ikindi nshaka kubabwira nyakaubahaw president abantu bapfuye muri st famille hari abantu cumi n' umunani ,

munyeshyaka himself ... wensislas munyeshyaka said not to put the 18 people among others . they were all taken to renzaho 's . ||| munyeshyaka wenyine ahagaze kuri aritali na wensilasi munyeshyaka yambaye anti bar baravuze ngo abo bantu nibabashyire hamwe cumi n' umunani babajyanae kwamu mujyi kwa renzaho
it was said they were going to give some information concerning inyenzi . i beg you , mister president , to go to the field so that we may prove what we are saying @: how he exercised his power and what happened under his authority . ||| hari amakuru bagiye kutanga y' inyenzi babahambiranya amashati babashyira muri ya hilux ibyo tubwira urukiko nyakaubahaw president tubasaga ko tujya kuri terrain tubibaerekae uko yaoboraga nuko bigenze mukihae yari afite ibyo ahagarariye .
the people were tied with shirts and put into the pickup . your own pickup , mister munyakazi , was white as you said but another before yours packed those people first . ||| barabahambiranyije babashyira muri ya hilux iyawe rwose nyakaubahaw munyakazi yari umweru nkuko ubiivugaiye ityari inberae yawe niyo yabanje kupakira abo bantu .
in that time the interahamwe i have talked about were in four groups . it was clear that they were coming to sainte @-@ famille . when the people were taken , it was said they were going to give information about inyenzi and residence certificates . we never knew what happened after . ||| na za nterahamwe nvuze biri ibikundi bine bigaragara koko ko bije muri st famille abo bantu bajya njyawe bagiye bagiye kutanga amakuru ku nyenzi na permis de residence ntituzi irengero ubwo yatubwira aho bagiye ,
i beg him to tell us where they were taken @: what happened to those who proved innocent and those who were guilty so that we may even worthily bury them . ||| ababaye abera aho bashyizwe bahamawe ni icyaha aho bagiye nibura tukabasha no kushyingura abacu ,
the last thing , mister president , after having asked him about those who were taken to renzaho 's .... -@ i guess i also have that right @- ||| icya nyuma nyakaubahaw presidenttumaze kumusaba abo bajyanywe kwa renzaho hari n' andi matariki ubwo nnjyae nraumva uburenganzira mbwemerewe , ,
as you have just showed us the power you have on munyakazi ... we shall bring our testimonies to the tribunal . but before i leave , i would like to ask you one thing @: he has been continuously evoking rugema donatien . ||| ko mumaze kutugaragariza kuri munyakazi ko uburenganzira bwanyu mwemerewe tuzabuzaan mu nkiko ubwo turi tayari rwose kuzabuzaan no mu nkiko ariko tubisabaiye ibi bikurikira @:@ yakomeje kubabwira uwitwa rugema donatien ,
he came to sainte @-@ famille escaping . ||| rugema donatien aje muri st famille yari asimbutse st famille ,
you all know rugema donatien was jailed among accomplices in 1990 . i have a close family relationship with him ; he is my uncle . ||| rugema donatien muesae muramuzi yari afunzwe mu byitso muri mirongo icyenda twebwe icyo tukoze jyae dufitanye isano rya bugufi mu muryango ni marume
rugema said @: "@ among people i have just escaped from , there is munyakazi @"@ . he came crying and said @: "@ you should know that today is your last day @"@ . ||| rugema yaravuze ati mu bantu nshitse harimo munyakazi yaje ataka ati mumenye ko ibintu byanyu birangiye uyu munsi ,
you all know rugema at kimihurura . his wife and children had just been killed . ||| rugema muesae muramuzi kimihurura bari bamaze kumwicira umugore bamwicira n' abana ,
he arrived at sainte @-@ famille after his house had been attacked . munyakazi had always been swearing to harm him . rugema is my uncle . i will even communicate to him that munyakazi 's case is being proceeded in the tribunal . ||| ageze muri st famille no kugirango ahagerae nuko bari bamaze kumutera iwe munyakazi ahora amukubitair agatoki ku kandi jyerugema ni marume kandi kandi nzagiraan communication nawe mumenyaishe ko tutangiye imanza za munyaakzi mu rukiko
we had tried it in 1997 . we wrote to the then military auditor general , major nzabanita joseph that there was a man in the army called laurent munyakazi we were accusing of genocide . fortunately gacaca has brought him to us . the judgment is up to you ! ask us then . ||| kuko twrabigerageje muri mirongo icyenda na karindwi tuandikair uwari oditeur generale wa oditora militeur yari major nzabanita joseph turamubwira tuti hari umuntu uri mu ngabo z' urwanda witwa laurent munyakazi turega genocide kikora turashimira kuba gacaca imutuzaniye ubwo ubushishozi n' ubwanyu mutubaze
as far as i am concerned , we will continue together in proceedings because i have much to accuse him of ; from 1990 in the time of accomplices ' case . i accuse him of torturing tutsis and people who were jailed among accomplices . he here is now ! ||| ubwo kuri jyae tuzakomezanya mu manza kuko nramurega kuva muri 1990 mu kihae cy' ibyitso nka munyakazi tortule yakoreye abatutsi abantu bafunzwe mu byitso dore nguyu munyakazi amakuru yose ,
i do not want to be too long mister president . we will be together in tribunals . i am asking you two things , mister munyakazi , in very strict words @: ||| nyakaubahaw president rero reka negufata umwanya munini ibindi tuzakomezanya mu nkiko nkaba nbasaba ibintu bibiri munyakazi mumagambo atyaye
as you can see , this is still the information collection step . we have also tried to collect information concerning the people we lost . we heard of many things from people who happened to arrive at sainte @-@ famille during the first days . they told us that munyakazi had been at sopetrad asking whether there was no shit to be cleaned off . ||| nkuko mubibona mu ikusanyamakuru ntawe tukoze ikusanyamakuru ry' abacu tubuze tugiye tuumva amagambo amwe yagiye akoresha mu ntiambara abahungaaga niko batubwiraaga abashoboye kuhunga bakainjira muri st famille mu minsi ya mbere batubwiye ko munyakazi hariya kuri sopetrad muri rugengae yahanyuza avuga ngo ko nta myand amukura hano ?
that means tutsis . he was answered that there were no tools . ||| bivuga abatutsi bamubwiye ko nta bikoresho ,
that is the information we have also collected so that justice for our people might be done . that is all they expect . ||| n' amakuru ntawe twakusanyije kugirango turengera abacu kuko ntawe nta kinri batusaba

thank you ! though you want me to swear , i am not giving any testimony . i am just asking ||| murakoze nubwo ugiye kundahiza ariko jyae nbazaaga nta buhamya ntanga
do not swear if you are asking ||| niba ubaza wikwirirwa urahira .
i want to .... mister major general munyakazi , you had told us a long story . however i think genocide took place between october 1st 1990 and december 1994 . ||| nagirango nyakaubahaw generale majoro munyakazi yatubwiye ibintu birebire ariko ngirango genocide bayibara mu kwacumi , itariki ya mbere 1990 kugeza mu kwacumi na kabiri 1994 .
he also told us about the invented scenario after which tutsis were arrested in order to kill them . ||| yatubwiye ko hari ikinamico yakinawe bakafata abatutsi bagambairiye kubica ,
when you asked him you said that you want three things ; his role , what he saw and what he heard . ||| mumubaza mwavuze muti turashaka ibintu bitatu , uruhare rwawe ibyo ubonye n' ibyo wumvise ,
you did not show us your role . ||| uruhare ntarwo utueretse ,
in 1990 , at the time of the shootings i was here in kigali . ||| muri mirongo icyenda igihe barasga nri aha muri kigali ,
i know that many people were arrested by major general munyakazi when he was still major . ||| nziko abantu benshi bafashwae na nyakaubahaw generale major munyakazi akiri major ,
he said that it was an invented scenario . i want to ask him why he arrested people knowingly . how did he consider that ? ||| nagirango mubaze yavuze ko ari ibintu bari bahimbaye we abo yafataaga ko yafashe benshi yabiemeraaga ko ari ibibaishyo akajyana abantu we yabibonaaga atae ?
second . at nyamirambo regional stadium , many people called upon him for help because he was in a vey good position for that . ||| ikindi abantu benshi muri stade hariya regionale baramutakambiye kuko yari afite ububsah buhaambaye ,
among people he helped , there is one woman he released and she went home . others perished there . he told us he drew a report but i do not agree with him because if he had really drawn the report , he would have released the people from the stadium . on the contrary , he took them to jail . ||| mu bantu yagiraiye neza hari umugore umwe yarekuye abandi barahagwa yatubwiye ko yakoze rapport ariko jyae nkaba ntabiemera kuko iyo aza kuyikora aba yaragiraiye nabo bantu bo kuri stade bakataha yarabajyanye ajya kubafunga
third . you all know the international pressure . even those who were not in the country might have read newspapers . that pressure made them release those they called accomplices . ||| ikindi igitugu cy' amahanga muesae murakizi nabatari ino mwasomye ibinyamakuru nicyo cyabokeje kugirango barekurae abo baitaaga ibyitso none we ko atatueretse uwari ari kufata abantu akaba yatubwiye ko yakijije abapadiri n' ababikira abaturage ijana na mirongo inani nabangahe bakagwa kuris t famille akatubwira ko atabibonye atanabiumvise ubwo murabona koko uyu nyakaubahaw ko yarahiye ko azavugaish ukuri murabona hari ukuri azavugaish ?
why did n't he show us who was arresting people but only told us that he saved priests and nuns and did neither see nor hear of the death of more than 180 people at sainte @-@ famille ? do you really think this gentleman will tell the truth as he swore ? he should spare our worries because the situation has already started worrying us ! ||| nawe abitusubizae kuko bitangiye kugaragara .
thank you . ||| murakoze
come only if it is the matter of testimony . those with suggestions will have their turn after . the turn is for witnesses . those who do not have testimonies should move back ; they will have their turn and give their views . ||| ariko niba ari ubuhamya tuumvikanae abafite ibitekerezo turaza kaubaha nyuma abafite ubuhamya kubijyanye nibi turi turimo kuri nyakaubahaw ariko abadafite ubuhamya bigirae nyuma turaza kaubaha umwanya nabo batangae ibitekerezo byabo .

eeh ... we spent there all the day on 14th and 15th . it seemed escaping from the rain under a sweating tree . munyakazi came with renzaho . he sent interahamwe into the church . ||| eeh ku itariki cumi n' enye maze kuhagera turahiriwe ku itariki cumi n' eshanu turahiriwe tusa nkabahungiye ubwayi mu kigunda nibwo munyakazi yaje ari na renzaho yohereza interahamwe mu kiriiya batangira kutwicaza mu kiriziya batangira kugenda bajonjora abantu babapakira muri hilux yagiye avuga itukura ,
they started seating us in the very church and picking up people whom they packed in the red pickup he has often evoked . they carried them in eight rounds till they saw strong young men had almost finished . they mainly took young men ||| bagenda bakora amaturu bakoze amaturu umunani biza kurangira ubwo babonaaga abasore babonaaga ko bafite ingufu bose babonaaga ko bagabanutse baibandaaga kubasore cyane .
eeh ! then after ... i will be brief . minuar came . they wanted to take people who wanted to go to the area controlled by rpf . minuar started by mille collines . we were carried in about two rounds . however interahamwe could stop people at times but things ceased after on the date i do not remember well . it was probably on june 15th when minuar came . meanwhile , they gave us a conference and told us they would come to take us . ||| eeh biza kubaho wenda mu magambo avunaguye haje kuza minuar ishaka kujyana abantu bashaka kujya muri zone ya fpr minuar yahereye muri mille coline twe yatukozeho nk' ituru ebyiri kusa izi interahamwe zikajya zitangira abantu ibintu bisa nibihagarara , itariki ntiibuka neza ariko nraumva hari nko kukitariki cumi n' eshanu z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu nibwo minuar yaje eeh batukoresha inama batubwira ko bazatutwara
eeh ! renzaho entered . for munyakazi , sainte @-@ famille was like his home because he usually came there . they usually came there with goats and asked to have their meal in priests ' buildings . ||| eeh hainjiyemo renzaho munyakazi we muri st famille hasaga nkaho ariwe kuko yarahahoraaga buri kihae cyane ko bakundaaga kuza bafite ihene bakabaza kuba ariho barira muri ayo mazu ya bapadiri ,
the only priest who stayed there was called wensislas munyeshyaka . he [ munyakazi ] was at sainte @-@ famille every time and every single hour . they were checking whether the number of young men was enough so that they might carry them out . ||| hari hasigaye umupadiri umwe witwaga wensisilasi munyeshyaka buri kanya buri sha yarazaaga nta kihae yabaga atari kuri st famille bareba ako abasore baba bamaze kugwira ngo baongerae babatwarae
they sometimes picked some and carried them out . once they heard that minuar would come to take us . they met and said that in case young men were taken , rpf would gain much force . it would gain soldiers . ||| bakakuramo bamwe na bamwe bakabatwara biza kugera noneho ko baumvise ngo minuar igiye kututwara nibwo habaye akanama aho aho abapadiri bararaga baravuga ngo aba basore nibaramuka bagiye fpr iraba ibonye ingufu iraba epa ibonye abasirikare nibwo bavugaaga ngo nibaramuka batwaye bazatwarae abana ,
it was decided that in case people would be taken , it had only to be children , old men and women ||| abasaza n' abagore
at that time , munyakazi himself , renzaho and munyeshayaka were standing there . they told a lady called angelina to go and come with her interahamwe in order to circle us . ||| ubwo bibaye gutyo bibaye gutyo munyakazi ubwe munyeshyaka , na na renzaho bahagaze aho babwira umudamu witwaga ngerina ngo nmanukae azamurae interahamwe ze zitugotae ,
let 's see ... they were discussing about the departure of young men on 16th that was the time they also told angelina to come with her men to surround sainte @-@ famille ||| ubwo murabona baravuze ngo abasore baramutse bagiye bose ngo cyane cyane bakubitaiyeho bariya ba ubwo babivugaaga ari ku itariki ya cumin a gatandatu ubwo noneho nibwo babwiye ngelina ngo abwirae ba basore bamanukae bagotae st famille
they [ munyakazi and others ] said that they would be bringing others during the whole night . the place was circled by the morning . munyakazi himself came and went to carry them and dropped them behind the church . about 9 , they started climbing and getting into the enclosure . they ordered to only shoot at young men and not women ||| ngo nabo bagiye kuzana abandi iryo joro ryose haraye hagotswe igitondo cyose munyakazi we ubwe uyu aza apakira amena inyuma ya kiriziya yongera asubirayo igihe cyo mu masatatu nibwo batangiye kusimbuka ikigo baravuga ngo barase uwitwa umusore wese ntibarase abagore babarekae
we were seated and some of us were opened rapid fire at . we were seated on the floor . minuar came on 17th . it arrived . those who were not killed , we were seated on the floor . munyakazi who is defending himself entered and cried @: "@ withdraw ! withdraw ! minuar are there ! ||| ubwo baratufataaga bakatwicaza hamwe bakaturasa urufaya batwicaje hasi ubwo ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi nibwo minuar yagombaaga kuza kututwara yahise iza ubwo iza abo batari baishe bari batwicaje hasi ubwo munyakazi we ubwo uhakana yahise yinjira mu kiriziya amaze kuinjira na renzaho yahise avuga ngo repris ngo repris minuar yaje
"@ get out with those you have not yet killed and kill them outside @"@ . i also stood up among them . ||| abo mutarica mubahagurukaane mugendae mubicirae hanze y' ikigo ,
when i reached sainte @-@ famille ’ s door to the steward 's office , while munyakazi and his colleagues were preventing minuar from getting in , i went to hide between containers which were there . those who lived there know it . ||| ubwo nnjyae nrahagurutse muri abo ngeze mu muryango wa st famille ahainjira muri economat hari ama continerie abahabaaga barayazi yabaga ku muryango ubwo nhagaze gutya aba ba munyakazi barimo babuza minuar kuinjira ubwo nsubiye inyuma gatoya mpita njya hagati yizo continerie
munyakazi seated us and they picked young men whom they took into the minibus that stationed next to containers outside . i do not know where it had been taken from . young men were seated in it . i stayed behind . this man owned a bar where nzeyi worked . he [ munyakazi ] even used to deliver driving licenses there some time ago in order to earn a little money . ||| munyakazi we ubwe yaratwicaje bakagenda abareba abasore babasohora babajyana mu kimodoka kiri kihagaze hanze iruhande rwa za contiers cya minibus niba kiri kiravuye he simbizi absore bagenda babicazamo bamaze kubicazamo jyewe ubwanjye nsigaye inyuma hari akabari uyu mugabo yari afite k' umugabo witwaga nzeyi kera akitanga za permis ninaho yajyaaga ajya kuzitangira kugirango bamuhae udufaranga .
the man called nzeyi was his employee . we could sometimes meet in nzeyi 's bar . i stayed behind and i went to tell munyakazi that we were not inyenzi but displaced people . we were about to go downhill a bit . one of the young men tried to get off the car and enter the steward general 's office garage . munyakazi and munyeshyaka followed him . and i moved back . ||| umugabo witwa nzeyi niwe umukoreraaga ubwo tujyaaga tuhurair muri ako kabari ka nzeyi nsigara inyuma njya kumubwira munyakazi rwose ntabwo turi inyenzi ahubwo turi impunzi ubwo turamanuka umwe muri abo basore asa nkusimbuka ngo agwae mu igaraje rya ecomat generale munyakazi na munyeshyaka bahita bagenda basa nkabamukurikiye ubwo nnjyae mpita nsubira inyuma
in so doing , ladies who worked in the infirmary that was there told me to sit down . they covered me with loincloths and sat by me . the young men sat there all along the day . in the evening , this man himself , major general in front of you , came back . ||| mukusubira inyuma hari abagore baegereye ku ivuriro hari ivuriro rivura baranbwira bati icara hasi abagore bahita banyorosa ibitenge bahita banyicara ni ruhande abo basore biriwe baicaye aho mu kihae cy' umugoroba uyu mugabo ubwe generale major mureba aha uhakana ibintu byinshi niba ahakana ariko n' imaan izabimushinja yaragarutse nimugoroba abo basore ubwe arabitwarair abo basore harimo uwo baitaaga gasongo munyensanga harimo uwiga aloys ,

he carried the young men that evening . we do not know where he took them . whether he employed them or ... we do not know . he should tell us where he might have kept our young men . he carried them away ; they were 18 . he took them away himself and only him ! though he said he had no connection with interahamwe , he once entered the church with twelve interahamwe . they were not many and there was no policeman . ||| noneho ubwo abo basore uwo mugoroba abijyanaiye aho yabashyize ntituhazi niba hari akzi yabahaye ntitubizi turagirango ubwe munyakzi atubwirae aho yatushyiriye abo basore bacu yarabatwaye bari absore cumi n' umunani arabatwara wenyine ubwe nubwo yahakanaaga ngo ntiyakoranye n' interahamwe yinjiye mu kiriziya ari kumwe n' interahamwe ari cumi n' ebyiri ntago zari nyinshi nta n' umupolisi bari kumwe yariwe

i went there on 19th ... 14th . i left when the war ended . ||| nhungiyemo kuri cumi n' icyenda icyenda na kane ,
there are people who were at sainte @-@ famille but have not seen him yet well . i beg him to stare at me carefully . he himself , stood by me wile i was sitting down . i will remind him the words he pronounced then he will remember as he said he does not know anything . ||| nvamo intambara irangiye munyakazi rero hari abantu babaye muri st famille bakaba bataramubona neza njyae nramuzi neza anyitegerezae we ubwe yanyihagarariye hejuru amagambo yanbwiye aramwibutsa ko yavuze ngo ntabizi ngo ntiyahageze
munyakazi himself first came to sainte @-@ famille .... we 've been given few minutes by the way ! ||| munyakazi ubwe abanza kuza muri st famille ariko mwaduhaye iminota mike ,
munyakazi came and took away one lady called chantal and about eight young men . he carried them in a pickup and he said he was taking them to mille collines . if the young men are still alive it might be just luck ; i can only see the woman today . ||| munyakazi yaraje atwara umugore witwa chantal atwara n' abandi basore bagera ku munani abajyana muri hilux avuga ngo abajyanye muri mille collines abo basore niba bakiriho n' amahirwe kuko uwo gore niwe nkibona wenyine
we came in very big number believing you sympathized with us . you separated those who wanted to go to the side of inyenzi and those who wanted to go to the government . realizing that the number of those who wanted to the inyenzi 's side was bigger , you became angry and moved your spectacles . ||| turahuruye tuumva ko ari impuhwe ugiye kutugirair ubwo uraje uravuga ngo abashaka kujya kuri cote ya gouvernement n' abashaka kujya kuri cote y' inyenzi ,
you talked to renzaho . i do not know what you said . only you know . you even immediately left . ||| ubwo wowe ubwawe ubonye abantu ababaye benshi bajyaiye kuri cote y' inyenzi uterura amarinette umujinya urakuica uvugana na renzaho ibyo mwavuganye simbizi ni wowe ubizi ubwo uhise usohoka uranigendera .
the following day , i think there were still few people left at mille collines . you came for evacuation . when you arrived you did not allow any man to go . when he wanted you said he was going to join inyenzi . ||| ubwo bwarakeye nraumva ubwo muri mille collines hari hasigaye abantu bakeya muza muje kutwara abantu muje kwe evacue koko uhageze ntiutumye hari umugabo numawe ugenda yaragendaaga ngo agiye mu nyenzi ,
you can see well that we know that you were present . do not try to tell a single lie . then after , you went and told the interahamwe to stop men so that only women might go . ||| uraumva ibyo uri uhari ntugirae icyo ubeshya ubwo urangije uragendaaga ukabwira interahamwe bakakumira abagabo abagore bakaba aribo bagendaaga .
even those who received them can say it . ||| abo bagendaaga basanga babakiraaga icyo kihae nabo barabibonye batubera abagabo uraumva ?
on june 16th the day i will n't forget , after people had been taken to saint @-@ paul and we were staying there , you came and stared at us ||| urangije ubwo ngubwo itariki ya cumi na gatandatu z' ukwa gatandatu ntazaibagirwa nibwo baje bamaze kutwara abantu babajyanye muri st paul twe tugumamo aho ngaho uraza uratureba
then you went out and came back at once with renzaho , commander gisunzu , angelina , and the then sector councilor called odette i guess . you went some where . you were with the interahamwe kimba and seseko . because you are saying that you were not there ; i am just reminding you . ||| urangije urasohoka umaze kugera hanze ugarutse uri kumwe na renzaho na commanda kinyoni na ngelina na conseille uri hariya ngo nimba ari odetta uragenda mujya ahantu uri n' intehamwe yitwa kinba niitwa sesaeko ubwo wowe uvuga ngo ntabwo uri uhari jyae reka wenda nkuibutse
you came and stood on the slope down which we were staying . then ... you munyakazi . they started picking people . among those left , there was a man called enock and others . there were still about ten people in front of amri 's house . you talked and after a while we saw the interahamwe standing all along the fence . we were outside the church . we were sitting in the sunshine . at once , we heard the interahamwe shooting at the door of the church . ||| icyo kihae uraje uhagarara hejuru yacu turi munsi y' umukingo nkaha urangije we munyakazi barobanura abantu icyo kihae nraumva abantu barrio basigayemo umugabo witwa enock abaitwa bande , mbese hasigayemo abantu bagera nko mu icumi inberae yo ... inberae yo kwa amuri muravuganaaa mukanya gatoya ubwo tugiye kubona tubona interahamwe zihagaze hejuru y' ikigo hose zimaze kuhagarara hejuru y' ikigo turi hanze turimo kaota akazuba ubwo tugiye kaumva tuumva zirashe urugi rwa st famille ku kiriziya .
women had stayed in . they ran out . meanwhile , there was a policeman with them called yoramu or something alike . he was from ruyenzi . he had arrived in the morning and told us @: "@ you know what ! today might be your last day ! inyenzi have taken others with them . what about you then ? @" ||| abadamu nibo bari barimo nibo basohotse bairukanka ubwo nsubiye n' inyuma gato ubwo umupilisi bari bafite witwaga ngo niba ari yoramu wo ku ruyenzi yaje mu gitondo uwo munsi aratubwira ngo sha ngo akanyu karabaye ngo inyenzi izindi zazijyanye ngo mwebwe mubaye abande ?
what he had predicted became true . you came with many interahamwe . every man was shot at . we survived by heaven 's will . only god saved us because no man would have survived . we stayed there till the night . i understand why you say you do not know it ; it is because it did not concern you . i was hiding in grass . there were toilets we had dug . ||| ubwo koko akacu katubayeho ubwo uraje n' interahamwe nyinshi nyinshi umuntu w' umugabo uwo ariwe wese ubwo baramurashe uko tusigaye ntawe ntitubizi n' imaan yaturokoye kuko nta muntu witwa umugabo bigejeje nijoro tuvuye ahantu turi tuihishe ubwo ahntu wowe uvuga ngo ntiunabizi ntibinakurebaaga jyewe ubwanjye nihishe ahantu hari ibintu by' ibyatsi hari amatoillette turi turacukuye
then i went down . i ran when gunshots worsened . somewhere down i joined men sitting down . these are the men my preceding colleague was talking about . you came and stood on the slope . ||| nrangije nramanuka njya hepfo amasasu abaye menshi nyirukankamo ubwo nragenda nsanga abntu bari baicaye ahagana hepfo uyu umbanjirije yavugaaga uraje utuhagarara hejuru
he asked me @: "@ why have you come here ? @" ||| ati ubundi wowe uje hano kugira kutae ?
i told him @: that "@ i am businessman and all the money was taken from me ; so i have no money to give them so that i might be released . so i have come here @"@ . he asked me @: "@ why have n't stayed on the yard and prefer to join inyenzi ? @" i said @: "@ i just came here ! @" ||| nramubwira nti nracuruzaaga nfite amafaranga baranyambura none nbuze ibyo nbaha bashaka kunyica nza kuhungira hano ati kuki utagiye ku kibuga uje hano mu nyenzi kugira kutae ?
he asked me with whom i was . i gestured like this and showed him that i was with all of them . he asked me @: "@ why are with all of these inyenzi ? @" ||| nti hano niho niyiziye aranbwira ngo uri kumwe na nde ? nhise ngira gutya nti aba bose turi kumwe ngo izi zose muri kumwe se kubera iki .
then , came another black tall young man in sports suit . his name must be ntirugiribambe samuel ; i guess . you were standing nearby . he was brought there . others were immediately shot at in the very place . you asked @: "@ why are bringing this ? @" they immediately shot at him and he ran away saying @: "@ mercy ! mercy ! @" on that you said @: "@ taste it ! why did you come here ? @" ||| arangije ubwo ngubwo tuhise tuicara haza umugabo nibutse uri unbaye amatraining w' umusore muremure w' igikara witwa ngo ntirukiribambae samuel aza atuhungiramo uhagaze hejuru yacu urangije bamuzanye bamushoreye kuko abandi bahise babarasair aho wowe uramubwiye ngo iki cyo murakijyana he ? bahita bamurasa arairukanka avuga ngo bamubabarirae bamubabarirae urangije uravuga ngo ... ntubizi ujyaaga he

on 19th , you , munyakazi , came back and took away people you found there . you said that there were others you had taken from the church . you came to us and we were about eight people down the water tank . you were with an interahamwe . he himself said that at rugenge . you started designating people telling them to stand up . the interahamwe beat me with a gun on my back , i fell down and you came to stand by me and wondered @: "@ what hell on earth has this come here for ! @" ||| uyu munyakazi uragarutse ku itariki cumi n' icyenda uraza utwara abantu mwasanze ubwo muvuga ngo mwavanye abandi mu kiriziya uraje usanga turi abantu bagera ku munani munsi y' ikigega uri kumwe n' interahamwe yarabiivugaiye muri rugengae urangije wowe uhita uvuga ngo wowe kanaka haguruka wowe kanaka haguruka iyo nterahamwe yangezeho inkubita imbunda kabiri mu mugongo nikubita hasi urangije uraza umpagarara hejuru uravuga ngo iki kijyaaga hehe .

it was in 1990 , i do not remember the date ; james will say it himself . munyakazi took james and a person nicknamed the priest to police station . it was kigali central prison in the time . ||| jemes munyakazi yamutwaye muri mirongo icyenda itariki ntinyibuka jemes yazabiivugair ari kumwe nuwo baitaaga padiri amujyana kuri brigade yari prison centrale ya kigali ,
i was told this by james . ||| yari kumwe nuwo baita padiri ayo ni amakuru jemes yanbwiye ,
when they arrived there he told them @: "@ do you see the place ? @" james will say this himself ; i only say this so that we grasp the information in advance . ||| abagejejeyo arababwira ngo hariya murahareba ubwo jemes nboneka azabiivugair ariko nbivuze kugirango amakuru ataza kutucika
arrived , he told them that he wanted to take them to that place . they both resisted . then he told them @: "@ let 's forget about for the moment @"@ . he immediately called muhima police station office . since then they were jailed . it was in the time of "@ accomplices ' imprisonment @"@ . that is all i was told . we might ask him personally when he will be present . ||| bagezeyo arababwira ngo ntashaka kubajyana hariya jemes yihagararaho we nuwo baita padiri arangije arababwira ngo reka mbe nbaihoreye arangije ahita abwira kuri brigade muhaima bahita babafunga ni cya kihae cy' ibyitso nayo makuru yanbwiye wenda twazamwibariza nza .
you were coming for final cleansing . you were accompanying them and you arrived there . i would like also to beg you to ask the minister of defense here present because they once arrived together at saint @-@ paul . he arrived , i was with robert and many other guys whose i do not remember names since i have not prepared it properly . i have just come from cyangugu unexpectedly . when i heard that he would be invited , i took the advantage because i have come twice and it did not ||| mwaje muje kukunba muje kukuraho umwanda urabaherekeje urahagera ndetse muzae kumbariza na ministriri w' ingabo uri hano kuko nawe bigeze kuzana muri st paul yarahageze icyo kihae yari jyae na robert n' abandi nbanri benshii ntinibuka amazina ntinbishyize neza kuri gahunda kuko nvuye icyangugu kare bintunguye biba ngombaw numvise ko muri bumuhamagarae nnjyae nza kuitaba kuko anje kabiri bianga .

his excellence munyakazi arrived . after he left father munyeshyaka came too . they continued to saint @-@ paul . it is too difficult for me to provide full information in fact . i am afraid i may lose control . however , i can answer some few questions if there are any . or ... you may even ask the very questions to renzaho or any other you may find belonging to his group . ||| ariko nyiricyubahiro munyakazi yarahaje ahavuye padiri munyeshyaka arahaza nyuma baza kukomeza na st paul kuburyo kugirango nzabahae amakuru yose birangoye ntaza guhungabana kikora kikora hari utubazo mwatubwira ntubasubiza cg mukazatubaza renzaho n' undi wese ushobora kuboneka kuko ari mugikundi kimwe nawe

we know that munyeshyaka lives in france . probably he would like to know what you know about munyeshyaka 's role because he might have been close to you . would you give some explanations about that ? let 's start by that one . ||| ibya munyeshyaka we tuziko aba mu bufaransa , usibye kowenda ashaka kumenya uruhare kuri munyeshyaka bigaragara ko mwari muziraanye ntinzi niba hari icyo mwasobanuraho kuri munyeshyaka tuhereye kuri icyo cya nyuma .

when rpf had taken people from saint @-@ paul , you know there was a zone belonging to rpf , interahamwe attacked all the places . ||| fpr imaze kujyana abantu bari muri centre st paul muzi zone yari iya fpr interahamwe zateye hariya hantu rwose ,
i immediately went to hotel de milles collines because the interahamwe had just broken doors there ||| jyewe nhise njya kuri hotel mille collines kuko interahamwe zari zatangiye kusatura inzugi zo muri hotel mille collines .
though it is being said that i was at sainte @-@ famille chasing minuar soldiers , those who were in that area were staying at hotel de mille collines . i spent the entire day with them . their commander was lieutenant @-@ colonel mwangi from congo brazzaville ||| ibyo bavuga ngo nri kuri eglise st famille nirukana minuar ingabo za minuar zari ziri muri iriya zone zari ziri kuri hotel mille collines turirirwanye zari ziyobowe na lieutenant colonel mwangi wa kongo braza .
i never chased minuar soldiers . neither did i see the attacks of interahamwe as i told the tribunal . ||| nta ngabo zo muri minuar nigeze nirukana muri kariya kacae nta n' ibitero by' interahamwe nyoboye nkuko nri nbibwiye urukiko .
so let us ask you some questions . many questions have been asked in fact but we shall help you to go faster ||| noneho reka twebwe tukubaze ku bibazo bikeya ariko babajije byinshi riko twebwe turakufasha kugirango biihutae utafashe inzira ndende .
there is a question by nyirangazare about the conference you co @-@ presided with renzaho tharcisse saying they had to leave kigali for their places of birth ||| hari ikibazo cya nyirangazare yababjije ku buryo mwabakoreshereje amanama ku kimihurura na renzaho tharcisse muvuga ko bagomba kuva mu mujyi wa kigali bataha .
you shall explain the reason for that in brief . ||| ubwo urasobanura impamvu azabyo kugirango mu magambo akeya , ibyo bintu birabaye ?
did it take place or no ? ||| ntibibaye ?
it did n't ||| ntago bibaye
she evoked something of sainte @-@ famille but you have been explaining that . ||| hari ibyo yakuvuzeho muri st famille ariko byo ukomeje kubisobanura ,
there is one question left ||| hasigaye kimwe
what i can add , if you do allow ! ||| ikindi nvuga munbabariye ,
i read of nyirangazare in new times and someone called gasongo was often evoked . ||| ikindi jyae nvuga kuri nyirangazare nbonye muri new taimae ko yari yatangaraije urukiko bavuga umuntu baita gasongo nbonye na none bakunze kumwibandaho cyane
it is said that i took away that gasongo from kibuye on that day when he left saint @-@ paul center ||| umuntu baita gasongo ukomoka ku kibuye uwo muntu baita gasongo , uwo munsi avuye muri centre st paul bavuga ko ngo nmutwaye
concerning what gasasira said they had submitted the accusations in the army auditor 's office , at nzabanita joseph 's , i did n't know it . i was never called in order to provide explanations ||| ibyuko kasasair yavuze yuko ngo ibirego bari barabigejeje muri oditor militaire kwa nzabanita joseph , ibyo ntago nri nbizi kuko ntago bigeze bampamagara ngo nisobanurae .
a member of the commission once joined me in gisenyi . i will say his name later as you said this is not a trial . ||| umuntu uri muri iyo commission ubwo nraza kaubaha izina ryabo izina rye nraza kuribaha kuko bvuze ko tutari mu rubanza ,
i was with officers i commanded . he told them that there were many accusations against lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi ||| yansanze ku gisenyi ndi hamwe nab a officers nyoboraaga arababwira ati hari ibintu byinshi bavuga kuri lieutenant colonel munyakazi .
however , we conducted an investigation and we found that rugema donatien and prefect kabera were wrongfully accusing lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi . ||| ariko tukoze iperereza rirambuye tusanga rugema dona tien na prefet kabera babeshyera lieutenant colonel munyakazi
the person would have been here and give you explanations if he had not been abroad . if things do not improve , he told me he will come ||| none uwo muntu yagombaaga kuba ari hano kugirango abibasobanuraire nuko ari hanze yari yanbwiye ko ibibazo bikomeza kugaruka yari kuza kubasobanurair
and show you that it was found out that those accusations were fake ones brought to me whereas we are all leaders as it sometimes happens when one hates another ||| akabaereka ko ibyo bintu basanze ari ibintu abantu bahimbaaga kandi ari abayobozi nnjyae ndi umuyobozi nkuko bisanzwe bigenda rimwe na rimwe iyo wanga umuntu .
the person joined me there and told me that i was wrongfully accused ; that i never killed a single individual ; that those i took away ||| uwo muntu rero yasanze ndi muri abo bantu aravuga ati barakubeshyeraaga abo bantu ntago ubatwaye nta muntu wishe abo utwaye
on 17th , 18th , and 19th i took them to saint @-@ michel cathedral ; that they found out that they are all alive . it was said when i was with officers ; they may come and tell you . ||| kuri cumi na karindwi , cumi n' umunani , cumi n' icyenda , wabajyanyr muri cathedrale st michel bose tusanze bariho babivuze ndi hamwe nba officers nabo bazaza baka bibabwira
i never knew that investigation conducted by the army auditor 's office . that 's all i knew . ||| ariko iyo enquete yakorwaaga na oditora militaire ntabwo nigeze nyimenya ibyo ngibyo nibyo nmenye .
you are going too far sir . we have what we are asking you that is simpler . ||| nyakaubahaw ibyo ngibyo urimo urajya kure cyane kandi twebwe tufite ibyo turimo kukubaza bya hafi .
saying they were to provide some information . they must be those you took away in order to save them . what would you say ? ||| muvuga ko hari ibyo bagiye kusobanura ngirango wenda ntinzi niba aribo babanri utwaye ugiye kukiza uratusobanurair
he , as well as others , may be wondering @: who proved innocent ? where are others ? would you explain it more ? ||| ngirango we aribaza ati n' abandi babiibajijeho ababaye aberae ni bande ? abandi bari hehe ? kugirango bisobanuke neza

i went there even at the time of gomme falling down . ||| nkubwiye ko n' igihe gomme yagwga ngiyeyo ,
every time there was a problem and i was called upon for help i went as an authority ||| iyo habaaga ikibazo bakanyitabaza bati hari ikibazo njyaagayo nk' umuyobozi .
given many people always died there -@ you might be aware of it yourself @- and that you arrived at sainte @-@ famille sir ; ||| none se nyakaubahaw ko abantu bagiye bapfa ari benshi cyane kandi buri munsi kandi nawe ngirango urabizi kandi ugeraaga muri st famille
i also told you i did my best to help the population ||| kandi nkubwiye ko nkoze uko nshoboye kugirango ntabarae abaturage
would you spare our worries about the people who died on 17th and 16th whom epa said you put their bodies in the steward 's office buildings , ||| noneho tumarae impungenge kuri abo bantu bapfuye ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi na cumi na gatandatu uyu epa yavuze ko imirambo yabo mwayijyanye muri economat
in the steward general 's office garage in order to hide them from minuar general ? would you tell us about that general ? ||| generale muri karaje ya econamat generale kugirango muyihishe minuar ntize kuyibona ibyo bintu bitubwiraeho ?
i did not kill them . ||| ntabwo arijyae ubaishe !
here is the whole story @: ||| ngiye kukubwira ukuntu bapfuye
eeh ! tell us if you do know ||| eeh niba ubizi bitubwirae
as i told you , interahamwe attacked saint @-@ paul center , sainte @-@ famille church , and hotel de mille collines . ||| ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi bakunze kuyivuga nkuko nkubwiye , interahamwe zateye centre st paul , eglise st famille , hotel mille collines ,
i was at hotel de mille collines . ||| zihateye jyae nkubwiye yuko nri muri hotel mille collines
interahamwe entered sainte @-@ famille church , took people form the church and shot at them between procure and the church . as i was told by some priests .... i saw one here by the way ! ||| interahamwe zirainjiye zikura abantu muri eglise st famille zibarasair hagati ya procule na eglise st famille imirambo yabo nkuko abapadiri babinbwiye nbonye hari n' umupadiri uri hano
he might explain it to you . ||| wenda azae kuza kubibasobanuri ,
... their bodies were taken to the steward general 's office buildings . that took place yes but as i told you i did not head that attack ||| babajyana kuri economat generale ibyo birabaye ariko nkuko nkubwiye icyo gitero cy' interahamwe bangerekaho
i was told by priests that the bodies were taken from where they had been shot at , between the church , procure and priests ' buildings ||| abapadiri banbwiye ko imirambo barayifashe bayivana aho ngaho babarasaiye hagati ya procule na kiriziya n' amazu y' abapadiri
people were shot at there . there were many interahamwe ; that is true . i was at hotel de mille collines ||| muri ako kacae niho babarasaiye babavanyemo kuko interahmwe zaje ari nyinshi icyo kihae jyewe nri kuri hotel mille collines .
i never headed those attacks though i have just been accused of it together with colonel renzaho , angelina and odette ||| ntabwo nyoboye icyo bitero uretse ko mu birego byose biri bihari mwahawe baeretse urukiko ko icyo gitero arijyae uri ukiyoboye na colonel renzaho na ngelina na odette
i was at hotel de mille collines helping all people who were there . i think it was that time when father uwimana saw that i had just helped people ||| jyae nri kuri hotel mille collines nrimo kutabara abantu bose bari kuri hotel mille collines ngirango nibwo padiri uwimana yabonye yuko nrangije kutabara abantu
and asked me to go and help the people who were at father vermerie 's ||| ansaba kujya kutabara abantu bari kwa padiri vemeshe

my mother is kamanazi charlotte ||| hanyuma mama akaba kamanazi charlotte
year of birth ? ||| uvutse ryari ?
i would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ||| eeh nagirango nbabwirae yuko iriya minota mwatanze kugirango umuntu ababwirae ibyabereye kuris t famille na st paul ari mikeya
whereas it is the center of the problem . ||| kandi itsindo ry' ikibazo ariho riri ,
people have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way ||| abantu nraumva baba bafite imformations ziba zitandukanye kuko uko ibintu biri bimeze ntago abantu babibonaaga kimwe .
we , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @: ||| twebwe rero nk' abapadiri bari bashinzwe kureba abantu bari bahungiye kuri st famille no kuris t paul ariko tutiyibagije ko hari abandi bantu bari hanze
on sainte @-@ famille primary school playground , on sainte @-@ famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by interahamwe ||| ku kibuga cy' amashuri ya st famille abo ngabo bari ku kibuga cya st famille n' abantu bari barahunze imirwano batafite ikibazo cy' interahamwe
those who were at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul even at cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from interahamwe ||| abari st paul no muri st famille ndetse no mu ntangiro muri cela n' abantu bahungaaga ahubwo interahamwe .
right ! ||| eeeh twebwe rero ,
we did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from interahamwe ||| kubera ko abntu bazaaga batuhungiraho ntabwo turi tuzi abo bantu abo aribo ngo tuvugae ngo wowe urahunga interamwe eeh wowe nta nterahamwe uhunga
we did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . that means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings ||| ariko ibyo ngibyo tubikoreraaga kubera umutekano wa bose nukuvuga rero yuko ubwacu nk' abapadiri mu ibanga tukoraaga inama nimugoroba
in order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there ||| kugirango tukusaanye ibyo tugiye tubwiraw hirya no hino kigirango tumenye uko tushobora tukomeza kumenya kufasha abantu bari barahahungiye
we did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against sainte @-@ famille ||| uwaduhaga information ntabwo tuvugaaga ngo umuntu yatuhaye information twagirango tubabwirae ko informations tubonaaga z' ibitero bigombaaga kuza muri st paul no muri st famille .
there were even people who held meetings among them . ||| harimo n' abantu bakoranaaga inama nabo ,
there were xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack . ||| habaaga harimo abasaveri , bakaza bakatubwira abti muitondae ejo cg ejobundi barimo kutegura igitero .
the information could be got that way ||| ubwo tukabimenya
since we could not know those who were connected to interahamwe , we did not reveal anything . ||| hanyuma rero kubera ko nkuwo munsi utabaga uzi iziri kukorana n' interahamwe ntawari kubimenya niyo mpamvu tuirindaaga kugira ibintu tusohora bimenyekana .
one could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . that is the way it worked ||| kuko ushoboraaga kubisohora ugasnag nibo bagiye kututanga , nuko nguko rero muri rusangae tukoraaga .
i do not even know why people have not evoked munyeshyaka . munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . he never intended to betray people . ||| na munyeshyaka batinyaaga kuvuga ntinzi impamvu batinya kumuvuga ntabwo yakoze , nta na rimwe yigeze ashaka no kuicisha abo bantu bavuga .
that is why i was telling you people understand things in differently . we , as priests either in sainte @-@ famille or ||| ubuhamya bwo , nibyo nbabwiraaga ngo abantu tufite ukuntu tubiumva kuburyo butandukanye twebwe rero nk' abapadiri , ari muri st paul ari muri st famille
saint @-@ paul ... we had appointed father celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ paul . i do n't know why people did not mention that interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies ||| muri st paul hari hashinzwe padiri celestin ariwe uri uhinzwe izo mpunzi ntinzi impamvu bataigeze bavuga yuko n' interahamwe naho zahageze zatwaye abantu nabo bapfuye
as they came to sainte @-@ famille to take and kill people . this leads me to talking about munyakazi now ||| nkuko muri st famille abntu baje bakabatwara bakabica icyo kugirango nagirango nvugae kubierekeye na munyakazi
what i am telling you is a true testimony . i would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul ||| ibyo ngibyo rero ngiye kubabwira nrababwira n ukuri n' ubuhamya ariko na none ikindi nagirango nbabwirae nuko hari abasirikare baje kurinda kuris t famille no kuri st paul
we had resorted to minister aloys . munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and interahamwe were coming to kill people ||| abasirikare turi twitabaje ministiri aloys padiri munyeshyaka akamubwira yuko ibitero biri biraye bihaje , akmubwira yuko interamwe irmo kuza kuica abantu .
he said he was going to handle the situation . i worked with munyeshyaka . then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day . ||| niwe uvuze ati tugiye kureba ukuntu tufasha ubwo nyuma yaho jyae nkoranye na munyeshyaka tugiye kubona tubona abajandarume baraje .
gendarmes settled at procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed . ||| hari abajandarume bari ku muryango winjiraga kuri procule kubera yuko abantu bari barahungiye kuri st famille bari mu kiriziya inzugi zo z' inyuma zari zifunze .
once a very strong attack came to take people from sainte @-@ famille and because interahamwe entered in disorder , ||| kaereka nyine ubwo haigeze kuza igitero kikomeye noneho rero tusaba kubera yuko interahamwe kubera ko zainjiraaga uko zibonye zije kutwara abntu muri st famille
we asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance . ||| tugeze naho tusaba tuti abajandarume bahari ngo nizizajya ziza imbunda bajyae bazibambura bazisigae ku muryango aho bainjirairaga ,
they did it . ||| bagiye babikora .
however as i said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks ||| ariko rero iyo hazaaga igitero kikomeye nkuko nigeze kubivuga igitero kikomeye cy' interahamwe nta kihae abo bajandarume bigeze babihagarika .
they were stronger than them till munyakazi himself some were stronger than him ||| bibarushaaga ingufu pe ndetse wenda na munyakazi yaza kugera aho avuga ko nawe hari ibyo atashoboye .
please , listen ! ||| murekae tuumvikanae
i still have the floor . if we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things ||| nracyakomeza kuko niba tushaka kuvugaish ukuri tujyae tuvuga ukuntu ibintu bigenze
we shall ask him questions . ||| reka tuze kumubaza ,
he will explain . listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his . ||| aratusobanurair murekae tuumvikanae , aravuga wenda ibyo azi n' undi aravuga ibyo azi ,
please , stop shouting ||| mucecekae tuumvikanae .
what i can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed . ||| eeh ikindi rero na none nbabwira , mu bajandarume bari baratuhaye kugirango barindae abantu harimo bamwe b' umutima mubi bashakaaga koko ko abo bantu babica .
it became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield ||| ndetse harimo bamwe bisabye ko babahindura kubera yuko bazaaga bakavuga bati turairirwa turinze inyenzi abasirikare bacu barimo kupfair ku rugamba baicwa nazo ?
we asked that some might be transferred . you can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out . ||| muri abo ngabo harimo abo tusabye barabatuhindurair ubundi mu ntangiriro babanri babaga bari ku kibuga ngirango murabizi bajyaaga kuvoma ubundi bakaza kugurisha n' abantu bari mu kiriziya batashoboraaga kusohoka
after that , the interahamwe talked about who were at sainte @-@ famille set a barrier saying inyenzi were being given water . ||| bigeze aho ahubwo za nterahamwe bavugaaga zari ziri aho ngaho hafi kuri st famille zaje kushyiraho bariyeri kuko bavugaaga ngo barazanira amazi inyenzi
after the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . they did it . ||| izo bariyeri rero zimaze kujyaho tuiambaje abajandarume ngo bajyae batufasha no kujya bajya kutuzanira amazi barabikoze .
in the parish yuhi where i lived , i went with major nsanzimfura jean baptiste after having called him for help that that the assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . i told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place ||| muri paroisse nbagamo yitwa yuhi njyanye numu na major nsanzimfura jean batiste nmaze kumutaba za ko ababikira bagiye ababikira ba basomption bagiye kubicira aho bari babasize nramubwira nti irukae iwanyu bahakorae genocide
he told me to go and take them . i first feared to go far and he ensured me that if i was to die we would both die . ||| aranbwira ati reka tujyende tujyae kubazana nbanza no kugira ubwoba nti jyae ntinrenga hariya hepfo aranbwira ati ngwino tugende niba uri buze kupfa turapfaan .
so , we went together . ||| nibwo tugiye turajyana ,
okay ! that evening we were facilitated from gitikinyoni to sainte @-@ famille by one thing ; ||| bon ubwo nimugoroba wicyo kihae byaranudafashije kuburyo bumwe kuko kuturuka ku giti cy' inyoni kugera kuri st famille
inkotanyi were shooting and bombarding a lot in order to come and take people from saint @-@ paul . ||| inkotanyi zarimo kurasa amasasu menshi kugirango zibonae uko ziza kutwara abntu muri st paul .
we came and arrived around midnight because our tyre deflated . we had never been at ease all along the journey . at any time we could be told @: ||| ubwo ngubwo turaje tuhageze nka sasita z' ijoro kubera ko imodoka yaje kutupfumukairho nriko kuturukayo ntabwo tugize amahoro kuko baratubwiraaga bati
"@ speed up ! we may get shot at @" because the car was slow . ||| muhitae mutaturashisha kuko imodoka yagendaaga gahoro bakavuga ngo muhitae mutaturashisha
arrived at sainte @-@ famille , i spent the night in procure with father munyeshyaka because i had forgotten the keys of the door from the steward 's office to saint @-@ paul . ||| ubwo tugeze kuri st famille eeh jyewe nrara muri procule nri kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka kubera ko imfunguzo zacaaga muri economat zijya muri st paul nri nzaibagiwe .
then we heard a lot of bullet shots in saint @-@ paul ||| hanyuma icyo kihae nibwo tuumvise igitero hirya muri st paul barasa amasasu menshi
i remember that father munyeshyaka told a soldier called murekezi to call minadef and tell them that interahamwe were killing people left at saint @-@ paul ||| hanyuma nrabiibuka ubwo padiri munyeshyaka niwe ubwiye umusirikare witwa murekezi ati telephone kuri minadef ubabwirae ko interahamwe zirimo kuica abantu bari basigaye muri st paul .
the soldier did then told him @: "@ inkotanyi are already there @"@ . they had just known what we thought was wrong . ||| uwo musirikare yarabikoze ahita amubwira ati ngwino ....... ati inkotanyi zagezemo ubwo bari bamaze kumenya yuko atari byo .
i wanted to leave then and i told them that at night one can not recognize that another wears a bulletproof . ||| hanyuma nshatse kugenda nibwo nbabwiye nti nijoro ntabwo umenya ko baambaye ziriya za anti bar isasu barimukubita ,
what they said is true he wore a bulletproof . ||| ibyo bavugaaga byo nibyo yari yambaye anti bar .
the following morning -@ i had already spent the night in procure @- the intrepid people i talked about ... i mean interahamwe ||| bon , noneho rero icyo kihae bucyeye bawho kubera ko jyewe nri nraye muri procule babantu nbabwiraaga bari ku mashuri ya primaire batatinyaaga eeh eeh interahamwe .
would you be brief father ? there are still other people who want to talk ||| padiri twagirango uhinae amagambo hari n' abandi basigaye
okay ! i just want to tell you about the following morning . ||| eeh ubwo ngubwo muri make twagirango tubabwirae mu gitondo bw' icyo kihae ,
it is true that colonel munyakazi arrived ||| nubwo bavugaaga colonel munyakazi yarahageze .
in the morning ||| mu gitondo
on 17th ? ||| cyo kuri cumi na karindwi ?
no sooner had they said so than i quickly ran to hide in saint @-@ paul . ||| ubwo bamaze kuvuga gutyo jyewe nibwo nnyarutse mpita njya kuihisha muri st paul .
as i was saying , those people really died in the yard of priests ' buildings . ||| icyo kihae rero nkuko nvugaaga abo bantu barahapfairiye , bapfairiye mu busitani bwo mu mazu ya bapadiri
after they were killed , the bodies were thrown in the grave that was in the steward general 's office garage ||| hanyuma koko abo bantu bamaze kubica imirambo baje kuyishyira muri fosse yo mu igaraje rya economat generale
i can n't say that ... i with others wo were in saint @-@ paul only heard they were being killed . we ourselves were hiding ||| ariko rero ntinvuga tuumvaaga ukuntu barimo kubica jyewe muri icyo kihae n' abandi bari muri st paul turi ntawe turimo kuihisha .
in the afternoon , around 5 p.m. general munyakazi came to take us . he took us to the archbishop 's palace . ||| nyuma rero nimugoroba nka sakumi n' imwe niho generale munyakazi koko yaje kututwara atujyana muri archeveche .
we went there . some time after the french bernard couchner met us there . we told him @: "@ so to verify the scandals , ||| niho tugiye icyo kihae na nyuma yaho nibwo tuje kubona uriya bernard couchener w' ubufaransa atusanzeyo turamubwira tuti kugirango urebae amarorerwa barimo kukora
go to sainte @-@ famille and enter the garage ; you will see a heap of bodies @"@ . ||| ugendae ujyae muri st famille ujyae mu igaraje urasanga imirambo ihari y' ikirunga .
it was true because we had just known that the bodies were still there . ||| kandi icyo kihae byaribyo niho turi tumenye yuko iyo mirambo yari ikiri aho ngaho .
that is what happened there but the story is longer than that . if there are questions you may ask me . ||| aho ngaho nuko bigenze , niba rero ni byinshi niba hari ibibazo mwambaza jyewe .
i want to ask you one question father ; the bodies thrown in the garage , have they been exhumed and worthily buried or not yet ? ||| padiri , padiri hari akantu gato nshaka kukubaza jyewe , imirambo yajugunyawe muri iyo fosse ya economt yarataburuwe iranshyinguraw cg ?
after some time after the bodies went stinking and people came and went to bury them . but where they were buried .... ||| imirambo yahamaze iminsi itangiye kunuka baje kubatwara bajy kubashyingura ariko aho bajyaiye kubashyingura
who took them away ? ||| ni bande babatwaye ?
i can not know that . we were at archbishop 's palace at that time . i do n't have information ||| nnjyae ibyo ntinbibabwira kuko icyo kihae turi turi muri archeveche nta information nbona
were they taken from the graves and taken away ? ||| bayivanye muri iyo fosse se baraongera barayitwara ?
they were taken from the graves and taken away ? the graves were still stinking even after war . ||| bayikuye muri iyo fosse baraongera abarayitwara ndetse intambara inarangiye nizo fosse zari zikinuka .
have you said munyeshyaka had a bullet @-@ proof and a pistol ? ||| utubwiye ko munyeshyaka yari afite anti bar na pistori ?
was he a soldier ? ||| ubwo se yari umusirikare ?
munyeshyaka first owned a kalashnikov , then ||| munyeshyaka yabanje kubona imbunda ahubwo ya carachinikove , noneho
please listen ||| murekae tuumvae
he once phoned me and told me that he had just had a gun . i went and joined him at sainte @-@ famille . i asked him whether he could dare bear a gun on his shoulders and walk . ||| yarampamagaye arantelephona ati ubu jyewe maze kubona imbunda nragenda njya kumureba hariya kuri st famille nramubwira nti imbunda uyishyira kurutugu uri padiri ukayitwara ?
he told me that it was of course heavy . ||| aranbwira ati koko iraremereye .
he told me that he was going to ask for a pistol . ||| ati ngiye kuaka pistole ,
he asked for it and he got it . i asked him whether he would shoot at person with it . he slipped on his shirt and put it here . ||| pistole yarayatse arayibona nragenda nramubwira nti iyo pistole uzayirashisha umuntu ? yabanje kutebeza akayishyira hano
then i told him @: "@ what will you do with a pistol ? @" ||| hanyuma rero nragenda nramubwira nti pistole uzayikoresha iki ?
he answered @: "@ i can not dare kill . ||| aranbwira ati jyewe ntabwo nshobora kutinyuka kurasa umuntu
it is just to make the interahamwe believe that i am one of them and then fear me @"@ . ||| ati nukugirango interahamwe zinbonae zibonae yuko ndi uwazo zintinye ,
that is what he told me . ||| ibyo nibyo yanbwiraaga ,
so , i told him to slip on it but not to reveal it . ||| noneho nramubwira nti yishyirae inberae ubonae kutebeza ntuyerekanae .
"@ it would be of no use . @"@ why would i have asked for it if i slip on it then ? it is just to make the interahamwe fear me , see me and find in me a partner @" he said . ||| noneho aranbwira ati nyishyize inberae se nba nrayakaiye iki ? ati nukugirango interahamwe zintinye zinbonae kandi zijyae zibona ko tufatanije .
are you allowed that at least ? ||| nibyo ngibyo ? murabyemerewe ariko ubundi ?
munyakazi arrived there in the morning . ||| ko uwo munsi mu gitondo munyakazi yageze hariya ?
what did you talk with him ? what did he come for ? ||| mwavuganye iki yari aje kuhakora iki ?
i did not talk to him ||| munyakazi ntabwo tuvuganye
what did he come for ? ||| yari aje kukora iki ?
i do not even know that . ||| n' icyari kimuzanye ntabwo nkibabwira ,
i just got out of procure -@ i spent my night there @- and i found him there . then after he left . i would be lying if i gave further explanations ||| jyewe kusa icyo nvuga nsohotse muri procule noneho nsohotse muri procule niho nri nraye nza kumubona aho ngaho nyuma aza kugenda ibindi bisobanuro nnjyae nba nbeshye .

they immediately went in the church together with interahamwe . i do not know their names because i was from cyahafi sector . ||| baba bainjiye mu kiriziya n' interahamwe zo muri rugengae jyae ntabwo nzibuka amazina kuko nkomokaaga muri secteur ya cyahafi ,
angelina saw me and exclaimed @: "@ tutsis , you are as hardy as weed . are you still alive mukandutiye ? @" she was an acquaintance of mine actually . ||| angelina yanjyezeho aravuga ngo ariko ababtutsi n' urwiri koko ngo nawe mukanrutaiye uracyariho ? dore ko turi tuziraanye rero .

for the first round , he carried bidede and others . ||| iyo modoka yatwayemo ba bidede inshuro ya mbere ,
what about the second and the third ? ||| inshuro ya kabiri harimo bande , inshuro ya gatatu harimo bande ?
the first round i am talking about there were bideli and other young men from kacyiru whose names i do not remember . ||| ku bwa bidede nibwo nvuga nyine aribwo bwa mbere ariko apakiraanye nba basore aribo harimo abana bo ku kacyiru ntinibuka amazina yabo ,
there were also other guys from nyanza ||| harimo n' abandi bana ba ba nyenyanza ,

i am talking about bidede because he was the first to be caught , then shot , and finally burnt with oil ||| kuko impamvu nvuga kuri bidede nuko ariwe babanje kuica bakamutwikaish na essence ,
from there , they went downhill killing people up to the farm in rugenge sector . ||| noneho bamanuka bica kurinda kugera hariya munsi y' igipangu cy' inka muri secteur rugengae
when the car reached , people on board included @: ngamije , ||| ariko iyo modoka mukuza kwayo ba ngamije , nagmije

they told me to join others and go to cleanse . ||| ubwo noneho bankoraho ngo ninze njyanae n' abandi njyae gushwangurira ishyamba iyo myanda tuyikuramo ,
i told them that i did not understand that language . i sat down again . i was holding a bible . ||| nrababwira nti jyewe ntinjya nshwangurura ntinzi gushwangurura ibyo aribyo jyewe niicarair nri nfite bibiriya mu ntoki
they went up cleansing as they said . they went to saint @-@ paul . the first person who approached me is mazimpaka who asked me about murashi 's son ... ||| barazamuka bajya gushwangurura koko bagiye muri st paul .......... uwa mbere ni mazimpaka ungeze iruhande aranbwira ngo n' uriya muhungu wa murashi
he told me that in case i found one of his family members i would tell him about his death . of course if would be still alive myself ! ||| aranbwira ngo nombona uwi wabo usigaye nimba nnjyae nzaba nkiriho nzababwirae aho yaguye ubwo ni hariya inberae yo kwa thomas kandi koko ni mbere yo kwa thomas yaguye
no sooner had he said it than ngamije and ndagijimana asked me whether i knew him . i said that i did , that his name was mazimpaka . they ordered me @: @" go this way ! follow him @" ||| akibivuga gutyo noneho baranbwira ngo uramuzi nti nramuzi , nti yitwa mazimpaka ngo ca hano ujyanae nawe uwo ni ndagijimana na ngamije ,
then i told them @: "@ yes i will @"@ . when i wanted to stop they pushed me and i fell on the other side of the road . i sat there . ||| noneho njyae nrababwira nti umva rero kujya nawe ntibinbujije nrajyana nawe ngiye kuhahagarara bantera senteri ngwa hirya y' umuhanda nicara aho ngaho
they started their task . what i want to say is that though munyakazi is denying the red car , it went for the first round , went back to carry others . it went three times . ||| batangira kukora ariko rero icyo nvuga nuko munyakazi ahakana iyo modoka imodoka yakoze inshuro ya mbere isubirayo ijya kuzana abandi imodoka yakoze inshuro eshatu
for the third round he brought those young men . they were sixteen . they were killed in cnd down rugenge sector 's office . ||| ku nshuro ya gatatu nibwo bazanye abo bahungu bavuga ababazanye ari cumi na batandatu babicira hariya muri cnd iri munsi ya secteur rugengae
there was mutarambirwa 's son who jumped over the fence of the house over there and went downhill through those houses . ||| ubwo harimo umwana wo kwa mutarambairw ubwo niwe uvuye asimbuka igipangu iriya nzu iri hariya hepfo amanuka hepfo muri ariya mazu .
this is written in the cell gacaca court record . ||| ariko byo biraanditse muri gacaca y' akagari
another part @: those who were hiding in sainte @-@ famille church . i think he might clarify those things and how he does not know the car ... actually i once saw him in the white car ||| noneho nizo zari zihishe muri iki kigo cya st famille ibyo ngibyo rero ashobora kubisobanura ko ngo imodoka atayizi iyo modoka y' umweru avuga ko yagendaagamo yigeze kuyinyuramo
that he acknowledges . he came to the barrier to see someone . i do know the man who was with him . he immediately met one cell leader from rugenge ; narcisse . ||| ayimanukamo hari umuntu yari aje kureba kuri bariyeri yari hariya kuri secteur rugengae umugabo bari kumwe simuzi ahubwo icyo kihae nuko yahise ahura na responsible wo muri rugengae narcisse
they went together some steps to nyanza . i was watching . after some minutes they were back and held a small a meeting . they left nyirabagenzi there who ordered not to tear tutsis ' steel sheets anymore but collect them and later be used to build houses to live in , ||| batambikaan berekera hirya nkabareba inyanza mu kanya gatoya rero baje kugaruka bakoresha inama hasigara nyirabagenzi arimo avuga ng amabati y' abatutsi ngo ntibaongerae kuyatemagura ngo bazayarunda rundae ngo bajyae bayubakaish inzu bo bazigiramo .
and to grant to the poor survivors some of the steel sheets . ||| ngo akazaba kasigaye ngo nako muzakaihorerae ngo muzakatueraire kuri ayo mabati
the following morning , mukeshimana 's father came to destroy steel sheets of nzabonitegeka gaston 's houses . when he started , i reminded him that the sector councilor had ordered them not to destroy steel sheets . ||| buracya se wa nkeshimana yaje mu isoko aza kusenya ya mabati y' inzu zo kwa gaston nzabonitegeka noneho atangiye kusenya nramubwira nti ariko se ko conseille yababwiye yuko mutazaongera kuyatemagura
i asked him @: "@ why are you destroying them ? what will you build your own houses with ? @" ||| none nkaba nreba muayemagura mwebwe muzaubakaish iki ?
on that , he ordered jonas ' son to come and teach me a lesson and go back to carry wood . ||| noneho nibwo yabwiraaga umuhungu wa yonasi witwa michel ngo zamuka ngo ubanzae umutikure ho gatoya ngo noneho ngo ugarukae uzae kutwara ibiti
please evariste ; tell us about the role of this man first . we shall follow up that after ||| ravliste tubwirae uruhare rw' uyu mugabo urangizae ibindi tuzabikurikirana .
his role is that though he is denying the car , everything was done under his command . jonas ' son beat me here ! ||| uruhare nuko ahakana ko iyo modoka atayizi ariko byose bikomokaaga iwe , dore ahangaha niho aha ankaha niho yonani umuhungu we yankubise ...........
nurses there could not treat me . then they told me to go out very quickly because something bad was to take place in a short time . ||| ngiyeyo nabo birabananira noneho nibwo bavugaaga bati gira vuba usohokaemo muri aka kanya hagiye kukorwa akantu
when i went down to sainte @-@ famille the interahamwe there took me and made me sit down there all the day . munyakazi should not deny because he used the two cars . ||| nramanuka njya st famille nramanuka no hasi aho hasi kuntuza interahamwe zari ziri hasi nizo zanfashe zairirwa zinyicaje aho ngaho ariko byose rero munyakazi natbihakane kuko izo modoka zombi yarazikoresheje .

because it was a place where they thought they could be safe . we arrived and spent four days there . i do n't know the dates . you may ask munyakazican because he participated in attacks and entered there . ||| kuko ariho hantu hari haihishe babona bashobora kubaho twrahageze rerpo hariya muri cela tuahamara iminsi igera kuri ine ntimunbaze itariki itariki muzibaze nka munyakazi we ukabagamo ibitero cg winjiyemo ...
we spent about four days . on the second day , young men who were there , we thought of establishing self @-@ defense system against interahamwe ||| ee tuhama iminsi nk' ine ariko kumunsi wa kabiri tukoresheje uko tushoboye abasore bari bahari turavuga ngo reka turebae uko tushyiraho uburinzi cg tushyiraeho ukuirinda tuirwanaho mu buryo bw' interahamwe
so that they might not easily invade . ||| zitashoboaraga kuza kuinjira zainjira uko zibonye kose ,
the formed self @-@ defense group was made of albert , the chief , ||| eee tushyiraho ako kantu ko kuinjira kakomeye kakizawe n' umuhungu umwe witwaga albertniwe uri shef
gihana , makombe , and others whose i do not remember names . ||| hagakurikiraho uwitwaga kihana , hagakurikiraho umuhungu witwa makombe hagakurikiraho n' abandi ntiibuka amazina
the group was so strong that we beat the first interahamwe 's attack . at the second time beat them as well . ||| ubwo ako kagurupe tushyizeho tubona n' akantu kakomeye interahamwe zituteye bwa mbere turazitsinda noneho ubaw akabiri zirateraw ziratsindwa
we were no longer afraid . ||| noneho tugeze aho tubona nta bwoba tufite akalisti tuakamanika kurukuta ,
we hanged on the entrance wall and the following one the timetable for watching in turns to ensure everybody 's security . ||| kurukuta rubanza no hirya tumanika akandi mbese ukuntu tuvugana ukuntu tuzajya tukora uburinzi kuburyo nta nugomba kugira ubwoba nyuma
after being severely defeated , the interahamwe went to resort to a higher security level . you know well it was headed by the very munyakazi who even headed the following attack . this shows he had been called upon by them . ||| ubwo rero interahamwe zabonye zimaze kutsindwa kuburyo bukomeye noneho baragenda batabaza ubutegetsi bukuru muziko buri buyobowe n' uyu mugabo munyakazi kuko niwe uje aziri inberae bigaragara ko ariwe bagiye kutabaza .
when they came , they were with this man , renzaho tharcisse , angelina and many others i do not remember well . ||| uyu mugabo barazana ari kumwe n' uwitwa renzaho tharcisse , n' uwitwa ngelina ,
people who are here know and remember them . ||| n' abandi ntiibuka abantu bose bari hano barabazi kandi barabaibuka .
we went and approached our chief aside and let munyakazi , renzaho and others get in . they passed through between cela buildings . you can see the corridor yourself ||| nuko tuesae tuegera uwari mukuru wacu albert tujya kuruhande munyakazi uyu nguyu nabo ba renzaho barainjira baca hagati hariya muri cela ngirango murahareba ukuntu hakurikiraanye
they went past the first house , reached the second which was seemingly a chapel , where some were hiding . ||| baca ku nzu ya mbere itambitse noneho iya kabiri iriho akantu kameze nka ka chapelle abantu bose bari bihishe muri ako kashapelle
others were in a guava garden . they told all people to come to the upper side . ||| abandi bari inyuma ahantu hari amapera noneho baravuga bati abantu muesae muzamukae ,
munyakazi himself gave the order of closing the upper path . they started cutting down the bush on the upper side in order to see who might be hiding there . ||| munyakzi uyu nguyu niwe uvuze ngo mutangiraire haruguru aho ngaho batangira kutema ibihuru kugirango barebae nuwaba yihishe haruguru aho ngaho .
we gathered . everyone was taken from the hideaway . renzaho said @: "@ there are now only tutsis . shoot at them @"@ . ||| ubwo tuesae turaterana uwihishe hose hose uwishe wese baramuzamura renzaho tharicisse arivugair ati n' abatutsi kusa noneho nimubarase
this one said to wait lest there should be hutus among them . i ask him to remember ; he said that instead of being killed together they should be killed according to their residence places . ||| uyu nguyu munyakazi aravuga ngo nibabe boroheje ngo hataba harimo n' abahutu ubwo ubwe abiibukae neza yaravuze ngo aho kubica bose ngo nibabice bakurikije ahantu bagiye baturuka
"@ muhima here , kimicanga , upper kiyovu , lower kiyovu @"@ , he himself pronounced those words . ||| abo ku muhaima bajyae aha , abo ku kimicanga bajyae aha , ngo abo mu kiyovu cya ruguru bajyae aha nabo mu kiyovu cyino bajyae aha nkaha iryo jambo n' uyu mugabo witwa munyakazi urivuze .
he said that people should be killed . he used those words . ||| ngo babae ariko babica
all people gathered according to their regions or sectors of origin . i , my two elder brothers , my cousin and few other people did not have any group to belong to . ||| ubwo abantu bose bajya ahntu bagiye baturuka muturerae twabo cg se mu mirenge yabo noneho twebwe bakuru banjye babiri na mubyara wanjye n' abanddi bakey ngirango aba bari inaha twebwe tubura aho mukicae tujyamo
renzaho asked @: "@ where do these belong to ? @" we answered @: "@ we are visitors from kibungo . ||| noneho renzaho aravuga ngoa ab ngaba se n' abahehe ?
we do not have reason to enter any of the groups . integrate us wherever you like . you may kill or save us @" ||| turavuga ngo twebwe turi abashyitsi tuje tuturutse ikibungo noneho nta mpamvu yo kugirango tujyae muri aba mushakae aho mutuishyirair mwatwica mwadukiza uuh .
the mother went down to call her husband where he was hiding behind a cupboard . no sooner had they arrived than this one and his men took them and killed the whole family there . ||| nyina aramanuka ajya aho yari yihishe inyuma y' akabati akimuzana aba ngaba bamujyanaan n' abana be babicira aho ngaho nabo
that one started killing people like that at everyone 's sight with a cruel torture in cela ||| nuko batangira kuica muri ubwo buryo bica abantu kumugaragaro iica rubozo riteye ubwoba hariya hantu muri cela
someone called .... has been asked and did not dare say it but this man in front of you headed the attack at cela . ||| uwitwa .... ... nkomeje kaumva barimo kumubaza abantu bakatinya kumuvuga ariko uyu mugabo uyu mugabo uyu nguyu niwe uyoboye igitero hariya hantu muri cela
for the sake of reliable information collection , in case he feels i am not telling the truth , i would beg him to come and say for example : @"@ this and this is not true or i did not arrive there @"@ ... ||| niba yumva ko hari icyo mubeshyera azae hano kugirango wenda ibintu bigendae neza iti kusanya makuru ryacu rigendae neza arekae kuhakana wenda ngiye cg se azabihindurae ukundi azae avugae ati aho ngaho ntabwo anahageze .
he was fully there ! he watched the death of people , he gave suggestions holding pistol when the interahamwe were doing their best to exterminate people , tutsis . ||| yari ahari atya abantu bose bapfuye ahari atanga aibitekerezo afite imbunda ya pistole mu ntoki n' interahamwe n' abasirikare bakoresheje uko bashoboye ngo baze bicae abantu abatutsi ngo babamaraeho
just after degode , wilson , gihana , vincent who was a judge were killed , ||| ubwo ngubwo bimaze kugenda gutyo ubwo ngubwo uwo degode na wilson , nuwundi witwa kihani n' uwitwaga vincent uri umucamanza bamaze kuicirwa aho ngaho ako kanya
this very man ordered that the people gathered in sectors and cells be taken away to be killed . ||| noneho baravuga ngo noneho babanri bagiye muri za secteur no mu ma serire nimubajyane mujyae kubicira ahandi uyu mugabo we ubwe ariwe ubiivugair
munyakazi himself , as you see him in front of you , wore his trousers far below the waist , very proudly , believing himself to be the almighty ||| we ubwe munyakazi uko ameze uku nguku yari yambaye ipantaro yayimanuye gutya yaregeje yumva mbese nta n' ikintu kimukoraho
and my cousin they worked together thought that because renzaho was from kibungo , he would save them . so they went to him . ||| na mubyara wanjye bakoranaaga kuri iyo modoka baravuga bati uyu renzaho ubwo ari umunyakibungo reka tumuhungiraeho wenda araza kutukiza
they went to that side . i and my elder brother stayed with this man . there was also another called antoinet . they told us @: "@ join those interahamwe @"@ . ||| nubwo abo ngabo bajya ho ngaho kuri iyi cote hamwe na mukuru wanjye nkurikira tugumaye aho ngaho hamwe n' uyu mugabo witwa antoinet baravuga ngo mwebwe nimugendae musangae ziriya nterahamwe .
that was actually a way of delivering us to them . fortunately , we went through the entrance of cela , we went and arrived among displaced people at sainte @-@ famille . ||| turagenda tuca tuca mu muryango wa cela turazamuka haruguru mu buryo bwo kututanga ariko ubwo imaan iza kuturinda turagenda tugera mu mpunzi zari ziri kuri st famille
when we joined those displaced people who were in sainte @-@ famille , they all moved away from me because i was easily remarkable . i mean ... among the wanted . ||| tuinjiye mu mpunzi zari ziri kuri st famille kubera ko ari jyae ugaragaraaga cyane ugaragaraaga mbese mu bahigawaga jyae ninjiye muri st famille nkigeramo bose barahunga
both tutsis and hutus left me alone on the yard so that i might be caught . ||| ari iz' abahutu zari zihari ari iz' abatutsi zarizihari bose baba bansize mu kibuga jyenyine kugirango baze bantwarae
i thought that instead of betraying others i should stay and be taken from there . ||| nuko nrareba nravuga aho kugirango nicishae abandi reka nigumaire aha nkaha hafi noneho baze bantwarae ndi aha nkaha
it was about 10 or 11 a.m. people were being taken away one after one , slowly by slowly . i was still with my brother . ||| ubwo hari mu masayine sayine satanu barimo batwra abantu buhoro buhoro ubwo na mukuru wanjye tukiri kumwe
the following day , i was the only one to survive among the security group . others were killed in my eyes like yours who did such a work . ||| ubwo bukeye bawho kuri liste y' abantu bakoraaga uburinzi ni jyewe uri usigayeho abandi bari bapfuye tubibona nk' abanyu bakoraaga ubwo burinzi
they called @: "@ nyirinkwaya @"@ ... first they called albert @: "@ is albert around ? @" he was n't . "@ gihana ? @" he was n't . ||| nuko barahamagara , baravuga ngo nyirinkwaya , barabanje bahamagara albert arbert arahari barahamagaraaaa baramubura bahamagara kihana barmubura ,
then they called my name ||| bahamagara izina ryanjye
i thought @: @"@ this is my end now . ||| bati nyirinkwaya ari hehe ?
let me just go @"@ . i put off my coat and my watch ; i gave them to my elder brother so to keep them and i decided to go . ||| nrabireba nkavuga nti ni hahanri nragiye ikote nri nambaye nrariambura nraita hasi n' isaha nri nambaye nbaita hasi mpita mbihereza mukuru wanjye nti ibi ngibi uzabisigaraane ubungubu nragiye .
luckily one of the interahamwe , faustin , said @: "@ we have absolutely killed all these inyenzi ! @" they called another who came after me on the list . his name was makombe . he is also here right now , he can give you his testimony ||| nuko ku bw' amahirwe umwe aravuga ngo w' interahamwe witwaga faustin aravuga ngo apuu ngo izi nyenzi ngo turazaishe bahamagaye undi muhungu witwa makombe uri unkurikiye ubu ngubu nawe arahari nawe yabibabwira yabaha ubu buhamya
he was the fourth to be called and i was the third . because they had just thought we all died , we survived that way . ||| bamuhamagara ngirengo ari uwa kane ankurikiye jyewe nri uwa gatatu nawe tugira imaan bavuze ngo aba bantu bose bapfuye turokoka muri ubwo buryo .
this man munyakazi , himself , headed the attacks at cela . he is responsible for the death of those people . absolutely ! i saw these things with my own eyes . i even have more . ||| ariko uyu mugabo witwa munyakazi uyu nguyu yayoboye ubwicanyi bubereye muri cela bamuriose abo bantu babamubaze n' amakuru jyae niboneye ntya ntya ntya ibintu nvuga rero ni byinshi cyane
there are men namely rutabana who said that he killed people at sainte @-@ famille . yes , he [ munyakazi ] once came and found me sitting where i used to sit -@ people moved any time i would sit near them @- ||| hari abagabo bavuze rero nkabo ngabo bitwarutabana yari uvuze ngo yishe abantu muri st famille yaraje jyewe ansanga mu kiriziya aho nri nihishe nicaraaga ahntu nkuicara abantu bose bakagenda
i was sitting like this . he held the coat i was wearing like this , and told me to go out . all people murmured @: "@ the guy is finished now ! absolutely ! @" ||| nicaye ntya araza afata ku ikoti ryanjye gutya ryo nri namabaye aranbwira ngo ninsohoke noneho abantu bose baravuga ngo wa muntu aragiye wa muntu aragiye
at that time i decided to go to cook porridge where the interahamwe often passed so to be caught from a public place instead of betraying others . ||| kugeza ubwo jyewe nfashe icyemezo nkahaguruka nkajya kuteka ikikoma aho interahamwe zacaaga kugiango zizansangae ahntu hagaragara ntiriwe nicisha abndi bantu

she asked again @: "@ do you mean you will n't come ? @" i answered @: "@ definitely ; i will n't @"@ . ||| ati noneho nturi bujyaeyo ?

i had a son , kagame who was already murdered . ||| ariko hagati aho nkaba nri nfite umwana abntu baishe kagame
we went to sainte @-@ famille . munyakazi and minuar were there . they said @: "@ because people have come to join inyenzi , let 's make a list of those who are joining the government 's side and those on the inyenzi 's @"@ . ||| ubwo tuhungira st famille mpageze uriya mugabo munyakazi icyo kihae minuar yari ihari baravuga bati ubwo abantu baje mu nyenzi mubahae igipapuro abaje mu nyenzi baiandikae n' abaje muri gouvernement baiandikae .
they told us to write our names and the side we wanted to go to . some refused . i told my colleagues that it probably intended to abduct us . ||| umuntu ajyae yandika izina kandi avugae naho agiye kujya ubwo bakoze ama liste bamwe turanga nrababwira nti ibyo aribyo byose nukugirango bajyae babona uko babiba
during the two days i had been abducted twice and people with me had paid for my ransom . ||| kuko muri iyo minsi ibiri bari bamaze kunwara nk' inshuro ebyiri abantu turi kumwe bantangira amafranga
one gendarme once took me and told me @: "@ for this time , come @"@ . i asked him @: @"@ where are you taking me brother ? @" he replied @: "@ you already know where you are usually taken @"@ . ||| hari umujandarume umwe untwaye aranbwira ati noneho ngwino tugende nti se sha munjyanye he ?
i thought that was actually my end . ||| ngo aho tubajyana se urahayobewe nravuga nti noneho karabaye
people gave money . some of them are even here . on that day , the lists arrived back from minuar . munyakazi had been with the father all the day ||| abantu batanga amafranga rwose benshi bamwe bari aha birangiye ubwo impapuro ziragaruka zivuye muri minuar munyakazi uwo munsi yari yirirwanye na padiri
talking . they said that people should be observed and put into their categories ; tall ones ... the young priest father munyeshyaka -@ i do n't master his names ! sometimes i am likely to .... ||| bavugana kuburyo baravugaaga bati abantu mubarebae mujyae mumenya uko bameze abarebare , padiri mujeni munyeshyaka ntinjya menya n' izina rye numva nshaka ..........
okay ! then father munyeshyaka with this man said @: "@ follow this order ; separate tall people from others @"@ . ||| bon nuko noneho bageze aho baravuga bati noneho mukurikize , munyeshyaka abivugana nuyu mugabo ati n' ukureba abantu barebare mukajya mubatandukanya
on that day , they had been holding a meeting all the day . father munyeshyaka came wearing a bullet @-@ proof holding a pistol . when he was celebrating the mass and moved like this the pistol fell down . ||| kuburyo uwo munsi bamaze kuvugana bari birirwanye mu nama padiri yaraje munyeshyaka yambaye anti bar n' imbunda atusomair missa ari kutusomair missa akoze gutya pistole iragwa
when it fell down we wondered @: "@ who is this guy reading the word of god with a gun that that has started falling down ! will n't he shoot at us in the church ? @" ||| iguye nibwo tuvuze tuti se umuntu ujya kusoma ijambo ry' imaan akaba atangiye kuzana n' imbunda zikubita hasi agiye kuturasair mu kiriziya
i had been there for few days . i had failed to arrive before . finally minuar said that the lists had to be drawn again and that selection would take place at the football playground ||| ubwo ngiye kubona kubw' amahirwe kuko jyae nri mpamaze iminsi mike nrabuze uko mpagera ubwo minuar iratangira iravuga ngo nugutoranya ama liste bunri bushya bakajya barobanurair ku kibuga cy' umupira .

they said @: "@ make sure munyentwali does not escape . can you imagine someone who called his son kagame ? can you imagine that ? he even refused to go to rwigema 's burial saying he was not an enemy . by the way , you , sector councilor , why have kept such a person till today ? @" ||| baravuga bati munyentwari ntava ntabacikae umuntu wise umwana we kagame ibyo bintu murabiumva murabiumva kandi akaba yaranze no kushyingura rwigema avuga ngo si umwanzi ati ahubwo conseille uyu muntu wawe kuki umutunze kugeza iki kihae ?
it was on the playground . i was about to get on the truck . this man and munyeshyaka refused absolutely . it became a great dispute . finally , minuar took me away by force . ||| ku kibuga ndi ku ikamyo barabianga pe uyu mugabo arabianga we na padiri induru iravuga minuar niyo yanfashe baranrwanair banjyana ku ngufu
those who stayed at sainte @-@ famille were killed after we left . i was at kabuga . that was my testimony . ||| uraumva rero ibyabaye nyuma kuko nmaze kugera ikabuga nibwo st famille abasigayemo bose babaishe nnjyae ngeze ikabuga ubuhamya ntanze nubwo ngubwo
we were together for thirty minutes during the dispute with minuar when i was getting on board . how can he be denying all these things ? ||| kandi yari ahari turahagararaanye hafi nk' iminota mirongo itatu minuar iri kunrwanair ngo ninurire imodoka ngendae none ibyo bintu byose ari kubihakana .
he was preventing you from getting on board ? ||| niwe ukuangiraaga
he and munyeshyaka . they said that i had to stay because i was not on the list . they checked the list and found out that i had a different name . i had my identity card with me . they refused saying that i should wait for my turn and i could be alive till that time . ||| we na munyeshyaka bavuga ngo ninsigare ngo kubera ko jyewe ntanditswe kuri liste bararebye koko basanga siko nitwa irangamuntu nri nyifite baranga ngo nintegereze izina ryanjye kandi izina ryanjye ntabwo nri kurigeraho
i had already been abducted for five times . people paid for my ransom . i was only abducted by gendarmes . no interahamwe did . ||| bari bamaze kuntwara inshuro zingahe zigera kuri eshanu abantu bose turi kumwe bamaze kaungura hari abajandarume bantwara nta nterahamwe yazaaga kuntwara nta n' interahamwe yantwaye n' abajandaraume bantwaye .

i , nkusi antoine swear to god that what i am going to say is true . ||| njyewe nkusi antoine ntanze imaan ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri .
what i am going to say about munyakazi is true . ||| nkubyo ngiye kuguga rero ni kuri uyu mugabo munyakazi .
on the 7th we escaped to ..... we spent many days there . i will n't say much of him . ||| ku itari ya karindwi tuhungiye muri ..... tuhamaze iminsi simuvugaho byinshi .
my colleague already said it and we were together ||| kuko uriya wambanjirije yabivuzeho kandi turabanaaga .
we were even in the same group ||| no muri ako gakipe turi turi kumwe ko kuba tubasha kuirinda .
but we were dispersed by this man and his men . ||| ariko uyu mugabo igitero cye cyose niwe utusheshe .
and nyirabagenzi . they were always together . ||| na nyirabagenzi nkuko byavugagwa ntabwo basigaanaga .
we were hiding and had been gathered together , this man observed ||| uyu mugabo ...... aho turi tuihishe hose bakaturundanyiriza hanze yararebye asanga .
and realized that people of his ethnic group would also die with us in case we were all killed . ||| koko hari kupfamo abo yita benewabo .
he said @: "@ put them in groups according to their cells of origin @"@ . it was done as such . ||| aravuga ati murobanurae mufatae celile yaho umuntu yavuye aza niko bigenze .
some were packed into the car . among those rwanga and his children . ||| bamwe nibwo babapakiraiye aho mu modoka harimo abana bo kwa rwanga bangahe na se .
he is responsible for all of that because he did it there . after some time we left the place ||| ibyo byose bitairirwa uyu mugado kuko niwe ubikoraaga aho hantu tuje kuhava .
covering our heads with mattresses . some went to sainte @-@ famille . ||| tugenda tuitwikiraiye za matora bamwe tujya saint famille .
fortunately we arrived at sainte @-@ famille . he was always there . ||| tugize amahirwa saint famille turainjira ariko ntiyahasibaaga ari kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka .
to show us their bodies so to worthily bury them . that 's it . ||| atuereka amagufa yabo tuyashyingurae mucyubahiro nraumva ibiangae ari ibyo .
thank you ! my name is safari , rugenge sector , ||| murakoze nitwa safari ......... tutuye mu murengae wa rugengae .
nyarugenge district , kigali city . what i have realized about this man , munyakazi .... ||| mu karerae ka nyarugengae m untara y' umugi wa kigali ngewe ikintu nbonye kuri uyu mugabo munyakazi .
i , safari hamoud , swear to god that what i am going to say is true ||| njyewe safari hamudu ntanze imaan ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri .
what i have realized about this man , munyakazi is that he is contradicting himself ||| ngwee ibyo nbonye kuri uyu mugabo munyakazi nbonyeko afite imvugo ebyiri .
as far as 1990 and 2005 are concerned . ||| afite imvugo yo muri mirongo cyenda na kane akagira ni mvugo yo muri 2005 .
one might say he is adjusting his position to vision 2020 ! ||| kieretse niba imvugo ihinduka ikanjyana vision 2020 .
though he has been denying the red car , he actually traveled in it in 1994 . ||| ...... muri mirongo icyenda na kane nubwo yahakanaaga imodoka yagiyemo iriya y' umutuku .
he looked out of the window and told them @: "@ what is wrong ? there is no shit here ! @" ||| avana umutwe mu modoka arazibwira ati ko nta mwanda nbona hano .
the interahamwe answered him @: "@ we have no tools @" ||| interahamwe ziramusubiza ziti ntabikoresho tufite .
he replied @: "@ how come that you do n't ? @" he looked out of the window again and talked to the gendarmes in the boot . ||| ahita abasubiza ati mubura ibikoresho mutae avana umutwe mu mudoka abwira abajandarume bari inyuma .
he told them @: "@ provide them with tools @"@ . they immediately gave them grenades . i wonder how the shit had to be removed with grenades ! ||| arababwira ati mubahae ibikoresho bahise babaha grenade niba rero uwo mwanda niba ushobora kuteruraw na grenade .
was that a wheelbarrow to remove the shit ? ||| cyangwa niba ari ingorofani yari abahaye yo kukuraho uwo mwanda .
after being supplied by him , they entered my aunt 's house where i was staying . ||| yamaze kuzibaha bahise bainjira kwa masenge aho nrinri .
they met me the first . they told me to stand on my knees . they told me @: " say your last pray because you are going to die ! @" ||| ninjye bahise bahingukairho baranfata baramfukamisha baranbwira ngo ninsenge ngiye kupfa .
i stood on my knees and say my prayer in arabic . they said @: "@ this one is talking to kagame in their language @"@ . ||| nrapfukamye nsenga mucyarabu baravuga ngo uyu nguyu ari kuvugana na kagame ubwo asenze mubirimi byabo .
i did not know our father and i mixed it with hail mary . ||| dawe uri mwijuru ntinri nyizi nyivanga na ntakuramutsa mariya .
another called david , beat me with a machete in my back . ||| noneho interahamwe yitwa david yahise inkubita ikibatira cy' umuhoro hano mu mugongo .
the interahamwe called maroc saw me and remembered that we used to play together at kimihurura . ||| iyo nterahamwe yitwa maroc iranbona ibona tuigeze kukinana hari ku kimihurura .
he said @: @"@ this boy is not an inyenzi . we used to play together at kimihurura . ||| iravuga iti ariko uyu mwana ntabwo ari inyenzi uyu mwana tuigeze kukinana umupira hariya ku kimihurura .
i never saw him involved in such things @"@ . ||| ntabwo nigeaze mubona ajya mubintu byinshi cyane .
he held the grenade given to him by munyakazi . he told them @: "@ if you kill him , i send you to hell with this grenade . i swear ! @" ||| yari afite iyo grenade munyakazi yari amaze kumuha arababwira ati muramutse mu mwishe nnjyae nrabatwika niyi grenade .
they were frightened and left me . i do n't understand why munyakazi is standing here ||| bagira ubwoba nibwo banretse ntinumva rero impamvu munyakazi ahagarara hano .
and denies that he travelled in the red car , that he supplied the interahamwe ||| akahakana iyo modoka y' umutuku yagiyemo akavuga ngo ntabikoresho yahaye interahamwe .
i was born in 1949 ||| nvutse ine nicyenda .
cell of birth ? ||| uvukair mukahae kagari ?
muyange cell . i am going to give you my testimony ||| akagali ka muyangae ngiye kaubaha ubuhamya .
raise your right hand and swear ||| zamura ikiganza kiburyo urahirae .
i , mukangarambe domithile , swear to god that what i am going to say is true ||| ngwee muka nkarambae domitira ntanze imaan ho umuhamya ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri .
the testimony i want to give to you is that this man munyakazi ... first he held a meeting . he was with odette . ||| ubuhamya nshaka kaubaha nuko uyu mugabo munyakazi yarabanje aza kukoresha inama we na odeta .
in the meeting , they told people to destroy tutsis ' houses so that their sons might have steel sheets to cover their houses . ||| bakoresha inama bavugango basenya amazu y' abatutsi ngo abahungu babo babonae amabati yo kaubakaish .
after the meeting people came downhill . there was an old man of my neighborhood called charles kabendegeri who ||| ubwo bamaze kuyikoresha abantu baramanuka hari umusaza tuturanye witwa karoli kabendegeri .
he pointed at me and said @: "@ it is as if traitors who are here have not heard what the gendarmerie commander has told us @: ||| ngo ibyitso biraha amunyereka ngo ntibiumvise umukuru wa jandarumori icyo yatubyiye .
that we must get rid of these traitors @"@ . something else i want to say about munyakazi concerns the people he is denying . ||| ngo ibi byitso biraha ngo nukubyikiza ikindi nvuga kuri munyakazi abo bantu numva ahakana .
i mean one hundred eighty @-@ six of sainte @-@ famille ||| ijana na mirongo inani nabatandatu ba saint famille .
they were put on minitrap 's truck . ||| babashyize mu kimodoka cya minitrape .
they drove them down to kiyovu . ||| babamanukaan baza mukiyovu .
munyakazi was in a red car though he is denying it . ||| munyakazi ari mu modoka itukura nubwo avuga ngo nta modoka yagenzemo .
he came with a driver from the gendarmerie called murindwa ||| azana umushoferi wabo wa jandarumori witwa muhirwa .
who was my neighbor . he arrived asking whether there were not tutsi shit . ||| turi tuturanye aza abaza ngo ese ntamyanda y' abatutsi ngo iraha nkaha .
they turned back the truck . the car of this one followed it . he was asking @: "@ is n't there any shit here ? @" ||| baza kaongera iyo modoka barayikiranura baragenda uyu nguyu ayigenda inyuma agenda abaza ngo nta myanda iraha .
others could reply @: "@ when we kill , we immediately bury ! we do not need help ! @" ||| bavuga ngo twebwe ngo iyo tuishe ngo tuhita tuihambira .
who said that "@ when we kill , we immediately bury . we do not need help ! @"@ ? ||| ibyo bivuzawe nande ko iyo baishe bihambira ?
the interahamwe who were there . murindwa also said it . ||| n' interahamwe zari ziri aho na murindaw nawe yarabimubwiye .
he told them to get on the truck and he followed them . only he knows where he carried them . ||| aburiza muri icyo kimodoka kuko yari abari inyuma niwe rero kuko niwe uzi aho babajyanye .
i saw him again when the gendarmerie headquarters was captured by inkotanyi . he came to see murindwa and told him to go and carry soldiers ||| babatubwira nongera kumubona inkotanyi zafashe kuri jandarumori aza kushaka murindaw amubwira ngo azae atwarae abasirikari .
having lost their legs . those who were dead were carried to gisenyi to be buried . ||| bacitse amaguru baba bapfuye bakajya kubahamba i gisenyi .
i saw him again coming to murindwa 's house . he said @: "@ i think the inyenzi are beating us now ! @" ||| nongera kumubona aza kwa murindaw avuga ngo ubanza inyenzi zigiye kutunesha .
i can n't imagine why he is defending himself whereas he used to come to people 's homes to hold meetings . ||| ntinzi rero impamvu arimo kuhakana kandi no mungo yarazaaga akakoresha amanama .
i did not even know that his name was munyakazi . ||| ngewe ntinri nziko yitwa munyakazi .
he used to come with nyirabagenzi and others to hold meetings . ||| yarazaaga naho hose nabanyirabagenzi baraza naho hose bakora amanama .
i can n't imagine why he says he was not involved in killings ||| ntinzi impamvu arimo kuhakana ngo ntabwo yigeze ajya mubwicanyi .
whereas he is the one to have sensitized people about the presence of inyenzi ! ||| kandi ariwe wa sansibilizaga ngo hano hari inyenzi .
that is what i had to talk about him according to what i saw . ||| ngewe nraumva ibyo nmuvugaho aribyo nkuko nmubonye .
let 's start by gisimba damas ||| hari umuntu witwa gisimba damas reka abe ariwe tubanza .
my names are mutezintare gisimba damas son of gisimba and mukamanzi dancile ||| nitwa mutezintare gisimba damas mwene gisimba .... na mukamanzi dansila .
be brief . you only have three minutes ||| mu magambo make iminota itatu kusa niyo tukuhaye .
briefly , i met him during the war . ||| mu magambo make rero nuko tuhuye mu ntiambara .
i was at nyamirambo , in my orphanage ||| ngewe nri i nyamirambo ku kigo cy' imfubyi mpagarariye .
there were many displaced children because there had been an orphanage for a long time . ||| hahungiye abana benshi kuko kiri kisanzwe ari ikigo kirair imfumbyi .
many children having lost their parents escaped there . there are even those who were killed there . ||| hahungiye abana benshi bamaze kuicirwa ababyeyi biciyemo n' abandi .........
the war was very cruel ; the interahamwe often attacked us but failed to harm us . ||| intambara yabaye mbi cyane interahamwe zikatutera zikajya ziza ....... biranga .
try to be quick , mister gisimba ||| gisimba wihute utubwirae .
something important i did is that i hid people ||| njyewe ibintu bikomeye ngerageje kuhisha abantu .
the operation to displace people was carried out by major karangwa ||| operation rero yo kugirango abantu bavae hariya i nyamirambo yakozwe na major karangaw .
he and about four gendarmes took us from nyamirambo . ||| niwe utukuye hano i nyamirambo n' abajandarume bageze nko kuri bane .
we went to saint @-@ michel . once munyakazi came there . ||| ...... tujya saint michel , saint michel rero munyakazi yarainjiye rimwe .
he came , observed and did not say a thing . ||| uwo munsi yarainjiye aritegereza ntiyagira ikintu avuga .
we were hosted by father karibushi , the then parish priest . ||| padiri karibushi niwe utuakiriye niwe uri padiri mukuru .
he had first hesitated and i told him @: "@ these are displaced people of mine . remember the vow you made to god ! ||| abanza kugira ingingimira nramubwira nti aba n' impunzi zanjye kandi nawe uri padiri nicyo usezeranaiye imaan .
all people are your sheep . these are mine i put within your hands . ||| ko abantu bose ari intama zawe nti nangae izi nrazikuzaniye n' intama zaangae .
they are yours as well @"@ . i did not see him anymore . soldiers abruptly got in . ||| arizo zawe ubwo ngubwo ntabwo nongeye kumubona ntinzi uko hainjiye abandi basirikare .
i resisted because i could see that they wanted to trick me in order to kill them . ||| nkomeza nyine kuangira kuko numva ari amayeri yo kugirango yo kugirango babicae .
i could n't see in lycee notre dame anything that would separate me from the children . ||| kuko numva notre dame ntakintu kihari kugirango kintandukanye n' abana .
i went on tricking them till they were all confused and gave up . ||| ubwo ngiye mbajisha kuburyo bigeze aho bakabaihorera bose .
during those days we arrived , interahamwe killed none of mine or displaced people . ||| nta muntu rero muri ayo matariki twahagereye nabo nhasanze b' impunzi .
no one was killed by interahamwe at saint @-@ michel ||| nta muntu uhaguye yishwe n' interahamwe hariya kuri saint michel .
do you mean that no one died at saint @-@ michel ? ||| kuri saint michel nta bantu bahaguye uhari .
no one died when i was there . we stayed there for very few days , ||| nta bantu ngewe bahaguye mpari kuko ntawe tuhageze mu minsi mike cyane .
then inkotanyi found us there on 4th and many soldiers were escaping on the 3rd . ||| inkotanyi zihita zihatusanga ...... ku itariki ya kane ku itariki ya gatatu abasirikari bari benshi bahunga .
i found rpf soldiers who wore differently . ||| njya hanze nsanga abasirikare b' inkotanyi ...... bari baambaye imyenda itandukanye .
they saw me , called me and asked me who i am . i told them . they told me to go back ||| ........ banbonye barampamagara baambaza bati urindae nrisobanura bati subira hasi .
that 's fine . we only wanted to know whether people did not die there or ... ||| ibyo nta kibazo twebwe twagirango tumenye kusa niba nta bantu bahaguye ?
do you have any other information to give us ? ||| niba se hari ibindi bisobanuro uri kutuha .

assiel i have just evoked died of wounds . he had been shot at there at nyamirambo . ||| uwo mugabo nvuze asiyeri kabera yapfuye afite ibikomere by' amasasu bamurasaiye hariya i nyamirambo .
he was cruelly tortured . maybe someone will talk about it . ||| ukuntu yapfuye yapfuye urwagashinyaguro nubwo wenda baza kubisobanura .
he and others with him only took porridge . once , this man and his group of ||| ........... bakanywa ikikoma ubwo umugabo n' umutwe yari ayoboye .
interahamwe and gendarmes prohibited that they be given the porridge anymore . ||| w' interahamwe n' abajandarume haza kugera igihe noneho abantu babashyira ikikoma arabaangira .
they could put off their shoes and take the porridge with them . ||| bakuragaramo inkweto bakanywa ikikoma bakinywesheje ibirato baambaye .
i ensure you , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , ||| icyo nvuga cyane banyakubahwa bagize inkiko gacaca .
that only assiel himself would tell the munyakazi 's deeds if he was alive . ||| umugabo asiyeri nubwo yapfuye niwe ahari uri kuzavuga ibigwi bya munyakazi .
fortunately for him he died . assiel 's death shocked me . he pitifully died . ||| uretseko yagize imaan akapfa urupfu rwa asiyeri kabera binantunguye ...... akiceceka yapfuye urupfu rubabaje .
because it was a pitiful one . we people from kibuye , have not understood it yet . ||| kuko rubabaje cyane tuesae nka banyakibuye tuyobewe urupfu rwe .
there are different rumors outside there . fortunately we 've just had one to ask . ||| ahubwo hari amakuru agenda atangaw hanze ............. ariko ngira imaan ko tubonye uwo tuzaba urupfu rwa kabera asiyeri .
kabera assiel died with rotten feet because of major general munyakazi ! ||| ........ kabera asiyeri yapfuye yaraboze amaguru kubera munyakazi .
donatie was his brother . ||| general major donasiyani .... bose ni ababyeyi bose baravukana .

who were here at nyamirambo , who were beaten and tortured . ||| bari bari hano i nyamirambo bakakubitaw bakaicwa urwagashinyaguro .

but now that we know he had been told that there was someone secretly hunting him , ||| ariko noneho niba yarabonye abantu bamubwirako hari umugendaho .
that he [ munyakazi ] jailed donatien till he was shot at without having given such a testimony at least , ||| na donasiyani akamufungaish akarinda iyo arasaw atatanze ubuhamya nkubungubu .
that we did not know how he was shot to death , major general shall have to pay that . we will go to all tribunals to accuse him of that ! ||| akarasaw tukayoberwa urupfu rwe jeneral major urupfu rwe tuzarumubaza tuzajya mu nkiko zose turumubaze .

people have been talking about the colonel 's actions . we were at lycee notre dame de citeaux . ||| bagiye bavuga kubantu ibikorwa bya koroneri ko twebwe turi turahungiye muri lycee notre dame .
the place has been evoked many times and was one of places he had to control . ||| numvise batangiye babikomoraho kandi yari hamwe muhantu ashinzwe kurinda .
we went to ... on april 30th 1994 , ||| tujya ku itariki ya 30/04/1994 .
those who were lucky to survive , we went to hide in a small forest that was there . ||| abari babashije kurokoka tugiye kuihisha ahantu mugashyamba kaho kahari .
around 10 or 11 , munyakazi with gendarmes came to lycee notre dame de citeaux . ||| ahagara mu ma saa yine saa tanu yaraje munyakazi ariko kumwe n' abajandarume muri lycee notre dame .
they called people and some including me kept hiding . ||| babasha kuhamagara abantu bamwe turihisha turakomeza turihisha .
some women were discovered where they were hiding because it was very near . ||| nuko nyuma abadamu bamwe barabona aho bari bihishe ahantu hafi cyane .
after some time , munyakazi could even call @: "@ show yourselves ! show yourselves ! ||| noneho munyakazi yageze aho akajya abahamagara ngo nimuvae aho muri nimuvae aho muri .
i am lieutenant @-@ colonel @"@ . we had not even recognized him before . ||| ngo ni riyetona koroneri munyakazi nta nubwo turi tuziko ariwe uje .
those who thought we would get killed if we showed ourselves , we stayed there . ||| bamwe tugumamo abaumvaaga bashobora kuicwa igihe bahagereye .
he knew that people were killed and told us @: "@ do not worry , your people are safe @"@ . ||| yari aziko bamaze kuica abantu nuko munyakazi aratubwira ngo muhumurae abantu banyu nta kintu babaye .
they had been taken through one path that goes down from lycee in order to be killed somewhere else . ||| kuko bari babamanukaanye mukayira ko muri lycee bagiye kubicira ahandi .
they told him @: "@ we know they died @"@ . he replied @: "@ do not worry ! nothing bad happened to them ! @"@ . ||| bamubwira ngo nyamara babaishe arabwira ngo muhumurae ngo nta kintu babaye .
i knew that they were dead . so , i would like to ask him to tell us about their death . ||| ngewe rero nkaba nziko bapfuye nkaba nmubazaaga atubwirae iby' urupfu rwabo .
that is all of my testimony . ||| ubuhamya buangae nubwo murakoze .

a list of people who died at lycee is available . ||| hari liste y' abantu bapfairiye muri lycee .
i wonder if i could have it . they were about 18 when getting registered . ||| yo nshobora kuyibona ariko umubare wabo ariko icyo kihae baraiyandikishaaga bari abantu cumi n' umunani .

there was rugaba as well . ||| hari harimo nbaitwaaga barugaba .
many people were taken from there . i would like to learn about our people 's death in lycee ||| n' abantu benshi bahavuye ubwo ngewe nagirango mubaze iby' urupfu rw' abantu bacu muri lycee .
my names are jean bosco . i was born in former gishoma commune ||| nitwa jean bosco mwiseneza nvukaiye ahahoze ari muri komini gishoma .
tell us your parents ' names first . ||| banza utubwirae amazina y' ababyeyi bawe data yitwa onesphore .
june at saint @-@ paul . when inkotanyi came to take people over there i was unlucky to stay there with other few people . ||| z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu ..... muri saint paul ariko inkotanyi zije kutwara abantu ngira ibyago byo kusigaraan n' abandi bantu bake .
we stayed there with someone whose deeds should be highly exalted ! ||| tukomeje kubamo tusigaraan n' umuntu utubereye umuntu ntamenya uko nbivuga .
his name was leonard . he was a watchman at saint @-@ paul . i remember that , once interahamwe attacked saying they wanted people who stayed there , ||| witwa reonard yari umuzamu muri saint paul nraibuka ko igihe kimwe interahamwe zaigeze kuza kushaka zivuga ngo zirashaka abantu basigayemo .
leonard put me into a hole . he told me that he thought i would be killed by this one . ||| uwo reonard anshyira mucyobo ashyiraho ibyatsi nravuga nti uyu nguyu ubanza ariwe ugiye kunyiicira .
i was saved by him . he was a watchman . many people know him . ||| ariko reonard uwo niwe ungiraiye neza yari umuzamu abantu benshi baramuzi .
leonard could tell me everything because i could not go out . ||| ariko reonard niwe unbwiraaga uko bimeze kuko njyae ntashoboraaga kujya hanze .
on 20th , it was said that gendarmes who guarded saint @-@ paul would no longer stay . ||| bigeze ku itariki ya 20 bavuzeko abajandarume barindaaga saint paul batakemerewe kukomeza kuhaguma .
they would be transferred . by the way , i stayed because someone ||| ko bagiye kuhabakura ........ ariko ubwo muri saint paul nri nahashigajwe nuko hari umuntu uri uje angira inama .
he was with ... you have heard of him . ||| ari kumwe n' abandi bantu ari kumwe nuwitwa ..... mwa mwumvise .
he had told me not to move because an order had been given ; to kill people who shifted from saint @-@ paul to sainte @-@ famille . ||| hanyuma uwo musirikari aranbwira ati ntugirae aho ujya kuko batanze itegeko ko abantu bavuye muri saint paul bahungiye muri saint famille ejo bazajya kubica .
i stayed there that night . interahamwe kept coming to rob in saint @-@ paul ||| ngumaye aho ngaho iryo joro interahamwe zikajya ziza kusahura aho muri saint paul .
because people had left rushing and lost their stuffs there . ||| kuko abantu babaga muri saint paul bahavuye biruka bahasiga ibintu .
i was there every single night they came for robbery . ||| uko bagiye baza kusahura ibintu buri joro barahansangaaga .
once i went asleep ||| noneho nza kutwaraw nudutotsi gatoya .
and around 4 a.m. bullet shots awakened me ; ||| bigejeje nko mu ma saa kumi saa kumi nimawe ngiye kaumva numva nkanguwe n' urusaku rw' amasasu .
people of sainte @-@ famille were being killed . ||| kumbi nabo bantu bicaaga bari bari muri saint famille .
i could only see him in a car . i had never come close to him . ||| ubundi njyaaga mubona mu modoka nri ntaramwegera .
on 20th , when we were ordered by interahamwe to go to sainte @-@ famille , ||| uwo munsi ku itariki ya makumyabiri interahamwe bamaze kututegeka kujya muri saint famille .
munyakazi joined the interahamwe who stationed on saint @-@ paul yard . ||| munyakazi yasanze interahamwe zikanbitse ku bibuga saint famille .
there was a barrier set by the interahamwe near a kiosk that was there . ||| hari ahantu hari aka kiosque kera aho hantu hari bariyeri y' interahamwe .
they wanted to kill me there . i felt some courage and thought to beg this man 's help ; ||| nizo zarimo kushaka niho zari zirimo kushaka kunbagira ariko numva umutima urankomeje nravuga nti uwatakira uyu mugabo .
i said @: "@ i am innocent . you should rather be fighting inyenzi who are at kicukiro and elsewhere ||| icyo nvuze nravuze nti njyewe murampora iki nti murabuka kujya kurwana n' inyenzi muvuga ziri kicukiro n' ahandi .
but not be killing hutus , your blood , at sainte @-@ famille ! @" he said @: "@ watch out guys ! this one was in the car . he never got off ! @" ||| mukaza mwica abahutu benewanyu saint famille uyu mugabo icyo yavuze yaravuze ati niko sha yari mu modoka ntago yigeze ava mu modoka .
he asked me @: "@ hey you , are you hutu ? @" i answered @: "@ yes i am hutu @"@ . he asked again @: "@ where do you come from ? @" ||| araambaza ngo uri umuhutu nramubwira nti nd' umuhutu aranbwira ngo iwanyu nihae ?
"@ i am from kimbogo ; bucyana and bigoli were from our village @"@ . ||| nramubwiye nti iwacu ni mukimbogo nti nikimenyimenyi bucyaan maritini na bigori bari abantu b' iwacu .
the two communes , gishoma and kimbogo were very close to each other ||| ariya makomini gishoma na kimbogo ni amakomini yegeranyae cyane .
i said the two men were my uncles . this man ordered to release me . ||| ............ ba marume nangae ......... saint famille uyu mugabo niwe uvuze ati nibakurekure .
the interahamwe accompanied me to sainte @-@ famille . ||| interahamwe zirampera zingeza kuri saint famille .
i thought @: "@ if i reveal my names and origin , i will get killed @"@ . ||| nravuga nti nimvuga amazina yanjye nkavuga n' iwacu barankurikirana .
what i thought was actually true . i went to sainte @-@ famille and took the name of ntezirya . ||| ibyo nibwiye bibaye byo ngiye muri saint famille niita irinri zina niita niita ntezirya hagiye haza aba g.
republican guards could sometimes come there and say that they were sent by their chief . i never knew who it was . ||| bavuga ko bohairijew n' umukuru wabo ntabwo nigeze menya uwo ariwe .
i saw the republican guards coming to sainte @-@ famille but i never knew what they were coming for ; ||| ariko njyaaga nbona aga gp baza buri munsi muri saint famille ntabwo nmenyaaga icyabaga kibazanye .
and saved us . that is what i can remember about munyakazi ||| ziratukijije ariko icyo nibuka kuri munyakazi nicyo ngicyo .
lycee notre dame de citeaux @: on april 30th 1994 , the day this man has just evoked . ||| lycee notre dame de citeau itariki mugabo avuze itariki ya mirongo itatu ukwezi kwa kane .
it is true that extremist soldiers who were in staff headquarters went to lycee notre dame de citeaux ||| igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na kane koko nibyo abasirikari bari hano muri etat major b' interahamwe bagiye muri lycee notre dame de citeau .
because they were supposed to control the area . a battalion was appointed to control the area . what he said , that nuns called father karibushi on phone is true as well ; ||| kuko aribo bari suppose yo kuharinda abasirikari ..... hari batayo yari iri hariya bakuramo abantu nkuko yabivuze bajya kubica ibyo yavuze kuri tariki koko nibyo ababikira bahise baterefona padiri karibushi .
they told him what was taking place . karibushi called me because i controlled the area of saint @-@ paul cathedral . ||| bababwira ibyakogo bagize padiri karibushi yaraterefonnye kuko ningewe urindaaga cadredral saint paul .
you should also tell us who participated in those attacks and killed people , sir ! ||| ariko nyakaubahaw ujyae utubwira nbaba baragiye muri ibyo bitero bakica
i told you they were soldiers from staff headquarters as well as the interahamwe . they went to take people who were here on april 30th , ||| nkubwiyeko ari abasirikari bari bavuye hano muri etat majoro n' interahamwe nibo bagiye kuzaana abantu bari bari hano ku itariki ya mirongo itatu y' ukwezi kwa kane .
1994 ||| mugihumbi kimwe maganacyenda mirongo icyenda na kane .
those nuns were actually attacked by soldiers as i said it . i left muhima ||| bariya babikira bari muri ...... ko abasirikari batangiye kubatera nkuko kare nbivuze koko nvuye k' umuhaima .
to lycee notre dame de citeaux . on that day , i met the nuns and i gave gendarmes to them ||| nza muri lycee notre dame de citeau kuri iyo tariki nbonaan n' ababikira nbashyira abajandarume .
i ordered captain ... to appoint gendarmes to protect lycee notre dame de citeaux . ||| nbwira kapiteni ...... ngo ahatangae abajandarume bo kurinda lycee notre dame de citeau .
i was just asked where those soldiers and interahamwe took them . i do n't know . ||| aranbabajije rero ati abo basirikari babajyanye hehe nizo nterahamwe ntago mpazi .
they called me for help and i helped them . i guess there is nothing bad in it . ||| kuko baranyitabaje nrabatabara ngirango aho ntacyaha nkoze .
as far as the attack at cela is concerned , i think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ? ||| kubierekeye igitero cyo muri sela bavuzeko kibaye ku itariki ya karindwi hari icyatanzwe ku itariki ya karindwi .
he just said that he arrived at cela on april 7th . ||| uwo yavugaaga kubierekeraanye no kuhunga igihe yagereye muri sela we yavuzeko yahageze ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane .
what about the attack of april 22nd ? ||| igitero rero cyo ku itari makumyabiri nebyiri z' ukwezi kwa kane .
people who were at cela moved to saint @-@ paul center and we protected them there . ||| abaturage bari bari muri sela bahungiye muri centre saint paul aba ariho tubarindira .
do you agree that there are those who survived at cela and moved to saint @-@ paul where you protected them ? ||| uremerako hari abacitse ku icumu bari bari aho muri sela bahungiye muri saint famille mukabarindirayo .
yes i do agree that there were people who escaped from cela by jumping over walls . however , i did not head that interahamwe 's attack . that is all i can add . ||| nrabiemera ko hari abantu bahungiye muri sela basimbuka inkuta bajya muri centre saint paul ariko ntago bigeze ariko ntago nigeze nyobora kiriya gitero cy' interahamye nicyo nakurengerezaho .
what do i think about the red car all people have been insisting on ? ||| ku kibazo abantu bose baibanzeho kiriya modoka y' umutuku .
i think i even started with it , saying that i never travelled in that car ! ||| ngirango nicyo nnatangiraiyemo nbwira abagize urukiko ko iyo modoka ntayigenzemo .
i never travelled in that car at all as people are saying . ||| ntinigeze nyigendamo rwose iyo modoka rero nkuko babivuga .
i absolutely reject that i travelled in that red car . never ! ||| ............ hari imodoka y' umutuku ugendaagamo nrayihakana iyo modoka koko y' umutuku ntago nigeze nyikoresha .
maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel munyakazi ! ||| kaereka niba hari umuntu ugendaaga avuga ko yitwa koroneli munyakazi ari muri iyo modoka .
during genocide it was used by others but ||| mukihae cya jenocide yatwaraaga abantu itwawe n' abandi ariko nawe indi .
you had yours somewhere not far ! ||| ugendamo .
the car never got to ... i never travelled near it . ||| ntabwo iyo modoka yigeze ijya muri ..... ntabwo iyo modoka nigeze ngenda iruhande rwayo .
never ! concerning the groups that killed people in kigali ; ||| ntago nigeze ngenda muri iyo modoka kubierekeye ikibazo kiza groupe zaicaaga abantu muri kigali .
they were many . there were interahamwe as we 've been saying . the last one has just evoked republican guards who used to come where he was . ||| izo groupe zari nyinshi hari interahamwe nkuko tukunze kubivuga uwanyuma aravuze ngo hari abajepe bazaaga .
there were even many intelligence agents employed by other authorities . ||| hari abantu bari muri za intelligence zinyuraanye bicaaga abantu bayoboraw n' abandi bayobozi .
so munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes ! ||| ntabwo rero ibyo ngibyo babishyira k' umutwe wa munyakzi .
you should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel ! ||| mwazabibaza iyo mitwe yicaaga abantu ariko ntabwo mwabigereka k' umutwe wa liyetona koroneli munyakazi .
had the groups entered saint @-@ michel cathedral , i would tell you their names . ||| iyo iyo mitwe yinjira muri katedrale saint michel nri kubabwira nti nikanaka na kanaka .
but the other area was controlled by nyarugenge territory company as i have already told the court . the groups were mrnd , cdr under the staff command ||| ariko hariya nkuko nbibwiye urukiko hari compagnie .... ya nyarugengae iyo mitwe inyuraanye yari mrnd , sdr za etat majoro .
who abducted people ? those groups of killers must be responsible for it . i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , was not commanding those groups . ||| baza kutwara abantu ibyo bigomba kubazaw iyo mitwe yicaaga abantu ntabwo nge liyetona koroneli munyakazi nyoboraaga iyo mitwe .
the accusations about what happened at saint @-@ andre brought against me are all wrong as well . ||| ku kibazo cya saint andre ibyo banvuze byose barimo kunbeshyera .
the accusations are wrong ones . i never arrived there . i only arrived at father 's house . i was with major ngirabatware . ||| muri saint andre .... kuri saint andre baranbeshyera ntinigeze ngerayo ngeze kwa padiri ..... nrihamawe na major ngirabatware .
after the killing of eight brothers , father blanchal called ngirabatware asking him that we might go to carry brothers who were with him . ||| padiri blanshari bakimara kuica aba furaire 8 yaterefonnye ngirabatware asaba yuko abafuraire ari kumwe nabo i nyamirambo tujya kubazana .
we first went to saint @-@ michel cathedral . we then went to carry them . we brought the first group to saint @-@ michel cathedral . ||| tukabazana muri katedrale saint michel tugiyeyo igice kinberae turakizana tukishyira muri katedrale saint michel .
you may ask father blanchal and those brothers . ||| muzabaze padiri blanchal nba furaire baba ... tufite .
i never headed any attack against saint @-@ michel or his parish ||| nta gitero nigeze nyobora kuri saint michel no kuri paroise yayoboraaga .
please sir , remember your duty was to protect the population and i can realize that you mainly concentrated your efforts on priests and brothers . ||| ariko nyakaubahaw mu nshingano zanyu zari kurinda cyane cyane abaturage kandi nrabona mwaribanze cyane cyane kuba padiri nba furaire .
why did you forget other people who were being killed because of their ethnic group ? ||| abaturage bo mwari mwabaretse ? abaturage baicwaaga nukuvuga baziraaga ubwoko bwabo .
we actually saved many people . the only problem is that even someone i carried in my car denies it when he arrives here ! ||| tukijije abantu benshi ikibitera ubungubu nuwo ntwaye mu modoka ashobora kugera hano akabihakana .
however , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned . ||| ariko nge abo bapadiri nvuga bose bari muri za corelasiyo ...... kurasa kuri arishoveki .
i am telling you that all priests who were in kigali are alive . ||| nrababwirako abapadiri bose bo muri kigali bariho ,
all priests and brothers who were in the area of plateau are alive ||| abapadiri bose n' abafuraire bari muri zone yose yo kuri plateau bariho .
no one died and all were saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi but once you save man and he comes here to accuse you as i have just seen it here . ||| ntabantu bapfuye kandi bakijijwe na liyetona koroneli munyakazi ariko umuturage naho umukiza ashobora kuza nkubu ngubu akakubeshyera akavuga ngo nkuko mbese nbibonye .
please sir , you have seen yourself people who have been here to say something . they have not been appointed by the court . we do not even now them . ||| nyakaubahaw ubonye abantu bafite icyo barimo kuvuga ntago rwose urukiko arirwo rushyizeho abantu baanga gutya nta nubwo tunabazi twebwe .
in addition , you asked to come and give the testimony on your own initiative and the administration only convened people ||| kandi ni wowe wisabiyeko uzaza kutanga ubuhamya ahangaha nukuvuga ngo urabiisabaiye ubuyobozi butumira abantu .
we have come just as court agents to listen to your testimony . our questions are based on what people have said . ||| twe tuje nk' urukiko kugirango tukirae ubuhamya bwawe ibyo tukubaza rero turashingair kubyo abantu bavuze .
we want to ensure you about that . ||| ...... aho ngaho turagirango tukumarae impungenge .
there are a lot of things about the meetings you held in rugenge . so , ... ||| hari ibintu byiinshi bakuvugaaga bierekeraanye n' inama zakorwa tusubiye muri rugengae ubwo ngubwo .
the meetings , going outside and say there was no shit , supplying killers ... can you imagine as an authority having gendarmes under your command ! ... ||| inama zakorwaaga aho ugeraaga ku mihanda uti se iyi myanda ko ntayo nbona ukatanga ibikoresho nk' umuntu koko uri uyoboye ufite .... ufite abajandarume ufite ibi ......
concerning destroying houses in kigali , i think you can see it yourself that areas controlled by gendarmes were safe . saint @-@ michel cathedral was not destroyed , ||| kuri icyo kibazo cyo kusenya amazu muri kigali ngirango nawe iyo urebye aho abajandarume bari barinze katedrale saint michel ntabwo yigeze isenyaw .
sainte @-@ famille was not , saint @-@ paul was not ||| kuri saint famille ntabwo yigeze isenyaw centre saint paul ntabwo yigeze isenyaw .
hotel mille collines was not as well . saying i sensitized about destroying houses is just a lie . ||| hotel mille colline ntago yashenywe kuvuga ngo ngiye kukoresha inama zo kusenya amazu ntabwo aribyo .
those of saint @-@ paul , sainte @-@ famille ... you know it yourself and all people do . why did you deploy your men there ? ||| ............ saint paul , saint famille ngirango nawe urabizi ngirango abantu bose barabizi muri sela nuko none se abo bantu mwayoboraga mwashyize hariya mwari mwarahabashyiriye iki ?
was it to protect houses after having failed to protect people ? i would like you to explain it to us . ||| mwari mwarahabashyiriye se kugirango barindae amazu niba abantu batari bashoboye kurindaw nagirango tusobanurairwe ibyo bintu .
the group under my command protected people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . you should ask me to explain what happened there if any problem arose at saint @-@ paul cathedral or sainte @-@ famille church controlled by gendarmes as i told you . ||| groupe ....... nyoboraaga yari irinze abantu kuri katedrale saint michel niba hari ibibazo bibaye kuri katedrale saint paul , eglise saint famille nkubwiyeko abajandarume bari bahari .
nyarugenge territory company , kigali formation and interahamwe attacked the institutions . ||| groupement electorale ya nyarugengae groupement kigali bagiye .... ingufu n' interahamwe zateraaga biriya bigo .
someone also o evoked kabera 's death . i did never participate in his killing . ||| uwavuze urupfu rwa kabera nta hantu nigeze ngira uruhare mu kuica kabera nagirango nbibwirae urukiko ntago nigeze ngira uruhare mu kuica kabera .
i did not evoke him before because on march 1st 1995 , ||| ikitumye ntari nvuze kabera nuko ku itariki ya mbere y' ukwezi kwa gatatu igihmbi kimwe maganacyenda mirongo icyenda na gatanu .
he and others were at saint @-@ paul ... at lycee ... saint @-@ paul center ... sainte @-@ famille church ... with mp rugema . it was in that time people say i took 13 people and carried them in a pickup . they even published it ; i read it . people from kibuye even established a commission ||| bari kuri lycee bari kuri centre paul eglise saint famille ........ na depite rugema aribo bavuze ko nkuye abantu cumi n' abatatu muri camionnette icyo noneho babiandika no ............ niho nbisomye icyo kihae abanyakibuye bashyiraho komisiyo .
which had to investigate about those men 's rumors . i already explained it . but i tell you that i am not among people who shot at kabera . ||| yo kureba ibyo abo bagabo bavuga niho nbibasobanuraiye ariko urupfu rwa kabera abamurashe ntabwo ndi mubantu barashe kabera .
thank you mister president , thank you all gacaca court panel members . i have asked to speak as one of the people who were at cela . i arrived there on 7th . ||| murakoze nyakaubahaw perezida banyakubahwa nyangamugayo nzabaye ijambo nkaumawe mubari muri sela uhahungiye kuva ku itariki ya karindwi .
my names are kanzayire bernadette . i am not giving a testimony . i want to have some explanations from our brother general munyakazi . ||| nitwa kanzayire berenadeta ntabwo ari ubuhamya ntanga ibyo nshaka kuvuga nibyo ngirango umuvandimwe jenerali munyakazi atufashe kugirango tusobanukirwae
as it was said , i was at cela . on 22nd , the place was attacked and all people escaped to sainte @-@ famille ||| nkuko bivuzawe nangae nri muri sela makumyabiri na kabiri haratewe abari bahari bose brahunga bajya saint famille .
and saint @-@ paul . i lived in all those places . munyakazi said that he was in charge of the mobile group . ||| na saint paul aho hose nrahabaye ariko kubyo generali munyakazi yavuze ko yari ashinzwe groupe mobile .
he also said gave some orders to gendarmes who were at sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and elsewhere . ||| ariko yanavuzeko yahaye amabwiriza abari bari muri saint famille na saint paul nhanri .
he said that he gave orders to territory company men because their commander could not be there . ||| bari bari muri compagnie ......... yavuze ko ariwe uhaye amabwiriza yo kurinda abantu kubera yuko umujandarume uri uhashinzwe yari yabaye broque .
e member of audience this means that those men were just executing orders . i think that general munyakazi should be responsible for everything they might have done since he had taken the responsibility to gave orders to them . ||| e umuturage nukuvugako bariya aribo bahabwaaga amabwiriza ibyo baba barakoze rero ngirango jeneral munyakazi afite uruhare yabigiramo kandi yafashe responsabilite yo kaubaha amabwiriza .
furthermore , in his testimony he did not say anything about the areas of rugenge and muhima . ||| ikindi mu makuru yabanje kutanga nta kintu yigeze avuga kuri ibyo bicae bya rugengae na muhaima ?
he only talked about saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines . i have wondered why he has avoided talking about sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and cela . ||| yivuygiye cathedral saint michel na hotel mille colline ......... nkibanza impamvu yari yanze kuvuga saint famille na saint paul na sela .
from caritas ' stores . however , why did n't he help him when saint @-@ paul was attacked ? ||| ku ma sitoke ya karitasi ariko se nta nicyo yamufashije kubitero bibaye muri saint paul .
he should have helped the only priest we could find because others were hiding . ||| n' uruhare yaba yaragize kufasha uwo mupadiri kuko niwe tubonaaga abandi ntabo tubonaaga bari bihishe .
he would have helped us more like that . i would also like to ask him to tell us what he did when he went to saint @-@ paul @: to get food or whatever ... ||| icyo yaba yaratufashije kandi anatubwirae igihe yajyaaga muri saint paul muri ibyo byo kuzana ibiribwa niki .
what he went there for ? did n't he get any information from gendarmes who were there about people who had been killed there ? ||| yabaga agiye kukorayo iki ibitero bihabaye n' abantu bahaguye abajandarume bari bahari hari amakuru bamuhaye ?
he was called for help but i heard that he arrived after people were already killed . ||| baramutabaje se ko numva hari n' igihe yahaje kandi ari uko baishe abantu ku itariki ya cumi na kane z' ukwagatandatu .
in 1994 , young men were taken from rooms where they had escaped . ||| muri mirongo icyenda na kane batwaye abasore benshi babatoranije mu ma sale aho abantu bari bahungiye .
the young men were about 60 . they were killed near the place . lieutenant @-@ colonel knows it but he did not tell the court . ||| abo basore bagera kuri za mirongo itandatu n' abandi bicaiyew hariya hafi riyetona koroneli munyakazi ibyo arabizi ko ntacyo yabwiye urukiko .
how did he consider that , as someone who had given orders to gendarmes ? ||| ese yabivuzho iki nk' umuntu uri uhaye amabwirirza abo bajndarume ?
mister president , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca panel , ||| ibindi nyakaubahaw perezida namwe nyangamugayo .
what did he do mister president ? thank you ! ||| yabikozeho iki murakoze nyakaubahaw perezida .
remember that this is not a party so that we rejoice and clap our hands ! we only thank one for his good deeds . ||| ntabwo tuba turi mubyishimo ngo tukomae amashyi ahubwo umuntu tumushimira ibiiza bye .
many people died at saint @-@ paul and i think you already know that ||| ........... abantu benshi bo muri saint paul batapfa ........ kandi ngirango namwe ibyo murabizi .
remember you were an authority ; you had men , equipment and weapons to stop killers , who by the way , were not as trained as your men ||| ........... ufite ubuyobozi ufite nabo uyobora n' ibikoresho uri ubifite n' intwaro zo kukumira abazaaga kuica abantu batanabyize kandi mwebwe mwari mufite abantu mwigishije .
as far as preventing such catastrophes and lay people having been accidently armed ! you should also tell us about arming the population by the way ! ||| bazi kukumira ibintu kibyo by' ibitero by' abantu babaturagae bahaye imbunda cyane cyane ko utanatubwiye ...... umuturage n' imbunda ibyo nabyo ubikaomozaeho ubitubwirae .
there were many unities . i am going to pass through them as follows @: rwandan army staff with generals here and then ; ||| ngirango hari za unitae nyinshi ngiye kuzisobanura muri ubwo buryo hari etat major ya arme rwandaise yari ifite ...... general aha hirya ahangaha .
gendarmerie staff which was in kigali city ; kigali operation command ; ||| hari etat major ya jandarumori ariyo yari mu mugi hari commandement ops commandement operationnel ya kigali .
there were also .... a lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned , ||| ariko bafite nza ............ nyinshi ....... ariko kugirango ngewe nshoborae kutabara bariya baturagae .
sorry to interrupt sir ! the question was about saint @-@ paul attacks ||| nyakaubahaw reka ntinkuciye mu ijambo ariko nagirango ibyo abajije ubiumvise kubierekeraanye no muri saint paul .
and sainte @-@ famille . among your responsibilities as an authority , you had the ability to stop the attacks and save lives of civilians ||| ibierekeraanye n' inshingano zanyu kuri saint famle ... uko uri umuyobozi mukuri uko ushoboraaga kukumira ibitero kugirango abasiviri batapfa .
who had escaped there because of their ethnic groups . we want you to tackle that issue . ||| bahungiye hariya bazira ubwoko bwabo turagirango ukanishe aho ngaho cyane cyane .
i am almost on it . there were twelve gendarmes at saint @-@ paul and twelve at sainte @-@ famille . ||| aho niho ngiye kugera nubundi hari abajandarume bagera kuri cumi n' ababiri kuri centre saint paul n' abajandarume cumi na babiri bari kuri saint famille .
there is one who said that people were abducted from saint @-@ paul in the eyes of gendarmes . what were they doing then ? ||| uriya yavuzeko ibitero byo kuri saint paul abantu ko bavaagamo kandi abajandarume bahari bari bashinzwe iki ?
i told you that the .... entered to abduct people . ||| nbabwiyeko ari iza .... zajyaaga kufatamo abantu ababikoze aba bafashe muri saint paul cyangwa muri saint famille .
i think that the abductors of people from saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille should be asked questions on their own because i was never told that such @-@ and @-@ such went to abduct people . ||| numva mwazababza kugiti cyabo kuko ntago bigeze babwira ngo kanaka na kanaka baje kufatamo abantu .
i would know it if they did it at saint @-@ michel . you have realized that the areas i controlled never experienced such problems . ||| iyo babikora muri hariya saint michel mwabonyeko aho nrinrinze nta kibazo ngize .
and sainte @-@ famille to see our gendarme who had died during an attack ||| njya na saint famille tujya no kureba umujandarume wacu upfuye mugitero kiri kibaye .
at saint @-@ paul . i also told you that i went to saint @-@ paul center after ... i was at hotel de mille collines . ||| kuri centre saint paul nraongera nbabwirako nyuma ya saa ubwo nrinri kuri hotel mille colline .
what about those who were at sopetrad , former sopecy i think ? ||| abari muri sopetrade ahari sopecya kera ngirango .
there were battalion 61 gendarmes at sopecya . ||| muri sopecya abajandarume bari hari batayo ya mirongo itandatu nimawe
no gendarmes with villagers there ? ||| nta abajandarume bari bahari bari kumwe n' abaturage ...............
i mean those who were with villagers on the barrier at sopetrad . ||| abajandarume bari bahari bari kumwe n' abaturage kuri bariyeri haruguru ya sopetrade .
no , there were no gendarmes there from sopetrad to poids lourd road . ||| oya nta bajandarume bari bahari kuva kuri sopetrade ukagera uriya muhanda wa puwa ruru .
this was guarded by battalion 61 . ||| uri urinzawe na batayo na nyarugengae yose yari irinzawe na batayo ya mirongo itandatu nimawe .
we have wished to have the long report so that we may learn more about this matter . ||| ......... tubisabye naya rapport ...... ndende kugirango ntawe tubimenyeho neza kuko ........ kubera kutinda .

when those events broke out , i was lieutenant . the genocide of tutsis started in 1959 . ||| igihe biriya bibaga nri riyetona ........... jenocide y' abatutsi yatangiye muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda .

on march 1st 1995 , ||| ku itariki yanberae z' ukwezi kwa gatatu igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na gatanu .
considering what i said on radio rwanda , some thought that i was for the interahamwe 's side . ||| kuri radio rwanda ibyo nvuze bamwe bibwiye ko nshyigikiye interahamwe .
national gendarmerie and all those services i was reported to investigated and found out that some accusations were faked . ||| jandarumi nasiyonari nizo serivisi bagiye bajya kuturegamo zakoze ankete zisanga ibimenyetso bimwe bidafatika .

yves , how many were you in your family before the genocide , living here ? ||| yves mwari umuryango w' abantu bangahe mwabaga hano mbere ya jenoside ?
before the genocide we were a family of six people living here . ||| mbere ya jenoside tubaga hano turi umuryango w' abantu batandatu .
we were four children , my dad and my mom . ||| turi turi abana bane , na papa na mama .
and after the genocide ... how many of your family members were murdered during the genocide ? ||| hanyuma noneho nyuma ya jenoside , musigaye muri bangahe ?
three of us were left after the genocide . ||| nyuma ya jenoside tusigaye turi batatu .
both my parents and my big brother were killed during the genocide . ||| papa na mama na mukuru wanjye baraishwe muri ... mu kihae cya jenoside .
could you tell me what are your first memories ? if you were to think back to when you were a child , what is one of the first things that you remember ? ||| unbwira kimwe mu bintu bya kera wibuka ? mu bwana bwawe wibuka iki , kikunda kukugarukamo ?
the thing i would remember is maybe the way we would all be together , chatting . ||| mu bwana bwanjye ikintu nkuibuka , ndi kumwe n' umuryango wanjye , nraibuka ukuntu tubanaaga , nraibuka rimwe na rimwe iyo tubaga turi hamwe tuesae tuganira .
my father used to make us laugh very much . ||| rimwe na rimwe papa yakundaaga kutusetsa cyane ,
he was very funny . ||| kuko yari umuntu uganira cyane kandi usetsa .
he used take us for a ride . ||| akakunda kutushimaish , kudutembereza .
my big brother also used to make us laugh so much when we would be just the children . ||| na mukuru wanjye nawe yari umuntu usetsa nawe iyo tubaga twiherereye turi abana kusa , yari umuntu ukunda kutushyushya akatuganiriza cyane akatushimaish .
how would you describe your relationship with her ? ||| nbwira ku mibanire yawe nawe ... ubusabane mwagiranaga ,
what did you do together ? ||| n' ibyo mwajyaga mufatanya kukora .
she used to pull me aside in the bedroom and give me plenty of advice about life in general . ||| mama twa ... yakundaaga kunganiriza cyane rimwe na rimwe , yajyaaga anyihererana akanshyira nko mu cyumba , akanbwira ibintu bigendanye n' ubuzima .
even before the genocide she used to tell us that anything could happen , we could find ourselves orphans as they could both die in a car accident , or something could happen to them . ||| ndetse na mbere y' uko jenoside iba yajyaaga atubwira ati @: "@ mushobora kuba imfubyi nta umenya , nshobora kugira accident cyangwa nshobora kugira ikindi kintu kinbaho , ababyeyi banyu bose bakapfa ,
so she would tell us how we needed to stop being childish and grow up , to be hardworking and to be able to take care of ourselves in case we were forced to . ||| njyewe na papa wanyu tukapfa . ariko mugomba kumenya ntimukabae abantu b' abatesi , " turimo yenda kukora ibintu akatubwira ngo @: "@ mujyae mugeragreza kukora cyane ,
she would give me advice so i can become a man . ||| kuko hari igihe tushobora kuzaba tutakihari mukirwanaho . @" yakundaaga kunyiegereza akangair inama zo mu buzima kugirango nzakurae ndi umwana mwiza nzamukae ndi umugabo .
tell us about your father . ||| nbwira kuri papa wawe .
you said he was a funny man . what things made him funny ? ||| yari muntu ki ?
he was very talkative . ||| papa yari umuntu ukundaaga kuganira cyane .
wherever he was maybe in bars with his friends they would be making jokes and when he would come home he would make us laugh as well . ||| yaraganiraaga cyane ku buryo iyo yabaga ari nk' ahantu bari nko mu kabari n' abandi bagabo bagenzi babaga baseka . igiparu kibaishe noneho yagera mu rugo ntawe akatusetsa .
the one thing i always remember is that , every evening , we used to wait for him to come home , even when it was very late because he used to amuse us a lot . ||| noneho nk' icyo mwibukiraho nk' iyo yabaga yatashye nka nimugoroba tuesae abana usangaaga tumurindiraiye . n' iyo yabaga ari butindae kutaha . kuko iyo yazaaga yaratushimaishaga akatuemerair kudutembereza ,
he used to promise us to take us for a ride or give us gifts or money to buy sweets on our way to church . ||| akatuha wenda nk' ibintu akatuha nk' amafaranga akavuga ati @: "@ nimujya mu misa muzagurae nk' akabombo , cyangwa utuntu nk' utwo ngutwo . @"
we always waited for him to come home before going to bed . ||| noneho tuesae tukamurindira tukaryama ari uko atashye .
if we went to sleep without seeing him , we would find him in his bedroom very early the next morning . ||| turara tutamubonye mu gitondo tukazinduka cyane tugiye kukomanga ku muryango ngo tumurebae .
tell me about your big brother . ||| nbwira kuri mukuru wawe .
my big brother was very quiet . ||| mukuru wanjye we yari umuntu ucecetse .
people did not even believe he could talk . ||| nta n' ubwo abantu bari bazi ko avuga .
he never used to talk when my dad or my mom were there because he feared them . ||| ariko iyo ... ariko ntiyavugaaga iyo yabaga ari mu rugo , papa ahari cyangwa se mama ,
so he would act like a very quiet person or a grown up in their presence . ||| kuko yarabatinyaaga akitwara nk' umuntu ucecetse cyane , cyangwa se hari ari umuntu mukuru .
but whenever we would be on our own , with maybe other children in the neighbourhood or from our school , he used to be so funny . ||| ariko iyo tubaga twiherereye turi abana kusa , cyangwa turi nk' abana ... tuturanye cyangwa haba ari ku ishuri , yari umuntu usetsa .
he loved funk music , dancing and movies very much . ||| yakundaaga amafilime cyane , akakunda indirimbo zigezaweho , icyo kihae tuzaitaaga ngo za funk , azikunda cyane ,
in school he was liked very much because he was calm and he loved people . ||| akakunda kubyina . no ku ishuri akaba ari umuntu abantu bakundaaga cyane , kuko yari umuntu witonda , kandi ukunda abantu .
did you all enjoy music together ? ||| haba hari igihe mwajyaga mwishimishiriza hamwe mu muziki ?
yes because he used to teach me and tell me what was on fashion . ||| yee , kuko yaranyigishaaga . niwe unbwiraaga ibigezaweho . kuko njyae ntabwo nbaga ... niwe ubaga yabikurikiye mu bitabo .
he loved to read and to listen to the radio . ||| akunda kusoma ibitabo akunda kaumva radio ,
he used to teach me how to dance in the bedroom . he would show me how to dance and i would imitate him . ||| noneho yaza aka nyigisha tukaiga turi mu cyumba , aka nyigisha kubyina nnjyae aka nyerekera ...
tell me , when you look back and remember your family , what is it that you remember ? ||| nbwira ikintu kikomeye wibukiraho umuryango wawe ?
happiness ? ||| ese n' ibihe by' ibyishimo ,
warmth ? fun ? what is the strongest memory that you have ? love , care ? ||| ese ni amagambo mwaganiraga ... ni iki kikuibutsa umuryango wawe ku buryo bw' umwihariko ?
i would say there are two things . ||| nbivuga nko mubicae bibiri .
as far as my mother is concerned , i remember very well that even before the war she was once took me to the bedroom and told me that there was a war going on and no one knew what was going to happen . ||| nk' icyo nibuka cyane nko kuri mama , ni uko mbere yuko jenoside itangira yigeze kunfata rimwe arantwara tujya ahantu mu cyumba . aranbwira ati @: "@ intambara irimo kuba ntawamenya ,
she told me that they might die or anything could happen to them , that we needed to be strong . it was as though she knew she was going to die . ||| tushobora kupfa cyangwa tukagira ikintu kitubaho . ati @: ariko muzaihanganae ... asa nk' unbwira ko agiye kupfa .
i remember how she used to pull me aside and tell me , "@ you 're the oldest @" and yet i was n't , i had an older brother . ||| muzaihanganae muzabae abana beza niyo biba ... @" nkuibuka na none ... ... yajyaaga akunda kunyihererana akanbwira ati @: @"@ ni wowe mukuru , [ ariko ntabwo yari njyewe mukuru hari hari mukuru wanjye ] .
she would always want to talk to me . ||| ariko nbonaaga ari njyewe ashaka kubwira cyane buri kihae .
she used to advise me on how to behave , to love people . ||| akantu kose kaba kabaye akampamagara ati @:
as far as my father is concerned i remember how he used to take me out with other men and buy me ‘ brochettes ’ . ||| "@ yves ujyae ugira gutya na gutya jya ukunda abantu ... @" naho kuri papa we , rwose nrabiibuka hari igihe yajyaaga akunda kunjyana akanjyana nko ... yaba agiye nko mu banri bagabo , akanbwira ati @: "@ ngwino njyae kukugurair brochettes ... @" akaba arijyae yihererana nnjyae akanjyana .
my mother even used to get angry with him about it and she would ask me why he was taking her child out at night . ||| noneho ... ku buryo mama bijyaaga binamurakaza , akamubwira ati @: "@ ariko se kuki unjyanair umwana , ukamutindaan ninjoro ? @"
i myself liked it very much , being with my father made me feel invincible . ||| ariko jyae bikanshimaish kuko nbaga ndi kumwe na papa , nkaumva meze neza nkaumva nta muntu unkoraho rwose . ariko nawe akakunda kunbwira ati @:
he also used to tell me to take interest in his things and to take care of my sisters . ||| "@ ujyae umenyera ibintu , ujyae umenya barumuna bawe , ujyae umenya bashiki bawe . @"
during the genocide , what is the memory , which is the strongest , the most difficult for you to recall ? ||| ni ibihe bintu bikomeye wibuka bibaye muri jenoside ? ni iki kikugoye cyane ?
the thing that hurts the most as far as my parents are concerned is the way they died . ||| ikintu muri ... nvuga nko muri jenoside kinbabaje cyane ku babyeyi banjye , nvuga nk' ukuntu bapfuye . mbere y' uko bapfa uko babinbwiye n' uko baje kubafata aho bari bari , icyambabaje cyane ni uko mama yari arwaye .
i was told that when they came to get them , my mother had been sick with malaria , she did n't have medication and she had been shivering and throwing up the whole night and they came that morning . ||| yari arwaye malaliya , ngo yari yiriwe ... yari yaraye ameze nabi ahinda umushyitsi ; aruka ... kubera malaliya , nta n' imiti yabonye ,
my big brother was moping the floor and listening to the radio even though they were hiding . ||| icyo gitondo nicyo baje kumubyutsamo . baramufata kuko ngo yari ameze nabi . ngo yari arwaye , afite imbeho ataitira .
what hurts the most about my father is that they shot him five bullets and he was there agonizing for two days with no medication . ||| mukuru wanjye we ngo yari arimo akora isuku aho bari bihishe , hari mu gitondo barimo bakoropa ... arimo akoropa nawe , yumva radio atazi ibyo aribyo , uraumva yari umuntu w' umwana .
he was just there and there was no enough medication . ||| wenda nvuga ko we , icyambabaje cyane kuri we , ni ukuntu ... ni iminsi yamaze atarapfa . baramurashe amasasu agera kuri atanu ,
two days later when he started to feel better , they came back and finished him . ||| akiryamye nta miti afite yo kumuvura , ari aho kusa nta muti . n' imiti babonye ikaba itahagije . icyo kihae kimaze kushira atangiye kukira baraongera baragaruka .
it hurts me and i always feel like it would have been better if he had died right away without going through so much pain . ||| nibaza ko icyo kihae yamaze ... njya nvuga nti @: "@ iyaba yarahise apfa . @" kubera ko igihe yamaze atarapfa , nicyo nbona kimubabaje cyane kuko yakimaze nta kintu ... ababaye .
those are the two most painful things . ||| ibyo bintu buri kihae iyo nbitekereje biranbabaza cyane .
where were you at that time ? ||| icyo kihae wowe uri uri he ?
we had gone to my grandmother 's place before it started . ||| njyewe bijya kuba turi tugiye kwa nyogokuru ,
they said that here in kigali there was no security and the best thing to do was to split into two and maybe some of us would survive . ||| tugenda bavuga bati @: "@ ino ahangaha hari umutekano mukeya ,
i was in gitarama at my grandmother 's place ; it is called igitwe . ||| reka ibiiza tutandukanae , kuko bashobora ... twebwe tushobora kusigara . @" noneho tujyayo , nri ndi i kitaarama kwa nyogokuru wanjye aho baita i taba .
how did you find out about the way in which your family was killed ? ||| umenye utae uburyo umuryango wawe wishwe ?
they killed them very badly . ||| uko nbiumva , uko nbibona baishwe ... baishwe nabi .
before then , they 'd make them walk around for maybe five kilometres , they were about a hundred people and they were shouting at them and beating them up . ||| kubera ko mbere yuko bapfa , babanje kujya babajyana hirya no hino , bakabashorera bakabajyana nk' ibirometero nka bitanu ari nk' abantu bagera ku ijana ... abantu babavugiriza induru babakubita ... babakubita amahiri ... ubwo buryo bapfuyemo nibwo ... nabyo biranbabaza . muri ubwo buryo ,
the way they died is also something that hurts me a lot . ||| mbere y' uko banapfa , numva njyae baraishwe nabi cyane .
even the day they killed them , they still run after them , beat them up and insulted them . ||| kugirango ... bageze n' umunsi wo kupfa mbere y' aho babanje kujya bairukanka , bakabavumbura mu bihuru aho bari bari . bakabakubita , bakabatuka ,
they pleaded with them to let them live but they refused . ||| bakabasabair imbabazi , nabo ubwabo bagatakamba baaka ... bakainginga ... nbona ko icyo kihae cyose ,
i think it would have been better for them to die straight away , on the first day . ||| birutaw n' uko bari kupfa ku munsi wa mbere .
what was the relationship between your dad and that soldier ? ||| papa wawe n' abasirikare bari babanye kutae ?
were they good friends ? ||| ese bari inshuti ... ?
all i can say is that my dad did not have any enemies . ||| icyo nvuga ni uko papa nta banzi nzi yari afite .
he did not have any problems even with the soldiers . ||| baba abasirikare , nta kibazo yagiraanaga nabo .
people in this area liked him because he used to help them out with the problems they 'd submit to him , he used to give them a ride the days he 'd have a car and they days he did not have one they would walk up to the taxi together . ||| ku buryo n' abantu bo muri kano kacae baramukundaaga . kuko bamukundiraaga ko ibibazo bamubwiraaga yarabibakemuriraga , yaba abasanze ku muhanda afite i modoka akabatwara , nta modoka afite bakazamukaan n' amaguru baganira kugera kuri taxi .
he used to buy them a drink when he 'd have money . ||| yaba afite amafaranga bakamusaba bati @: "@ tusengeraire akabasengerair . @"
even soldiers did not have any problems with him ; in fact some of them were his friends . he was in good terms with not just the soldiers but with everyone else . ||| n' abasirikare nabo nta kibazo yari afitanye nabo . ahubwo yari afite n' abasirikare bamwe na bamwe b' inshuti ze . ku buryo numva nta kibazo yarafitanye n' abasirikare , uretse n' abasirikare nta n' undi bari bafitanye ikibazo .
if you saw your dad with that particular man , what would their relationship have been ? ||| iyo ubonaanaga papa wawe n' uwo mugabo w' umwicanyi ubonaaga bameze batae ?
friendly ? would they drink beer together ? would they work together ? would they sit and talk ? ||| ese ubonaaga ari inshuti nziza ... ese babaga baganira neza ... ? ubonaaga basabanye kutae n' iyo nshuti ye ,
what was that relationship like ? ||| iyo nterahamwe ?
all my dad 's friends were people he used to meet with ; he met some of them at work or some in bars or on the streets . ||| papa abagabo b' inshuti ze bose bari abantu bahuraaga . hari abo bahurairaga mu kazi ... hari abo bahurairaga mu kazi , hari n' abo bahurairaga mu kabari , hari n' abo bahurairaga mu nzira .
he worked very hard and he was very intelligent and the people he used to work with liked him . ||| abo ngabo bose nko mu kazi papa yari umuntu ukora cyane kandi yari umuntu uzi ubwenge . ku buryo nk' abo bakoranaaga mu kazi , benshi baramukundaaga kuko yabaga abishoboye . kuko benshi baramushakaaga cyane .
his friends in bars were people they used to buy each other a drink and he used to make jokes together . ||| abo mu kabari nabo barahuraaga basengeranira . akabasetsa ibiganiro bimeze neza ,
even the man who betrayed him was his very good friend . ||| ndetse n' uwo mugabo wunri umugambanaiye nawe yari umuntu w' inshuti ye cyane .
even the people he used to meet elsewhere liked him because he was always ready to help . ||| kuko bahurairaga ahongaho hose . baba n' abo batakoranaaga bahurairaga mu nzira , baramukundaaga kuko ntacyo atabakoreraaga .
our family members used to always come home to visit him or ask him for money or to simply seek advice from him . ||| ndetse n' abantu bo mu muryango wacu bazaaga mu rugo , baza kumusura , abaza kumusaba amafaranga , abaza kumusaba conseille [ bamugisha inama ] ,
there were always people here in our house . ||| abo bose bazaaga hano buri kihae , hahoraaga abantu bazaaga buri kihae .
do you know how your mother died precisely ? did somebody tell you ? ||| uba uzi uko mama wawe yishwe ?
from where you were in gitarama , did you see the killings taking place , not of your family but ... ? if so , what did you see ? how did the killers go about doing their work ? ||| wowe ubwawe uba urabonye aho bica abantu ? tuvugae nk' aho uri uri i kitaarama , wigeze ubona ahantu hakorerwa ubwicanyi ? nbwira ibyo ubonye muri icyo kihae .
i saw many people being killed . ||| uburyo nbonye bica abantu , nbonye abantu benshi .
i remember in particular this man who was found by the interahamwes from his hiding place . ||| ariko nk' ibyo nibuka hari umugabo rwose nbonye interahamwe ziramuvumbuye ahantu yari yihishe bari bafite ubuhairi ,
some had clubs , others machetes , they run after him for about five minutes before they caught him . ||| bari bafite imihoro , baramwirukankana . nramubonye yirukanse agerageza kubasiga ariko bamwirukankanye nk' iminota igera kuri itanu bataramufata .
someone beat him on his head with a club as i was watching . ||| ariko bagiye kumushyikair umuntu yamuturutse inyuma amukubita ubuhairi mu mutawe nrabirebaaga ,
he did not do anything ; he just fell down and died right away . ||| umugabo nta n' ikindi kintu yakoze , yahise yikubita hasi arapfa .
the other thing i saw is this girl who was also killed very badly . ||| ibindi nbonye hari umukobwa nbonye baishe , uwo mukobwa bamwishe nabi .
they found the place where she was hiding also and run after her . ||| nawe babanje kumuvumbura baramwirukankana ,
she was left there agonizing for about thirty minutes and i was hearing everything . ||| kujya kumwica yabanje kutaka yamaze nk' iminota nka mrongo itatu [ 30 ] atarapfa ,
i saw her dying but i did not have the strength to approach her , as they were still standing next to her , laughing , happy to have found a prey . ||| akiboroga nrabiumvaaga . ariko nbonye apfa ariko ntinigeze ngira ingufu zo kumwegera ngo nrebae aho yari ari . kuko hari hakiri abantu baseka bishimye bavuga bati @: "@ tuvumbuye umuntu . @"
how did you feel ? what was your predominant emotion at that time ? what was your main feeling at that time yves ? how were you feeling inside ? ||| wowe muri wowe inberae mu mutaima wawe wunvaaga umeze utae ?
i was still a child but inside of me i was very sad . ||| mu mutaima wanjye numvaaga ... nri nkiri umwana ariko muri njyae numvaaga ... nbaga nbabaye cyane .
i was also scared but it reached a point where all the fear went . ||| uretse no kuba nri nfite ubwoba , ubwoba bwo bugeze aho burashira .
i reached a point where i felt like i did not know what was going on , or where i was . ||| ariko noneho ngera aho biranyobera . nkaumva ntinzi ibyo nrimo , nk' umva ntinzi n' aho ndi .
seeing a human being killing another one or running after him or her . ||| kubona umuntu yica undi , kubona umuntu yirukankaan undi ,
seeing them agonizing or having wounds all over their bodies because they cut them down is something i was not capable of grasping or fully understanding . ||| niyo wenda atabaga yapfuye ukabona arimo kusamba cyangwa ukabona bamutemye afite ibikomere umubiri wose , n' ibintu ntiumvaaga ntanabashaaga no kusobanukirwa .
i was so miserable ! there 's a day i kept feeling very sad without really knowing why . ||| nbaga nfite agahinda kenshi cyane .
i felt very uncomfortable , very confused despite the fact that it had been a good day as no one was chasing after me . ||| ndetse hari n' igihe nje no kumenya ... mbere y' uko ... ariko ntinri ndi mu rugo , ariko hari iminsi yigeze kugera numva ntekereje mu rugo cyane . nkaumva nrababaye , nkaumva ntahangayitse .
i wrote down the date and i later on found out that it was around that time that my family was murdered . ||| icyo kihae nfashe agapapuro nandika itariki . iyo tariki nje kusanga ari nayo yahuye muri iyo minsi mu rugo bapfuyemo .
i had spent the whole day crying without really knowing why . ||| kuko icyo kihae niriwe ndira ,
it was quite a peaceful day as no one had come where we were hiding on that day . ||| umunsi wose biranyobera . kandi icyo kihae niwo munsi turi tubonye akahaengae kuko nta bantu babaga bahari baje kutuvumbura .
but on that day i was not at peace at all , i kept thinking about home , about my brother . ||| noneho uwo munsi biranyobera nkaumva nta mahoro nfite nirirwa ndira nkatekereza mu rugo cyane ntekereza mukuru wanjye ;
i wrote down the date and kept the peace of paper and memorized the date . ||| icyo nfashe agapapuro nrabiandika . agapapuro ntakabika itariki nyifata mu mutawe .
later on i found out that it was the time it happened . ||| icyo kihae niho nje no kubaza neza nsanga ibyongibyo niho bibereye .
when did you find out about your parents and brother ? ||| ni ryari umenye ko ababyeyi bawe baishwe ?
when did you find out what had happened ? ||| umenye ryari ibyabaye ?
i was told about it after the genocide . ||| nje kubimenya nyuma ya jenoside .
i was so convinced they were still alive ; i had convinced myself that they were not dead . ||| kuko njyae numvaaga batapfuye . nri nishyizemo yuko wenda bashobora kuba bakihari .
i learnt about it later on in august . the people who knew what had happened did not know how to tell us , as they did not know how we were going to handle it . ||| nyuma nbimenye nko mu ... nbabimenye banzae kubitubwira kuko baumvaaga nibabitubwira se turabigenza tutae ? nje kubimenya nko mu kwa munani ,
one day my sister and i had a long conversation and she told me what had happened . it was in august , when the genocide was over . ||| jenoside yararangiye nibwo nje kubimenya ... mushiki wanjye nibwo tuganiriye neza , abinbwira neza anbwira uko bigenze ... hari mu kwa munani jenoside yararangiye .
i did not know where they were and we spent some months living on our own without any family members . ||| kuko ntabwo nri nzi aho bari , kuko nmaze amezi angahe tuba twenyine , nta muntu wo muri famille [ mu muryango ] tubana niho nbimenye .
could you describe for me something that you saw during the genocide that really stays in your mind that you can not get out of your mind ? ||| ushobora kugerageza kunbwira ikintu ubonye muri jenoside kitajya kikuvamo ? ikintu uhora wibuka .
the thing about the genocide that i can never forget is first of all the fact that my parents were killed . ||| ikintu cyo muri jenoside kitashobora kaumvamo , ikintu kinberae nibuka ni ngomaw ugomba kumenya ko ababyeyi bawe bapfuye . icyo kintu ntikishobora kaumvamo .
the ways in which people were killed , and yet they were innocent children , innocent women , innocent parents , is also something i can never forget . ||| kuibuka ukuntu abantu baishwe , ukuntu baicwaaga nabi kandi bari abana beza , ari abakobwa beza cyangwa ababyeyi beza .
jumping over dead bodies , not being able to sleep , having to steal a jacket from the dead all these are things i can never forget . ||| ibyo bintu byo muri jenoside , kubona imirambo cyangwa kugenda usimbuka imirambo . kuba ushaka kuryama nturyamae ahubwo ushaka nk' ikoti ukariambura umuntu upfuye wowe ukarifata , n' ibintu bitashobora kaumvamo .
i can never forget . ||| ntinshobora kujya kuryama ntatekereje ukuntu mu rugo bapfuye ,
i can not go to bed without thinking about them and remembering how they were killed , or without thinking about other children who died or other people i knew . it is not something that i can ever forget . ||| cyangwa se ntatekereje ukuntu abana bapfuye . cyangwa se abantu bapfuye nba nri nzi n' ukuntu bapfuye n' ibintu bitashobora kaumvamo na rimwe .
what does it mean to be a survivor ? ||| kuri wowe kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu wunva bivuze iki ?
what is the consequence for you as a person ? ||| ni izihe ngaruka zo kurokoka jenoside ?
surviving taught me the value of life . ||| jyewe kurokoka , iyo umuntu arokotse nibwo umenya ... nibwo nje kusanga agaciro k' ubuzima .
when you escape death , when maybe someone was about to cut you down and does not do it and you 're still alive the next day , that is when you appreciate life . ||| kuko kurokoka n' ikintu baita ... iyo umuntu agiye kupfa akarokoka . niba uri ugiye kutemaw ukagira imaan ukabona ako kanya ntutemawe ukabona ufite umunsi w' ejo . niho koko uhita ubona ko ubuzima bw' umuntu ari ikintu kihenze ; niho koko uhita umenya ko ubuzima bw' umuntu atari ikintu cyo kukinisha .
you then realize that your life or other people 's lives are of great value . ||| ubuzima bw' undi cyangwa se ubwawe .
you understand that everyone gets affected by things just like you do . ||| kuko nawe ikiba kikubayeho ni nako kiba kibaye ... ninako kinaba no ku wunri muntu iyo ugiye kumukorera ibintu nk' ibyo ngibyo ugiye kukorerwa . ni nayo mpamvu iyo ngiye kukora ikintu nbanza kutekereza jyewe uyu muntu akinkoreye bigenda bite .
i now think twice before i do something bad to others because i know it hurts others as much as it could hurt me . ||| iyo ngiye kukorera umuntu ikintu nribaza nti ese ari njyewe akikoreye nbifata ntae ?
it taught me respect for both my life and for other people 's lives . ||| kuko iyo umuntu acitse ku icumu niho hantu wunva ko ubuzima ari bwiza , kandi ubuzima ari ikintu umuntu agomba kaubaha , buba ubwawe cyangwa buba ubw' abandi
how were your parents buried yves ? ||| utubwira uburyo ababyeyi bawe bashyinguwe ?
i would say that they way they buried them did not please me . ||| nvuga ko uburyo bahambwemo ntabwo bunshimaishije .
in the rwandan culture , when someone dies , people come and mourn with you . ||| kuko nko mu muco wa kinyarwanda iyo umuntu apfuye , haba hari abantu .
they killed them and threw them into some garbage , so to me they were not buried . ||| abantu baraza bakagira ikiriyo ... ariko bo baraishwe barabafata babajugunya ahantu mu myanda ... hatameze neza , bon ... kuri njyae numva batarahambwe .
that is actually one of the things that really hurt about the genocide . ||| ni nacyo kintu nabyo mu binbabaza bya jenoside icyo kintu nacyo kiranbabaza cyane . kuko nbabazaw n' uko ntabashije kuba biibuze mu rugo ,
i wish we had at least buried them as a family . ||| kubona umurambo wabo cyangwa kuba ntarabihambaiye cyangwa kuba tutarabahambye nk' umuryango ,
i would n't say that they were buried because getting somebody 's body and throwing it anywhere and yet they were some respectable and innocent person is not a burial . ||| ibyo bintu biranbabaza cyane . nvuga ko batahambwe kuko iyo ufashe umuntu ukamujugunya , ukamujugunya aho ubonye , kandi yari umuntu wiyubashye ,
it is so wrong ! ||| ukundaaga abantu nta kintu kibi yakoze , nibaza ko ari ibintu ... si ukuhamba ni ibintu bibi .
can you tell me where you found them and when you found them and how you found them ? ||| ibyo ubimenye utae ? wabimenyeye he ? ese ubibawiyew ni iki ?
people had seen them as they were at the neighbours . ||| ku bababonye ubundi bari bari kubaturanyi ,
even my sister who was with them saw the way they killed them . ||| hari hari na mushiki wanjye nawe uri kumwe nabo , unababonye babica . yarahatueretse ati @: "@ ni ahangaha babahambye . @"
he showed me the place and we decided to exhume them as the grass was growing over it in order for us to bury them in a better way no matter how hard that was . ||| ntahagera ntahareba , noneho nyuma tubona hararengeraanye ibyatsi hari ibihuru , niho tugize igitekerezo turavuga tuti @: "@ reka noneho tuzabashyingurae neza .
at least we buried them the way everyone else is buried , in a way that honours them . ||| tugeragezae biibuze n' ubwo bwose bikomeye . @" turabataburura tubashyira aho tuumva biibuze bahambwe nk' abantu nk' uko bari bariho , kandi baiyubashye , kandi nk' uko n' abandi bantu bose bahambwa .
yves , do you think you can forgive the people who killed your parents and your brother ? ||| none se yves utekereza ko ushobora kubabarira abantu bakuiciye ababyeyi ? ubona bishoboka ?
it is very hard . ||| kuri njyae birakomeye cyane .
forgiveness is not easy . ||| kubabarira ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye . ntabwo nvuga ngo @: mpite nbivuga aka kanya ngo @:
i can not just say that i can forgive the person who took my parents away , the person who made me the way i am , who made me to be different from other children , without the affection and the presence of my parents . ||| nvugae ngo nbabarira umuntu ungize gutya , utumye ntagira ababyeyi , nta mera nk' abandi bana . ntagira affection [ urukundo ] y' ababyeyi ,
forgiveness is not easy and it is not something i could do on my own . ||| ntabasha kubaan nabo . ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye . ntabwo ari ibintu nakwishoboza ngo nvugae ngo nbabarira umuntu unyiciye .
it is already hard enough to forgive the person who killed other people apart from my parents . ||| n' utaranyiciye yariciye abandi , nba numva nawe ntapfa kumubabarira . noneho rero nk' uwanyiciye nba numva atari ibintu byoroshye . yewe n' uwishe n' umuntu ntazi ,
forgiving my parents ' murderer is a lot more difficult ; it is something that would require that i think about it for a long time . ||| ariko ari umuntu ntabwo byoroshye kumubabarira . nnjyae uwanyiciye , uwanyiciye nk' ababyeyi aho ho birakomeye ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye . ni ibintu bisaba nk' igihe kirekire cyane .
do you feel that justice has been done for you and your family ? ||| ubona hari icyo ubutabera bukorwa cyangwa bukoze mu kukurengera cyangwa kurengera umuryango wawe ?
justice ? ||| nvuga ko ubutabera ,
since i do not even know where the person who killed my family is ; maybe he is somewhere in jail ... to me , it is like nothing has been done as far as justice is concerned . ||| kuva uwanyiciye ntazi naho ari . wenda ashobora kuba ari muri prison ahantu . ubutabera numva kuri njyae , numva nta kirakorwa kuri njyae .
when you see someone who killed your family members being condemned for something like five years , you know that , sooner or later , the five years will be over and then he will be released . ||| kuko iyo ubonye umuntu wenda ukuiciye akatairw imyaka itanu ,
being imprisoned is a punishment yes , but personally justice has not yet come my way because i have never seen it . ||| ubwo ni ukuvuga ngo nimara kushira azafungurwa .. kufungwa kusa n' igihano ariko nbona jyae ubwo butabera butarangairho kuko ntarabubona ,
they have never judged the people who killed my family , so that i maybe say that they were condemned to death or to life imprisonment . ||| nta rubanza baracira umuntu unyiciye ngo nvugae ngo wenda bamukataiye urupfu cyangwa se kufungwa burundu . ibyo nabyo numva atari igihano ,
therefore , i do n't consider that as a punishment , actually i wonder which type of justice that is . ||| numva ubwo butabera ntazi ubwo ari bwo ,
neither have i ever analysed it to see if it [ justice ] has been done to me . ||| ntintatekereza ubwo ari bwo ngo numvae ndenganuwe .
i once saw one of the people who were present and who were happy about it even though he is not the one who killed them . ||| yee , hari umuntu umwe nigeze kubona , nubwo ataishe ariko nawe yari ari mu bantu bari bari aho ngaho babiishimaiye . nramubonye .
what did you say ? what did you do ? how did you react ? ||| umubonye se uvuze iki ... ukoze iki ... ubiitwayemo utae ?
i did not have the strength to talk to him . ||| ntabwo nigeze ngira imbaraga zo kaongera kumuvugaish ,
i saw him and i was so overwhelmed that i did not know what to say . ||| kusa nramubonye numva ... biranrenze numva nta n' ikintu nmuvugaish .
i felt like maybe if i had talked to him , i could have said or done something wrong out of anger . ||| kuko numvaishe ntacyo nmukorera , kuko numvaishe ngiye kumuvugaish ngira umujinya nkaba ngira ikintu kibi nkora .
i chose to leave . he was going to be questioned in gacaca court . ||| nhisemo kumuhunga nraigendera , kuko yari afunze ari kumwe n' aba ... abari bagiye kumucira urubanza muri bino bya gacacabagiye kumubaza ibintu .
i did not have the strength to even approach him and ask him something . ||| ntabwo nigeze ngira imbaraga zo kumwegera cyangwa ngo mbe ngira ikintu nvugana nawe . kuko numvaaga nta kintu nfite cyo kumubaza .
there was nothing to talk about , he knew who i was and i also knew him . ||| kuko yari anzi nnjyae nri muzi , kumuvugaish numvaaga ntabona icyo muvugaish ,
should i have greeted him ? i did not know what to do so i left it there . ||| ntinmusuhuza , sina ... biranyobeye nramureka .
do you think we learn anything from the genocide ? is the genocide useful in any way ? ||| ubona hari isomo tukura muri jenoside ?
personally the genocide taught me the value of life , it taught me to appreciate having parents . ||| jenoside njyae nbona hari icyo yatuigishije . ku giti cyanjye jenocide yanyigishije kumenya agaciro k' ubuzima . jenoside yanyigishije kumenya ko burya iyo umuntu afite ababyeyi ari ikintu kikomeye . kuba utabafite nibyo bikuha kumenya ... kumenya koko ko ababyeyi b' umuntu ari ingirakamaro .
loosing them is what makes you realize the importance of having them . ||| jenoside yanyigishije byinshi .
the genocide taught me respect for other people 's lives as well as respect for my own life . ||| yanyigishije kaubaha ubuzima bw' abandi . jenoside nvuga ko yatumye menya nk' uko nbivuze kaubaha ubuzima bw' abandi , ituma menya y' uko ubuzima bwanjye ngomba kubufata neza nkabwubaha ,
that 's it ! ||| kandi n' ubwabandi ... nraumva ari ibyo .
yves do you think the genocide is possible again here ? ||| yves utekereza yuko jenoside ishobora kaongera kuba mu rwanda ?
i think it is impossible . ||| nraumva ... njyae numva bitashoboka .
from what i see i believe it can never happen again . ||| njyae numva ntabiizeye nkurikije ibyo nbona nbona ntabiizeye . kubera ko numva jenoside itakaongera kubaho , nbona itazanongera .
when i look at the way today 's youth really fights against it all and the way they really want to fight it and remember it no matter how hard it is , and when we look at the consequences it had on us , i do n't think it is possible ! ||| kubera ko iyo nbona nk' urubyiruko tungana ingufu bashyiramo barwanya ibyo bintu byose tugarageza no kaongera kubiibuka , kandi bitubabaje , kandi tubona ingaruka bitugizeho ,
i think it is impossible ! ||| nbona bitashoboka .
and as we were saying , we need to do all we can for it not to happen again . ||| kandi nbona nk' uko tujya tubiganira tukora n' ibishoboka byose kugirango wenda ntiiongerae .
are you just being hopeful , or do you believe it ? ||| uraumva ufite ibyiringiro ?
i believe my future will be good ; my desire is to be responsible for my life and to be able to help others the way we used to be before . ||| numva ubuzima bw' ejo hazaza bwanjye numva buzaba bwiza . kandi numva nifuza kuba umuntu ushobora kugira icyo yimarair , nnjyae nkagira umwuga nk' abandi , nk' uko turi tumeze mbere .
it will take a good education , which is a must for one to be able to have a good life and to be able to help out others . ||| ibyo kuiga byo ni ngombaw kugirango ugirae ubuzima bwiza . kandi numva ndi umuntu ubaho nfasha abandi bafite ubuzima bubi ,
others who are poor and whose lives are worse than mine . ||| bagenzi banjye wenda tungana ntanshobora kuba nfite icyo nrusha ,
i believe i will soon be able to help them out with the little i will be having . ||| numva mu minsi irimbaire nzagerageza kugira icyo nnjyae nbafasha , muri bike nba nfite numva ngerageza kugira icyo nbafasha .
i believe the future will be better than the last ten years have been . ||| numva ubuzima bw' ejo hazaza buzaba bwiza . kurenza ubwashize uko buri bumeze mu myaka cumi ishize .
what do you think rwanda has to learn as a country ? and how is the best way to do it ? ||| ubona u rwanda nk' igihugu rukwaiye kukura somo ki ku bibaye ?
rwanda is a small , beautiful country and i believe all rwandans should learn to love each other and to help each other out . ||| jyae nbona isomo u rwanda ruvanamo ... ... nbona bibaye mu rwanda kuko u rwanda n' igihugu gitoya kandi cyiza , nbona abanyarwanda riba isomo y' uko bagomba kukundana , gufashanya nicyo kintu kituma u rwanda ... kandi no kutaibagirwa ... kutaibagirwa ibyahise .
they also need to always remember what happened and to try and love each other and to help each other out . ||| kuhora baibuka kandi bakatekereza gufashanya .
because for all this to happen , people did not love or respect each other . ||| kuko ibingibi byose kugirango bibae n' uko abantu batakundanaaga .
nobody respected other people 's loves . ||| kandi abantu bata ... basuzuguraanye nta muntu wubashaye ubuzima bw' undi . kandi kubikora nabyo kugirango babigeraeho birakomeye .
it will take a lot to make it happen as each rwandan has his or her own problems ; if people were understanding what challenges we go through individually , we would be able to help each other more effectively . ||| kuko buri muntu wese aba afite ibibazo bye , aba afite ibimuhangayikaishije . iyaba abantu bashoboraaga kumenya ko ibibazo by' undi ugomba kubiumva , nawe ukamubwira ibyawe niho abantu bafashanya .
what 's the most difficult aspect of being a survivor ? ||| ni izihe ngoraane zikomeye ubona zikomoka ku kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu ?
the thing that constitutes a challenge in being a survivor is remembering what happened to you . ||| ikintu nbona kikomeye nk' umuntu ucitse ku icumu ... kigora cy' umuntu ucitse ku icumu n' ukuibuka ibyakubayeho .
sometimes as a survivor you can remember so many bad things that it destroys your life , it stops you from doing anything . ||| kuko iyo wibutse ibyakubayeho hari igihe bishobora kutuma ubuzima bwawe bupfa . iyo ucitse ku icumu hari ibintu uba ufite wibuka bibi bishobora kuba bikubuza kugira ikindi kintu ukora . bishobora no kuba bikuhindura mu mutaima wawe ,
you can change to become a very wicked person because of the things you saw or the things you went through . ||| ukaba uhinduka umugome , kubera ibyo uhuye nabyo , cyangwa ibyo ubonye .
being a survivor can make life very hard as i said because of what you saw . ||| kucika ku icumu ikintu ... ingaruka ... nvuga nk' ingaruka mbi y' ikintu kituma ubuzima bukomera nk' uko nbivuze nk' ibyo ubonye ,
what you saw might change the way you look at people and it can even stop you from loving anyone . ||| ibyo uhuye nabyo bishobora kuba bikuhindura , uko ureba abantu bikaba bituma nta muntu ukunda . kubera ko uhuye n' ubuzima bubi .
your love for people can be completely destroyed . you get to see so much evil that you do not fear anything anymore . ||| bikaba bituma rwa rukundo uri ufite rushobora no guhungabana ku bantu .
even afterwards , life becomes so challenging that you can not achieve anything in life . ||| kuko utinyuka ibintu byinshi . ubona ibintu byinshi bibi . nyuma yaho rero ubuzima bukakukomerair bukatuma nta kintu ugeraho .
you sleep and you 're woken up by nightmares of people with machetes who want to kill . or you remember the child you saw being killed . ||| uryama ugashiguka , kubera ya mihoro ubonye abantu bakuri hejuru ... kubona uko umwana yicwa .
that 's the thing that i think can be such a challenge for the survivors . ||| icyo n' icyo kintu nbona kikomerair abantu bacitse ku icumu .
it affects them for the rest of their lives . ||| ni ibyababayeho kandi bikibagiraho ingaruka , mu buzima bwabo .
you said that your mother gave you advice on how to behave when she is no longer here . how have you done that ? what 's the advice that she gave you and how have you done that ? ||| uvuze ko mama wawe yajyaaga akugira inama y' uko ugomba kuitwara . none se ubu atakiriho ugerageje utae kubishyira mu bikorwa ?
maybe i can talk about how she told me how i should behave in her absence . ||| nvuga nk' ibyo yanbwiye by' ukuntu ngomba kuitwara igihe atazaba ahari ,
she told me , "@ you should love people and always think of living with people peacefully . @" ||| yaravugaaga ati @: "@ ujyae ukunda abantu , kandi ujyae utekereza kubaan n' abantu neza . @"
then i wondered why she told me that but later on ; when she was no longer there , i thought about it again and i realized how important it is . ||| ibyo yarabinbwiye kandi akibinbwira nibajije impamvu abinbwiye . ariko nyuma nje kubitekerezaho nibaza ... atakihari nbona koko ko ibyo bintu ngomba kubikurikiza .
i always think about it and try my best to live in good terms with everybody . ||| nyuma yaho ubungubu ibyo bintu nbaigenderaho , ni ibintu mpora nibuka cyane . ngerageza kubaan na buri muntu wese neza .
even when somebody hurts me , i try not to focus on that , as it is something that has to be there . ||| n' iyo umuntu yaba akugiraiye nabi ugerageza kubiirengagiza . kuko burya nta muntu utagira nabi nawe bishobora kukubaho .
i try to love people and to understand people and what kind of challenges they face in life . ||| ngerageza kukunda abantu ... kaumva ikibazo cya mugenzi wanjye . ibyo nibyo ngendairho kubera ko yabinbwiye . kandi nkagerageza kuvuga nti @: yabinbwiye azi impamvu kandi yabinbwiye ariwe muntu unkundaaga bwa mbere .
it is something i try my best to be able to put into practice . ||| ni ibintu mpora ngerageza kukora .
you 've been working on the project in gisozi . ||| hashize iminsi ukora ku mushinga wo kaubaka urwibutso rwa gisozi .
why ... ? ||| utubwira impamvu ?
because the gisozi project is ours and we need to be the ones to do it . ||| kuku ... numva biriya bintu byo ku gisozi , nbona ari ibintu bitureba kandi tugomba kukora .
if i do not do it , who else will do it ? ||| kuko nbona umuntu atabikoze nbona nta wunri muntu ubikora .
not everyone is capable of doing it . ||| kuko nbabishobora ni bake .
spending all your time looking into the lives of people who died and looking at their pictures is very sad . ||| kuhora buri kihae wunva ubuzima bw' abantu bapfuye , kuhora buri kihae ureba amafoto y' abantu bapfuye , ni ibintu biteye agahinda cyane .
but i do so and i do it with all my strength because it needs to be done . ||| ariko impamvu njyewe nbikoramo nkabishyiramo ingufu ni uko jyewe nbona ari ibintu bigomba kubaho .
so that even the people who want them to be forgotten will have failed . ||| kugirango n' abashaka ko byibagirana babiburae .
i think the day the project is completed it will have a lot of impact . ||| nbona ko umunsi biriya bintu byo ku gisozi umunsi birangiye , nbona ari ibintu bizaba bifite ingufu cyane . kuko bizafasha abantu benshi cyane .
it is very helpful even to us . ||| ntawe ubwacu biratufasha .
the day you will want to remember your friends or your family , you will be able to go there . ||| igihe uzajya ushaka kuibukair ababyeyi bawe , cyangwa n' inshuti zawe , cyangwa n' umuryango wawe .
that 's why i give myself fully to that project because it will be of great help . ||| nbona ari ahantu tuzajya , tukajya tuhajya hakatufasha . niyo mpamvu ku giti cyanjye nbona ari ibintu ngomba kushyiramo ingufu zishoboka .
it will even show the international community that the genocide actually happened . ||| kandi nbona ari ibintu by' ingirakamaro bizaereka n' amahanga ko koko jenoside yabaye .
thank you ! ||| urakoze .
is there anything that you feel you should say that i have n't asked ? ||| ariko haba hari ikindi kintu ushakaaga kuvuga utavuze ukivuga .
i do not have much to add but the only thing i can say is that life after ten years is a very difficult life . ||| ntacyo narenzaho , kusa icyo nvuga ni uko ubuzima bwanjye nyuma y' imyaka icumi ni ubuzima bukomeye kandi butoroshye .
some people think that the genocide is over and there 's absolutely no problem . ||| abantu bazi ko jenoside yarangiye ibintu byose birangiye nta kibazo .
in fact it is now after ten years that some people are starting to realise the consequences of the genocide . ||| ariko ahubwo nyuma y' imyaka icumi nibwo abantu benshi batangiye kubona ingaruka za jenoside .
some people are getting to understand what genocide is . people are still hurting . ||| ni nabwo batangiye kumenya jenoside icyo ari cyo kuko hari abantu bakibabaye .
when someone tells you that they have been unhappy for ten years , they mean it . ||| kuko iyo wunva umuntu akubwira ati @: "@ maze imyaka icumi ntishima , " ntaba akubeshya . kuko burya aba amaze imyaka icumi ataishima .
life ten years later is a tough one and this is still too soon , we still have a long way to go and despite the fact that those who did it do not want us to progress , we will try and move forward . ||| ubuzima bwa nyuma y' imyaka icumi ni ubuzima butoroshye . kandi n' ubungubu bukikomeye kuko haracyari kare . nbona inzira ndende ikihari , kandi tuzagerageza kuyi ... tukagerageza ku ... kujya mbere ,
and i believe god will help us to do so and to be able to help one another . ||| kuko ababikoze bashaka ko tubaho nabi . niyo mpamvu tugomba kugerageza ntitubaeho nabi . kandi nziko imaan izatufasha tukabaho neza .
the survivors do not live in good conditions , the orphans have a difficult life and they need other survivors to be able to share the challenges they go through and also the victories , the way out . ||| kandi tukanafashanya kuko abacitse ku icumu bose ntabwo ariko bameze neza , imfubyi zihari ntabwo ari ko zimeze neza . zikeneye abacitse ku icumu bagenzi bazo kugirango babahumurizae . bababwirae nabo uko babigenza kugirango ubwo buzima bubi baburengae .
i think us survivors need each other . ||| nbona ko abacitse ku icumu turakeneraanye , kandi tugomba gufashanya .
very few people who are not survivors can actually be able to help out a survivor . ||| kuko imfubyi ntabwo zishobora ,
whereas a survivor can encourage another one better , as he or she is the one who can relate to what they are going through and who can show them that is it actually possible to overcome . ||| nta muntu ... ni abantu bake bashobora ... yahumuriza undi ucitse ku icumu we ataracitse ku icumu .
sometimes hearing about the challenges other people go through makes you feel like yours are less important . ||| kuko niwe uzi ubuzima yahuye nabwo , kuko niwe uzi ko ubwo buzima yaburenga kuko burya iyo umuntu akubwiye ibibazo bye nibwo wunva ko ibyawe nta kibazo wowe ufite ,
it instils some strength in you ! that 's my opinion ! ||| ahubwo ukaumva ugize imbaraga kuko hari undi muntu umeze nkawe .
my name is murengezi wilberforce . ||| izina ryanjye ni murengezi wilbeforce ,
i am 58 years old . ||| nkaba nfite imyaka mirogo itanu n' umunani .
wilberforce perhaps you could just tell me , how many people were in your family before the genocide ? ||| wilbeforce , umuryango wawe uri ukizawe n' abantu bangahe , mbere ya jenoside ?
there was my wife and i and our five children . ||| nri nfite ... jyewe n' umugore wanjye n' abana batanu .
and how many of your family are left after the genocide ? ||| none se hasigaye bangahe bakiriho nyuma ya jenoside ?
i met my wife a long time ago when we were still in secondary school ; we went to the same school . ||| eh , umugore wanjye tumenyaanye kera , turi abanyeshuri muri ecole secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] .
we fell in love then . after high school , we were engaged for four other years before we got married . ||| turiganyae , niho tutangiraiye kauzura . kandi tumaze kuiga ecole secondaire tumaze imyaka ine tutararongoraan turi aba fiances ,
then in 1971 , we got married . ||| hanyuma muri 1971 turarongoraan .
therefore , she was not a girl i just met and married but we were together for a long time before marriage . ||| ntabwo rero yari umukobwa tupfuye kuhora kusa , ariko n' umuntu tubanye igihe kirekire tutararongoraan ,
even our parents knew each other because they were both pastors in the episcopal church in rwanda . ||| kandi n' ababyeyi bacu bari baraziraanye , kuko bose bari abapasitori muri eglise episcopale mu rwanda .
so we spent thirty @-@ three years together . ||| tubanye ... uraumva tumaraanye imyaka mirongo itatu n' itatu ... eh ... hari ibyo nbeshye gatoya kuko tumaraanye imyaka ... kugeza muri 1994 ,
sorry that was n't true ; by 1994 , we had been married for twenty @-@ three years . ||| ubwo turi tumaraanye imyaka makumyabiri n' itatu turongoraanye .
we had two sons and three daughters together in those twenty @-@ three years . ||| muri iyo myaka makumyabiri n' itatu , niyo tubyayemo abahungu babiri n' abakobwa batatu .
tell me about your second child . ||| nbwira noneho ku mwana wawe wa kabiri [ cyangwa ku buheta bwawe ] .
my second born was called jean @-@ claude . ||| eh , umwana wanjye wa kabiri yitwaaga jean claude .
he was a very tall guy . ||| yari umuhungu muremure cyane ,
he was in his 6th year of secondary school , almost finishing high school . ||| uri ugeze muri 6 eme secondaire [ muwa gatandatu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] ,
he was a very quiet guy . ||| agiye kurangiza humanite , kandi yari umuhungu ukunda kuceceka cyane ,
he liked listening to the radio news , which used to make me predict that maybe in the future he would become a journalist or a politician . ||| ariko yakundaaga kaumva amakuru ya radio . nbonaaga ari umuntu uzaba umunyamakuru , cyangwa umupoliticien [ umunyapolitike ] niko nibaza .
there 's nothing much i can say about him because he was not very talkative . ||| nta kinri kikomeye nmuvugaho ubungubu kuko ntiyakundaaga kuvuga cyane ,
but he loved to listen to others talking . ||| ahubwo yakundaaga kaumva ibyo abantu bavuga .
there 's nothing more i can say . ||| ngirango nta ... ntacyo narenzaho kuvuga kuko ... njya kugenda ,
when i was leaving , i called him and told him to be the one to drive the car when they go to a place where they were planning to go with his mother . ||| nsize mubwiye ko agomba kufasha nyina , kutwara imokoka kujya ahantu bari bagiye kujya .
the last thing i told him was not to drive too fast and to be careful on the road . that 's all i can say . ||| kandi nramuhamagaye nranbwira nti ... @: niryo jambo rya nyuma nmubwiye nti : jya ujyenda buhoro mu muhanda kandi witonde . ngirango nta kinri narenzaho ki ...
tell me about your third child . ||| nbwira nanone ku mwana wawe wa gatatu [ ubuheture ] .
she was a girl called kayitesi claudette . ||| eh , yari umwana w' umukobwa witwaga kayitesi clodette .
she was also in her last year of secondary school . ||| nawe yari ageze mu mwaka unyuma wa secondaire .
she was not very healthy but she was very bright in school . i thought she would have a very good future . ||| yari umukobwa ufite amagara mato , ariko w' umunyabwenge cyane mu ishuri .
as any parent i wanted the best for her and since she was very good in science , i thought she was going to be a medical doctor . ||| kandi yari umwana na ... nbonaaga inberae ... uko umubyeyi aba yifuriza umwana , numvaaga nbona ko ... kubera ko yari azi ibintu bya science cyane nbonaaga ko ashobora kuzaba umuganga [ docteur en medicine ] .
what about the fourth born ? ||| naho umwana wa kane ?
my fourth child was francine ingabire . ||| ... umwana wa kane , ni francine inkabirae ,
you have her on your photos . ||| mufite kuri ariya mafoto yanyu ,
she loved her sister claudette very much ; she loved to swim . ||| yari umwana ukunda mukuru cyane , clodette . kandi yari umwana ukunda kaoga , kujya kaoga [ natation ] .
she was always there to talk to us after work , she would chat with us and ask her what we needed . ||| yari umwana ukunda kuza tuvuye ku kazi , akaza kutuganiriza , kutubaza icyo tushaka ,
not many children do that but she would come and ask us if we wanted a drink or some water or tea . ||| akenshi abana benshi ntibakunda kubigira . ariko we abaza @:
she was a child who cared a lot about her parents . ||| "@ nkuhae fanta ... nkuhae amazi ... nkuhae icyayi ... @" ubonaaga ko ari umwana witaye no ku babyeyi cyane ,
perhaps more than her older brothers and sisters did . ||| ahari kurenza bakuru be .
what is your special memory of her ? ||| ni ikihae kintu cy' umwihariko wibuka kuri we ?
yes i do believe in god and i still work for him until this day . ||| yego . nizera imaan kandi nracyayikorera kugeza n' ubu ,
i am not a pastor like my father but i do what i can . ||| ntinri pasteur nka data ,
i love to sing and i lead some children in a choir . ||| ariko ibyo nshoboye kukora ... ubundi nkunda kuririmba . nrabikora nfite abana nyobora mu makwaya [ choir cyangwa chorale ] kuko numva ko ,
i do it because i guess there is a mission that god left me to complete in my remaining lifetime . ||| n' aho ibyo bibaye , ariko imaan ifite icyo yansigaraije kugirango nyikorerae mu buzima bwanjye buri busigaye .
can you tell me how your wife and your children died ? ||| ushobora lkumbwira uburyo umugore n' abana bawe bapfuye ?
i was n't there like i told you before . ||| uko bapfuye ... nk' uko nbabwiye ntinri mpari ,
but celine my daughter who survived told me some of the things . ||| ariko uwo mukobwa wanjye usigaye , celine . hari ibyo yanbwiye ,
also some neighbours who escaped death by hiding and fleeing told me about it . ||| kandi hari abaturanyi bashoboye kuihisha , bashoboye gutoroka ntibapfa . nabo baranbwiye .
we were living in kicukiro . ||| ubundi turi tutuye ku kicukiro , kandi umunsi wa mbere baje kumubaza ,
on the first day they came to ask my family , "@ who is murengezi ? @" ||| itariki zirindwi baje kumubaza , babaza mu muryango wanjye , bati @: "@ murengezi ni uwuhe ? @"
they told them i was not there . ||| undi nawe ababwira ko ntahari .
they shot my wife on the feet and said , "@ we shall come back . find him ! @" ||| hanyuma umugore wanjye bamurashe ku kirengae bamubwira bati @: "@ turagaruka tusangae umubonye . @"
they did not come back until the 8th when my family went to hide in a convent which was in the neighbourhood . ||| ariko ntabwo bagarutse . kugeza ku itariki umunani , bahungira mu babikira ,
on the 10th , they came and told them that everybody should go down , as they wanted to check their identity cards . ||| bari hafi bose , ku itariki ya cumi , baraza bababwira ngo mumanukae muesae . tugiye gukontorora ... tugiye kureba identite zanyu ,
they stood next to a roadblock and took them to a hole nearby , one by one . ||| kandi babashyira kuri bariyeri yari hepfo y' urugo . batangira kugenda bajyana umwe umwe , umwe , ahantu hari icyobo hepfo y' umuhanda .
some were shot dead , others were killed with a hammer , and some others were hacked . ||| bamwe baaka ... bakabarasa abandi bakabakubita inyundo abandi bakabatema .
in fact , someone told me that my wife was last taken as she was limping and they shot her inside the hole where the others were . ||| ariko mu kuvuga ukuri , umuntu umwe yanbwiye kuko kuko umugore wanjye yacumbagiraga bamujyanye hanyuma , bamurasair aho abandi bari bari muri uwo mwobo , barunda aho ,
the hole is still there ; we have constructed it . ||| muri uwo mwobo . uwo mwobo n' ubu turawubaakaiye ,
about a hundred people in our neighbourhood died and we buried them all together in the same grave , which we built up . ||| hapfuye abantu muri ako kagari k' iwacu bageze ku ijana . kandi bose tubashyize mu mwobo umwe turawufunga , turabubakira .
there were other people in my house apart from my wife and my children . ||| ariko mu rugo rwanjye ntabwo harimo abana banjye kusa n' umugore ,
the people who were working for us were also there . ||| harimo n' abakozi .
there was a lady , a friend of ours who used to work for us . she had stopped working for us as we got for her another job , she happened to be at home on that day . ||| hari umukobwa umwe w' inshuti yacu ... uri umukozi wacu , ariko hanyuma yari yaragiye turamushakiye akazi ahandi .
they checked her id and found out she was a hutu and they told her to leave . ||| we barebye mu identite [ indangamuntu ] basanga ari umuhutukazi , kandi baramubwira bati @: "@ we va aho ntacyo tukushakira . @"
she was helping out my wife who was wounded and she told them she was n't going to leave and they could kill her if they wanted . ||| kandi kuko yari asindagije umugore wanjye yari yakomeretse , we yaravuze ati @: "@ jyewe ntabwo muva iruhande , nimunyica munyicanae nawe . @"
so they murdered her right there next to my wife . ||| yanze kumuva iruhande kandi bamwiciye hamwe n' umugore wanjye .
because he was tall , claude , according to what his sister told me , was beaten with a club on his head and they threw him inside the hole . ||| claude kuko ari muremure , ibyo ni mushiki we ubinbwiye . bamukubise agafuni mu mutawe hanyuma yitura hasi hanyuma bamanukaan mu mwobo .
after hitting you with a hammer or with something else , then they would shoot you in order to stop people from making noise . ||| ariko ahongaho icyo bakoraaga iyo bamaraaga kukukubita inyundo cyangwa ikindi bakurikizaagaho kukurasa isasu kugirango we kukomeza kusakuza .
some of the survivors told me about a soldier , i do n't know his name , who came and told the interahamwe to make sure they [ victims ] do not make too much noise . @" ||| kandi hari umusirikare umwe uhaje ntinzi izina rye ariko n' abamumbwiye . abo bakize , ko yaje akababwira ati @: "@ mwe kutuma basakuza .
do it as fast as possible , do n't give them time to beg you to stop ; after beating them with a club just shoot them . ||| mubigirae buhoro be kutaka , mubakubitae inyundo nimurangizae mubarase , mujyae mumurasa birangirae .
we do not want people 's bodies on the street as satellites are watching us . @" ||| kandi mugirae vuba hano mu muhanda hano ntitushaka abantu bahaguma , za satelite ziratureba . @"
i was told this by my neighbour who managed to hide , his wife was also killed . ||| ibyo ni ibyo nbwiye n' umuturanyi wanjye turi tuturanye , we ushoboye kuihisha , ariko nawe umugore we yarapfuye . ariko we yashoboye kuihisha ntiyagira icyo aba .
the truth is that i did not see any of this ; it is my young daughter celine who told me about it . ||| mu kuvuga ukuri rero , ntabyo nbonye uretse uwo mwana mutoya celine uwineza ,
i do n't know if it is god who sent somebody but a soldier came and said that all the young children should go back to the nuns ' home . ||| we ntinzi niba ari imaan yohereje umuntu ariko haje umusirikare aravuga ati @: "@ abana bato bose ... muesae muzamukae .
celine was only nine years old then and so she went back to the nuns ' home because that man told them to do so . ||| kandi na celine yari umwana muto w' imyaka icyenda nawe arazamuka basubira mu babikira . ni uko yakize kubera ko uwo muntu yaje akavuga ati @: "@ abana bato muzamukae musubirae mu kibikira . @"
the other thing that happened is that her mother gave her the car keys and told her to give them to her dad [ me ] in case she would be lucky to see him again . ||| kandi ikintu kibaye ni uko yaramubwiye ... nyina yaramurembuje , amuha imfunguzo z' imodoka ati @: "@ uzazihae papa numubona . @"
but she never gave them to me because they were running and even the car was ... ||| ntabwo yashoboye kuzimpa kuko bairukanse kandi icyabaye ikikomeye n' uko n' iyo modoka ntabwo bashoboye ...
what happened to francine ? ||| francine se we ibye bigenze bite ?
about francine ... i do n't know anything about what happened to her . ||| ku bya francine rwose ntacyo nmenya ,
her younger sister does not say anything about her although she saw many things happen . ||| kuko na murumuna we ntacyo avuga . yabonye byinshi ariko avuga bike cyane .
but she just told me that they hacked her with a machete . ||| ariko mu magambo avuga yanbwiye , yanbwiye ko bamutemye n' umupanga .
i do n't like to ask her too many questions , because i know she does not like to talk about it . ||| ntabwo nkunda kumubaza byinshi kuko iyo ntangiye kumuganiriza nbona ko nawe nta kunda kubivuga cyane .
sometimes when i ask her something she answers , but she is unable to have a long conversation about it . ||| akunda kuicecekair . ariko rimwe na rimwe iyo mubajije akantu arakanbwira ariko kuganira umwanya munini akutekerereza ntabwo bimukundira .
what does it mean to be a parent who has lost his wife and his children ? ||| wunva usobanura utae , kuba uri umubyeyi ukapfusha abana n' umugore mu bintu nk' ibi ?
at first , it felt like it was a nightmare but as time goes you get to realize that it has actually happened because you do not get to see them anymore ! ||| mbere , umuntu yumvaaga ko ahari yari inzozi , ahari arimo kurota . ariko iminsi ikashira indi ikataha ,
sometimes i talk to them at night as if they were still around ! ||| kuko ukaumva ko ari ibintu bibaye , kuko utababona . kandi rimwe na rimwe [ ntinzi niba n' abandi bijya bibabaho ] ariko jyae rimwe na rimwe hariho igihe nganira n' umwe muri bo . nijoro ,
it is a big problem because it can never disappear completely . ||| ukaumva muraganiriye , ariko biba ikibazo kuko ntibikushiramo .
god blessed me with another wife and two more children . ||| kuko nkanjyae imaan yampaye umugisha nbona undi mugorae , ndetse nongera no kubyara abandi bana babiri batoya .
you can never completely forget , especially at this time of the year you think about them and remember them . ||| ariko ntabwo bikushiramo iteka cyane cyane iyo bigeze muri iki kihae , utangira kubaibuka , kubatekereza ndetse no muri kamere yawe , mu nbaraga zawe ,
you can never be the same person again , your character and your whole being change . you can never forget ; it is impossible ! ||| uri usanganywe hari ikintu kigabanuka cyane ... kigabanuka cyane . ntabwo umuntu ashobora kaongera kumera nk' uko yari ameze ntabwo bikunda . kuko famille uba urabayemo ... famille yawe ,
after living the family you lived with for twenty @-@ five years , i have told you that i met my wife in my childhood and we grew up together , we got married and we got kids and suddenly it was all gone . ||| mukamara imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu , noneho nvuye ku mugorae wanjye we kuko tumenyaanye kera tukiri abana . uraumva ni souvenir zo mu bwana zirakura , zirakura kugeza igihe mubaye ... mwubatse urugo mukabana neza ,
sometimes you wonder why you survived ! ||| mukabyara abana , hanyuma bikashira . wunva usa n' aho usigaye ... utari ... ukibaza ndetse rimwe na rimwe impamvu usigaye .
it is a very tough question . ||| ni ... ni ikibazo kikomeye .
because , for one to be able to forgive , you first of all need to know whom you 're forgiving , you can not forgive if no one asks you to forgive him or her or when you do n't know who it is you 're forgiving . ||| kuko kubabarira umuntu , ubaw mbere na mbere ugomba kubanza ukamenya uwo ari we . kuko ntiubabarira umuntu utakusabye imbabazi . cyangwa se utamenye uwo ari we ngo umurebae uti @:
or maybe when nobody has come to ask for forgiveness so that you can at least acknowledge that they were going through some sort of madness . ||| uriya yari yabaye umusazi reka muihorerae .
the word "@ forgiveness @" is a tough one . ||| birakomeye rero kuvuga ijambo ryo kubabarira .
but i believe if someone would come to me and say , "@ i betrayed you , i murdered your wife , i murdered your kids @"@ , i would forgive them . ||| ariko mpamya ko umuntu aje akanbwira ati @: " nrakuhemukaiye nkuiciye umugore , nkuiciye abana , " nmubarira .
i 'd also become a murderer if i killed them . ||| kuko mwishe nnjyae nba nbaye umwicanyi .
i would truly forgive them but the question is who to forgive . ||| nmubabarira rwose . ariko ikibazo kihari ni ukumenya ahubwo uwo ubabarira uwo ari we ,
who is it ? ||| ni inde ?
not all hutus killed . ||| kuko abahutu bose ntabwo baishe ,
therefore you can not say that you 're forgiving the hutus . ||| ntabwo rero uvuga ngo urababarira abahutu .
you need to know who did it and then be able to say that , so and so did this to me but i forgive him or her . ||| ugomba kumenya umuntu ku izina rye uti kanaka yankoreye ibi ariko nramubabariye .
as a christian i know it is written , "@ forgive others as i forgive you . @" ||| kandi nk' umukristo nnjyae nzi ko bavuga ngo mujyae mubabarira abantu ibyaha babakorera kuko nnjyae ubyo munkorera nrabibabarira .
therefore , as a believer i truly believe it is possible to forgive but you ought to know whom you are forgiving . ||| nk' umukristo rero nemera ko umuntu ashobora kubabarira umuntu , ariko cyane cyane agomba kumenya uwo ababarira uwo ari we .
so if they came before me and asked me to forgive them , i could do it . ||| aje inberae yanjye rero akansaba imbabazi , nmubabarira .
that 's the way i can put it . but the condition is that they would say it . ||| njyae numva ari uko nbivuga ariko yabivuze .
you can not forgive in general . who is it you 're forgiving ? ||| kuko ntabwo utanga imbabazi ngo uvugae ngo nrababariye bande se ?
i think that is what we lack here in rwanda , that someone would come and acknowledge that they betrayed you , that they killed your people . ||| mpanya ndetse ko aricyo kintu tubura muri iki gihugu cyacu cyo mu rwanda . ni uko umuntu ashobora kuvuga ati @: " jyewe nrakuhemukaiye .
if it were the case , people would forgive . ||| ngize gutya , nishe abantu bawe , none nbabarira . @" icyo kihae umuntu yababarira ,
very few people acknowledge what they did and you wonder if these people killed themselves , if they just happened to die . ||| ariko igihe abantu bose ... benshi babihakana ko ntabyo bakoze , ukibaza niba abo bantu baraiishe , barapfuye kusa .
it is so obvious when you compare the number of the victims to the number of those who acknowledge being the perpetrators of the genocide . ||| kuko abantu babiemera nibake cyane ; ugereranyaije n' umubare w' abantu bapfuye .
the same people who were our neighbours . ||| abo tuturanye ... turi tuturanye ,
i 'll give you the example of one of my neighbours called simbizi , there was one house between his and mine . ||| nkubwira urugero rumwe rw' umugabo turi tuturanye witwa simbizi . hagati ye n' iwanjye hari haciyemo inzu imwe .
we had known each other for a long time . ||| turi tuziraanye kuva kera .
when they arrested him they asked me to come and identify him . ||| kandi bamufashe baje kunbaza kugirango nrebae niba muzi .
when i got there they asked him if he knew me , he said no ! ||| kandi mugeze inberae baramubajije bati @: "@ uyu muntu uramuzi ? @" yaravuze ati @: "@ oya ntabwo muzi . @"
you see how difficult it is ! ||| umh ! uraumva icyo kintu kirakomeye noneho kugirango umuntu avugae ngo ntakuzi ,
someone we used to live with and spend a lot of time with , his child used to come home and share meals with mine and he said he does n't know me and yet we were neighbours ! ||| umuntu tuiraraanwaga , mwasangiraga , umwana we yajyaaga aza iwanjye akasangira n' abanjye rwose . umh !
despite the fact that we were neighbours , he said he did n't know me . ||| ariko yaravuze ngo ntabwo anzi , kandi turi tuturanye .
that shows how much forgiveness will be difficult as long as rwandans will not tell the truth about what they did . otherwise , forgiveness is for sure the ideal thing to do . ||| ibyo rero bigaragaza ko abanyarwanda igihe bataravugaish ukuri , no kuemera ikintu bakoze , kutanga imbabazi bizaruhanya . ariko ubundi nibyo biri byiza .
so is justice possible or not ? ||| none se ubwo wunva ubutabera bushoboka ? cyangwa usanga butashoboka ?
do you feel justice has been done for your children ? ||| wowe wunva ubutabera burakoze ku biha bikorewe abana bawe ?
so far , no ! no justice has been done so far ! ||| kugeza ubu ntabwo irakorwa . kugeza ubu nta justice [ ubutabera ] irakorwa , eeh ... nvuga kuri jyae ntayo irakorwa ,
in my opinion , not yet and i believe even others feel the same way . ||| kandi mpamya ko no kubanri ari uko .
because what justice can be done to somebody who wiped out your children , all your family ? ||| kuko justice y' umuntu ukumaze umuryango , ukumazeho abana , ni iyihe ?
what do you gain when they are imprisoned for five , or six or ten years ? ||| kufungwa imyaka itanu , cyangwa itandatu , cyangwa icumi bakamufungura uba ubonye iki ?
what punishment is that ? ||| aba ahanawe iki ?
justice will be done according to the laws of the country , but many will never be known and that is a very big issue because many have fled from where their former residence . ||| justice ... ubutabera buzakorwa abantu bazakiraw imanza bakurikije amategeko uko avugaw , ariko abenshi ntibazamenyekana . abenshi ntabwo bazamenyekana . niho ikibazo gikomereye .
they now live in places where they are not known . ||| kuko abenshi bahunze n' aho biciye , bakajya kutura ahandi batabazi .
or maybe they are known but nobody has the courage to report them for fear that they might take revenge afterwards . ||| ahandi ndetse nbagira abo bamenya bakatinya kubavuga , kuko babagirair nabi hanyuma .
it is a very big issue in rwanda . it will be very difficult unless they ask for forgiveness and confess their sin and acknowledge them . ||| ni ... mu rwanda n' ikibazo kikomeye cyane kugirango hatabaye kusaba imbabazi , no kuirega kw' abantu , no kuemera icyaha bakoze , bizaruhanya cyane .
how does it make you feel personally that you were n't there when your family died ? ||| wiyumvise kutae , igihe uri ugiye hanyuma ukaumva ko umuryango wawe bawishe ? wumvise umerewe utae ... ?
i got sick , with a weird sickness i had never heard of before . ||| eeh , nrarwaye . eeh ... , nrwaye indwara ntazi ,
my whole body was itching and i was scratching myself all over . ||| buri bwo bwa mbere ingeraho , ariko nrwaye kuishima [ ahita yishima mu mutawe no ku maboko ] , umubiri wose .
i went to see a doctor and they could n't give me any medication . ||| nkishima cyane kumara igihe kandi njya kwa muganga ntibanbonerae umuti .
the psychologist told me that it 's ok to cry when i feel like it and that i could do it as much as i wanted maybe when i am alone . ||| kandi umuganga yaranbwiye umwe ngiye kureba ureba ibierekeye iby' ihahamuka cyangwa ibindi ... aranbwira ati @: " nuwumva ushaka kurair jya urira cyane .
i was in nairobi , kenya then , all by myself . ||| wiherereye urirae . @" icyo kihae nri jyenyine nri nrashoboye kugera muri kenya i nairobi ,
during the day i used to walk around and spend time with others who were in the same situation . ||| kandi hafi ninjoro buri kihae ... uraumva ku manywa uratemberaaga ukajya kureba abandi bahunze mukaganira ,
but almost every night , i would remember everything and i would feel like i did not know where i was . ||| ariko ninjoro uryamye nibwo wibuka ibintu byose , ukaumva aho usigaye , ukaumva utazi ibyo ari byo .
in reality , apart from my close family , i lost many other relatives . ||| kuko uretse abo mu muryango wanjye no mu muryango wo hirya ,
my big brother who was also my neighbour , his wife and my father , some children who were living with them , you know the way the african family is , were also all killed . ||| hari mukuru wanjye turi tuturanye , n' umugore we , n' abana bamwe bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] urabizi familles [ imiryango ] zo muri afrika , na data .
there was my brother @-@ in @-@ law and his wife and their six children who had also died . ||| nabo bari bamaze kupfa . hari ... muramu wanjye musaza w' umugore wanjye n' umugore we n' abana be batandatu , bose bari bamaze kupfa .
my father @-@ in @-@ law and my mother @-@ in @-@ law also died . ||| hari databukwe na mabukwe , bose bari bamaze kupfa .
it felt like you were left completely on your own . ||| uraumva rero wunvaaga ko uruhande rwawe rwose nta kisigaye .
john is the only one i knew who was still alive because he was studying abroad and we used to talk on phone . ||| na john ... john niwe nri nzi ko ariho kuko yarigaga , yarigaga mu mahanga hanze , we nri nzi ko ariho we turavuganaaga .
at that time i did n't know that celine survived , i thought she also died . ||| ariko na celine ntinmenye ko yariho nawe nri nzi ko yapfuye .
so i felt like there was no one left , either on my side , or on my wife 's side . ||| ubwo rero numva ko umuryango wose @: ari umuryango w' umugore wanjye ; ari umuryango wanjye ; nta kisigaye .
we were lucky to later on find out that two of our relatives survived as they took refuge at mille collines hotel . ||| ariko by' amahirwe tuje kugira amahirwe kubona abandi bavandimwe babiri basigaye , batagize icyo baba bashoboye kujya muri mille collines [ hoteli yihishemo abantu ] .
also two of my wife 's sisters survived . ||| hanyuma hari na murumuna ... na barumuna b' umugore wanjye babiri .
so after the war , being able to find out that some people were still alive was very encouraging and motivated us to want to continue to live and give your best . ||| ubwo uraumva rero nyuma wongeye kubona ko hari abandi bantu bakiriho , bikakuhumuriza . bikakutera kaongera kushaka kubaho ,
especially because somebody needed to look after the children who survived so that they could study and live a good life and achieve something . ||| kandi cyane cyane no kureba abo bana usigaraanye , ukaumva ko ugomba kubaho no kugirango babaeho nk' uko imaan yabakuhaye kandi basigaye . usanga rero ari ngombaw kukora icyo ushoboye cyose kugirango n' abo basigaye bazashoborae kubaho no kuiga no kugira icyo bageraho .
how would you like them to be remembered ? ||| wunva wifuza ko bakuibukaw kutae ?
especially on the days that were made for remembrance , on the 7th , the day of commemoration is a day one gets to remember them a lot . ||| eeh , cyane cyane nk' iyi minsi bashyiraho yo kuibuka , itariki ya karindwi ni umunsi umuntu yongera akabaibuka cyane . n' ubwo n' ubundi umuntu abaibuka ,
even though we remember them anyway , that day is a day you share with other rwandans in doing so and it helps us to think together and look for a way for this never to happen again in rwanda . ||| ariko uba umunsi usangiraho n' abandi banyarwanda kuibuka abanyu .
and that it should not happen to anybody else worldwide because it is terrible ! ||| bikatuma mutekereza ikintu kikorwa kugirango ibi bintu bibayeho ... iri tsebwabwoko ribayeho , ritazaongera kubaho . yewe ritazagira n' undi ribaho mu isi . kuko ni ikintu kiteye ubwoba .
i also enjoy looking at their photos . ||| kandi cyane cyane nkunda kureba amafoto yabo ,
my sister who was living in kinshasa , congo drc had many of their photos . ||| kuko nri nfite mushiki wanjye ubaga i kinshasa . hari amafoto menshi yari afite n' amwe nbaeretse niwe wayampaye ,
she is the one who gave me even the photos i showed you since the house and everything in it was burnt up . ||| kuko inzu barayitwitse yose n' ibyarimo byose ntacyo tubonye . ariko yashoboye kutuha amafoto amwe ,
so i sometimes sit down and look at them and i remember ! ||| nkunda rero kuicara rimwe na rimwe nkayareba , kandi bituma nibuka ... nbaibuka . mbese n' ubu nkibaza nti @:
i think about them and wonder how the children would be today , how their mother would be ... it is something i remember very much . ||| "@ ubu baba bameze batae ? aba bana baba bameze batae ? nyina wabo aba ameze atae ? @" ni ibintu rero nibuka cyane .
nobody can stop you from remembering your people who were so much part of your life . ||| kandi nta muntu ushobora kukukuramo kuibuka abantu bawe , bagize ubuzima bwawe .
even though some people do not want us to remember or to talk about it , we can not forget them . ||| n' ubwo hariho abantu baba batashaka ko mubiibuka , mubivuga , ariko twebwe ntitushobora kutabiibuka .
we will always remember and even our children need to be told about it . ||| tuzahora tubiibuka kandi n' abana bacu babimenye , kugirango nabo bazanabiirindae .
perhaps our biggest mistake was that we never believed it could actually happen . ||| kuko ahari akenshi twa ... tuzize kuibwira ko bitashoboka .
but now we know it is possible , we are aware that people can betray others and wipe up entire families . ||| ariko ubu tuzi neza ko abantu bashobora kugambirira kukora ... kumaraho abantu . igikuru cya mbere n' ukumenya ko mugomba kuanga icyo kintu .
it is something we need to fight against in our thinking and this can be done through teaching and also in fighting against it with all our strength . ||| mu bitekerezo mubiigisha abandi , kandi biba ngombaw kubirwanya n' imbaraga ... n' ingufu mukabirwanya .
but i believe that the younger generation and the youth , if they keep on teaching .... educational method is the primary idea . ||| ariko mpamya ko mu bana , mu rubyiruko bagenda baigisha , baigisha inyigisho niyo ya mbere nkuru .
after all , it was through education that everything came up . ||| inyigisho niyo yabiteye ,
therefore , education is what will take it away . ||| inyigisho niyo izabirangiza .
nothing else can ! ||| nta kinri kibirangiza .
finally what is your ... how do you feel about the future ? wilberforce , who are you today and how do you view the future ? are you optimistic ? ||| turangiza nbwira uko wunva ejo hazaza ? wilbeforce wa none ni inde ; kandi ejo hazaza uhaumva utae ? ese wunva uhafitiye ikaizerae ,
are you faithful ? ||| cyangwa se wunva hazaba heza ;
how do you feel ? ||| cyangwa ...
ha ha ... ! ||| aah ... !
[ he laughs ] in the beginning i told you that i am a man of god . i have faith that things will be good . i trust in a better future for our country . ||| [ araseka ] nbanje kukubwira nti jyae nk' umuntu w' imaan nizera ibintu bizaba byiza . nizera ko akazaoza k' igihugu cyacu , kazaba keza .
the future of our country will be good ; but for it to be good , we will need to work towards it . ||| avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' igihugu cyacu izaba nziza . ariko kugirango ibae nziza ni uko tubikora ... ni uko tubikorera .
if we do not work for it , it will n't happen ; but if we do , our future will be good . ||| nitutabikorera ntabwo izaba nziza . ariko nitutabikorera , avenir [ ejo hazaza ] yacu izaba nziza .
it is not only murengezi 's responsibility or the government 's responsibility . ||| ni ikintu rero kitari icya murengezi wenyine , n' ikintu kitari icya abayobozi bonyine ,
all rwandans need to understand that if we want to build a better future and to avoid what we went through in the past , we will have to work on it . ||| ni ikintu abanyarwanda bose bagomba kuiumvaish . ko niba tushaka kuzamera neza mu mu kihae kiri inberae ,
things will never happen miraculously . ||| kuzairinda ibyo byose tunyuzemo , tugomba kubikorera .
that 's all i can tell you . ||| ntabwo bizizana ni icyo nkubwira .
tell me about your mother . ||| ntashaka ko unbwira ibintu byinshi ... nbwira kuri mama wawe .
describe her for me . ||| ... usae n' umunshushanyiriza .
my mother was tall and brown ; she had soft hair . ||| mama wanjye yari ... yari muremure ; ari inyobae , afite imisatsi y' iraendae ,
she liked dressing in skirts and shirts . ||| yakundaaga kuambara amajipo cyane n' amashati .
that 's what i can say about my mother . ||| nibyo ntekereza nvuga kuri mama ikindi nvuga kuri mama ,
she was a very funny person . ||| yakundaaga kusetsa cyane .
but she could also be a tough person ! ||| ikindi nanone akagira ikitsurae .

and , we are talking about beatha . ||| tukaba tuganira na beatha .
beatha , tell me about your mother . ||| ubwo rero beatha nkusaba ngo unbwirae kuri mama wawe .
umh ... my mother was called uwimana devote . ||| umh , mama wanjye , yitwaaga uwimana devota ,
she was very brown and tall . ||| yari inyobae cyane , ari muremure akunda kuambara amajipo kenshi .
she was a very funny person . ||| hanyuma ikindi yakundaaga kusetsa cyane ,
but she could also be a tough person ! she loved everybody . ||| ariko hamwe akagira ikitsurae kinini ... yagirair ... yakundaaga abantu bose .
sorry , please tell me more about your ... tell me about your first memory of your mother ... ||| unbabarirae , ariko unbwiye muri make . nbwira ibintu byose uba wibuka kuri mama wawe .
it was on christmas time . ||| ni igihe kibaga ari nko kuri noheri ,
i used to go to church on christmas and they used to buy us new clothes . ||| kuri noheri njyaaga kusenga , kuri noheri nbaga ... batukuriye imyenda mishya ,
so i would be very smart in church on that day and i would always find nice food at home . ||| hanyuma nkajya kusenga nkeye , nza saa sita tukasanga batetse ibiryo bitasanzwe .
i used to enjoy spending time with her chatting in the kitchen . ||| ubundi nkundaaga kuganira na mama cyane tuicaye mu gikoni .
what was special about those ocassions ... on that ocassion of christmas . ||| ni iki kintu kitasanzwe ubonaaga icyo kihae ?
everybody used to go to church on that day , even the people who had not been to church in a long time . ||| bibaga ari umunsi abantu bose bajya kusenga ,
and it was the day we 'd eat special meals . ||| babaga bataheruka mu rusengero . icyo nibuka nk' umwana ni uko icyo kihae turyaaga ibiryo bitasanzwe ... bitari bisanzwe turyaaga .
and the other thing that made it special was that many families used to gather together on that day and share drinks , different local beers and several others . ||| hanyuma ikidasanzwe ni uko imiryango myinshi yateranaaga abantu bakasangira , bakanywa inzoga , bakanywa ikigage byose .
i forgot to ask you a basic question at the beginning . can you just give me your name and age ? ||| noneho reka nkubaze ikibazo nri nkwaiye kuba ubundi ntangiraiyeho . unbwira izina ryawe n' imyaka ufite ?
my name is uwazaninka beatha , i am twenty @-@ four years old . ||| izina ryanjye nitwa uwazaninka beatha , nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' ine y' amavuko .
can you tell me about ... when you look back in your family life , what were the things that were important to you as a child ? ||| unbwira ikintu ubonaaga kikurutira ibindi igihe umuryango wawe uri ukiriho nk' umwana ?
the most important thing to me ... something that was special for me was being with my family . ||| ikintu kiri icya mbere kuri jyewe ni ... kiri ... icy' ingenzi ni ukuba nri kumwe n' umuryango wanjye ,
i felt very strong , i felt like even the thunder could not harm me , being with my family made me feel very safe . ||| numvaaga nkomeye . numvaaga n' inkuba itamanuka ngo inkubitae , nta kinri .
being with my family gave me "@ moral @"@ . ||| kuba nri mu muryango wanjye byampaga morale ,
it made me feel like there was no problem . i felt very strong . ||| bikabampa kaumva ko nta kibazo numvaaga nkomeye cyane .
tell me about your grandmother . ||| nbwira kuri nyogokuru wawe .
what are your memories of your grandmother ? ||| ni iki wibuka kuri nyogokuru wawe ?
what happened to my grandmother was ... she was killed in 1987 . ||| ibyabaye kuri nyogokuru wanjye ni ... ni uko muri 1987 baje kumwica .
it was on the eve of 1988 so they came and killed her . ||| hari mu ijoro ry' umwaka mushya wa 1988 ... bishyiraaga 1988 . hanyuma baramwica .
she died a painful death . ||| yicwa ... yicwa urupfu rubi cyane .
that is what happened to her . ||| nibyo bimubayeho .
i was seven years old then . ||| icyo kihae nri nfite imyaka irindwi .
can you maybe just tell me in one sentence how your grandmother was killed ? ||| ushobora kunbwira gato kusa nko mu nteruro imwe , ukuntu nyogokuru wawe yishwe ?
umh ... umh ! ||| umh ... umh !
she was hit with a hammer in the head and she immediately died . ||| bamwicishije inyundo mu mutawe , yahise apfa .
then they pulled her out of the house going to throw her body . ||| hanyuma bamukurura bamujyana hanze kumuta ,
but , they dumped her somewhere i used to play during day time . ||| ariko bamuta ahantu h' umukingo , ahantu njyaaga nkunda kukinair ku manywa .
what are your feeling about your grandmother when you remember her ? not what incident , but when you remember her as a person ||| wunva umeze kutae iyo wibutse nyogokuru wawe ?
eeh ... i feel so hurt whenever i remember that they killed her at a time when we were planning to shift and go to live in uganda . ||| eeh ... ! numva ... nrababarara cyane , cyane ko bamwishe mu kihae turi tuendaaga kujya kutura i bugande .
i always feel like if she had n't died , i would n't have seen the genocide and everything else that followed . we would have been outside [ the country ] . ||| numva ko iyo ataza kupfa wenda ntari kubona jenoside turi kuba tuibereye hanze .
her death had many consequences on my life [ in the long run ] . ||| iyo ... iyo muibutsae numva ko kumwica kwe byampaye ingaruka nyinshi mu buzima bwanjye .
can you just tell me ... tell me what ... maybe what ... tell me what happened to your mother ? ||| ushobora kunbwira mama wawe we uko byamugendekeye muri jenoside ?
my mother they ... on the 14th of april 1994 , that is when she was killed together with many others among our neighbours . ||| mama wanjye ba ... ku itariki cumi n' enye z' ukwa kane [ 14 /04 /1994 ] nibwo bamwishe ,
they threw them in the river nyabarongo after they had hacked them into pieces and cut down their thighs . ||| hamwe n' abandi bantu benshi bo muri quartier [ akacae turi tutuyemo ] bagiye kubata muri nyabarongo . ariko babatayemo bamaze kubatemagura amatako ,
that is what i know that happened to her . ||| n' icyo nzi kimubayeho cyo nba nramenye .
were you with her ? ||| mwari muri kumwe se ?
i was not with her . it was during easter holidays . ||| ntabwo nri kumwe nawe kuko nri ndi mu kiruhuko cya ... cya pasika ,
the war started while we were n't together . ||| intambara rero yabaye ntari kumwe nawe .
how do you know what happened to your mother ? ||| none se umenye utae ibyabaye kuri mama wawe ?
on the 15th , as i was walking around the nyamirambo market when i met a man who told me how she died . ||| eeh , ku itariki cumi na ... cumi n' eshanu [ 15 /04 /1994 ] nibwo nzamutse ngiye ... nrimo ngenda mu muhanda w' i nyamirambo mu isoko ;
he was from our home . ||| nibwo nje kuhura n' umuntu uri uvuye muri quartier y' iwacu .
later on , after the war , it was confirmed to me that what he told me was the truth . ||| hanyuma niwe uvuze ... unbwiye ukuntu baishe mama , ariko na nyuma y' intambara nabwo nje kumenya ko biri ukuri , kandi ata ... yavugaaga iby' ukuri .
do you know who killed your mother ? ||| uba uzi umuntu wishe mama wawe ?
from what i was told , they came in a big group of interahamwe but the man who killed her was called rwakatsi . ||| mu kubiumva numva uwamwishe yishwe na groupe [ agatsiko ] nyinshi y' interahamwe , baje ari mu ki groupe [ igitero ] kinini ,
he was our neighbour . ||| ariko umugabo wamwishe ... ushakaaga ko apfa cyane n' umugabo witwa rukasa turi tuturanye .
did you know that man ? ||| uwo mugabo se uri umuzi ?
yes , i knew him ... we were neighbours . ||| yee , nri muzi ... turi tuturanye .
can you say it in one or two sentences ? ||| yari umuntu umeze atae ?
they did so many things . ||| bakoze ibintu byinshi ,
they killed many people , in many ways @: some were immediately killed ; some women were raped before they killed them , and some were crucified on trees . ||| bakoze ... baishe abantu mu ... mu buryo butandukanye . hari abo bicaaga uwo mwanya hari abo bicaaga ... nk' abagore bamaze kubafata ku ngufu , bakababamba ku biti ... uko bitangiye nnjyae nbona ... bitangiye kera .
it started way before , in 1990 and the killing increased in 1994 . ||| bitangiye muri za 1990 biza bizana muri 1994 aribwo bibaye byinshi cyane ,
in 1990 they were already teaching them how to kill , as they were preparing the genocide . ||| ariko nko muri 1990 baishe ... batangiye kuigishwa kuica , kuko ahari bateguraaga jenoside .
if we had known that the interahamwes were going to kill that way , we would have fled before , we never thought it would reach that extent . ||| hanyuma ukuntu interahamwe zaje kuica ntawe ubwacu nta ... ni ibintu ... iyo tubimenya tuba turahunze wenda mbere .
people were murdered in many different ways . ||| ariko tuumvaaga ko bitazaba muri kariya kageni . bibaye ibintu bibi , baishe abantu mu buryo bwinshi butandukanye .
can you just describe for me their attitude when they were doing it ? ||| ushobora kunsobanurair imyitwarire ... uko babaga [ abicanyi ] bitwaye ?
they had various attitudes as they were doing it , some were laughing , they were very proud of themselves as they thought they were working for the country , others had an expression of anger in the eyes . ||| biri bitandukanye ukuntu babaga bameze , hari abazaaga bakuica baseka , baumva ko ibyo bakora aribyo ; baumva ko ibyo bakora ari ukukorera i gihugu .
however , in most of cases , nobody was paying attention to their attitude as by the time they would reach you , it would feel as though you were already dead . ||| hari n' abazaaga bafite uburakari mu maso , uretse ko akenshi na kenshi ntabwo ubaga witayeho kureba ... attitude [ imyitwarire ] yabo . bibaga ari ... bakugeraagaho wunva upfuye .
you would feel like you had no life left inside of you . ||| wunva ugiye , kuko wunvaaga bakugezeho nta buzima uri ufite .
so they were coming in whatever ways they wanted to . ||| bazaaga rero uko bashaka ; bazaaga mu buryo bashabatse .
they had the power . ||| imbaraga zari izabo .
can you descride for me that story you told me before where you saw a woman and her daughter being raped ? ||| ushobora kaongera kunsubirair muri ya nkuru wigeze kunbwira y' umubyeyi n' umwana we w' umukobwa wigeze kubona ...
i did not actually see them but i heard them . ||| mu by' ukuri ntabwo nbabonye ariko nrabaumvise .
they were raping them some where down the place where i was hiding . ||| ahantu nri nihishe hari haruguru y' aho baba ... barimo babakoreraaga ibya nfura mbi hepfo yanjye ,
it was a daughter and her mother . ||| yari umukobwa na nyina bombi .
the daughter was about fourteen or sixteen years old . ||| umukobwa w' imyaka nka cumi n' itandatu [ 16 ] cyangwa cumi n' ine [ 14 ] .
it was a big group of interahamwe in nyamirambo . ||| hari hariya i nyamirambo yari groupe [ igitero ] nyinshi y' interahamwe .
i put some clothes in my mouth to stop myself from screaming so they do not find me . that 's all . ||| ariko icyo kihae ngerageje kuishyira imyenda mu kanwa , ngo nnjyae ntaza kutaka bakanbona .
i did not see them ; it was dark , at around two o'clock in the morning . ||| ni ibyo numva ... ntabwo nbabonye buri mu ijoro , hari nko mu ma saa munani y' ijoro .
could you just describe that scene for me , because ... it is quite a difficult scene ? where were you at that time and how did you know what was happening ? could you just describe that for me ? ||| ushobora kugerageza kusobanura uko ubiumvise ? aho uri uri icyo kihae , n' uko umenye ibyariho bikorwa n' abo bicanyi ?
i was coming from mumena ; it was at night . ||| nri nvuye ku mumena , hari mu ma saha ya nijoro ,
i was going down to nyakabanda . ||| hanyuma manuka nshaka kujya mu nyakabanda .
i kept bumping into dead bodies of people who had just been murdered . ||| ngenda ngwira intumbi zari zimaze kuicwa muri ako kanya . hanyuma ukuntu nbimenye n' ukuntu nbiumvaishije ,
i knew what was happening because from where i was , you could tell what was being said and what was being done to them . ||| ni uko aho nri nihishe n' aho bari bari hepfo , ushoboraaga kaumva ibyo babakoreraaga n' ibyo bavugaaga .
i knew they were going to rape them with nothing else in exchange . i t was not as though they had paid any cows as a dowry for them . ||| kuko bavugaaga ko bagiye ku ... kubasambanya kandi nta ... nta n' ikiguzi babahaye nta n' inka babakoye ;
i can not describe it to you , unless you had been there yourself . ||| mbega wunva ibyo babakoraaga ntinzi ukuntu nbikusobanurair kuko ... kaereka umuntu nyawe ... wenyine ahaibereye .
i felt the pain probably more than they did ; it was as though it was being done to me . ||| ukuntu biri bimeze ... ni ... ahubwo numvaaga uburibwae kubarusha . numvaaga ari jyewe urimo ubabara kurusha uko numvaaga urusaku rwaru ... uko uwo mukobwa yasakuzaaga .
i even saw her picture recently . ||| n' ejo bunri nramubonye mu mafoto bamaze kubona ejo bunri ,
she had a twin sister . ||| yari afite impanga ye .
i saw it and i was reminded of what happened but i did not talk to anyone about it as i felt like no one was going to feel it the way i did . ||| ukuntu ba ... mbega nramubonye mpita nbiibuka ariko nta muntu nbashije kubibwira , kuko numvaaga nta ubiumva nk' uko jyae nbiumvise .
it was ... i felt the pain probably more than them . ||| ni ibintu ... numvaaga uburibwae kusa kumurenza .
can you describe to me what was perharps ... the most difficult experience of being on your own during the genocide trying to survive ? ||| ushobora kunbwira ingorane zikomeye uhuye nazo , cyangwa ikintu ubona cyagukomereye kuruta ibindi muri jenoside ?
i would n't say that everybody was evil but the majority of the people were . if only few were wicked , it would not have reached such an extent . ||| nvuga ngo bose ntabwo bari babi , ariko abenshi bari babi .
i would say that 5 % were good , the other 5 % was neutral and the 90 % remaining was evil . ||| kuko iba ari bake bari babi ntabwo biri kugera kuri uriya mwanya .... kuri kiriya kigero . iba ... nvuga ngo 5 % bari beza . abandi 5 % ntabwo bari bafite icyo bari ... bari hagati bifashe . hanyuma 90 % yari isigaye bose bari babi .
how would you describe the ... if you had one sentence to say what happened in this country , how would you describe it ? ||| nk' umuntu akubajije ibyabaye muri iki gihugu ngo ubimubwirae mu magambo make ubisobanura utae ?
was it evil and hatred ? was it madness ? what happened ? as you were trying to survive , what was going on in your mind about what was happening in this country ? ||| nko mu kihae wendaga kurokoka ubiumvaaga utae ?
i did not think about it then but when i reflect on it today . ||| ntinbitekereje mu ntiambara , ariko ubu nibwo nbitekereje .
i would describe what happened in 1994 as though rwanda had gone down to hell or moved to a different planet . ||| kuko iyo ngerageje kuibuka ibyabaye muri 1994 , igice nbishyiramo nvuga nk' aho u rwanda ruri rwimutse rugiye mu kuzimu . cyangwa rugiye mu yinri planet [ umubumbae ] ntazi .
rwanda was silent . i do n't know how to describe it . ||| ahantu ruri rucecetse nta muntu wa ... mbega ntinzi ukuntu nbikuereka .
imagine people being killed day and night , minute after minute . ||| reba kusa abantu abaicwa umunsi n' ijoro . umunota ku wunri .
no one intervened or did anything ! the whole country was silent and was busy doing something so wrong ! ||| hanyuma nta muntu uvuga , nta muntu ugira iki ... mbega igihugu kiri kicecetse kirimo kikora amabi ,
it was as though we had moved to a different planet . even the entire world was silent as though nobody knew us . ||| wunvaaga ko tuimutse tugiye ahandi hantu kuko n' isi ntiyari ituzi .
it was as if rwanda had been erased from the earth . ||| n' isi yabaye nk' aho ntabwo ituzi . biri bi ... wagirango u rwanda ruraimutse , rujya ahandi hantu aho ntawunri muntu uri uruzi .
the things that happened are difficult to believe if i can say , they go beyond what we can humanly comprehend . ||| kuko ibintu bibaye birenze ukuemera ... ntinzi niba nvuga ngo birenze ukuemera .
it goes beyond what one can imagine . ||| birenze icyo umuntu yatekereza .
tell me about yahaya . ||| nbwira kuri yahaya .
yahaya is ... i would say that he is a good person because few people did what he did . ||| yahaya ni ... nvuga ko ari umuntu mwiza kuko ibyo yakoze ntabwo ari abantu benshi babikoze .
he hid over 30 people . ||| yahishe abantu bagera kuri mirongo itatu [ 30 ] barenze .
he saved me ; i am sure that interahamwe was going to kill me . ||| kandi ikindi nnjyae yarankijije umunsi wo nri ngiye kupfa ... kuko uriya munsi wo nrawuzi nri nzi ko bagiye kunyica .
when i run to yahaya 's house while fleeing , he welcomed me into his house and stand by my side . ||| kuko uriya mugabo yaragiye kunyi ... iriya nterahamwe yari igiye kunyica . ariko yahaya nirukanse mpungiye iwe ,
and i did n't have many people sided with me then . ||| ntabwo yanyirukanye ahubwo yaranretse ... yanrekeye iwe , ahagarara ku ruhande rwanjye . ntabwo ari benshi bahagaze ku ruhande rwanjye rero .
that 's why i think he was a good man , a righteous man . he did it not even so much because he is a hutu . ||| niyo mpamvu nbona ko ari umuga ... ari umuntu mwiza . kandi ari ni umukiranutsi kuko ijambo yankirishije ntabwo ari ijambo ryo kaumva ko yari umuhutu ,
he told that interahamwe that he will answer to god the blood he had shed there the previous day and mine as well . ||| ahubwo yavuze ati ... yanbwiye iriya nterahamwe ngo @: "@ amaraso umena , wameneye hano ejo , n' ayo ushaka kumena uyu munsi imaan izayakubaze ,
so he did n't even do it in the name of being a hutu but he did it for god . i think he was a righteous man . ||| ariko ntabwo wica uyu mukobwa . @" bivuga ngo ntabwo yitwaje ubuhutu , ahubwo yitwaje ko ibyo yakoraaga yakoreraaga imaan . numva rero ari umukiranutsi .
tell me about surviving ; what was it like to get through the genocide and find that you 've finally survived ? ||| nbwira noneho kubijyanye no kurokoka jenoside [ kucika ku icumu ] , kaumva urokotse ubiakiriye utae ?
after the genocide , it still felt like hell . ||| nyuma ya jenoside , bisaga nk' aho nanone usigaye mu muriro .
there were dead bodies all over the place , everywhere you passed , you 'd see corpses . ||| kuko ibintu byose biri hirya yari imirambo , yari intumbi nta muntu muzima uri usigaraanye . ucaaga iruhande rwawe ukabona umuntu ... aho yaguye ,
i remember seeing a baby that was breastfeeding on its mother 's dead body and i did nothing to stop the child , as i myself felt so confused . ||| ukabona undi yari amagufa ... nraibuka njyewe ngenda nbona umwana yonka ... yonka nyina yarapfuye . ariko nmurebye ntinigeze ngira ikintu nkora , kuko numvaaga nnjyae ubwanjye ntakaye . ntinigeze nfata uwo mwana ngo mwigizeyo ,
i did n't know what was going on . ||| ahubwo nramurebye kusa nraigendera . mu mutawe numvaaga ndi ... numvaaga nta kintu kirimo . no mu buengae numvaaga nta kintu kirimo , ntago nkoze ibintu by' abazima .
surviving that time felt like walking through some bush after it has been burnt . ||| kusigara rero nyuma y' icyo kihae wunvaaga ari nk' uko umuntu yatwika ishyamba ryoseee ... hanyuma akakureka ukagenda mu bushyae .
i felt stupid , as though i did n't know anything . ||| kuko biri nko kugenda uri igicucu , cyangwa uri nk' ikintu kitazi n' ikintu na kimwe .
would you finish the last sentence ? ||| rangiza interuro yanyuma kubyo utubwiraaga .
we lived in saint @-@ andre [ secondary school in nyamirambo , kigali ] for about one week . ||| nyuma ya jenoside ngiye ... tubaye icyumweru muri ste andre [ ishuri ryisumbuye riri i nyamirambo ] ,
i went to see my mother on the 5th no on the 6th . ||| ariko ku itariki esheshatu ... cyangwa eshanu ... oya esheshatu . nibwo ngiye kureba mama wanjye .
when i got there was n't a single living . ||| ngezeyo nsanga ibintu byose ... ngirango ikintu kifite ubuzima cyose nta kiri kihari .
even the birds were silent . ||| n' inyoni zari zicecetse ,
there were no mice around . ||| n' imbeba nta zikibaho ,
in a word everything was silent and you could only see insects flying over the corpses . ||| mbega wunvaaga ibintu byose bicecetse . ahubwo icyo ubonaaga n' ukubona ubusimba buva mu rutoki bwirukanka ... biri birenze .
the other thing i recall is meeting a lady who used to be our neighbour ; she was wearing my mother 's clothes . ||| ikindi ni uko nhise mpura n' umudamu turi tuturanye , yari yambaye ijipo ya mama wanjye , n' ishati ya mama wanjye .
i came back here to kigali and when i got here i stayed with a certain family that had just come back from exile . ||| hanyuma nragaruka inaha , ngeze inaha nibwo ngiye kubaan na famille [ umuryango ] imwe y' abantu bari bavuye hanze muri iyo minsi .
staying with people i did n't know , who were even sometimes speaking a foreign language , was also very hard . ||| abantu ntari nzi , kuba mu bantu utari umenyereye , ururimi utazi , rimwe na rimwe baganira ururimi bakuraanye ,
the other thing that was so difficult is that they did n't totally trust me . ||| biri bingoye cyane kugirango nbanae nabo . kandi ikindi nanone kubaan nabo , babaga batakuizeye bihagije .
as a survivor i could have been with the interahamwe because to them all the tutsis had died . ||| bavugaaga ko uwapfuye ariwe ... umututsi ni uwapfuye .
that was also very hard ; it was even harder than being a survivor because those you stayed with did not believe that you were a survivor . ||| uwasigaye ubwo yari kumwe n' interahamwe . ibyo nabyo bibayeho nk' ibintu bibabaza cyane kurusha noneho no kaumva ko usigaye . kuko abo usigaraanye nabo ntabwo baumvaaga ko usigaye .
what was the feeling inside ? ||| muri wowe inberae wiyumvaga utae ?
i do n't know what i can compare it to . i can not really express how i felt . there 's nothing i can compare it to . ||| nvuga ngo ... uko niumvaaga mo inberae ntabwo ... ntabwo biri ... nraumva ntakuha ikigeraranyo cy' uko numvaaga .
you reach a point where you feel like you 're nothing , you 're just there and days pass but you 're indifferent to everything . ||| ahubwo ugeraho kusa ukaumva ubaye ... nta kintu uri cyo . ugeraho ukabaho gutyo uko ubayeho kusa .
you 're living a life you 're not used to . ||| ukabona umunsi urira , ukabona undi uraje , ukabaho mu buzima buraho utamenyereye ... ikindi wunva ko ntacyo ubwiye undi ,
in short you feel so useless . ||| nta kintu umaze muri make .
i remember one day even saying that i should have died , as the dead at least were silent , they were fine . ||| kuko nraibuka ko umunsi umwe nigeze kuvuga ngo @: iyo nba nrapfuye kuko abapfuye ubungubu baracecetse . bameze neza .
my thinking was that living a non @-@ sense life was worse than being dead . ||| numvaaga ko hapfuye abantu benshi ! nkaumva ... nkavuga rero kubaho mu buzima butafite ikintu butafite igisobanuro , birutaw n' uko nba nrapfuye .
my perspective of life was different . ||| njyae rero ntabwo nigeze ... ngira ibindi byiyumviro .
my opinion then was that living was worse than dying . ||| nri nfite ibyiyumviro byo kaumva ko kubaho birutaw no kupfa .
can you forgive people who carried this out ? ||| wunva ushobora kubabarira abantu bakoze biriya bintu ?
umh ! ||| umh !
[ she smiles ] that 's a tough question . i can not forgive . forgiveness is from god . ||| [ araseka ] icyo ni ikibazo kikomeye kuko ... ntabwo ... kubabarira ni iby' imaan kusa . ntabwo njyewe nbabarira nk' umuntu .
i am only human ; i am not some sort of air . ||| ndi umuntu ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ndi ... ntabwo ndi umwuka .
all the pain i encounter in life does not leave room for forgiveness . ||| ububabare bwose nshobora kuhura nabwo mu buzima bwanjye , ntabwo bumpa umwanya wo kubabarira .
the life we live in today ... you see the good and that reminds you of what happened . ||| ubuzima umuntu abamo muri iyi minsi ubona ibiiza bikakuibutsa ibyabaye ,
you see the bad and it also reminds you of what happened . even when you get a big house or a lot of money , you have no one to give it to or to share it with . ||| ubona ibibi bikakuibutsa ibyabaye , mbega n' iyo ubonye inzu nini cyangwa ubonye amafaranga menshi , wunva ntawe uribuyahe . wunva ntawe uri busangirae nawe ,
you get a big house but it is empty because no family will come and visit you . ||| ubona inzu nini ukabona ibaye ... nta kintu kirimo kuko nta muryango uri buze kukusuramo ... usanga rero no kuvuga ngo @:
so when you think of forgiveness ... maybe you can forgive because there 's nothing else you can do . ||| ‘ kubabarira ... ’ wenda ubabarira kuko nta kinri ukora .
and if you do not forgive ... the killers were about 90 % ... it would kill you . you would get a heart attack and die . ||| kandi utababariye se ? kuko abantu baishe mu ntiambara ni 90 % . ubwo rero upfa . urinda wicwa n' umutima ... urwara umutima .
you just look at it and leave it . ||| ugerageza kurenzaho kusa .
have you ever met any of the perpetrators who you recognised and know ... or having met anybody who was directly involved in killing members of your family ? if you have n't how would you handle it if it happened ? ||| uba uzi abantu baishe umuryango wawe ? cyangwa se nibura ujya uhura n' abantu bagize uruhare mu kuica umuryango wawe ?
i do not know the people who killed my family because i was not there . ||| abaishe umuryango wanjye bo kubera ntari mpari ntabwo nbazi .
i probably meet them without knowing they are the ones . ||| bivuga ko mpura nabo ntanabazi .
but the man who was in the group pf the people who killed my mother is there . when you meet them you just buy them a drink or something . ||| ariko umugabo wishe ... mu bantu baishe mama wanjye , bari aho kusa bose . iyo ubaciyemo nta kinri ... ubagurair inzoga , cyangwa ukabashakira ikindi kintu .
there was a time i met a killer at the taxi park in town and instead of him being the one to have a problem , it is me who had one . ||| hanyuma umuntu nhuye nawe wishe abantu nhuye nawe kuri gare hano hirya mu mugi . aho kugirango agirae ikibazo , nijyae uhise ngira ikibazo .
i felt so shocked , my heart stopped beating . i sat down , as i felt dizzy . ||| umutima uransimbutse nhise ngira ubwoba kusa ... nicara hasi kuko nri ntangiye kaumva isereri .
i can not tell you that i thought of forgiving them or even of taking revenge . ||| ntabwo rero ... uhura ... ubwo rero ntabwo nkubwira ngo ngiye kutekereza kubabarira , cyangwa ubugome ,
i was terrified . ||| ahubwo ngize ubwoba .
i had goose pimples . i can not tell you that i forgave them or anything else , when you meet them you almost loose your mind , you can not think straight ! ||| numvise umubiri uzanye ubushayi nta kinri . ntabwo nkubwira ngo numvise nbabariye cyangwa ... kuko iyo uhuye nabo uta ubwenge . nta kinri utekereza .
has justice been done ? ||| ubona ubutabera bukora akazi kabwo neza ? cyangwa ubona hariho kurenganuraw nabwo ?
it is tough question because i feel like instead of it being called justice when it is not justice anyway , it would be better that they just let them go free . ||| icyo kibazo kiragoye kuko ... numva ... aho kugirango biitwae ubutabera , bitari ubutabera , ni byiza ko babareka noneho bakigira hanze kusa .
that 's all i can wish them . because i would not wish them to be thrown into the river the way they threw my mother into the river . ||| kuko ntinkuifuza ko babaroha mu ruzi nk' uko baroshye mama mu ruzi .
my mother was drowned into the river together with my uncle , my grandfather and many other members of my family . ||| mama bamuroshye mu ruzi , baroha data wacu , baroha sogokuru , baroha abantu benshi bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] yanjye .
therefore throwing just one person in there is useless . ||| uroshye umuntu umwe rero , ntacyo bimaze .
the other thing is that the government takes care of the prisoners ; it has to feed them and provide healthcare for them and they are many . ||| kandi ikindi , leta iragaburira izi nfungwa . iraita ku nrwara zabo kandi ni benshi .
it would therefore be better to let them free and maybe to sensitise them every month or so to help them become human again as they had probably lost their humanity . ||| ibiiza rero ni uko babareka bakaza bakajya hanze , kusa bakajya babaha inyigisho wenda mu kwezi , cyangwa mu mezi angahe ... zibakarura mu bumuntu kuko ibyo bakoze nabo bari batakaye .
how can you kill the neighbour you used to exchange cows with and share a drink with ? ||| kuko uuturanyi mwahanaga inka , mwasangira inzoga ,
it 's not normal . ||| mwasangira iki ... nabyo si ubuzima .
it shows that rwanda was lost as i was telling you , because no one heard its voice then . ||| ni ibintu wunva ko nk' uko nkubwiye u rwanda ruri rwatakaye . ruri rwatakaye ahantu , kuko nta n' undi muntu warwumvaga .
we were somewhere where no one could see us . ||| ruri ruri ahantu nta n' undi muntu yarebaaga .
what i can say about justice ... unless .... even that would not be enough , even if they killed them ... but it does not sound fair to me when it is called justice . ||| nraumva rero ikintu nvuga ubucamanza , ubutabera kaereka ... nabyo ntibyampaza kubona wishe uwo muntu . nta n' icyo bimarair . ariko nanone nabyo ntibinshimaish ,
knowing that somebody killed other people the other day and they say he 's an adult ! ||| kaumva biiswe ubutabera , atari ubutabera . kaumva ko umuntu yishe ejo bunri yakoze iki ngo arakuze . mbega ntiiishe abakuze nkawe ?
were the people they killed not adults ? ||| ko se bo bicaaga abakuze ?
or saying that they were children ! ||| kaumva ngo umuntu yari umwana .
do children kill ? they do not ! ||| mbega umwana arica ? umwana ntiiica .
why were they not children while killing ? ||| kuki batabaye abana mbere y' uko bica ?
let them free them , which is what will make more sense to me . let them come and live with us . ||| aho rero bivuga ngo ... babavanaemo ahubwo bigirae inzira . baze tuturanae .
can genocide happen in rwanda again ? ||| ubona jenoside ishobora kaongera kuba mu rwanda ?
i do n't think so , it can not happen again . ||| ntabwo nbiemera ... ntabwo izabaho . kuko nkanjyae nta mutaima wo kuica nfite . niba abo bantu bazaza bafunguwe bakaigishwa , hakabaho kuibuka ibyabaye ,
because personally i do n't have a desire to kill in my heart . ||| hakabaho aho abantu bazajya bajya bakavuga bati @: "@ ibi bintu birabaye . @" n' umwana akajyayo akavuga ati @:
if the people who are being released today are going to be sensitised and if remembering what happened will be part of our lives , if there will always be a place where anyone even children themselves can go and acknowledge that it actually happened , and that it was wrong then i do n't believe the genocide will happen again ! ||| "@ ibi bintu birabaye . bibaye ni bibi . @" ntabwo numva ko jenoside izabaho . ntabwo izaongera kubaho .
what do you think about the future ? ... can you describe for me about the consequences of being a survivor ? ||| ugerageza kunbwira ingaruka ubona zo kurokoka jenoside ?
the consequences of being a survivor are very many . ||| ingaruka zo ... zo kurokoka ni nyinshi cyane .
when i look at us the survivor of the genocide , some of us survived without really surviving . ||| kuko iyo nrebye nk' abarokotse ... nkatawe turokotse intambara ... jenoside hari abarokotse batarokotse .
some women who were raped are living with hiv @/@ aids , some survived but they have no one to talk to , that is another type of death , those are some of the genocide consequences . ||| hari abarokotse bafite sida , abagore bafashwae ku ngufu ; hari abarokotse kurokoka utakigira umuntu muvugana ; narwo n' urundi rupfu .
the other thing is that you can never live a full life again , you live half of a life , and you live a life full of questions , of uncertainties , of maybes . ||| izo ni ingaruka . ikindi ntabwo ubaho mu buzima bwuzuye . uba mu buzima bw' igice . uba mu buzima bw' ibitangaza ;
maybe it is going to happen again , you 're never at peace within your heart . ||| uba mu buzima butekereza ‘ surprise ’ [ ikintu kitunguraanye ] ... butekereza ko ... wenda ... wenda ... cyangwa se ... uhora muri wenda ... se ... uhora wunva wenda ... bishobora ukaongeraho , uhora wunva utafite umutima uri hamwe .
that 's what they call trauma . ||| kurokoka rero niko ... ibyo nibyo baita ihahamuka ahubwo .
you constantly are traumatized . ||| uhora wunva uhahamutse buri kihae ,
your life is incomplete . ||| ntabwo ugira ubuzima bwuzuye .
for example sometimes i can be walking in town and i look at crowds of people and i see their bodies lying down , as though they were dead . ||| uragenda ... ... nk' urugero njyewe , hari igihe ... iyo nreba abantu benshi ... iyo ndi nko mu mugi , nkareba abantu ikivunge cy' abantu . hari igihe nbabona baryamye ari intumbi .
i look at somebody and i imagine him or her dead . ||| nkashaka kureba umuntu , nkashaka kumureba apfuye ;
even me myself i sometimes imagine myself dead . ||| nnjyae ubwanjye hari igihe njya nitekereza mfuye .
not so much because i think of death , i am still young , but because of the many people i saw being killed . ||| ibyo ntabwo ari ukubera ko ntekereza urupfu , nracyari mutoya . ahubwo ni ukubera intumbi nbonye , n' abantu nbonye baicwa .
those are the consequences of surviving . ||| ibyo rero nizo ngaruka zo kurokoka .
you do not look at people and see life in them , you see them dead instead . ||| ntabwo ureba umuntu ngo umubonaemo ubuzima , ureba umuntu ukamubonamo apfuye .
how do you want genocide to be remembered ? what is the right way to remember genocide ? ||| ubona jenoside yari ikwaiye kuibukaw itae ?
the way genocide should remember ? ||| ukuntu bari bakwaiye kuibuka jenoside ,
i think we should not only remember the genocide every year but also in helping out the survivors . ||| bari bakwaiye kuibuka jenoside buri mwaka . ariko na none turi tukwaiye kuibuka tufasha abacitse ku icumu .
because remembering what happened only once year does n't really benefit the survivors much . ||| turi tukwaiye kuibuka ... kuko kujya kuibuka ibyabaye ku bacitse ku icumu , nta nicyo bibamaraiye turi tukwaiye kuibuka jenoside buri mwaka ,
we should remember it every year , everyday because they do remember it every day , not just once a year . ||| buri munsi , kuko abacitse ku icumu bo bayibuka buri munsi ntabwo ibaho buri mwaka kuri bo .
on an international scale , we should remember the genocide in helping out those who lived through the genocide , the survivors . ||| ariko mu rwego rw' isi yose turi tukwaiye kuibuka jenoside tufasha ababaye muri iyo jenoside abacitse ku icumu . tubaibuka , tuigisha abana batoya , nruzi ko twebwe turaangiritse ,
we could remember them in teaching the children about it because as far as we 're concerned , we 've already been destroyed . ||| turapfuye . kaereka nyine abo bana batoya , bakahora bayibuka , n' urubyaro rwacu rukazibuka jenoside .
we need to teach the next generation about the genocide , the descendants of the hutu , the descendants of the tutsi , the descendants of the twa , all need to remember that the genocide actually happened . ||| urw' umuhutu , urw' umututsi , urw' umutaw rukaumva ko jenoside yabayeho .
it needs to reach a point where those who need to understand where their fathers are faulty understand it , as well as those who need to understand the way their parents were victimized . ||| abaumva amakosa ya ba se bakayumva , abaumva akarengaane ka ba sekuruza bakakaumva ;
in conclusion we need to make sure that even the child who will be born tomorrow will know that what happened in our country was wrong . ||| mbega tukabaho mu kihae cyo buri mwana n' uzavuka mu myaka ingahe azajya avuga ati @: "@ iki kintu kibaye mu gihugu kiri kibi . @"
do we learn anything from the genocide ? ||| ubona hari isomo jenoside yatusigaiye , cyangwa ubona hari icyo jenoside ituigisha ?
i feel like beatha today is ... i am not afraid ; i am not worried . ||| njyewe numva beatha w' uyu munsi na ... ntabwo nfite ubwoba ,
because where i am at today , i do not wish for genocide to happen again . so i am not worried because i am one of the people who say that the genocide should never happen again . ||| ntabwo nfite impagarara ... kuko aho bigeze ntabwo nshaka ko jenoside izasubiraho . rero ntingira ubwoba kuko ndi mu bantu bashaka ... bavuga ngo @: "@ ntabwo jenoside izaongera kubaho .
the other thing is i have faith in a better future . ||| ikindi numva kusa ... ... nfite kuizera kw' akazaza . kubera ko umwana wanjye wanjye uzavuka , n' umwuzukuru wanjye ,
i believe my children and my grandchildren after them will have a good life apart form me who has already been destroyed . ||| numva ko bazaba mu isi nziza . uretse njyewe umaze kuangirika .
my children will still suffer the consequences of the genocide but their children in the following generation will n't . ||| ariko numva ko abandi bo bazaba bazima . uretse ko umwana wanjye azagira ingaruka za jenoside . ariko umwana we ntabwo azazigira .
the third generation will not live out the consequences of the genocide . ||| ikinyejana [ urubyaro ] cya gatatu ... ntabwo kizabona jenoside nk' icya kabiri .
the second one will for sure but the third one will not . ||| icya kizayigira , ariko icya gatatu ntabwo kizayigira cyane .
so i look at the future with hope . ||| rero nfite kuizera kw' akazaza .
my name is uwimpuhwe alice . i am 20 years old and i am from tambwe commune , in tambwe sector , in nyamagana cell . ||| banyita uwimpuhwe alice nfite imyaka 20 nvuka muri komini tambawe akarere ka tambawe umurenge wa nyamagana selile ya nyamagana
that is where i was when the war broke up . ||| intambara yabaye ariho ndi .
both my parents were there too . ||| n' ababyeyi banjye ariho baba .
in fact at the time , when the war started , i think i was a little bit grown up , i used to see people coming to dad , talking to him , threatening him , saying that they would kill him . ||| ariko mu by' ukuri intambara ijya kutera njyewe nraumva nri maze kumenyaho akengae ho gatoya njyaaga , nbona papa abantu bakaza bakamubwira ,
they were mainly our neighbours . ||| ariko mbese bakamubwira ngo sha wowe tuzakuica ariko cyane cyane ari nk' umuturanyi .
it seemed as though they were in some sort of conflict . they were not friends . ||| ariko mbese ko bari bafitanye akantu mbese k' inzika ntinzi ntanubwo banakundanaaga .
as time passed , i saw the war really spreading , we run away . ||| ariko igihe kiza kugera , nza kubona intambara koko irateye ngiye kubona nbona turahunze ,
i was still with both my parents then . ||| icyo kihae nri ndi kumwe n' ababyeyi banjye bose .
my dad was killed two days later . ||| ubwo papa intambara ikitera ku munsi wa kabiri nibwo yapfuye .
they came home , a man called kayishema took him away , and he never came back . ||| baza mu rugo , haza umugabo baitaaga kayishema aramufata aramujyana , mu by' ukuri agiye ntabwo yigeze agaruka .
we do not know what followed until today . ||| ntabwo tuigeze tumenya amarengero ye na n' uyu munsi ntabwo nzi ahantu yaguye .
we were rescued with my mother and brothers and sisters , some suggested that we look for a way to go to burundi but when we reached the boarder , we were told that it was too late . ||| tusigaraan na mama n' abandi bana tuvukanaaga , turahunga mama avuga ngo ashakishae uburyo mbese tujya i burunri ,
no more crossing the boarder . ||| tugeze kuri douane biranga mbese ngo turatinze ntakuambuka ,
therefore , we failed and came back . ||| turaongera turagaruka .
on our way back , they wanted to kill me before anyone else . ||| tumaze kugaruka , njyewe nsigaye ahantu mbese umugabo bari bagiye kunyica mbere y' abandi bana bose ,
fortunately , there was a certain man who implored them to let me go with him because i had the same name as his daughter . ||| noneho umugabo umwe aravuga ngo @: "@ noneho ngo uwo mwana ngo kuko yitwa alice , kandi yitiraanw n' umwana wanjye ,
he wanted me to go and help his children as a housemaid . ||| nzae ajyae mu rugo , mujyanae mu rugo mbese azajyae afasha abandi bana akazi . @" mbese ubwo wenda ni nko kuba umukozi mu rugo urebye .
that man was called kayigamba , i still remember him . ||| ariko ubwo uwo mugabo bamwitaga kayigamba n' ubungubu ndacyamwibuka ,
he was going to shoot me with an arrow . ||| ubwo mbese yari agiye afite umuheto ashaka mbese kunrasa mbese andashisha umuheto .
my mum begged him suggesting any possible arrangement rather than killing me in front of her . ||| ubwo mbese mama aravuga ati @: "@ nbabarira turebae ukuntu tubigenza , " yari afite wenda n' udufaranga duke aravuga ati @:
the man felt sorry for me and he later on took me to his home . ||| "@ aho kugira ngo unyicirae umwana mu maso @" umugabo agira impuhwe noneho gutyo aragira ajyana iwe ,
my mum continued her way towards ruhango as she knew there was no other way . ||| nragenda nba iwe ba mama barakomeza bagaruka mu ruhango mbese kuko yabonaaga ko nta bunri buryo mbese .
she was not among those who came back . maybe she died by the roadside . ||| ubwo mu bagarutse nabo mu by' ukuri niba yaraguye mu nzira ntinigeze n' umva agashweshwe ke n' akabana tuvukanaaga ,
neither her nor my brothers and sisters survived ; my two cousins and i are the only survivors in my family . i am the oldest one . ||| ubwo nrangije njyewe mbese mu bana tuvukanaaga nsigara njyenyine ariko nsigaraan n' abana tuvukana kwa data wacu 2 . mu by' ukuri mu muryango urebye ni njyewe mukuru usigaye .
we met the dad , but he was living together with another woman [ stepmother to the girl ] and she had sons who were brothers to the girl . ||| anshyira se amaze kunshyira se , yabanaaga na mukase afite na basaza be ,
her brothers wanted to kill me , but their father stopped them because he loved his daughter so much . she was his first @-@ born . ||| basaza be mbese bashaka kunyica nawe ubwo ngubwo umusaza aravuga kuko yakundaaga uwo mukobwa we yari imfura ye aravuga ati @:
he said "@ you can not kill this girl in my presence . ||| "@ uno mwana ntabwo mushobora kumunyicira mu maso .
if you want to kill her , call my daughter because she is the one who brought this girl here and kill her in my daughter 's presence . @" ||| mugendae muhamagarae umukobwa wanjye mumwice ariko nawe abizi niwe umuzanye ahangaha . @"
the old man was called benjamin . ||| nrangije uwo musaza bamwitaga ... benjamini bamwitaga benjamini uwo musaza .
i lived there for a while with another kid who was brought there by his father to benjamin . ||| ubwo nrangije ntahabaye ... igihe kirageze hakaba hari n' akana kari kahari nako ise yari yaramubwiye ati @: "@ rero benjamini , turi inshuti , uri umuvandimwe ,
her dad told benjamin that as he was his best friend , he should take care of the child -@ she was his last @-@ born . ||| uzanfataire kano kana kanjye . nipfa mbese ni bucura bwe .
look after her , take my cattle and everything , but keep my child safe . ||| ariko uzakafatae uzakamenyerae dore nkusigaiye inka nkusigaiye byose , ariko uzamenyerae ako kana . @"
then benjamin came and told us @: that child and i , she was called gakecuru . ||| ubwo arangije umusaza araza aratubwira ati rero alisa n' ako kana bakitaaga gakecuru ngiye kubajyana babicae . nramubwira nti muby' ukuri ntabwo uri bunjyanae ngo banyicae . ubwo arangije hakaba hari n' undi mugorae ubungubu asigaye aba i butare .
he said , "@ i am taking you to be killed . @" ||| ubwo aravuga ati @: "@ noneho wowe niba unzae ko nkujyana ,
then i frankly told him that he could n't take me . then he told me that if i did n't believe him , he would take the young girl first , to show me that he was serious . ||| reka nbanzae njyewe jyanae uno mwana kugirango nkuerekae ko ntakubeshya .
he took the young girl and she was killed . ||| ka kana arakajyana aragenda barakica aragaruka .
when he arrived at home , he told me that i was the one next . ||| amaze kugaruka ati @:
i told him to kill me himself instead of delivering me to the perpetrators ; he used to say that he would let the perpetrators kill us so that he would not be responsible . ||| "@ ubwo nyine niwowe utahaiyew @" nti mu by' ukuri njyewe aho kugirango ujyanae unyicae , genda ujyae kunyicisha mbese we yavugaaga ko ari bukujyanae mu gitero akaba aribo bakuica ariko atariwe ukuica .
i convinced him to take me back to the grandmother 's house where i was before maybe i will spend one night . ||| ubwo arangije nramubwira nti ahubwo munbabarirae munyambutse uno mugezi nindangiza nsubirae kwa wa mukecuru hahanri nri ndi , nrebae wenda ku hari ubwo wenda ricya kabiri .
that is what i told him . ||| niko nmubwiye .
[ benjamin ] the old man gave me his son camakoma to escort me across the river and we went back to where i had been before ; i could n't even remember the place well , i searched for it and i found it . ||| umusaza ampa umwana we witwaga camakoma aramperekeje aranyambukaije umugezi ntakomeje nsubiye hahanri ntinnahaibukaaga neza ntahashakaije ,
when we arrived there , the grandmother told me that i could n't spend the night in her house . ||| ntahabona . ngezayo umukecuru aranbwira ati @: "@ iyi sura ntabwo iri bunraraire ahangaha . @"
at sunset , she threw me out . ||| ubwo abona burije amaze kubona ko bawije aravuga ngo @:
she asked me to go and look for another shelter . then i realised that it was not safe to stay in a region i did not know and that i could not hide anywhere because i did n't know where to hide . ||| "@ jya kushaka aho wihisha . @" nrangije njyewe nbonye ko kuihisha ntakintu bimaraiye nta hantu nzi , ntaki ,
in fact she took me to a certain place but i did not trust her ; i thought she would send me perpetrators to kill me . ||| aragenda ashyira ahantu , nravuga nti aha hantu ashyize , wenda ari buze kunyoherereza igitero kihansangae , baze banyicae .
i decided to go and commit suicide . i threw myself into a river , yes i did . ||| nragenda mpita nfata decision ( icyemezo ) y' uko jyewe ngomba kujyenda nkiyahura . nragenda nraiahura jya mu mugezi mbese nijugunyamo pe .
but the river refused to take me . you know , it was full then as a result of the rainy season . ||| nrangije umugezi uranyanga uzi ko hari hanuzuye icyo kihae hari mu itumba .
the river threw me at the bunk . ||| umugezi uragenda unta hakurya .
it was coming to morning as the day starts dawning when the river rejected me ; i could hear birds singing . ||| umaze kunta hakurya nbonye bukeye wenda nko mu bunyoni mbese kikihae mu bucyacya niba ari mu bucyacya .
i went back and knocked . ||| nraongera nsubirayo nragenda ntakomanga ,
she told me that they came looking for me and they never found me where she had left me . ||| nramubwira aranbwira ngo tuje kukushaka hahanri turakubura .
"@ i was around . @" i said . ||| nti ubwo mbese nri ndi hepfo gatoya .
but then i spend the night with her daughter . the following day we went to gather groundnuts from the grandmother 's field . ||| wa mukobwa noneho turaraye tugiye kusarura ubunyobwa ahongaho kwa mukecuru wiwe ,
at night she suggested to her grandmother to let me sleep inside their house instead of going back to the bushes . ||| ubwo ngubwo burakeye nijoro noneho aravuga ngo noneho aho kugirango age kungera ararae mu gisambu nrarae hano noneho jyewe nribuze kumushyira nde ?
she then promised to take me to the chief of the attackers , emmanuel , the following day so that the chief decides what to do with me . ||| umukuru w' igitero bamwitaga emmanuel . ati njyewe nramushyira emmanuel , manueli noneho niwe uribuze kunbwira uko biri bugendae .
we went to emmanuel 's place and she said , "@ this girl is from ruhango , i caught her while she was passing by . @" ||| turagenda tujya kwa manueli aravuga uno mwana nuwo mu ruhango , nmufashe gutya agenda ,
the man asked me , "@ are n't you a tutsi ? @" ||| umugabo araambaza ngo ntabwo uri umututsi ?
"@ my god , i am not a tutsi ! @" i denied . ||| erega ubwo n' igiti kigeretse ! ntabwo njyewe ndi umututsi .
"@ are n't you a tutsi ? @" ||| ntabwo uri umututsi ?
he asked me again . i said , "@ no , i even do n't agree with what the old woman said about me . ||| nti kandi n' uko mukecuru abivuze jyewe nraumva atari byo ahubwo jyewe iwacu niriya muri butare nshaka igi komini mbese nramubwira nti jyewe nbaga kwa nyogokuru wanjye ,
the truth is i was living with my grand mother in butare ; however , my mum had re @-@ married in ruhango . ||| ariko mama yaragize kutae , yarashatse mu ruhango .
but i am not a tutsi . @" ||| ariko jyae nrababwira nti jyae muby' ukuri nramubwira nti njyewe ntabwo ndi umututsi .
he said ; " it is obvious from your looks . @" ||| ati biragaragara reba n' ukuntu umeze urebae n' iki .
then i said i am not a tutsi at all . ||| nrangije nrababwira nti jyewe ntabwo ndi umututsi rwose .
but that man did not believe me and he decided to put me on hold before killing me . ||| nrarahira umugabo arangije bukeye ahongaho ati wowe turakuica ,
they did not kill me that night . in the morning i went back to the so @-@ called grandmother . ||| ntegereza urupfu nyine ko bari bunyicae ntibanyica barangije bukeye mu gitondo ,
she refused to receive me pretending that she did n't want me to be killed in her presence . ||| noneho nsubira kwa wa mukecuru noneho mukecuru aravuga ngo uno mwana ntanraraire ahahanga batazamutsinda mu maso .
then the girl told me we should look for other alternatives . ||| wa mukobwa noneho nawe aravuga ati reka tushakishae ukuntu bigenda bite ? bigenda .
then i asked her where she thought i could go when her dad had chased me , where she expected me to go . ||| noneho nramubwira se wowe uranshyira hehe ko ubona papa wawe yanyirukanye avuga ko bagiye kunyica nragenda jya hehe ?
the man called kayigamba whose daughter was my namesake said ... by then , the attackers were having several meetings . ||| noneho wa mugabo unyambuye iwacu baitaaga kayigamba uwunri mbese uvugaaga ngo nitiraanw n' umwana we . arangije nravuga reka noneho icyo kihae za mitingi zari zatangiye i bugesair nraumva abanyabugesera bari batangiye kuhunga .
in fact , in bugesera people had started fleeing . ||| nragenda ahongaho bahitaaga imigina ,
i went to a place called migina . ||| ahongaho mbese nri ndi , nragenda jyayo jya muri mitingi yaho ,
there came a man called shiriduwi , i am not sure if it is shiriduwi . he came , pulled me from the roadside where i was sitting with the girl and then asked me what my tribe is . ||| ngezeyo urugabo rwitwaga shiriduwi niba ari shiriduwi , ruraza runkura mu muhanda aho nri nicaye nicaraanye n' uwo mukobwa . araambaza ngo wowe uri bwoko uki ? ndamubwi ,
i kept quiet . ||| ndamwihorera nbura ikintu nvuga .
i had nothing to say ... there was another man called biya , who was a young brother to the doctor in that area . ||| ubwo arangije hakaba hari umugabo baitaaga biya murumuna w' uwo nguwo uri umuganga ahongaho ,
they both knew me very well . ||| yari anzi hamwe n' uwo mugabo baitaaga kayigamba bari bari mu nama .
at that time , they were in a meeting and when they came out , they defended me . they said i am from their family . ||| araza arampamagara aravuga ngo uno mwana yahoze mu rugo iwanjye ngo n' umwana wanjye .
that 's the way i survived the attackers . ||| ubwo arangije nragira ,
he [ bayi ] told me to go home . ||| ubwo mbese nkira gutyo aravuga ati ugendae ugarukae mu rugo . ugarukae mu rugo muby' ukuri jyewe nrabona ntabona ahantu nnyura .
then i told him that i have no where to pass in order to reach home , he then asked his father to take me home because his father had a motorbike . he left for his home and i went to my home too . ||| ubwo arangije ansigair muzehe wiwe kuko we yari afite moto arataha nnjyae nragenda jya mu rugo .
he walked away and i also walked away with the old man . we walked for about one kilometre [ 1 km ] and then the other guys [ attackers ] followed me because they wanted to kill me . ||| turagenda , aragenda ajya murugo ngendana na muzehe . tumaze kugendana na muzehe tugenze nka nka km ahari , barangije baraza ba bagabo bankurikiye bashaka ku nyica .
some of them said that they would be in trouble if they touched kayigamba 's child meaning me ; because kayigamba was a strong and respected man at the time . ||| barangije noneho baragira ... baravuga ngo murica umwana wa kayigamba mufite ibibazo . kuko icyo kihae yari akomeye yari afite n' ingufu .
they asked the old man ; "@ are you taking her to kayigamba 's home or to your home ? @" ||| ubwo arangije aravuga ati @: "@ ubwo se umujyanye kwa kayigamba ? @" cyangwa umujyanye iwawe ?
then he replied that "@ this is kayigamba 's child , i am taking her to kayigamba because he asked me to take her to him . ||| aravuga ati @: "@ njyewe uyu n' umwana wa kayigamba mushyiriye kayigamba yamunsigaiye . @"
i went to kayigamba 's home and spent another week there . ||| ubwo nragenda jya kwa kayigamba nongera marayo ikindi cyumweru ,
there came another man called emmanuel . he was seeking for a place where to hide and then he found a place around kayigamba 's house in a sorghum field . ||| haza undi muhungu baitaaga manueli gutya araza kuhaihisha arangije ajya hepfo gutya mu masaka ,
there was a big tree around , which looked like a guava tree . ||| hari igiti nkakiriya ahari kintuza cy' amapera kinini ,
he climbed the tree but unfortunately , kayigamba saw him and asked him to come down the tree . later he killed him from the same sorghum field . ||| noneho aragenda ajyamo uwo mugabo kayigamba aragenda amukuramo amaze kumukuramo aragenda amutsinda muri arya masaka .
we fled together . ||| ubwo nrangije turahunga umugabo mbese yabonaaga ko ntari umwana we ,
but because i was not the real daughter to that man [ kayigamba ] , he would make me carry a very hot pot on my head . ||| akazajya afata isafuriya njyewe nikoreraaga isafuriya ishyushye tukagenda niyo babaga bakuye ku mashyiga .
every time , after cooking , they would ask me to carry the pot so that we continue our journey . ||| jyewe nrayikoreraaga tukagenda .
we would walk and after some distance , they 'd ask me to go fetch water . ||| tugera ahantu bakanbwira ngo ningende jyae kuvoma ,
i remember i walked up to rusatira , those ends of butare . ||| nrabiibuka njyewe ngarukaiye i rusatira . hariya mu bicae bya butare .
i realised that i was n't going to cope with the situation for long because i joined their family when they used to eat maize paste everyday . ||| kuko njyewe nbonye y' uko njyewe tutaza , mbese ko njyewe ntazabishobora , ubwo nrabiibuka kuko mu ntiambara njyayo baravugaaga ngo baryaaga n' ibigori ,
it is made out of maize flour mingled in water . ||| baravuga bati noneho ifu y' ibigori ni yo igira kutae ?
that is the only food that could satisfy the family . ||| ngo niyo itubuka .
i was put in charge of grinding maize and separating the fine flour from the big particles . ||| wowe akazi alice uzajya utukorera , uzajya utusekurair ibigori kandi uzajya ubiyungurura .
therefore , i would grind the maize until my hands got swollen . ||| ubwo nkazajya nsekura ibigori , nza kurwara mu ntuze , mu ntoki . nje kurwara mu ntoki mbese kuturika cyane ,
however , that never stopped me from carrying the pot whenever it was time to move ahead . ||| ariko niba nnaharwaye gutyo , ntabwo binbuzaaga y' uko nitugenda ntaza kuikorera ya safuriya .
it was my daily job . ||| mbese wariwo murimo wanjye mbese tugiye .
when we reached rusatira , the nkotanyi came . ||| ubwo turagenda tugeze i rusatira , i nkotanyi icya kora ziba ziraje ,
however on the way , the perpetrators would kill some of the people who had fled with them . sometimes they would stop and abuse me . ||| bagenda bica abantu mu nzira , bakampagarika ,
then i decided to stop and go back where we were coming from . ||| pu !
i said to myself "@ there is no difference i may still die . even though i go keep going with these perpetrators , they may reach some where and kill me , i can not change much to my fate . @" ||| ubwo nrangije ngira kutae ? mpita decida njyewe kusubira inyuma uko bizagenda kose , nzapfae cyangwa bizagendae bite ? ko n' ubundi ntacyo nkirwanair .
i used to fetch water . ||| ubwo nrangije njyaaga jya kuvoma gutya ngiye kubona ,
one day , as i was planning to go fetch water , abayi came and told me ; "@ alice , get out ! @" ||| nbona gutya ntuza uwo mugabo baitaaga abiya . araza aravuga ngo @: " ali , ngo @:
i went out . ||| sohoka . @" ntasohoka ;
then he said , "@ i know you very well , you are a tutsi . ||| maze kusohoka araambaza ngo wowe ngo ntakuzi ngo uri umututsi ,
you will not continue to stress us out for so long . ||| ngo aho kugira ngo ugendae uturushya ,
i was suggesting we kill you and then we proceed our journey without you . @" ||| ahubwo twagirango tubae tukuica ukava mu nzu twebwe tukagenda ukwacu .
i knew there was nothing to lie about because it was true , he knew me . ||| nravuga nti uyunguyu aranzi nanone ntakintu ndi busubizaeho ntaki ,
therefore , i simply kept quiet . ||| nricecekair ndamwihorera .
but my hands were swollen and then he asked me , "@ what happened to your hands ? @" ||| ubwo izi ntoki zari ziragize cyane ziratunbaye mbese zirajemo ikibyimba , maze araambaza ngo mbese ahongaho ubaye iki ?
i told him that i was grinding maize grains and then developed corns in my hands , which turned to be boils and later on the boils busted . ||| nramubwira nti nsekuye ibigoli nrangije rero nragira hazamo ibavu riraturika none ubu ntinzi .
then he told some men to take me and kill me . ||| ubwo arangije ampereza abagabo ngo bagendae bajyae kunyica .
but there was a dispute among those men because they could n't decide who would kill me . ||| abagabo bansiganira kunyica mbese hariya i rusatira ,
that was in rusatira . ||| barangije baravuga ngo uno mwana ntabwo tumwica mbese n' uzabaho .
one of them told me to go after that . ||| ubwo umwe aravuga ngo sha ngo ngaho igenderae .
i left them and went back . ||| nongera nisubirair inyuma nraigendera ,
i would avoid using the main road and would go through the bushes instead . ||| sice mu muhanda njyewe nkazajya genda nkicira mu bihuru nkaigendera ,
as i was walking i met some people whom were said to be the inkotanyi . they were collecting children and that is how they got me too . ||| nyuma rero ntinzi ukuntu nhuye n' abantu bavuga ngo mbese ni inkotanyi bagenda batoragura utwana nk' uko nguko nnjyae bantoraguramo ,
then we were taken to butare . ||| batujyana i butare .
we lived there until when i started thinking "@ well , i am here but how come none of my family members is here ? ||| tubaye ahongahooo , igihe kiragera noneho alisa nkazajya nibaza , ubusae ko ndi hano , nkaba nbona nta mwene wacu nrikubona ,
does this mean no one survived to come and get me out of here ? @" ||| n' ukuvuga ko nta numawe uriho wenda ngo azanshakishae cyangwa ngo azagirae kutae ?
i lived there for some time and then ... later i saw my cousins . ||| ntahabaye , ntahabaye , nrangije ngira kutae ? nyuma nza kuvamo mbese nbona ... barumuna banjye bo kwa data wacu bari hanze ,
they were younger than i was and they were on their own . therefore , since there was no good life where i was living and yet at the same time my cousins were getting spoiled on the roads , i decided to leave the place and join them . ||| mbese nrangije nravuga aho kugira bandagare reka tugirae kutae nnjyae nrabona hano ari nta kintu hamaraiye ,
i was the oldest , life became very hard on us . ||| reka njyewe nvaemo nijyewe mukuru gendae nbasangae . ubwo nrangije mu by' ukuri ubuzima buratugora ,
i started that life of being in charge of the whole family since i was the oldest . ||| tujya hanze mbese jya hanze arijyewe mukuru ari njyae en charge ya famille .
"@ i am now talking about life after the war . @" ||| nkazajya nreba mbese ubwo ngeze ku buzima iby' intambara birangiye .
we went to a certain man called papa alisa . ||| ubwo tujya ku mugabo baita papa alisa ,
we told him , " as you can see how our home was destroyed . ||| turangije turamubwira tuti rero twebwe i wacu urahareba ,
there is no house left . if you did us a favour and got us a shelter , it would be very meaningful to us . we are the only ones who survived , we will never burden you as far as food and other needs are concerned . ||| nta nzu ihari ntaki ahubwo twebwe utucumbikiye ukatuihera akazu tugira kutae tukiberamo njyewe na barumuna banjye dore nitwebwe tusigaye twenyine ,
if you got us shelter , it would be of great help to us . ||| nraumva bitufasha ntabwo twebwe tuzakugora mbese mu buzima mbese nko kututunga ;
we shall look for means to get food by ourselves . @" ||| nraumva mbese tuzabona uko tubaho .
we would endlessly sit in that house and sometimes we would even sleep without eating anything . ||| ubwo tujyaaga tuigira muri ako kazu , tuka ... hariho igihe tunaburaraaga ,
today , despite all the time gone by , we still sleep hungry sometimes . ||| kandi na n' uyu munsi wa none ntureba n' igihe kishize n' ubungubu turaburara . keretse ... baragenda bakajya ku ishuri ,
unless ... my cousins and i go to school but on our return when on holiday ... unless someone feels sorry for us and gives us two kg of beans , and another one gives us one kg of cassava flour ... we normally find a way to survive on what we 've got . ||| nnjyae nkajya ku ishuri , ariko tuza mbese nko mu kiruhuko keretse nk' iyo umuntu atugiraiye impuhwe . utuhaye ibiro 2 by' ibishyimbo , utuhaye ikilo cy' ubugali ,
occasionally , when it 's time to live school we worry thinking about where to go as we dread going back to our so called home . ||| tugira kutae ? tubifata uko nguko . cyangwa se ukasanga turi kuiganyira ukuntu mbese tugomba kuva ku ishuri , n' urugo ukuntu turi burutungukamo rumeze ,
life where no one comes to say hi , sometimes we do not go to school . at my age i would have finished high school if it were n't for such problems . ||| ntawe uzaza ngo atubwirae ngo mwaramutse , cyangwa se tukabura nk' uko tujya ku ishuri . nkubu njyewe nba nrarangije . ariko bigera ahongaho nkabivamo ,
sometimes i stop because i have no means to go to school . ||| nkabireka nkabura uko jya ku ishuri ,
however , sometimes we were lucky to go to school and the times we were n't , then we all just sat home . ||| ngira amahirwe nkabona uko abo bana uko bagiye ku ishuri mbese bakagenda . cyangwa tubura uko tubigenza tuesae tukaicara .
in short , life is really hard . ||| ubwo mbese ukareba ubuzima mbese buragoye .
i did not go to school last term because of similar problems . ||| nkubungubu urebye trimestere ( ikihembae ) yashize ya mbere ntabwo njyewe nigeze niga kubera ibibazo nk' ibyo byose .
until a few days ago i managed to go to school for this current term however , life is still too hard . ||| ubu nrangije kugira ngo mbe nbasha kusubira mu ishuri ngiyeyo ubu ejo bunri muri kino kihembawe ,
it 's difficult to get a job . nobody can employ me yet . ||| mbese nkabona ubuzima buragoye ,
of course i can never work as a housemaid because i can not stand that job . ||| nkavuga se ubu nzakora iki ? ntanuwo nsaba n' akazi ngo akampe ,
i can not work as a housemaid where every one insults you or people do to you anything they wish . ||| nkabona nanone ntawampa akazi . kandi nanone njyae ntawe uzampa akazi ko kuba mu rugo njyewe ntinshobora kuba umuboyi cyangwa ngo umuntu antukae cyangwa ngo agirae kutae .
well , the man helped us with his house in 1997 until when he told us that , although his house was very small , he would wish to get a small amount of money out of it . ||| mu by' ukuri wa mugabo yatutije inzu muri za 97 igihe kiza kugera ati rero akazu kanjye , n' ubwo ari gatoya , nkakodesha kakagira kutae ,
be it 3000 rfw or 5000 rfw in case he repaired it . ||| kakampa amafaranga n' ubwo yaba 3000 cyangwa se 5000 kakoze isuku ,
he said that it would be of use to him . ||| nraumva biangirira mbese akamaro .
i went to see another old man who was a hutu and told him ; "@ mzee [ old man ] , you used to be a friend to my dad . ||| turagenda noneho nravuga noneho njya ku musaza kabisa w' umuhutu witwa muhamudu nti muzae nzi uko uri inshuti ya papa ,
since you were friends , please get us a small house we promise to never disturb you . ||| none ubwo uri inshuti ya papa tushakirae inzu ntabwo tukugora ,
get us a house of one bedroom and a living room , even if it only has a bedroom without a living room we will survive it , we will hung curtains in the room to divide it . ||| tushakirae akazu k' icyumba na salon cyangwa nigashaka kabae na , nta cyumba kirimo cyangwa tuzajya tushyiramo rido .
fortunately the old man gave the house to me . it had a single bedroom with a small living room . it was his servants ' house . ||| arangije umusaza akazu arakampaye k' icyumba na salon kabagamo abakozi be ,
after some time , the old man said that we should at least give him 1000 rfw . ||| arangije noneho igihe kiza kugera ati @: "@ noneho , mujyae munshakira n' igihumbi . @"
i told him that sincerely speaking i could not get that money . ||| muby' ukuri njyewe nramubwiye nti igihumbi ntacyo nbona ,
"@ you know the way we live , it is your wife who sometimes helps us , " i told him . ||| nti ubuzima bwacu urabizi , uzi ko ufite icyuma mu rugo , umugore wawe niwe utugirair impuhwe .
people would look at us and feel ashamed because i never used to ask for food even when we were starving to death . we would never beg food from anyone . ||| ubwo mbese ukareba n' umuntu akagira n' isoni n' iki ? nk' ubu njyewe ntinshobora kujya gufunguza ,
i never go to someone and say that " i , alice , am hungry . @" ||| uraumva inzara ishobora kunyica cyangwa nba barumuna banjye ikabica cyangwa bakagira , ariko ntabwo nshobora kuza ngo nkubwirae ngo njyewe ngo alisa ngo nfite ikibazo iki n' iki , ngo ngirae .
i just keep silent until when one can tell from my appearance that i need something . because the majority of people listen to your problems yet they are not going to help you . ||| ntakuihorera niba ubona ko ari ngombaw , wowe wagikemura . s' ukuvuga y' uko benshi nrabazi ariko ubwira umuntu akakaumvira ubusa . sukuvuga ko nicaye ,
i stopped going to school because there were no people in this world to help others in need . ||| atari uko abantu batariho kandi bavuga ngo n' abagiraneza babaho .
i dropped out of school for a whole year until a few days ago when i realised that i am risking stopping my studies , and then went back at school when the term was coming to its end . ||| nraicaye umwaka wose urashira . ejobundi nabwo nbonye ko rwose nicaye birangiye , igihembwe kirashira .
i went to school very late . ||| kimaze kushira , n' ubungubu no kujya kuiga ngiyeyo nyuma .
i used to study in kanombe . ||| kuko nigaaga hariya i kanombe . nrareba kuza kuiga hano ikigali , nta tick ,
coming to school here to kigali with transport problems , going back home yet there is nobody to find there , plus several other problems ... therefore , i decided to study from there ... where i would walk in case i had no bus fare . ||| ntataha nta muntu ugira kutae nsanga , ntaki , reka noneho ngira kutae ngendae nsubirae inyuma jyae kuiga iriya . kuko nzajya nbura n' uko nbigenza nzajya ngenda n' amaguru .
i asked for admission in the school and i was accepted . ||| ubwo nrangije nragenda nsaba ishuri , bararimpaye , bamaze kurimpa ariko ngira ikibazo cyo kujya ku ishuri ,
but i still had more needs ; i wanted someone who came help me with let 's say ; washing soap , which coasted 50 rfw , or maybe to give me some colgate . ||| nshakisha noneho n' umuntu nnanbwira se wo kabyarawe ungiraiye impuhwe ukampa agasabune wenda ka cinquante ( 50 ) biibura ampe nka 2 kiangwae se na ga colgatte ,
you know what ? ||| kujyenda uri mushyashya uvugae ngo ugiye kutangira usaba ,
when one is new in a school , it gives a wrong impression to begin with asking anyone for a colgate or soap yet you are new in the society . ||| ngo nshyirairho agacolgatte , ntiza agasabune , kandi witwa ko uri mushyashya ukaumva nabwo n' ibibazo . ubwo nrangije nihagararaho haashije ibyumweru 2 abana baratangiye ,
it is a problem . ||| ntinzi rwose ,
after being late for two weeks , i can not tell how lucky i was and a certain lady come and asked me @: ||| ntinzi nnjyae ukuntu bigenze ngiye kubona nbona umudamu umwe araje , aravuga ati @: "@ ese
after dividing the soaps and colgate , i told them , "@ you see we have got something to use at school but we have no ticket to take us to school . @" ||| tumaze kutukabana , noneho nrababwira nti @: mu by' ukuri noneho murebae tubonye ibikoresho kandi ntawe uzabona ticket ,
one was going to school in nyanza and the other one was in shyogwe . i asked the first one if he @/@ she would walk up to nyanza ? @" ||| umwe yiga i nyanza undi yiga i shyogwe , ubwo murareba ubu se uzava hano ugendae i nyanza n' amaguru ?
i said that personally i could carry my bag on the head and walk till i get there . ||| mu by' ukuri njyae nzikorera igikapu cyanjye manukae ncae hano hepfo ngendae ! ni nzagenda n' amasaha angahe , ariko nzagenda . nuko nrangije noneho ubwo noneho nbabwirae nti muri abana ,
no matter how long it would take . "@ since you are too young , i said , you should go by the roadside and get a ride to nyanza and the other one to shyogwe . ||| mujyende mujyae ku muhanda mushakae umuntu ubategair rifti umwe agendae , umwe ategae ijya i nyanza undi ategae ijya intuzaa ijya i shyogwe .
that is exactly how it happened . ||| ubwo bigenda gutyo .
afterwards , i decided to go and see claire the following day . ||| ubu rero nrangije ngira gutya nibwo nvuze nti rero reka nzajyae kureba na claire ejo ,
claire and i went to the same school . hoping that she would get something to give me . ||| nrangije nravuga nti ni wenda mu by' ukuri turiganyae nti we ntiyabura iki ? ntiyabura icyo yamarair . ubwo rega ntateze nraje !
i boarded a taxi and went there . ||| nje ino ahangaha .
first , i went to get permission from the school director [ headmaster ] he immediately told me "@ alice , you will not sit for the final exams . @" i asked myself why ? ||| nrangije ubwo nsaba uruhusa ariko n' ukuvuga y' uko nabwo nzanaw n' iki ? nzanaw n' ibibazo . directeur araza aranbwira ati @:
i believe you understand how problems kept piling , up all at once . ||| alisa wowe nta uzakora exta kubera iki ? ubwo urumaw ko ari ibibazo biri kugenda biza mu binri .
then i asked him " why sir ? @" ||| nti kubera iki ? aranbwira ati @:
he replied , "@ you came very late after i have already taken back the forms . ||| "@ uje nyuma usanga formulaire nrazijyanye ,
and since i took the forms , there is no alternative , you will study but you will never sit for the final exams . maybe next academic year ... @" i got so disappointed that day . ||| none ubwo nzijyanye n' uko nyine , uzaiga ntiuzakora exta ntabwo uzagira ... umwaka utaha uzagira . @"
i imagined spending days in class yet i were n't going to sit for exams . ||| noneho nibaza ubuzima bwanjye , nibaza kuza kuirirwa nicaye ngo nraiga , ntinzanakora ntinzanagira kutae ?
then i asked the headmaster to let me go back home but the headmaster said no ! ||| directeur nibwo nmubwiye nti njyewe urekae ntahae .
i again asked him to let me go back home , once again he said no ! ||| ngo oya . nti njyewe reka ntahae niko njyewe nmubwiye ,
i got annoyed and he realised that i was . ||| directeur arangije abona nrarakaye ,
the following day i went to him again he refused . ||| buracya nsubirayo , buraongera buracya nsubirayo . nramubwira nti rero ,
the next day i told him that i needed permission to go and tell people at home about the situation . headmasters never know student 's details he thus gave me the permission . ||| ubundi directeur ntabwo aba azi ibibazo by' umuntu . nti mpa uruhushya ntahae jyae kubibwira mu rugo , uko ibintu bimeze , ampaye uruhushya .
i said to myself , i have no home to go to . ||| nrangije noneho nravuga @: mu by' ukuri ntaho ntaha jya ,
i better go to the examination council and ask if i can not sit for exams . that is the decision i myself made . ||| ntaki , ahubwo reka ngirae kutae ? jyende jyae muri conseil jyae kwibariza . noneho reka jyewe jyae ,
i decided to go to the examination council and ask why alice in particular would not sit for exams . ||| reka jyewe jyende muri conseil jyae kwibariza . uraumva , reka jyewe jyae muri conseil jyae kwibariza , nibarize impamvu njyewe alisa ntagomba kukora ,
the thought of repeating the whole year ... can you imagine ? ||| nibaza ukuntu jyewe nzaiga umwaka wose , uraumva ,
at the same time i would think about my life and finally i decided it impossible . ||| nkaongera ubutaha nkazagaruka . nkibaza n' ubuzima bwanjye nkabona ibyo bintu ntazabishobora .
at first going to school was very hard for me . ||| kandi no kuza kuiga bingoye .
i borrowed 1500 rfw from a fellow student . ||| nragenda nguza umwana nramubwira nti rero nbabarira njyewe unkurize amafaranga .
i told her that if all goes well i would pay her very soon . ||| nti unkurize 1.500 nti njyewe ntashaka kujya i kigali imaan n' inshoboza nzayakuha .
i did n't know where to get that money but i took it because i needed bus fare . ||| mu by' ukuri ntinzi ahantu nzayakura , ntinzi iki ! nricecekair . nba en charge ya ya mafaranga noneho kugira ngo jyewe nzabonae i ticket .
then i went to the examination council yesterday and explained to them my problem . ||| ubwo nraza jya hariya kuri conseil ejo nragenda nbabwira mbese ikibazo cyanjye ko ari cyo kibazo nfite , baemera kuvuga ngo bazagira .
at the council they easily understood my problem . they gave a call to my headmaster and reminded him about alice 's case . ||| batelefona directeur , baramubwira ikibazo cya alisa ,
they asked him to fill the form on my behalf and take it to the council for me . ||| noneho uzauzuzae wowe uzauzuzae fomurmulaire yiwe numara kuyuzuza ugirae kutae ? uzayizanae .
then i left that place . ||| ubwo rero nrangije ,
in the evening i decided to go and see claire as i had planned prior . ||| nragenda nravuga nimugoroba nti reka rero noneho jyae kureba claire , nramanuka mpita jya kureba claire mbese ,
she asked me to go back the next morning that there were some people who wanted to know about life of children who take care of themselves . i told her that i have no problem with that . ||| mu gitondo nibwo mbese yanbwiraaga ngo uribuze mbese . nravuga nti nta kibazo , ngo kandi barashaka ubuzima bw' abana bibana .
i know the experience of living alone . ||| nti njyewe ubuzima bwo nrabufite .
i would have left yesterday for school because the headmaster said that i should go back to school . ||| nuko nyine nti nba nranagiye n' ejo nkaongera nkasubirayo ngo ngendae jyae ku ishuri ,
that is what he said on phone . ||| kuko directeur yari avuze ngo mpite nongera ngarukae kuko bari bamaze ku mutelefona .
in a word that is how my life is , i am half alive , half dead . ||| nuko mbese urebye ubuzima bwanjye n' ubwongubwo nriho ntariho .
from school i do n't expect to find anyone home . ||| sibyo , simvuga ngo nrava ku ishuri nvugae ngo ntasanga uyu nguyu ,
i do n't even think having someone visiting me ; let 's say an aunt visiting me , i do n't have any aunt , i do n't have any uncle , no one . ||| ibindi byo simba nnabitekereza kugirango umuntu wenda bibinri byo kusuraw byo kuvuga ngo njyewe ngo nragiye ngiye nsanze masenge nta masenge ngira , nta data wacu ,
as you see me standing here in front of you , i am the oldest person of the family that survived . ||| ntaki ! uko mpagaze uku nijyewe alisa ninjye mukuru w' umuryango . uraumva , ukareba ukasanga rero ,
because of all that , i wish there were no holidays at all . ||| nba numva na vacance zitanabaho .
i suffer a lot on holidays . ||| kuko nragenda nkahangayika .
i get several problem i can not solve . ||| ukasanga rero n' ibibazo bigenda binkomereye cyane nkashaka nkabibura .
nowadays , telling a rwandan about the problems i face is just a ... they would just talk about your problems all around . ||| nawe aho kugirango ugendae urebae umunyarwanda w' iki kihae , ugendae umubwirae uti nfite ikibazo iki n' iki , uraumva ,
one has to come up with a decision . ||| wa muntu nawe , ahubwo azakunyega azagira kutae ? agendae akubunza akuvuga .
we live in that small house suffering . ||| wowe ugira kutae ? uremera ukafata kamwe . ukagenda tukagenda tukibera muri ubwo burushyi bwacu ,
if anybody feels sorry for us ... life goes on . ||| muri ako kazu kaho nkaha mbese , niba batugiraiye impuhwe n' uko mbese nyine bimeze ubuzima ni bara , bara .
how many were you in your family ? ||| mwavukanaga muri abana bangahe ?
we were four children . ||| tuvukanaaga turi abana 4
and how many of you survived ? ||| mukaba musigaye muri bangahe ?
how we lived together ? ||| uko tubanye ?
well , when i reached his home , i was never treated like a home child . he took me to be like a housemaid . ||| mbese ubwo ngezeyo mu rugo , iwe , muby' ukuri ntabwo nbaye nk' umwana wo mu rugo urebye njyewe yanfashe nk' umukozi wiwe .
every night i would go to hide somewhere in the bush and in the morning , they would pick me up . ||| ariko ijoro , mbese ni joro , yaravuga ... njyewe njyaaga njya kuihisha mu gikaranka ahantu , ubwo bukacya bumara kucya ,
in his home i would go to harvest coffee . ||| bakaza kunbwira bati ngwino , nkagenda , ubwo iyo nbaga ndi murugo iwe njyaaga kusoroma ikawa ,
we would take the coffee to the machine for grinding . ||| tujyaaga kuzishesha tukajonjora .
sometimes i would go to fetch water for cleaning the coffee . ||| cyangwa nkajya no kuvoma amazi yo kuronga ikawa ,
most of the time , that would be my work in his home . i guess you know that by then it was harvest time . for coffee as well as for other things . ||| ariko urebye , mbese akenshi akongako niko kari akazi kanjye mbese urebye ; icyo kihae muzi ko ikawa zari zaeze cyane !
they used to give me a lot of work because i was vulnerable . ||| n' imyaka yari yeze ! mbese ubwo , uko nri ndi bankoreshaaga uko ndi . nkagenda ,
we would spend the whole day in coffee plantations and take it for grinding . ||| ubwo tuirirwaaga mu ikawa , tukazishesha ,
from there , i would go for water . ||| ubundi nkaza nkajya kuvoma ,
i would not use a normal can ; i would use an old can to fetch water and i would bring water with it . ||| ariko mu kuvoma kwanjye bagiraaga kutae ? jyae ntabwo bampaga ijerekani nzima ,
i would bring half can water . ||| ntwaraaga ikijerekani cy' iki ? cy' igice , cya kinri cy' igice nkagenda nkakikorera nkakizana ,
not a full one . ||| ariko kibaga ari igice kitauzuye .
i stayed there . ||| ubwo ,
then that man came and told me ; "@ let me tell you young girl , i got you from your mum . ||| ndahabayee ... umugabo noneho yarangije aranbwira ati @: "@ reka noneho nkubwirae wa mwana we ,
and i do n't want your blood to be counted on me . ||| nkuambuye nyoko , maze kukuambura nyoko , nraumva ntashaka ko amaraso yawe azagira kutae ?
therefore , i beg you to go . ||| azaambarwaho . none gira kutae ? wowe igenderae .
it is up to you to look for a way to ruhango , i do n't know if you can guess the right way . @" ||| niba ushakisha ukuntu uri bugendae ukagera mu ruhango , simbizi , ugendae upima ikirere . @"
i told him that i did not know where to go . ||| nramubwiye , nti @: jyewe nraumva ntamenya iyo njya .
i assured him that i did n't know where to go . ||| nti jyewe rwose nraumva ntamenya iyo njya . noneho arangije aranbwira ati ... noneho ,
but there was a certain child who lived in that family ; the wife of that man was that kid 's aunt . ||| hakaba hari umwana uhabaaga umugore yarabereye nyirasenge ,
that child seemed to be wiser than i was ; she even looked older than i was . ||| we ubonaaga anrushije mbese no kujijuka , ubonaaga ko anrusha n' imyaka .
then i decided to ask her to do me a favour ... ||| noneho nramubwira nti wowe , mubwirae agirae kutae ?
to escort me and show me the way because i did n't know the way . ||| amperekeze , anyerekae inzira jyewe ntinzi ahantu ndi bujyae .
then that kid escorted me up to a small route . but there was some place i remembered , where we once passed with my mum . it was at my uncle 's place . he was my mum 's cousin . ||| arangije aramperekeza . amaze kumperekeza , angeza kukayira . angejeje kukayira noneho hakaba hari ahantu tuciye kwa musaza wa mama wo kwa se wabo ,
the first time i passed there , i was with my mum and she said ; "@ i am going to find means of how we would go to burundi because there 's no other alternative . @" ||| ariko mubyukuri jyae nri mpageze ari ubaw mbere , mbese turi tugiye ubwongubwo , mama aravuga ati @" njyewe ngiye kushakisha uko nshoboye tugende tujyae i burunri nta kunri . @"@
but as i told you , she stopped on the way . ||| ubwo arangije , ubwo uraumva ko we yagarutse mu nzira ,
then i went on and ascended the hill . ||| noneho nnjyae ntakomeza nrazamuka ,
then i decided to pass at my uncle 's place expecting to find somebody . ||| nravuga nti reka ncae hahanri , wenda bo usanga bakihari . ariho kwa marume .
when i went there , i found no one . ||| ubwo nciyeyo , nsanga wapi noneho nsanga intuze ,
the grass had grown everywhere . ||| n' ibyatsi birameze .
"@ where will poor alice go ? @" i asked myself . ||| nti noneho alice nrajya hehe ?
i would aim from where i was standing and look across the hill but i would not find any place that i knew . ||| nkazajya mpagarara ahangaha nkareba hakurya , nkareba hakuno , nkabona nta hantu nzi .
believe me , i did not try to commit suicide only once , i did twice . ||| mu kuiahura mu by' ukuri ntiniahuye rimwe jyewe , niahuye kabiri .
slightly below that home there was a river . ||| ubwo hepfo yaho hari umugezi , se bawitaga nguki ! hepfo ya ,
i do n't remember what it was called . ||| mbese ,
near their home , the river was approximately there [ she 's pointing ] and they were living somewhere like here [ as she 's pointing ] . near the swamp . ||| bari batuye , mbese ni nk' igishanga nk' ahangaha nabo batuye nka hariya . nkavuga nti noneho , nti uno mukenya noneho ,
then i said to myself ; "@ i am going to throw myself in this river . @" ||| nti nragenda nanone nkugemo .
i threw myself in the river and simply drunk some water and found myself the other side of the river . ||| noneho nragenda nkuikubitamo , ubundi nragenda nywa amazi ngira kutae ubundi birangije , nikubita hakurya . maze kuikubita hakurya ,
when i was young , i used to hear that when you commit suicide and you have money , you can never die . ||| noneho nkaba nraumvise ngo umuntu wiyahura afite amafaranga ntapfa .
i had 1000 rfw in my pocket . ||| jyae nri nfite igihumbi ,
"@ maybe it is the reason why i can not die . @" i thought . ||| nravuga nti ubu ahari nti ni uko ahari nfite amafaranga .
then i put that money aside and then went back into the river . ||| ya mafaranga nyakuramo nyata imusozi , nraongera ninagamo .
i still did not die . then i left the river . ||| nbona ibintu biranze . ubwo nbonye ibintu bianze ngira kutae ? ntaceceka nyine ubwo nyine ,
that is how i left that man 's home . he was called kayigamba . ||| uko niko nvuye kuri uwo mugabo bajya baita kayigamba .
would you remember all the people you met during the genocide if you saw them today ? ||| none se , ubwo abo bantu bose ugiye unyuraho muri icyo kihae cya genocide . abo bantu bose wunva ukibaibuka ubabonye ubamenya ?
yes , i know them . ||| yee , jyewe nrabazi .
do you know anything as far as their lives are concerned ? ||| nta maherezo yabo uba uzi ubungubu ku buzima bwabo ?
well , kayigamba is imprisoned . ||| mbese kayigamba ,
but i do n't know the prison where he is . ||| amakuru ye nba nzi , arafunze . ariko ntabwo nzi ahantu afungaiye .
i heard that abiya who was a doctor is now in kenya . ||| uwonguwo nawe baita abiya uri ntuza ... uri umuganga we yafashe , we nraumva ngo ari muri kenya ahari niko numvise .
that is what rumours say . he went with a girl called grace . grace was a girl we were hiding together in that home . ||| yajyanye n' umukobwa bajyaaga baita grace ubwo uwo mukobwa baitaaga grace nawe turi tuihishaanye ahongaho mbese ,
he used to say that he was trying to save her and later make her his wife . ||| mbese yaravugaaga ngo ni muburyo bwo kumukiza ariko ahita agira kutae ? amugira n' umugore w' iwe barajyana . abongabo ntinzi iki ?
then they went together but i have n't heard more about them . ||| ntinzi amaherezo yabo .
in the orphanage . ||| muri orpherinat .
actually , even though i was considered to be living in the orphanage , i would n't feel at home . ||| mbese ubundi urebye , icyo kihae jyewe nbonaaga mbese , n' ubwo numvaaga y' uko ndi muri iyo orpherinat , jyewe nibazaaga ko atari iwacu .
is n't it ? ||| sibyo ? ariko ko mpari ngize kutae ?
i knew i would one day leave the orphanage . ||| nzahava n' ubundi .
otherwise there were n't many problems . however , for me to decide to leave the orphanage , there was a certain man who was called ... i do n't remember his name . he was some kind of director . ||| muby' ukuri nbonaaga nta kibazo , ariko ikintu jyewe kinahankuye cyane kugira ngo decider kusezera , hari umugabo baitaaga ntuzaa ... mbese ari nka directeur wacu .
one day ... i had a big scar here on my ankle , where i was speared . ||| noneho igihe kiza kugera kuko jyewe , hano nfite n' igikovu banteye icumu hano ahangaha ku gatsinsino . nrangije ubwo , directeur akazajya ,
then he would ... by then i was too slim ; i looked very weak . ||| kuko icyo kihae nri nnutse ndi akantu rwose kateye ubute . ubwo ,
then he said to me , "@ look at this disaster ! @"@ ||| arangije directeur noneho aravuga ati @: "@ ariko nk' iri shyano ! @"
. the director , said that . ||| akabivuga directeur icyo kihae , akabivuga . nrangije noneho ,
otherwise , i was fine and i was with other children . ||| ariko nkagenda mbese nkabona mubanri , mbese nta kibazo ,
i could eat , sleep , you know , we would get all things plus clothes . ||| nrarya nkaryama , uraumva , mbese nkabona , mbese byose bakatuha n' imyenda .
my problem was the man called kayigamba . ||| ariko jyewe nza kugira ikibazo cy' uwo mugabo bajya baita ngo ni kayigamba .
then i decided to leave the orphanage . ||| ubwo nrangije nyine nibwo ngize kutae ? ndesida ( nfata icyemezo ) jyewe kusezera nyine .
i told them that i wanted to leave the orphanage . ||| nravuga ngo ntasezeye ,
i said i would live the way god wished . ||| nti nragiye nzagenda nbaeho uko iki ? uko imaan ishaka .
i preferred working for someone as a housemaid to being abused by someone . ||| n' iyo ngenda nkakorera umuntu ariko ntagize kutae ? ntakomeje kuzajya ntukwa n' umuntu . ubwo nragaije ,
i think by then i had completed my primary studies . ||| icyo kihae rwose nri nrangije ahari na primaire .
then i left the orphanage . ||| ubwo rero mpita ngira kutae ? mpita nigendera rwose nyivamo .
then you left the orphanage and decided to become the head of a family . ||| ubwo rero uba uvuyemo , ufashe icyemezo cy' uko uba umukuru w' umuryango .
how old were you ? ||| ubwo ngubwo muri icyo kihae uri ufite nk' imyaka ingahe ?
i probably was 17 or 16 years old i think . ||| i cyo kihae nraumva nri nfite ahari nka 17 cyangwa , 16 nraumva ariyo nri nfite .
the children you were looking after , what are their age difference ? ||| abo ureraaga bari bakurikiraanye batae mu myaka ?
the oldest is 18 years at the moment ; she is in secondary four . ||| mbese umukuru muri abongabo , afite imyaka 18 ubungubu . yiga mu wa kane secondaire .
her young sister is in secondary two now . ||| murumuna we nawe , yiga muwakabiri ubungubu .
do you still live with both of them ? ||| muri kumwe nabo ari babiri .
i stayed at home and wrote a letter on my own . ||| ubwo nsigara ku rugo nrangije nfata intuze jyewe ubwanjye , nfata i lettre nrayandika . maze kuyandika nramubwira ,
i took it to him but his wife did n't know how to read . ||| nragenda nrayimuha , umugore we ntabwo yari azi kusoma .
he read it and called me and asked me ; "@ alice how do you feel ? @" ||| nrayimuha arayisomye , arangije arampamagara , ati @: " alice ubona bimeze kutae ? @"
meanwhile my cousin asked for an exercise book , and he told her that there were no books . ||| iki , ariko biza kuva ku ntandaro , murumuna wanjye aramubwira ati , mpa ikaye ,
that he did n't have money to buy books . ||| abasaba mbese ikayi . amaze kubasaba ikaye arababwira , ngo nta makaye ahari . ngo nta n' amafaranga nfite yo kukugurair ikaye .
some other time another event happened ; he had other two girls that he had brought ... he used to work from kigali ; he was a businessman there in the commercial street . ||| ubwo nanone ikindi kihae kiza kugera yari afite abana b' abakobwa babiri , arabazanye , uwo mugabo mbese yakoraaga inahangaha i kigali ,
but he would come home on fridays . ||| ari umucuruzi acururiza hariya muri quartier mateus ariko akataha ku wa gatanu .
he took his daughters to the tailor and made them good clothes then for us he bought us very funny clothes . ||| afashe abana be aragiye arabadodeshereje , twebwe arangije , aragenda atuzanira , ni nko kutufatair ibyamvagara .
he put those clothes in the closet and called me . ||| arabizanye , amaze kubizana aragiye abishyize muri garde robae ubundi arivugaishije ,
he said to me , "@ look into that closet there are some clothes , check if they suit your cousins and you . @" ||| arampamagaye ngo genda murebae muri iriya myenda urebae ko wowe na barumuna bawe ibakwira .
i rushed to the closet and saw the clothes but when i compared them with the clothes that they had given others , they were incomparable . ||| noneho nrayirebye , nrebye n' iyo bazaniye abandi , ndabi compara ( nrabigereranya ) nsanga ntibihuye .
well , i used too be so mad ... i thanked him . ||| nrangije nramubwiye ngo n' uko . njyewe nri umuntu ugira umujinya cyane , nramubwira nti n' uko murakoze ,
i told my cousins never to wear those clothes . ||| maze kuyifata , njyewe nbwiye barumuna banjye nti iyo myenda ntimuyanberae ,
we decided to give them to the housemaid . ||| ahubwo tugirae kutae ? tuyiherae umukozi wa hano mu rugo .
he brought us three funny skirts and three undefined t @-@ shirts , i just thanked him and told him that we had not yet reached the extent of wearing such things . @" ||| uraumva yazanye ubugutiya 3 @-@ n' ubupira ntazi ukuntu bumeze , uraumva , nramubwira nti njyewe n' uko mwarakoze mwaradufashije ariko ntabwo , ntabwo tugeze aho kugirango mutuhae ibintu bimeze gutya .
we gave them to the housemaid . ||| turayifata tuyiha umukozi , tumaze kuyiha umukozi noneho ,
she wore them and one day , his wife saw her wearing the same clothes . she immediately reported us to her husband . "@ they never wore the clothes you gave them . ||| akazajya ayambara . umugore aje noneho umugore araturega , aravuga ati yamyenda ubahaye ntayo bigeze baambara ,
instead they gave them to valentine [ housemaid ] . @" ||| ahubwo bagize kutae ? bayihereye valentine ,
then he called us and said "@ really ali ... ! ||| aratuhamagara , amaze kutuhamagara , uwo mugabo ngo koko ali ,
how could you disobey me yet i brought you here ? @" i replied that it was n't the end of life . ||| ngo utinyukae unsuzugurae nrakuzanye ? nrangije nramubwiye ngo ahangaha siho ubuzima bugarukaiye , ufashe abawe , njyewe nrabimubwira gutya vis a vis ,
i told him face to face ; "@ you brought your children tailor @-@ made clothes and brought us undefined clothes . ||| ufashe abawe uragenda urabadodeshereza , twebwe urangije uragenda utuzanira iki ? utuzanira imyenda ntazi ukuntu imeze , twebwe tubonye imyenda tutayishoboye tugira kutae ?
when we decided that we would never put them on , we decided to give them to valentine . @" ||| tuyiha valentine .
then i decided to leave that home and joined a man called papa alisa . we told him those problems and he allowed to live with us . ||| nanone ndesida kuhava nibwo ngiye kuri wa mugabo baita papa alisa , mbese tumubwira mbese ibyo bibazo yemera kutucumbikira , ubwo nrangije mbese wa mugabo namusezeyaho .
meanwhile i said bye to the other man . by then i was in secondary one . ||| twebwe turagiye njyewe nigaaga mu wa mbere secondaire njyewe niho nigaaga .
then we started living alone and he started saying that we got spoiled . ||| ubwo tudecida mbese kujya kuibana turagenda tubaye ahongaho umugabo akajya avuga ngo turananiraanye tugize kutae ,
i said no problem , watch us and see if we would ever mess up on the streets . ||| nti nta kibazo ariko muri tuesae uzacunge uzarebae ko hari uzagira kutae ? ko hari uzaiyandarika .
we lived there and never stepped in his home . ||| tubaye ahongaho tutakigera mu rugo rwiwe tutakigira kutae ?
but i am sure he never saw us in very bad conditions ; we never got sick of jigger . ||| igihe kiza kugera , ubwo wenda yabonye ko tutasa nabi cyane cyangwa nta na mavunja turwaye nta ki !
we sometimes used to get soap and wash our clothes . he never caught us looking bad . ||| tukazajya tubona n' agasabune tukamesa akabona ntitusa nabi !
later he came to us and said , "@ even though you left us , you can come and pay us a visit . @" ||| ubwo arangije mbese nanone aravuga ati @: "@ noneho ubwo , mwagiye muza mu rugo kutusura , kugira kutae ? @"
well , when someone told me something like that , in my heart i despise them , wondering why i should visit them then i say yes knowing very well that i would never appear in their homes . ||| njyewe muby' ukuri iyo babinbwiye njyewe ntabobinshimisha , ushobora kubinbwira nkakugayair mu mutaima ariko nkikairiza .
that is how my life went on . ||| ubwo nrangije mbese bikomeza kugenda gutyoo ... nraumva ari uko bigenze .
when you are with your cousins , i guess that sometime you talk about life ... what kind of advice do you give them ? what do you talk about as far as your life style is concerned ? ||| iyo ubundi wicaranye na barumuna bawe ibyo ari byo byose hari ukuntu muganira ku buzima . ubaha inama ki ? mbese ikiganiro mugiraan kaerekeye ku buzima murimo kiba kiteye kitae ?
as the oldest of all , i first calm them . ||| mbese nkanjyae mukuru , njyewe icyo nkoresha bwa mbere nbanza kubakaruma ( kubarema agatima ) . nkababwira nti @:
i assure them that things will change for the better . ||| ‘ ibingibi siko bizahora . ’ mbese nkabizeza ko inberae hari ibiiza .
i convince them how the future will be good and how we are going to get a better life . ||| njyewe mbizeza ko inberae hari ibiiza nkababwira ko tuzabaho neza ko tuzagira kutae , yuko nyuma y' ubu buzima mbese hazaza iki ?
so i go ahead and tell them @: "@ although we have no job now , in the future we will get one , we are studying and we will get jobs afterwards so the future will be good . ||| hazaza ubundi . nkababwira nti dore rero impamvu twebwe tufite avenir , n' uko nta kazi kakibaho twebwe turi kuiga , kandi n' ubwo tuiga tuzagira kutae tuzarangiza .
i believe god is with us , if we behave ourselves then the future will be brighter . @" ||| kandi nraumva y' uko imaan itagize kutae ? itatuteranye . ntawe nitwifata neza , tuzagira kutae ?
therefore , we keep up our morale like that . ||| nkeka ko inberae tuzagira avenir nziza . mbese ntawe tukagira tutae ? tukiha morale ,
even when we have n't had dinner we just keep morale . however , sometimes we feel discouraged . ||| tuba tunaburaye tukagira tutae ? tukiha morale . mbese ukasanga mbese twifitiye izo za morale , ariko hariho igihe kazamo mbese ,
when one intentionally decides to skip dinner , they find it easy but when one misses it simply because there is no food , it is very distressing . ||| burya wa mukani iyo ubwiraje uvuga uti nrarya , burya uba wunva nta kibazo , ariko iyo uburaye uvuga uti nta n' akantu , n' aka nagakeya usanga umuntu yahangayitse .
the kids ask me @: alice what should we do ? ||| bakavuga bati alisa tubigenze tutae ? nnjyae ubwanjye alisa ntakunri nbigenza , mu by' ukuri noneho namwe muri bakuru ,
yet , i myself have no choice . ||| sibyo , murabibona njyende njyae hehe ? ku isambu nta kintu kihari ,
so i also ask them , "@ you are now mature , why do n't you tell me what to do ? look ! ||| namwe murabibona .
there is no food in the garden , of course i can not dig because i do n't know how to , neither do you . ||| ari njyewe ntabwo njya kufata isuka ngo ngiye kuhinga ntinbishobora , namwe n' uko , ubwo tugirae kutae tutegerezae uko bizagenda , muby' ukuri ndababwiza ukuri ,
so , what can we do ? ||| uraumva turya ari nk' umuntu utugiraiye impuhe nk' uku nguku .
all we can do is wait and see what happens . @" ||| mbese akikora ukajya kubona ukabona akuzaniye nk' agafu nk' iki ,
i want to assure you of this ; we get what we eat by luck , when someone gives us about four kilograms of cassava flour and maybe we had a kilogram of beans then we slowly eat that one kilogram of beans with those four kilograms of flour and some vegetables . ||| tukakafata kuko mu ruhango muzi ko haba imyumbati cyane , hari n' utuzanira ibiro 5 . niba tutetse ikilo k' ibishyimbo , tuzajya nyine tuteka utubaoga dukeya ubundi tutekae ubugari bwinshi wenda ,
[ here in ruhango there is a lot of cassava flour ] that is the situation we are in . ||| utubaoga tuturaye nk' icyumweru , ukareba ukasanga mbese umuntu akarondereza . n' uko urebye bimeze .
i would like to ask you another question that is hard to answer but please , try and do . ||| nagirango nkubaze nk' ubuzima bwawe , n' ikibazo wenda kisa n' ikigoye kukibaza ... kukisubiza ukigeragezae .
do you remember the people who harmed you ? can you tell them to us and what they did ? ||| wunva mu buzima bwawe , abantu bagiye bakukorera bibi bakubabaje wunva ubaibuka ushobora kubavuga ? n' icyo bagiye bakukorera ngo kanaka yagiye ankorera iki ;
for example @: you can say so and so did me wrong yet he or she could have helped me . ||| uti kandi yari afite n' ubushobozi bwo kugira ikindi akora kizima ?
oh . in my life time . ||| mu buzima ?
well , the fact that i remained without a family , i can not blame anyone . ||| rero mu by' ukuri , njyewe nta muryango nsigaraanye , njyewe ntawe nshobora kuveba .
everyone is concerned only with his or her own familly . ||| umuntu wese agira kutae ? yirebair mbese famille yiwe .
nowadays , we have all changed as rwandans , the one who could help you as a survivor tells you he @/@ she is as well . ||| kuri iki kihae abanyarwanda turahindutse . n' uwakagize icyo akumarair , uvuga uti @: wenda tuvugae ndi umurescape nawe uri umurescape ,
i confide in you and you just answer me that those things happen . ||| njyewe nyaza nkubwirae ikibazo nurangiza unbwirae ngo ibyo bigize kutae ? ngo ibyo bibaho . kuko ibyo ngibyo nrabikoze , sibyo ?
this has happened to mebefore ; i approached somebody who i thought could help me , but his advice was that he also studied in similar struggles . @" ||| nragenda nreba umuntu , kandi nzi y' uko afite ko hari icyo yanamarair . yagize kutae ? yangiriye inama aravuga ati @:
that i should also bear with it because in the future i will be fine . ||| " ntawe tuize gutyo , turushye uraumva , nawe ugomba kugira kutae ? ugomba kujyenda ukaiga ukaruha ukagira kutae ?
and after telling me all that , i asked him @: "@ you actually know me and there is nothing i am hiding from you ; in fact you knew my family . ||| ariko nyuma ubuzima buzaza . @" mu by' ukuri arabinbwiye . noneho nnjyae nramubwira muby' ukuri ko unzi , uraumva ?
how can you be the one to tell me to go to school without a pen or anything ? @" ||| ko ntaho nkukinze , ko famille yanjye uri uyizi , uraumva ? ukagombye kunbwira ngo njyende nigae ,
i asked him if he has ever seen a person who goes to dig without a hoe . ||| noneho nta karamu nta n' iki , mbese nramubwira umuntu ajya kuhinga nta n' isuka afite ?
"@ can n't you get me even a pen that costs 50rwf or even a kasuku [ the cheapest exercise book ] ? @" ||| ese ungairiye impuhwe ukampa bic ya 50 cyangwa ukampa na kasuku , uraumva ? ntabwo ngira ?
so he told me that @: "@ it seems you have come to give me problems and yet i have n't solved mine . @" ||| arangije uzi ukuntu yanbwiye , ngo nraumva uje kuntura ibibazo nnjyae n' ibyanjye ntabishoboye . kuva icyo kihae njyewe nrabiibuka nbimubwiye 98 .
from then , i remember it was in 1998 , i decided never to tell anyone my problems . ||| kuva icyo kihae , ntabwo yigeze , ntabwo nongeye kuvaaga ngo njyewe ngo ngiye kugira uwo nbwira ibibazo .
i sat down and decided to pray to god . ||| njyewe nraicaye nravuga nti nzasenga imaan ,
i decided that if god found it worthy to help me , then we would get help . ||| imaan nibona ko ari ngombaw izajya ibikora . kandi nibona ko atari ngombaw ,
if he did n't then ... of course god knows why we survived among all those who were killed , it was n't because we were so precious not even because we were holy . ||| nayo izi icyo yadushigarije , ijya kutusiga kugirango abandi tugiye kupfa ntabwo tubarushaaga ubwiza cyangwa ntitubarushaaga kukiranuka ? noneho ngenda nda ,
therefore , i believe god knows us and he is watching . ||| noneho nkazajya ngira ikiizerae cy' iki ? nti imaan iratuzi , iratureba , aho kugira ngo ubwirae umwana w' umuntu akusekae ,
instead of telling a son of man who will not help me and who may even laugh at me , i just keep silent . ||| agirae kutae ? akuvebe , agirae kutae , nkicecekair .
there is a time i reach my worst moments where i think about working as a housemaid for someone because i do n't think there is any other job that i can get . ||| nkagira nko muri cas mbi ( ibihe bigoye ) nkavuga nti @: ubusae alisa ngendae noneho njyae kusaba akazi wenda nk' ahantu wenda tuvugae , jyae nk' ahantu nshakishae n' umuntu nti @: nsabair akazi wenda ngendae mbe umuboyi ko nruzi nak' ubuplanto ntawakampa cyangwa iki !
but later , when i think about waking up at 5:00am and all those struggles , i say no ! ||| nkabireba noneho nkaicara nkatekereza , njyewe nzajya nbyuka saa cumi n' imwe ngendae njyae kukora jyae kugira kutae nti wapi , nti ibyo ntinbishobora nti nnjyae turi tubatunze ariko ntinshobora kujya kukira tutae ,
i can not work as a house girl yet we used to have them at home . ||| jyae kujya kuba umuboyi w' ahantu .
i think about such things when life has become very hard on me . ||| ubwo biba bigenze kutae ? bigeze muri bwa buzima , bubunri noneho ntazi ukuntu bumeze .
and my cousins can n't stop asking me what they should do , but i keep on telling them to calm down that the future is promising . instead of telling people our problems , we simply sleep . at times it 's not only a problem of food ; finding firewood can also be stressful . because you need firewood or charcoal to cook , a jelly @- can of water costs 20rwf therefore , be it water or any other things , life still becomes so hard . ||| ubwo arangije ... nrangije ubwo mbese nkabigenza gutyo , nanone ba bana bakaza bakabwira ati @: "@ ubusae alisa turabigenze kutae ? @"@ nnjyae nkababwira nti @: mwikarume , inberae hari ibiiza , mbese aho kugira ngo ugendae ubwirae ikibazo umuntu runaka uyu n' uyu , ahubwo gira kutae muihorerae rekatwiryamire , tukiryamair . bukacya ubwo ukasanga ubuzima bugize kutae ? ufite ikibazo cy' inki ? s' ukuvuga ngo n' ikibazo cy' imiraire kusa . uba ukeneye n' urukwi rwo kucana . ubwo n' iki ? n' amakara , urabiumva neza , ijerekani igura 20 , ukasanga ari imivomere ari iki , byose ukasanga n' iki ? n' ibibazo . ukibaza .
i would like to ask you as a child who lives alone and as a child who has a lot of responsibilies , we all can see that it was n't your own choice , it is because you lost your parents when you were very young and in turn , you were left with responsibilities . ||| nanone nkubaze , nk' umwana wibana , ufashe responsabilites uri mutoya , nrabireba kandi ntabwo ,
what main challenges do you have as an orphan who is responsible for other children ? ||| ni ukubura uko mbese bigenda no kuba urabuze ababyeyi , ibibazo byo kuba urafashe responsabilites biraumvikana . uraumva ibintu bikugoye kurusha ibindi mubuzima urimo bw' ubupfubyi ndetse no kuba uri responsable w' abana wunva ari nk' ibiki ?
what else is a challenge to you ? ||| uraumva ikikugoye ,
you told me that getting food is the first problem . ||| unbwiye uti @: kurya birakugora , icyo nicya mbere .
do n't you have any other problem ? ||| nta kinri ukaongeraho ?
given all your problems . ||| noneho ukurikije ibyo bibazo byose ufite ,
do you find it possible to reconciliate with those who caused them to you ? ||| wunva hari ubwiyunge bushobora kuiyunga n' abagiye bateye ibi bibazo byose ,
i mean the killers who murdered your parents and caused you all these responsibllities at an early age . ||| nravuga mbese bariya bicanyi batwaye ababyeyi bawe , bakatuma uba responsable w' ibintu , wunva ushobora kubiihanganair ukaiyunga nabo ?
but if a person who committed a crime against me asked me to forgive him when he is really sorry , i can forgive him , but since i do n't know him , my heart is divided on the issue . ||| jyewe umuntu unkoreye icyaha , aje akansaba imbabazi , kandi azikuye ku mutaima , nmubabarira .
tell me ! ||| ariko mukihae ntawe nzi , ndi hagati .
what would you do ? ||| ese ,
would you forgive him or ... sincerely if i knew him and he was ready to ask for forgiveness , i would forgive him . ||| nmubabarira , nbigenza kutae ? ariko jyewe muzi ,
and if he were not ready to ask for forgiveness , then he would continue to serve his sentence . ||| yansaba imbabazi akazihabwa cyangwa se atazisaba akakomeza akahanaw . kuko ubundi bajya bavuga ngo ubundi "@ uwicishijwe icyuma nawe agomba kuicishaw ikindi @"@ . sibyo ?
normally it is a said that ; he who killed using a sword should die by the sword , but since that saying was not obeyed then i can just forgive him . ||| iki kihae ababyeyi banjye baba bakiriho wenda banagize . ariko nawe , kuko ntavuga ngo bagendae bamwice n' ubundi ntabwo biriho , nmubabarira .
i would like to ask you another question @: what advice can you give to ... well , it is true you have a very big problem in fact a heavy one however , there are children who have the same problem as you and they are many . you who have the problem of looking after orphans yet you are also an orphan , there is a kind of life you know and you know how to survive through it . what kind of advise can you give to people with such problems ? ||| ubundi se , ngira ngo nkubaze akandi kabazo . ubona , ni iyihe nama , urabona y' uko , ufite ikibazo , yego n' ubwo ukifite kandi kikomeye , ariko nka babanri muba muri kumwe nabo , urabizi nka hariya mu bana ba pnud nabo bahura n' ibyo bibazo bikomeye , abo muhuje ibibazo ni benshi , ibyo ari byo byose nkamawe mufite icyo kibazo cyo kuba murera imfubyi kandi namwe murizo mufite imyaka mikeya , mukiri aba mineur . ibyo aribyo byose hari ubuzima uzi wunva ndetse n' ukuntu ugenda ubwigobotora ubwigobotora , ni iyihe nama uha abantu bafite nk' ibyo bibazo ?
are you talking about orphans or any other people who have such problems ? ||| nk' abana b' imfubyi bibana ? cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese uba wunva afite ikibazo ?
orphans . ||| nk' abana b' imfubyi bibana ,
what advice can you give them , so that they can be able to lighten the cross they are bearing ? ||| ni nk' iyihe nama ubagira kugira ngo barebae ukuntu bagenda bigobotora amagorane n' imisaraba barimo ?
for example @: i am a student , i have to be happy with being a student and be happy even though i had nothing to eat for dinner . ||| ukavuga tuvugae nkanjyae ndi umunyeshuri , nyuzwe y' uko ndi umunyeshuri , nkanyuraw y' uko nnaburaye .
if i was not contented with what i have ... i believe you know what most children do ? ||| kuko iyo nza kuba ntanyuzwe wenda n' uko ndi cyangwa n' iki ? abana benshi murabizi , bajya mu muhanda bakagenda bakaiyandarika bakagira kutae . kubera iki ?
they get to the streets and misbehave , why ? ||| ntabwo baba banyuzwe . baravuga bati njyewe ndi mpfubyi , uraumva , ntawe ngira nbwira noneho reka njyewe ngirae kutae ,
because they are not happy with what they have , they say ; "@ i am an orphan who has no one to listen to my problems @" so , they go to the streets and involve themselves in prostitution and end up getting infected with hiv @/@ aids which in now an epidemic . ||| ngendae jyae kuiyandarika . ukasanga aragiye araiyandaritse ntanyuzwe n' uko ari , akuyemo n' iki ? akuyemo na sida .
but if you are happy with the little you have and are content with who you are , the rest will come slowly . ||| kuri iki kihae noneho uzi yuko nicyo cyorezo noneho kiteye . ariko uyo unyuzwe ukanyura n' ukuri ukanyuraw n' ubuzima bwawe , kuko byose byose biza buhoro .
what advise can you give to your fellow rwandans since , as you can see , your testimony will be kept ? ||| mu rwego rwo kuanzura , wunva icyagirira abanyarwanda ,
remember that we said we are going to keep your testimony in the "@ national archive @" it will be well kept and you will see it . ||| kuko urabona y' uko ubuhamya bwawe buzabikwa tukubwiye ko buzajyanaw muri archive national .
if you are lucky to one day have kids , they will be able to see it , plus those you are looking after . ||| buzabikwa uzabureba nunagira amahirwe yo kuzagira abana , n' abana bawe baburebae n' abo urera baburebae ,
all will be able to listen to your advice , which , you have given based on your lifetime experience . ||| baumvae inama n' impanuro ubahaye , ukurikije ibyo unyuzemo n' inyigisho mbese ugiye ukuramo nawe kuburyo bitumye nawe utanga inama zihagije . wunva hari ikindi kintu ukaongeraho ,
what other advice can you give that will be of help to those who will listen to your testimony ? ||| kishobora kuzagirair akamaro ku bazabureba ?
well , if all rwandans were united , we could find a way to prevent genocide from happening again in rwanda . ||| kigirair mbese ... mbese ubundi njyewe icyo nkaongeraho . mu by' ukuri n' uko abanyarwanda tuesae mbese tushyize hamwe . ni uko tureba ukuntu genocide itazaongera kugaruka mbese mu rwanda .
we should be united and love one another . ||| tukashyira hamwe mbese tukashakisha nk' urukundo hagati yacu , tukakundana , turangiza mbese urareba mbese intambara zaikunze kugenda ziza ,
i believe you have noticed how wars have been intervening but lucky enough they are stopping . ||| abacengezi , cyangwa iki ? ariko murareba ko bitangiye kugenda bigira kutae ? bioroha .
in fact there is peace and security . ||| ariko muby' ukuri , nrebye nbona amahoro nta kibazo . ubungubu , ikibazo twebwe ubundi tuba twifitiye ,
the main problem i have or even others encounter nowadays is the problem of surviving . ||| jyewe nkanjyae , nkanjyae alisa , cyangwa nk' abandi , ikibazo umuntu afite muri iki kihae tugezemo n' ikimibereho mbese twebwe ,
those who are well off spread rumours of wars . ||| ubundi ibyo kuvuga ngo intambara izaba , umuntu ajya kuvuga ngo niyo ntiambara izaba , ariko yagize kutae ? ariko yahaze ,
but poor alice how can i know about such things yet i am struggling for something to eat for a day ? ||| yagize kutae . nkanjyae alisa niba izajya ku , njyewe se nbibwiraw n' iki se ? nba nibereye ku kibazo cy' imibereho nyine .

i only wanted to live with my grandfather ; my grandfather was the person whose company i enjoyed the most . ||| njyewe ubundi nkundaaga kubaan na sogokuru .
i reached an extent of refusing to go to school just because i wanted to stay with my grandpa . ||| kubera ko mu bantu bose numvaaga nishimaiye kubaan nabo nbanaaga ... numvaaga sogokuru ariwe nbana nawe cyane . ku buryo n' amashuri nri nranze kuyiga nshaka kumusanga ,
i moved in with him and we lived together . ||| nragenda nbana nawe .
when my parents realized that i did n't want to live with them , they let me go to my grandpa 's . ||| eh mu rugo bamaze kubona yuko ntahashaka kuhaba nshaka kuibanair na sogokuru , baranreka nbana nawe .
i was happy because he had cattle and i would spend the whole day with him grazing the cows . ||| kubera ko we yarafite inka , nkajya niriraanw nawe nragiye .
later , he started to narrate me stories of the past . sometimes he would give me examples of some of our neighbours who were still alive . ||| nyuma akajya anbwira amateka ya kera , akampa exemples [ ingero ] z' abantu turi tuturanye n' ubu bamwe barahari , umusaza umwe arahari .
he told me how in 1959 they would come and loot their properties ; take their cows , kill them ... kill their cows , sometimes eat them or take the rest . ||| akajya atubwira ukuntu muri ... kuhera muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , ukuntu bazaaga bazaaga bakabasahura , bakabatwarair inka , bakabica ,
but during those days they did n't used to kill people , it was rare . ||| bakica inka bakazirya izindi bakazitwara , amazu bakayasenya ariko kuica nk' umuntu ntabwo bibagaho , nago bakundaaga kubikora .
he used to tell it to me live ... ! ||| aka binbwira gutyo ampa urugero rw' umusaza umwe turi tuturanye witwa nshaka .
he also gave me another example of a man called nshaka who was our neighbour and i think he was arrested after the war and released because he was aged . ||| n' ubu arahari ngirango n' intambara iba nyuma baje kumufunga , baraongera baramufungura kubera ko ashaje .
there were other children at grandpa 's ; they were his sister 's grandchildren . therefore , they were his grandchildren too . ||| ubundi kwa ba sogokuru hakaba hari abandi bana ba ... b' abuzukuru ba nyi ... ni mushiki wa sogokuru abuzukuru be .
they are the ones we used to be together . ||| nibo nkundaaga kuba ndi kumwe nabo ,
only one of them survived , the rest died . ||| umwe niwe ukiriho abandi bose barapfuye .
we used to play together on the streets . ||| niwe tuirirwaanaga ku muhanda tuikinair ,
what i talked about is my life before the war . ||| ibyo nvuze ni ubuzima bwanjye bwa mbere y' intambara .
i did n't know much , i was simply interested in grazing cows , eating and playing on the streets . ||| ibyinshi nta nubwo nri nbizi njyewe kuko ni ... numvaaga ibinshimaishije ari ukuiragirair inka kusa , no kuirirwa nikinair ku muhanda .
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana .
yes . ||| yee ,
i remember it was in 1991 ... between the year 1991 and 1992 . ||| ubwo ... nrabiibuka nraumva hari mu ... muri mirongo cyenda na rimwe [ 1991 ] , hagati ya mirongo cyenda na rimwe [ 1991 ] na mirongo cyenda na kabiri [ 1992 ] .
i was coming from grazing the cattle , i remember i had fought with nshaka 's kids who were also looking after cows . ||| ubwo nri nvuye kuragira , ariko no muri icyo kihae nri nrwanye n' abandi bashumba , n' abana be b' uwo musaza mbese witwa nshaka .
when he asked me why i fought with them , i told him they had hit a cow with a stick in the ears . ||| nraza kubera ko ngiraaga amahane anbajije icyatumye nrwana nabo , mubwira ko bakubise inka inkoni mu matwi .
and when they hurt the cow , i had to fight them . ||| bayibabaje nrwana nabo .
we never used to hit cows ; we would just caress them while saying soft words and the cow would go where you want it to go . ||| kuko ntabwo ... ntabwo turakirizaaga ... ntabwo tukubitaaga inka , ushaka uzikoraagaho gutya uzikabukira kugirango zigendae ,
we never used to beat them because almost all cows were peaceful . ||| kuzikubita ntabwo bibaga ... ntabwo ukundaaga kuzikubita , nta n' inka zagiraaga amahane zabaga zirimo .
so , when i faught and after telling grandpa all that , he decided to tell me all about his past . ||| nrwanye nabo rero , ngeze mu rugo nbimubwiye , ahita anbwira noneho n' amateka ye ,
i did n't know it then . ||| ibyo ntabyo nrinzi icyo kihae .
he gave me another example of how one time they came to loot them and they refused to live the house . ||| anbwira amateka ye , ampa urugero rw' ukuntu noneho bigeze kuza kubasahura , baje kubasahura mu nzu baanga kuyivamo ,
the same nshaka was leading thea group of attachers and when they reached our home ... i guess he told me that it was in the year 1973 ; they came to my grandpa 's house , grandpa told them that he was not going to leave the house . ||| uwo nshaka akaba yari afite igitero ayoboye icyo kihae , bahageze [ ndi kaumva yarabwiye ko muri cyo kihae ko hari mirongo irindwi na gatatu ] . bigeze mu rugo ababwira ko atari buvae mu nzu ,
"@ maybe you burn me inside @"@ , he told them . ||| ababwira ko bari buyimutwikiraemo .
therefore , they took away cows and his harvest since he had refused to get out of the house . ||| noneho barangije batwara inka n' imyaka barayitwara , kubera ko yari yanze kusohoka ,
they did not burnt him , they just left him there in the house and took everything . ||| baanga kumutwika , inzu bayimusigamo baraigendera , ariko ibintu barabitwara .
from then , i started developing hatred towards them . i started hating even the people who were looking after his cows . ||| kuva icyo kihae rero nnjyae nibwo numvaishije noneho nrushijeho kubaanga . kuko kuhera icyo kihae nnjyae na ... ntangiye kungana n' abashumba be ,
i would n't want to come close to them and whenever i would see their cows , i would feel like hitting them to death . ||| nkaumva ntashaka ku ... no kubaegera nbona n' inka yabo nkaumva nyikubita nkanayica .
when was that ? ||| icyo kihae hari nka ryari ?
it was around 1992 . ||| icyo nbikora hari muri [ 1992 ] .
why would you do that ? ||| kuki ukunda kubikora ?
i ... i loved my grandpa so much , i can not explain it . ||| njyewe ... ubundi njyewe nkundaaga sogokuru cyane ,
maybe because he used to give me total freedom . ||| ntiunbaza ngo ni iyihe mpamvu . impamvu nini igaragara ni uko njyewe yampaga liberte .
there was a place that used to be close to the main road , i used to like sitting there at the road . ||| hari ahantu haegereye noneho umuhanda wa kaburimbo , nkakunda kuigira ku muhanda .
and again he would let me graze the cattle while at home they would want me to just sitting there . ||| kandi akampa n' uburenganzira nkajya k wiragirira , mu kihae mu rugo ho usangaaga bashaka ko nirirwa mu rugo nicaye mu rugo .
yet there were no kids to play with . ||| nta n' abandi bana bahabaaga muri ... turi tuturanye tuumvikanaaga ngo njyae kukina nabo .
generally , i used to like my grandpa 's place . i was happy there . ||| ukasanga mbese nikundira kwa sogokuru kuko nbanaaga ariho nbonaaga hanshimaishije .
your grandfather died ? ||| sogokuru yarapfuye ?
my grandfather died . ||| sogokuru ? yarapfuye .
from your point of view , when do you think change occurred in your life ? ||| noneho wowe ku bwawe imibereho ubona yarahindutse ryari ,
when did you notice the changes ? ||| ubonye ibintu bihindutse ryari ?
i ... normally i did n't ... whenever i would see such things , i would never understand what it meant . ||| njyewe , ubundi na ... niyo nbibonaaga gutyo ntabwo nmenyaaga ibyo aribyo ,
because i used to enjoy it myself . ||| kuko nnjyae nrabiishimiraaga ,
whenever i would see the militias coming ... we never used to call them interahamwe . ||| nbonaaga interahamwe zije ... icyo kihae nta n' ubwo tuzaitaaga interahamwe .
there were political parties such as m.d.r but at the time , in shyorongi commune , i only knew of m.r.n.d. because i would hear them animating , singing loudly ... it 's only in 1993 that i understood they were political parties and why they were created . ||| kuko yari amashyaka za m.d.r. icyo kihae hari hariho m.d.r. ariko njyewe i shyorongi [ commune ] icyo nri nzi ni ... yari m.r.n.d , [ ishyaka rya politike ] niyo nbonaaga cyane kubera no kunima [ kushyushya urugamba ] bakaririmba cyane , mbese ni muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] ntangiye kumenya amashyaka icyo aricyo , impamvu ariho ,
when i would hear of inkotanyi , i thought of them in a negative way because i believed what was said about them . ||| ariko nkaumva inkotanyi nkaumva ... nnjyae nkazifata uko babivuga . ntabwo nnjyae nri nzi ikibazo cyabyo . uretse ko icyo kihae bitangira muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] ,
i was not aware of what was coming next . ||| hajeho amashyaka ,
in 1993 my grandfather told me they might have resumed their mission , the one they had in 1959 and 1973 . @" ||| nibwo sogokuru yongeye kunbwira yuko bashobora kuba baongeye ya gahunda yabo , bari barimo muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , na mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] ;
i would think that ... he did n't think people would kill others . ||| noneho njyewe nkaumva ... nawe yari aziko ko ari nta muntu ushobora kuica undi .
we thought it would be as usual ; taking cows , looting properties , demolishing houses and that would be all . ||| akaumva ko ari bya binri byo kuza bakabatwarair inka , bakabasahura bakabasenyair amazu bikashira .
i never thought that the things that took place here in 1994 would happen . i was really surprised . ||| mbese nnjyae ntabwo nri nzi ko bino bintu bibaye muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] bishobora kubaho .
i did n't have a clue . ||| ni ibintu nnjyae bintunguye ntabwo nbizi .
how did it start ? how did it start in 1993 ... ? ||| bihindutse bite ... bitangiye bite muri za mirongo cyenda na gatatu ...
in 1993 in shyorongi , i was ... we were living in one part ... it was like one part of the cell . ||| muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] i shyorongi , kuko ariho na rinri , turi tutuye muri quartier [ mu kacae ] imwe , urebye ni nka partie [ igice ] imwe ya serile ,
all our relatives were living in that area . ||| uko imiryango yacu ifitanye amasano yose yari ituye hamwe .
there was a road from gisenyi and ruhengeri going to kigali . ||| ariko ku muhanda hanyuraaga imodoka zivuye i gisenyi , mu ruhengeri , baje inaha i kigali .
people would pass waving flags , seated on top of mini buses ... in our neighbourhood , there never used to be much people ... the only people that used to be there were that old man 's family . ||| bafite amabendera , bagenda hejuru y' amabisi ... muri quartier [ muri ako kacae ] nabwo harimo abantu , abenshi bari famille y' uwo musaza .
that old man also had a very big family . ||| kuko uwo musaza nawe yari afite famille [ umuryango ] nini cyane ,
if one said that there were only two families in that area , one would be almost true . ||| ku buryo nk' uwabasha kuvuga ko serile yari ikizawe na famille y' abantu ... y' imiryango ibiri ntabwo ... ngirango ntiyaba yibeshye .
almost everyone was related to that old man called nshaka and the rest were related to my grandfather . ||| usangaaga ari iyo famille [ uwo muryango ] abantu bose bafitanye isano n' uwo musaza witwaga nshaka , abandi bafitanye isano na sogokuru ,
that was the only type of people you would find there . ||| ukasanga ari ubwo ... ubwo bwoko bw' abantu kusa bahari ...
which cell was that ? ||| iyo serile yari iyihe ?
it was called nyarurama . ||| ni nyarurama .
... then later , i would see people going to shyorongi stadium , which was called nyakabingo . ||| .... noneho nyuma , nkajya nbona abantu bajya muri stade y' i shyorongi harimo stade yitwa nyakabingo .
even people from other sectors would go there and dance and drink and then later they would go home . ||| bakabyinairyo , hakaba n' andi ma secteur yazaaga kakabyinairmo bakanywa bakataha .
me too , i would go there to dance because i used to like it . ||| ariko nnjyae nragendaaga nyine nnjyae nkajya kuibyinair nkagenda ... nnjyae numvaaga binshimaishije .
although i would go to dance , i could see that some people in my family were not happy with it . ||| ariko uretse yuko ... uko njyaagayo bakabona nbiishimaiye nbonaaga mu muryango nkabona n' ababiishimaiye na bamwe ,
i would sense something but it would be so unclear to me . ||| nkabona harimo akantu ariko njyewe simbyiteho ,
later in ... 1993 when i really knew what political parties were . the year was ending , i remember i was in primary three and that is when i quit school . ||| simenye ibyo aribyo . bigeze muri ... nraumva icyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] aribwo amashyaka nyamenye neza . umwaka ujya kurangira , kuko icyo kihae nigaaga mu wa gatatu primaire ,
i just stopped studying . ||| mpita nreka kuiga nraiicarair nraiicarair nrabiihorera .
i remember there was a war but the war had n't reached our area . ||| icyo kihae hari hariho n' intambara , ariko yari itaragera ino aha ,
we used to hear that there is a war in ruhengeri and byumba . ||| tuumvaaga ko ibera mu ruhengeri n' i byumba kusa .
why did you stop studying ? ||| kuki uvuye mu ishuri ?
well at school , even my teacher was my relative . ||| bon , jyewe aho nigaaga n' umwarimu utuigishaaga yari mwene wacu .
but i used to hate being beaten ... one time i went to school late , and when i was caned i just walked out of school and to hell ! ||| ariko nkanga kukubitaw ... ngiye ku ishuri rimwe nraza nza nkererewe ankubise mpita nisohokair nva mu ishuli nraigendera . pu ,
i did n't see any importance of studying . ||| mpita nvuga ko no kuiga nta nakamaro bifite ,
even my grandpa had never gone to school and when i told him about it , he never had any reaction . ||| kuko na sogokuru ntiyari yarize . nawe kubimubwira nawe numvaaga nta kintu bimubwiye nnjyae kuiga mpita mbi ... nrabireka .
therefore , i stopped studying . ||| maze kubireka mpita niicarair .
from then , i did n't go back to school . ||| ndi kaumva nta ... kuva uwo munsi nta n' ubwo nongeye kusubira mu ishuli ,
i went back to school only after the war . ||| nrisubiyemo nyuma y' intambara .
did you go back in 1994 , immediately after the war . ||| usubiyemo muri mirongo cyenda na kane ikirangira ...
no . i went back in 1996 . ||| oya ngiyemo muri mirongo cyenda na gatandatu [ 1996 ] .
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana .
i went there ... i completed primary during the school year 1995-1996 . ||| ngiyemo ... nize umwaka wa gatatu 1995-1996 .
why did you go back to school ? ||| ni iyihe mpamvu usubiye mu ishuri ?
they told me to go back to school because they realised that there was nothing else i could do with my life . ||| nyuma banshubije mu ishuli kuberako babonaaga nta bunri buzima . kandi nta n' ikindi kintu nri kukora ,
i was n't mature enough to look for a job . ||| si nri ndi umuntu mukuru ngo hari akandi kazi nkora ,
i just went to school up to now . ||| nraje nraiga nyine kugeza ubu .
tell me how the war ... how did you face 1994 personally ? ||| nbwira ukuntu iby' intambara bya ... ubibonye utae muri 1994 wowe ?
well , when the war started ... personally i used to like soldiers very much . ||| bon . intambara itangira , mbese njyewe ubundi nkundaaga abasirikare cyane .
but ... during the first months of the year 1994 , i had an uncle , he was my mum 's brother ; he was a son to the big brother of my grandpa [ in kinyarwanda , cousins whose fathers are brothers are considered as brothers and sisters ] . ||| yee , ariko ... ubwo ngubwo mu mezi ya mbere y' umwaka w' 1994 , nri nfite musaza wa mama wo kwa data ... wo kwa sogokuru wacu , mbese ni mukuru wa sogokuru .
he had joined the inkotanyi army . ||| yari yaragiye mu nkotanyi .
many people used to come saying , "@ in your family , some people joined the inkotanyi . @" ||| noneho abantu benshi bakajya baza bavuga ngo , ngo @: "@ imiryango yacu ngo harimo abantu bagiye mu nkotanyi ,
even me , whenever i would hear of inkotanyi i would imagine that they were very bad people . ||| " ariko nnjyae nkaumva inkotanyi nkaumva ari abantu babi ,
generally , i would hate the inkotanyi so much . ||| mbese nnjyae inkotanyi nkaumva ndazanze neza .
due to the way they would talk of inkotanyi , i also would believed that inkotanyi were very bad . ||| kuko bitewe n' ukuntu bazivugaaga numvaaga nnjyae koko inkotanyi zishobora kuba ari mbi .
one night we came back and while i was sleeping with my grandpa , i asked him , "@ why are we hidding all the time ? @" then he told me , "@ you remember what i once told you . ||| noneho rimwe noneho tuje nijoro , nraraanye na sogokuru nramubaza nti @: « se kubera iki turi kukomeza kuihisha ?
they have resumed it , but this time it is even worse . @" ||| arambair ati @: « bimwe byose nkubwiraaga bibaye urya munsi , ubungubu nibyo baongeyeho , uretse ko noneho buno bifite ingufu . »
i immediately understood that the looting of people 's properties , the killing of cows and the destruction of houses was about to happen . ||| mpita menya noneho ubwongubwo nyine ari ukusahura ibintu ; bakica inka bakazirair izindi bakazijyana bakasenya amazu . bon ,
well , around the 12th of april ... my uncle [ mum 's brother ] had married a hutu lady ... her brothers took her with her kids and said that the rest should be killed . ||| noneho bigeze nko ku italiki ya 12 z' ukwezi kwa kane . nibwo musaza wa mama uri ufite umugore ... yari afite umugore , w' umuhutu basaza be baraza baramufata , baramutwara n' abana babyaraanye ,
they took them all on that day ; a troop came and took them all . ||| baravuga ngo @: « ubundi abandi bagomba kuicwa . » umunsi babafashe babajyanye bose . baje baba ... hahise haza igitero kiraza kirabatwara .
i left for butamwa at home . ||| ubwo njyewe nhise nvamo nraigendera . nrabacika . nigair i butamwa mu rugo .
i left thinking that maybe things were safer back home . ||| ngiye kureba y' uko ... nvuga nti hano buno ... ahangaha niko bigenze buriya iwa ... mu rugo nta kibazo .
but when i reached there ... i was shocked . i did not find a single person there ; the house was widly open with no one inside . ||| ariko mpageze ... noneho nkubaiswe n' inkuba mpageze nta muntu n' umwe nhasanze . nsanze inzu zirangaye . nrebye mu nzu nbura umuntu .
it was around 6:00 o'clock in the evening , i looked for them but i never found anybody . ||| hari nka saa kumi n' ebyiri . nshaka umuntu nramubura .
as i was still ... i went to grandma because it was not far from there but when i reached there i did not find anyone neither . ||| mu kihae nki ... nrazamuka ngiye kwa nyogokuru kubera ko nanyogokuru turi tuturanye , mpageze nbura umuntu .
i went back home . ||| nraongera nramanuka .
since it was on the hill , i had to descend . ||| kubera ko ari ku gasozi gutya nramanuka mpageze hepfo ,
i heard people , ... people who were maybe from attacking some place ... maybe they were across the hill ; i could n't tell where they were from . ||| niba ari abantu ... abantu bari ... niba bari hakurya , niba bari he ? simbizi ,
they came running ; i heard a crowd of people and it was getting dark . ||| bahita baza biruka . numva igitero cy' abantu ubwo hari hatangiye kwira .
when i heard people making a lot of noise , i climbed a mango tree and sat there . ||| numvise abantu basakuza mpita nurira igiti cy' umwembe , niicarair mu giti .
they came and went around the house and entered inside but they did n't find anybody . ||| ba bantu baraza bazenguruka inzu , bajyamo inberae , bashaka umuntu baramubura .
then they started saying , "@ they 've gone to hide , they will come back in the night or maybe someone else has already taken them . @" ||| noneho bahita batangira bavuga bati @: « ubu ngubu bagiye kuihisha bari bugarukae nijoro , cyangwa hariho abandi bantu babajyanye . »
from then , i got the confirmation that my people were still alive . ||| ubwo ngubwo nhise menya yuko wenda batarapfa .
then i thought , "@ they have n't died yet , maybe they are hidding somewhere . @" ||| nravuga nti @: buriya ntabwo barapfa wenda hari ahantu bari .
as i was still in the tree , at night , at about 7:30 p.m. ... i got hungry and started eating mangos . ||| mu kihae nkaicaye aho ngaho mu giti , nijoro hamaze kuba nka ... nka saa moya n' igice , n' inzara yari inyishe , mu giti harimo imyembe nifatair umwembe ndirair .
when i finished the first one i grabbed the second one . ||| nrangije uwa mbere nfashe uwa kabili ,
i suddenly heard someone coming through the banana plantation . ||| numva umuntu ari kuzamuka mu rutoki .
immediately i ... i left the mango waited to see who it was . ||| mpita ... noneho nrawureka ntaceceka ngo numvae .
the i found out it was grandma . ||| ngiye kubona nbona ni nyogokuru uzamutse ,
therefore , i came down the tree and greeted her . ||| noneho nramanuka nda ... nramusuhuza .
she was very surprised to see me alive . ||| arangije nawe agira ubwoba cyane ukuntu nba nkiriho ,
and she told me that , even the others were still alive . ||| aranbwira ati @: « n' abandi barahari , »
then she took me to ... there was a place where they used to mine cassiterite , in deep holes and that is where they used to live ; they would spend the whole day in those holes and come out at night when they were going to sleep . ||| araza anjyana ahantu ... hari ahantu bacukuraaga gasegereti , mu myobo yo hasi mu butaka , biberaaga ... bagendaaga bakairirwamo bakaza nijoro baje kuryama .
after showing me where they were , we went home to sleep at night . ||| noneho ubwo ngubwo anyereka ahantu bari , nijoro ubwo ngubwo turaza turaryama .
the following day , as we were preparing to live at 3:00 ... in fact , we used to go home to sleep at 3 a.m. and then at 4:00 a.m. we would go back to the holes to hide . ||| uwo munsi ... umunsi ukurikiyeho , tuje nka ... tugiye kugenda saa cyenda . kuko turazaaga tukaryama saa cyenda ... saa kumi , zagera tukahita tuongera tukasubira muri ya myobo .
immediately they found out that we would hide and come back to sleep , a very big group of killers came , the people who were in that attack were our neighbours , we were living in the same cell . ||| ubwo ngubwo haza ... ako kanya bari bamenye ko tugenda tukihisha tukaongera tukagaruka . hahita haza urutero runini cyane , abantu bari barimo ni abantu turi tuturanye ahongaho . bo muri ... turi tuturanye muri iyo serile .
they came and shouted . ||| baraza bavuza induru , barahafata ... baratuzenguruka ,
they surrounded the whole house and soon after all doors were open . ||| noneho bamaze kutuzenguruka , bari bazengurutse inzu yose ,
dad slammed the door and locked it , they hit it hard and it fell inside ... i had a sister who had been born lame . ||| imiryango yari rangaye papa afata urugi ahita arukurukubitaho . arukinze bararukubita bose rugwa inberae ... kubera nri nfite mushiki wanjye w' ikimuga ,
dad asked her if he could carry her , but she refused . ||| ntabwo yagendaaga , yari yaravutse aremaye ,
and when she refused ... they had ordered us all to get out and while dad was still arguing with them , they beat him up and he just carried the kid on his shoulders . ||| aramubwira ngo amuterurae bagendae aranga . yanze ubwo kubera tuesae bahise batufata baratusohora mu kihae akiburana nabo baramukubita arasohoka afata umwana amushyira ku bitugu .
i was holding a mattress on the head , when they started pushing us forward , saying they were taking us to kill us with others . ||| nri nfite matera ku mutawe , mu kihae bari batangiye kutusunika batushyira inberae , bari kutubwira ngo batujyanae batuicirae hamwe n' abandi ,
they asked us to choose between putting us in a bus and taking us to arusha . ||| ngo batushyira muri ... batubwiraaga ko ngo ari ukutujyana muri bus , batujyana arusha .
that is what i heard but i did n't understand which bus they were talking about . ||| ni gutyo nbiumvaaga njyae ntabwo nrinzi iyo bus icyo aricyo ,
i thought it was a normal bus but i checked around and i did n't see any . ||| numvaaga ko ari bus isanzwe . ariko nreba hafi y' umuhanda ahongaho nkayibura . bon , noneho turangije ,
well as they were still talking , putting people in front , i slightly bent . ||| mu giye bakiri kuvuga ... bakiri kubafata babashyira inberae ,
i was very small , it seemed like i was sleeping under the mattress . ||| njyewe nhise nca bugufi , nri mutoya , matera isa nk' aho ... mbese nsa nkaho nryamye hasi matera injya hejuru .
then , i sneaked away and left the mattress there . ||| mpita nvamo gutyo matera nyisiga ahongaho nrairukanka .
they thought i was under the mattress . ||| noneho bo bagira ngo ndi munsi ya matera ,
i went and hid in the bushes around and when they checked below the mattress , they did n't see anyone . however , they did not mind much about it , they just got confused and left . ||| nyuma nragenda mpita nihisha mubihuru ahongaho , matera barebyemo babura umuntu . ntibabiitaho baraigendera . birabashobera .
until today , i do n't know how they were killed . ||| kuva uwo munsi kugeza ubungubu , ntabwo ntigeze menya ukuntu babaishe .
but i am sure they all died . ||| icyo nzi cyo ni uko nta n' umwe ukiriho .
they took them and then ... in my mind , i could n't think of nothing , neither could i feel anything . ||| barabatwara , bamaze kubajyana , njyewe mu mutawe wanjye nta kintu na kimwe ntekerezaaga , nri meze nk' igiti .
while i was hiding there , [ i can not find the right way of describing how i was feeling ] i sat and thought for a while ... it was around 11:00 a.m. i got out of the bush because there were dogs passing all the time , trained to search for people during the day . ||| nihishe ahongaho nabwo ubundi nbona image [ uko nagushushanyiriza ] nkuha y' ukuntu nri meze . nraicara , ntatekereza hashize umwanya , hari nka ... hari hamaze kuba nka saa tanu z' amanywa ,
i went into a certain hole where we used to spend time and in the evening , at around 7:00 p.m. i left the hole . ||| nvamo muri icyo gihuru , kuko hari imbwa zairirwaaga zihiga abantu ku manywa . nragenda njya mu mwobo umwe tuirirwaagamo , bigijeje ni mugoroba nka saa moya ,
the i thought , "@ if they took my whole family at home , maybe at grandpa 's they are still there . ||| mpita nvamo . nravuga ngo @: buno ubwo hano babajyanye , buriya kwa sogokuru usanga bahari ,
maybe they hid and came back to sleep . @" ||| barikujya kuihisha bakaongera bakagaruka .
when i reached there ... i was very dark almost in the morning , it was at around 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. i found nobody at home [ his grandfather 's home ] and the house had no doors left . ||| noneho mpageze , nhageze nijoro nabwo bwenda kucya nka saa kumi , saa cyenda n' igice gutyo , nsanga nta muntu n' umwe uhari inzugi barazikuyeho ,
i looked for people but i could n't find anyone . ||| nshakisha umuntu nramubura ,
i checked at the road ... i went to look for them at the road but i did n't find them . ||| nreba ku muhanda ... njya ku muhanda nshakisha umuntu nramubura ,
i met soldiers walking around . ||| mpura n' abasirikare bari kuigendera .
there was a lady called francoise who lived in shyorongi . she looked older than her age . ||| noneho hakaba hari umukobwa uri utuye i shyorongi witwaga francoise ubwo yari mutoya nawe uretse ko ubona ari mukuru .
a certain soldier asked me , "@ are n't you francoise 's brother ? @" ||| haza umusirikare araambaza ati @: wowe nturi musaza wa francoise ?
i said "@ yes i am . @" ||| nrikairiza .
then he took me and said that francoise was his friend . ||| ahita anfata aranbwira ati ... anbwira yuko francoise ari inshuti ye .
he took me and then i went to live together with the soldiers . ||| noneho aranfata turajyana tubana nabo mu basirikare ,
later , all the soldiers who were there were taken to jari , where there is a radio antenna . ||| noneho barangije barabafata abasirikare bose bari ahongaho babajyana i jari . hano kuri ... kuri fm [ entenne ya radio ] .
i continued to live with soldiers but i had never seen people being killed ; i thought it was just chaos and that things would change with time . ||| mpageze nraje nbana n' abasirikare , noneho nbona ... nri ntarabona umuntu yica undi . ibyo byose nbonaaga ari akavuyo bigenda bigenda gutyo ,
the following morning , they brought other tutsis people ... the first person i saw being murdered was a lady whom they got and cut with a bayonet ; they cut her neck open and blood spread all over . ||| nta muntu nri nkabona yica undi , noneho mu gitondo bazana abantu ngo n' abatutsi ... kuko ubaw mbere nbona umuntu apfa ni umukobwa bafashe bamukata na bayoneti bamukata gutya iki ikingiki [ ijosi ] kirasama , amaraso atakara hasi .
i was so scared ; it was my first time to witness murder . ||| ngira ubwoba nnjyae ,
i had never seen her before . ||| nibwo bwa mbere nri nbonye umuntu apfa .
she was living in jari but up to now i do n't know her name . i just saw her there but i still remember her today . ||| yapfuye mureba uwo mukobwa ntinri muzi , ariko ni uwo ijari na n' ubu ntinmenya izina rye , nmubonye gutyo uretse ko n' ubu nba nreba image [ ishusho ] ye .
the war went on , the soldiers were fighting against the inkotanyi in the hills . ||| nyuma , noneho bakajya baza kubera ko hari hariho urugamba hari inkotanyi , bakaza bakafata abantu ... interahamwe zairirwaaga mu kigo abasirikare bari inberae barimo kurwana ,
meanwhile , the interahamwe would take local people and kill them in the camp just where there is a football field that used to belong to the state police . ||| zikazaan abantu zikabicira munsi y' ikigo , ahantu hari ikibuga cya jandarumeri .
one evening some cooking oil was brought for the soldiers . ||| habaagamo ikibuga cya jandarumeri . noneho hari abantu bazanye , nrabiibuka ari ni mugoroba , amavuta bari baohereje yo kuteka ... yo kutekair abasirikare .
then they said that , there is no logic in eating good food while their father has died [ president habyarimana ] . ||| baravuga ngo nta mpamvu zo kuyateka , ngo nta mpamvu zo kurya neza , ngo mubyeyi wabo yapfuye . bafata za ngunguru barazi ... ba ... bafata ingururu batekaagamo zose barazicanair ,
then they filled several drums with oil and put them on fire . ||| bashyiramo amavuta . noneho bafata abantu bakajya babanaagamo batoya . abafite taille ntoya bakaba aribo banaagamo .
then they would choose the short tutsis and dump them in it and burnt them alive . ||| bagashya , gutya bakajya bakufataaga bakakujugunyamo ureba . noneho nyuma kuko nbirebaaga ,
i was terrified ! ||| ngira ubwoba .
therefore , i decided to move forward , towards where the war was taking place . ||| mpitamo ngewe kuigira inberae aho urugamba ruberaaga icyo kihae .
when i got there , i did n't know how to move on my stomach like i would see others doing ... when i saw some of the people i was with being shot dead , i decided to go back . ||| mpageze naho kubera ko ntabwo nri nkamenye kugenda nryamye hasi nk' uko nbonaaga abandi babigenzaaga , abo turi kumwe bose nkabona amasasu arabakubise barapfuye , mpitamo kuisubirair inyuma nbona ntacyo .
when i got there there , i found so many kids who had come from their homes in the neighbourhood to join the army . ||| noneho mpageze , icyo hari abana benshi bagiye baturuka mu miryango y' ahongaho hafi ahongaho bakacikair mu gisirikare ,
then some interahamwe came to investigate on all the kids . they picked all the kids , me included . ||| haza interahamwe zije kubareba . noneho zikagenda zijonjoramo abana bose barimo , nnjyae banfatamo . banfashemo ,
since the soldier [ who had taken me there ] was there , he talked on my behalf telling that i do n't come from that area when they were almost taking me . ||| wa musirikare kubera ko yari ahari , bagiye kututwara ,
then some people said that i was born there , that they even knew me . ||| avuga yuko njyewe ntavuka ahongaho . barangije bavuga ko njyewe mpavuka ko banzi .
i remember there was a certain interahamwe who said that he knew me that i was kayiranga 's son but i did n't know who kayiranga was . ||| icyo kihae nrabiibuka ko harimo interahamwe imwe yavuze ngo ndi umuhungu wa kayiranga . kayiranga uwo nguwo ntinmuzi .
he told them that they got me from byumba when the inkotanyi had killed all my parents , and that the refugees had taken me there . ||| noneho arangije aravuga ati @: « bankuye i byumba , inkotanyi ziraishe ababyeyi banjye , ko mbese natoraguwe n' impunzi .
immediately they took me out and took the rest of the kids . ||| bahita bankuramo , abo bana bose barabajyanye .
one kid escaped them but unfortunately , he took off through a place full of land mines and they killed him . ||| ariko harimo umwana umwe ubacitse , uretse ko nawe nta mahirwe yagize yarairukanse aho yanyuze mines ziramwica .
and all the rest were murdered . ||| abandi nabo barapfa . nyuma y' ahongaho nraje nraza ... hari ahantu hari akabande hagati hari ahantu hari akabuga ...
then i left ; there was a small court that was next to the camp before you reach the antenna . ||| ... kameze nk' akabuga uvuye mu kigo , ukagenda ... mbere yuko ugera kuri ziriya antenne , hari harimo ikibuga .
all the people who were caught were burnt there ; they would pour petrol on them while they were standing and they would burn them . ||| bafata abantu bari bahafataiye , babatwikira aho , kuko bo babamennyeho essense baratwika bahagaze .
that was the place where they would train interahamwe how to use guns . ||| ahantu bigishirizaga interahamwe imbunda .
they ordered others to use pickaxes . next to that place is where the local counselor was living ; we would call it ‘ at the counselor 's . @" ||| abandi noneho barababwira ngo bafatae amapiki hafi y' a ... hari ahantu umukonseye yari atuye tuhitaaga kwa konseye ,
but i did n't know him ; i just used to hear that it was at the counselor 's . ||| ubwo niho yari atuye ntinri muzi , numvaaga ngo ni kwa konseye .
they made people dig holes ; once one would dig a pit of his or her height , he or she would enter into the hole and they would just put soil above when someone is still alive . ||| barabacukurair ucukura umwobo umara kugera kushyika uko ungana ukajyamo bakarenzaho igitaka . uri muzima .
meanwhile , some hutu kids who had come from byumba accused me of being a tutsi . ||| noneho bigeze hagati kubera ko harimo abana baturutse i byumba b' abahutu , bamaze ku ... baravuga ngo njyewe ntabwo ndi umuhutu ndi umututsi barabinshinja .
i overheard them saying they were going to call the interahamwes to come and kill me . they went to call them [ the interahamwes ] at night . ||| bajya kuzana interahamwe nijoro , kubera ko bagiye ... babivuze bari mu madirishya ndi kubiumva ko bagiye kuzizana .
in fact , i overheard them saying it through the window . ||| mpita nsohoka . nsohotse banyirukaho n' izindi nterahamwe ziraza zinyirukaho ,
i immediately run away and when i got in the middle of where the inkotanyis and the soldiers i was with were fighting , i sneaked inside the house of the ‘ counsellor ’ of jari . ||| nrairukanka . ngeze ... ndi hafi kugera hafi y' aho inkotanyi zari ziri n' abasirikari ba ... tubanaaga , hari amazu y' uwo mugabo ngo yari konseye w' i jari , ninjiramo .
when i got inside , there were dead bodies all over the place , that 's where they were keeping them . ||| ninjiyemo nsanze ari intumbi kusa zipakiyemo mu buzu , abantu bagiye bica .
since i did n't have anywhere else to go , i hid in the middle of the corpses . ||| nbura aho njya mpita njyamo ... nfata ... njyamo hagati nirenzaho abantu bapfuye .
when they came , they could not see me . ||| nbura ... uko nrimo ahongaho baraza ,
then they closed the door and went . i spent about 4 hours lying down with those corpses . ||| bafungura bakasanga n' intumbi zibereyemo bakaongera bakakinga . uko bi ... uwo munsi ndi kaumva nramazemo amasaha agera nko kuri ane .
then i decided to leave the house after realizing that it was calm . ||| amasaha ane ashize nibwo nvuyemo numvise ntamuntu ukikoma , nvamo nraza .
i stayed in the area where the soldiers were fighting . i would hide at the frontline . ||| noneho nguma hafi y' aho ... aho abasirikari barwanairaga niho nhise nguma , hafi ya terrain ,
and that is where i was staying . ||| aho barasairaga nnjyae akaba ariho nguma .
there was an old woman they had refused to kill ; i used to see her whenever we would be going to harvest fruit , maize and sugarcane . ||| hakaba hari umukecuru uri uhari haruguru y' aho bari baranze kuica . nmunyuraagaho , kuko hari ahantu tusoromaaga amatunda , n' ibigori n' ibisheke ,
i would always take some to her before i would take them to the soldiers . ||| nkamuzanira nawe nkahanyura nkahita nbimanura nkabijyana ahongaho ku ... aho barwanairaga .
they ended up killing her two days before we left the place . ||| uwo musaza nawe ... uwo mukecuru bamwishe hashize ... hasigaye iminsi ibiri ngo tuhavae .
in that area the inkotanyi had blocked the roads used for taking food to the soldiers in the camp . ||| nyuma ahongaho nraza bafata ... kubera ko inkotanyi zari zirafunze inzira izana ibiryo mu kigo ;
when they realized they could no longer get any food or bullets delivery , they decided to leave . ||| ibiryo bibuze , amasasu abuze , bafata decision yuko tuhava .
the following day , we spent the whole day without hearing any shooting until 8:00 p.m. when they told us to leave . ||| mu gitondo tuiriwe ahongaho nta muntu urasa , ni mugoroba nijoro bigejeje nka saa mbiri , baratubwira ngo tugende . turamanuka wa musirikare umwe uri warampfashe ,
as we were going the soldier who had taken me with him had a bag full of money . ||| yari afite igikapu kiuzuye amafaranga . bya bikapu bya gisirikare avuga yuko ayo mafaranga ,
he said he was taking it to francoise ; i mean the francoise who lived in shyorongi . ||| ayashyiriye francoise uwonguwo uwo mukobwa mbese ubaga i shyorongi .
since he had a gun , he went in front of us then i followed him . ||| arangije turamanuka kubera ko ariwe uri uri inberae afite imbunda ,
we bumped into the inkotanyis and he was the first one to be shot dead and everyone else was killed . ||| ageze inberae tugwa mu kicae cy' inkotanyi niwe zabanje kurasa arapfa .
i looked around but i could n't see a single living person , they had all died . ||| bose barapfa nrebye inyuma nbura umuntu nrebye inberae nbura umuntu ,
therefore i sat down to try and pull myself down as i did n't even know where i was . ||| ntinri mpazi nsigara njyenyine none niicarair hasi , kugira nbanzae ntuze menye ahondi n' ahariho .
then ... as i was still sitting at the roadside , a military lorry , which was taking water to the camp , came . ||| arangije mu kihae nkaicayemo ahongaho , haza ikamyo y' abasirikare bagiye ... bajyanye amazi mu kigo ruguru , bahita babona nicaye muri borodire .
they saw me sitting there ; they asked me why i was sitting there yet they had sent me a while ago . ||| baambaza impamvu mpicaye kandi bantumye kare .
then a certain soldier got out and told me to enter the car . that is how i escaped them . ||| umusirikare avamo aranbwira ngo ninurire imodoka tujyane nba nbacitse gutyo .
then in the morning they came and said that my whole family had died and that i was a tutsi too ; they were wondering why i joined the army . ||| noneho mu gitondo baza kuta ... kuvuga yuko na ... hari umu ... ahongaho nba ko umuryango ujyae wose upfuye , kandi ko ndi umututsi nnjyae bibaza impamvu nba mugisirikare .
when they found out details about me , i escaped them and joined the refugees . ||| bamaze kubimenya mpita nbahunga mpita njya mu mpunzi .
when i reached there ... because i had refused to join the refugees whose origin was shyorongi , i joined those from byumba . ||| ngeze mo ... icyo kihae kubera ko ... nanze kujya mu mpunzi zivuka ahongaho , nhise njya mu mpunzi mu zaturutse i byumba .
when they started asking me where i was coming from , i told them that i was coming from byumba and that the inkotanyis had killed both my parents using clubs . ||| mpageze kubera ko zatangiye kunbaza ukuntu ... ubundi aho nturutse , nbabwira ko nturutse i byumba , ariho iwacu , kandi ko papa na mama ari inkotanyi zabaishe zibakubise udufuni .
some women liked me very much and treated me so well . ||| icyo kihae hari harimo abagore barankunda cyane , banfata neza ,
then i joined the refugees who were heading to byumba . ||| noneho ngenda mu mpunzi zigenda i byumba .
i left with the refugees from byumba and some time later , i met a man from butamwa who said he knew me but i denied it . ||| hanyuma ubwongubwo ubwo twagendenaga nazo , nibwo tuje kugera inberae mpura n' umugabo umwe , noneho ukomoka i butamwa . avuga ko anzi .
he insisted saying @: "@ are n't you gatsimbanyi 's son ? @" ||| avuze ko anzi ndamwihakana , akajya anbwira ngo @: "@ nturi uwo kwa kanaka , nturi uwo kwa gatsimbanyi ? @"
"@ which gatsimbanyi ? ||| nti ashwi da , nti na gatsimbanyi simuzi .
i do not even know me ! @" ||| ngo none se ngo @:
"@ are n't you from butamwa , in ruriba ? @" "@ not at all ! @" ||| "@ ntabwo uturuka i butamwa , ngo ntabwo iwanyu ari mu ruriba ? @" nti @:@ oya ,
i went on denying it . ||| nrabihakana .
then one of the ladies who was with me defended me and explained to him that i was from byumba and that both my parents had been killed by the inkotanyis . ||| noneho umugore umwe turi kumwe ahita avuga ngo @: "@ murabeshyera uno mwana ngo ni uw' i byumba , ngo n' iwabo barabaishe ngo n' inkotanyi zabaishe . @" mbese nabo bari barabiemeye ,
they all believed it was true and they treated me as their child . ||| baranfashe nk' umwana wabo .
we went on together ; i think we reached the boarder together . ||| turajyana tugeze ku ... ndi kaumva turageraanye ku mupaka , niho ntandukanaiye nabo ,
that is where i lost sight of them , they disappeared from the crowd . i continued walking with people i did n't know , i did n't know where we were going , it was my first time to take that route . ||| nrababuze . ngenda ngendair mu kigare gutya n' abantu ntazi ahantu bagiye , aho bajyaaga ntinri mpazi , nibwo bwa mbere inzira ntabwo nri nzizi .
when we reached the way ... in the camp , i was sitting by the roadside and there passed a lorry carrying water . ||| ngeze mu nzira , mu nkambi ahongaho ahantu bari bakaambitse nicaye ku muhanda , haza imodoka bafite amazi .
i drunk a bit of it but it tasted too salty ; i had never taken salty water before . ||| noneho nfata amazi nywaho ayo mazi narayanyweye numva arimo umunyu mwinshi . nibwo bwa mbere narinkweye amazi arimo umunyu ,
i developed stomachaches and got diarrhea . it was a red cross car so when they noticed that i got seriously sick , they took me to their hospital . ||| mu nda hararya mpita nrwara diarrhee [ kuhitwa ] . noneho iyo modoka ni aba ... ni iya croix rouge , noneho babonye nrwaye baranfata bashyira mu bitaro byabo ,
later they asked me where my family was and i told them they were n't there . @" ||| nyuma baza kunbaza famille yanjye aho iri nrababwira nti @: ntabahari .
a certain man came and asked me about my family , because he looked ugly , i told him that inkotanyi killed them all . ||| umugabo umwe uje nreba afite isura mbi , anbajije nramubwira ngo iwacu inkotanyi zirabaishe bose .
he then added my name on the list of orphans and they took me to the orphanage at ndushu , in goma @-@ congo drc . ||| noneho aranfata anyandika muri liste y' imfubyi , bajyana mu kigo k' imfubyi cy' i ndushu . kiri kiri muri ... kiri kiri i goma [ kongo ] ,
i lived there but later i left . ||| nbamo , nyuma noneho nvamo ,
i wrote a letter , which i sent through the red cross to my aunt who was a teacher here at muhima . ||| kuko nje kuandika ibaruwa nyinyujije muri croix rouge , iraza igera kuri mukuru wa mama yigishaaga hano ku muhaima .
she replied me and sent me a picture . ||| noneho nawe aranyandikair anyohereza n' ifoto , barayizana bahita banzaan ,
they took me there and i started studying . ||| mpageze ubwo ngubwo ntangira kuiga .
throughout , i had never told anyone about my life or about what i went through ... in addition , no one had ever told me that my family was killed . ||| ariko kuva uwo munsi , nta n' umuntu nigeraaga nbwira uko ubuzima bwanjye uko buba ... uko bunbayeho ibyo nzi , nta n' umwe nigeraaga nbibwira . noneho mpageze ,
therefore , i disappeared again and went there during day time to verify myself . ||| kuva uwo munsi nta n' ubwo nigeraaga numva yuko mu rugo baba barapfuye . mpita nongera noneho nrabacika , njyayo ku manywa , njya kuhairebair .
when i got there , it was even hard to find the way as almost everything had been covered by grass ! ||| mpageze nsanga ni ibihuru , nta n' inzira ubona ,
i just went back home but i never told them where i had gone , i just told them that i had gone to play . ||| nragaruka . ntinigeze nbabwira aho ngiye , nbabwiye ko nri ngiye kukina kusa .
so , i just sat there at home . ||| noneho nraje niicara murugo ,
my uncle was in exile and later i even saw my aunt [ my father 's sister ] who was married to a congolese . ||| murumuna wa papa yabaga hanze , nyuma yaho nza kubona na mushiki wa papa uri urashatse umu ... yari yarashatse umukongomani . aba ariwe nbana nawe ,
i lived with them until i completed primary school and joined secondary . ||| niga primaire nrayirangiza ; nyirangije ninjira muri secondaire .
i passed well primary and joined a government school "@ byimana @" in gitarama . ||| kuko narayitsinze njya muri leta njya kuiga mu biimaan [ kitaarama ] .
it was the first time i was living around people of my age . ||| mpageze kubera ko nibwo bwa mbere nri ngiye muri societe y' abantu ,
besides , we were almost all knew each other because the majolity had come from the same school . ||| tungana benshi ubona ko abenshi tuziraanye . kuko abenshi bari abanyeshuri tuvanye ku bigo bimwe , uretse aho ngaho mu kigo nbanaagamo n' abana batoya cyane ,
of course some were younger than others . one day , one of the boys in my dormitory insulted me about my mother . ||| n' abandi ari bakuru ; noneho hajemo umuntu umwe , hari umunyeshuri umwe turaraanaga antuka kuri mama . antutse kuri mama ntabwo biigeze binbabaza narisekeye .
when he did , i did n't feel anything at the moment , i just laughted . ||| noneho ninjoro nbitekerezaho .
but at night i thought about it , it was as though my brain was widening ; i recalled the past , i thought about my current life and i started asking myself why or what i was struggling for . ||| ubwenge noneho butangira kutekereza gutya gutourna [ kuzenguruka ] ntekereza ibya kera , ntekereza uburyo nriho .
i thought , "@ i have no sister , no brother , i have no father , no mother . @" ||| nibaza ikintu ndi kuruhair nreba inyuma nkabona nta murumuna wanjye nfite , nkareba nta papa , nta mama ,
i did n't see why i was studying ! ||| nkabona ndi kuigira ubusa . kuko icyo kihae nrabiibuka ,
i remember that time , i never slept and the whole day i was thinking about that ; i did not study that day , i was in class but absent minded . ||| nabyi ... nbirayemo , nbiirirwamo , kuiga ntabwo nigize niga , niriwe mu ishuli nka ... nimereye nk' igiti ,
i remember i spent about three hours out of class ; i was chased out of class because i was n't taking notes . ||| nkabona , kuko uwomunsi nmaze nk' amasaha atatu hanze bansohoye kubera ntianditse na notae . ninjoro ngiye ku buriri , umutwe uranrya .
when i went to bed that night i could n't sleep , i could n't talk . ||| nanirwa kuryama , nrabyuka , nraongera nraryama , banvugaishije birananira ,
they took me to kabgayi hospital but it was all in vain . ||| njya kuvuga bikananira . kuvuga birananira neza banjyana mu bitaro i kabgayi , nabo birabananira . nje ,
they took me back home ; at the hospital they said i did n't have any problem . ||| banzanye mu rugo , banjyanye kwa muganga , baranbwira bati @: "@ nta kibazo ufite . @"
i spent six months without talking , i was used to communicate through writing . ||| kuko nbashaaga kuandika ariko simbashe kuvuga . icyo kihae nmaze amezi atandatu ntavuga , nandika kusa .
that is when i was taken to the trauma centre . ||| nibwo nje kujya hariya muri tromatisme [ ikigo kivura ihahamuka ] ,
i even started to work with esther who was with avega . ||| aba ariho nkorera nabo , nbanje no kukorana n' umugore witwa esther umwe ukoreraaga muri avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba jenoside ] nyuma y' amezi atandatu nibwo nongeye kaongera kuvuga .
i was able to talk again six months later and i went back to school . ||| no kuiga , ahongaho mpita mpava ,
but i shifted from byimana to apace . ||| nigair kuri apace . yee . kugeza ubungubu ni gutyo . bijyaaga bigaruka ariko ubungubu ,
the situation continued like that up to when they [ trauma centre ] advised me to be in the habit of talking to my friends and telling them my story , vice @-@ versa . ||| kubera ko nyuma y' aho nibwo ... biongeye kunbaho nibwo muri traumatisme banbwiye bati @: "@ uzajyae ugerageza kuganira n' abantu , ubabwirae amateka yawe nabo bakubwirae ayabo , bizajya bigenda bishira . @"
i usually do n't talk , not even to the members of my family ; but this is because they have never seen a war . there is none i can say that he or she knows a war . ||| ariko kubera nta muntu n' umwe wo muri famille , nta n' umwe nigeraaga nizera kuganira nawe , urebye muri famille [ umuryango ] yanjye yose nta muntu nvuga ngo yabaye mu ntiambara .
none of them has ever seen a person being killed . ||| nta muntu n' umwe wigeze ubona yica undi ,
even the few who have seen dead bodies just saw them on tv . ||| n' ababonye intumbi ni bakeya , bazibonaaga ku matereviziyo .
that is the reason why i believe there is nobody i can talk to about such stories because i believe they do n't know a thing . ||| uraumva ko nta muntu n' umwe nba numva ko nganira nawe , ngo numvae hari ikintu azi ,
that is the only reason . ||| niyo mpamvu .
there is apoint you mentioned that you joined the soldiers . how much time did you spend with them ? ||| hari aho utubwiye ko ugiye mu basirikare , icyo kihae winjiraga mu basirikare ho umazemo igihe kingana iki ?
i stayed there for two days . ||| icyo kihae nmazemo iminsi ibiri ,
i just wanted to see the way they used a gun ; i enjoyed it . ||| kuko jyae numvaaga nshaka kureba aho barashisha imbunda nta kinri numvaaga kinshimaishije ,
when i reached there , i found out that some people had been commanded to kill others . ||| ariko mpageze numvaishe yuko abantu bari kuica abantu ,
when i thought that they could even attack my grand father 's place , i immediately left . ||| kandi nti ... ari n' itegeko , nravuga nti ubona no kwa sogokuru nabo bari bubicae mpita ntahagaruka .
at your grandfather , did they know where you were ? ||| kwa sogokuru ntibari bazi aho uri ?
i did not tell them anything , and when i came back they asked me where i had been , i told them but they did not say a thing . ||| nta kintu nigeze nbabwira baranshatse barambura , kuko nje bara ... baraumiwe baambaza iyo nri ndi . nrabibabwira ariko nta kintu bigeze bantwara .
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana .
i left that place knowing there was peace at my place , i knew that one day they would kill us because of the way they were moving with their machetes , they all had new machetes . ||| icyo gi ... mbese nahavu ... nhavuye ndi kuvuga nti @: buno iwacu hari amahoro . kuko nbonaaga yuko ubuzima turimo , nbonaaga bianze bikuze ko bagomba kutuica .
nshaka was the one to keep the machetes . ||| kuko ukuntu bazaaga bameze byonyine n' imihoro , bose babaga bafite imihoro mishyashya . uwo musaza witwaga nshaka niwe ubikaaga iyo mihoro .
so , they used to pick them up from his place . ||| bajyaaga kuyifata iwe .
his sons , his younger brother 's sons [ nephews ] and his older brother 's sons [ nephews ] were all killers . ||| harimo abahungu be , harimo n' abahungu ba mukuru ... ba murumuna we benshi cyane . mpita mpava rero , njya ... uri kaumva ko aribwo ibyo bintu byose bije kuba ,
that is when i realized that the situation was similar everywhere . ||| nabwo ngezeyo nkabona naho nta kigenda . icyo kihae nibwo nmenye ko ubwo hose ariko bimeze .
how did you go , in a car ? ||| ugiye n' iki . uteze imodoka ?
no , i left by foot . ||| oya ngiye n' amaguru ,
i left early in the morning and reached there at around six or seven in the evening . ||| kuko nhavuye mu gitondo kare mpagera saa kumi n' ebyiri ... saa moya .
were n't you afraid of walking or there was a way you would hide ? ||| ntiuri ufite ubwoba se bwo kugenda , cyangwa hari uko wihishe ?
at that time there were many people on the road screaming while hunting for people but i did n't fear anything at all because i could walk anyhow and no one stopped me , though i feared roadblocks . ||| icyo kihae mu muhanda hari abantu benshi bavuza induru , abenshi bajya kuhiga abandi , ariko njyae nta bwoba nbaga nfite ngendaagamo gutyo , nta muntu wigeze antangira mu nzira , ahantu ntinyaaga kunyura ni kuri bariyeri kusa .
when was that ? ||| hari ryari ?
i used to think about the way i was living , i was staying with my aunt [ my mother 's older sister ] , they were n't real sisters but their fathers were brothers . ||| nhoraaga ntekereza ... kubera ko nbanaaga ... mukuru wa mama tubanaaga ntabwo ari ... ntabwo ari uwo kwa sogokuru neza . mbese ba sogokuru bari bava inda imwe .
he had two children and one was abroad . ||| afite abana babiri , undi aba hanze .
whenever i would compare the way they study and the way i study , i would find my studying useless . ||| nbona uburyo baigamo n' uburyo nnjyae niga , nkabona njyewe nta kintu kuiga bimaraiye .
i would go home for holidays and when the others would come , they would be received in such a warm way ! ||| kuko nrazaaga ngera mu rugo muri vacances [ ibiruhuko ] , nkabona abana ... ... araje uko yishimaiye umwana we siko anyishimaiye , ubundi ibyo ntakibazo .
it would leave me wondering whom i live to make happy and who could ever make me happy ! ||| ariko nka tekereza ese njyewe nshobora kuishimira ... kushimaish nde , ninde nshobora kuishimira nkamubura mbese . ukasanga mu mutawe wanjye ibyo ... nicyo kintu kirimo , kaumva ko nta kintu jyewe nimaraiye .
there was none and this really troubled me a lot . ||| binzirika mu mutawe kandi nta ... n' umuntu nbonaaga nganiraaga nawe , mbese tuvugaaga ibintu bisanzwe by' ubuzima bw' ahongaho bw' ako kanya . nta yinri gahunda nbaga nrimo nbona ... ntabwo nigeze nbona umwanya wo kuvugana n' umuntu n' umwe , ibintu bierekeye na jenoside .
because i had no one to talk to and whenever i talked to anyone it was just the usual things but i could n't talk about things related to genocide because of being traumatized and in case i talked it was only lies , i never felt like telling anyone the truth . ||| kuko n' aho muri traumatisme [ ikigo kita kubahahamutse ] aho nri ndi , ntabwo nigeze nbabwira ibyinshi , ibyinshi ngiye nbibabwira nbabeshya . nta muntu numvaaga nshaka kubwiza ukuri .
did you start talking at the trauma center ? ||| ugeze muri traumatisme [ ikigo kita kubahahamutse ] niho utangiye kuvuga ?
i started talking from then , but at first i used to use a pen and later they told us to stop writing and they started persuading me to try and talk . ||| yee , icyo kihae ... nibwo ntangiye kuvuga ariko ... icyo kihae nkoresheje bic [ ikaramu ] . noneho ibya bic , banbwira ngo tubivaeho ,
at times they also would tell me to start doing sports . ||| baaka bagenda banyumvaish ukuntu ngomba kuvuga , bikaza gahoro , ubundi barabwira bati ujyae ukora sport , noneho sport nyikora cyane .
i over practiced sports , which has caused me backaches , though i think it may be because of the beatings during the war . ||| noneho kino kibazo cy' umugongo nibwo kitangiye no kuzaho , icyo kihae nta nubwo ntekerezaaga ko ari n' iyo mpamvu wenda baba barankubise mu mugongo . mbese ... numva ari ibintu ntakwaiye kubabwira , nrabiihorera nanga kuirirwa nbibabwira byose .
basically there are things i would n't feel like revealing and i could only answer what they asked , in case they would ask me about the war , i would briefly reply and keep the rest to myself . ||| ibyo banbajije akaba aribyo nbasubiza , baambaza ibierekeye n' intambara nkababwiramo bike , ibindi nkanga kubibabwira .
when did you start telling it all ? ||| utangiye kubivuga byose ryari ?
it is this year that i started talking about it ; i recently said it for the first time . ||| ntangiye uno mwaka kubivuga , kuko ibya mbere ntangiye kubivuga ejo bunri .
even right now as i am talking , there are some information that i skip , because there is much that i forgot . ||| n' ubungubu tuvugana harimo byinshi nba ngiye nsimbuka . ni byinshi ntiibuka . kuko nko kubiandika nabwo biranvunnye .
even writing was n't easy ; there were some information i wrote and sent it to mudende [ adventist 's university ] . ||| harimo ibyo nanditse byoherejwe hariya i mudende [ universite adventiste ] .
the first day i wrote two pages , hoping to add on the following day . ||| nraanditse umunsi wa mbere , nanditse page ebyiri , nvuga ngo ejo nzaongera nandikae ,
when i sat the following day to continue , i had a lot to write but it was not flowing in order . ||| ngiye kwa ndika noneho haza ibindi ... noneho nashobo ... nbona chaine [ umurongo ] kuzana imwe , kugirango bigendae kuri chaine [ umurongo ] imwe nbona ntibishobotse .
therefore , i decided to leave everything and get a whole day to prepare it . ||| nfata decision [ icyemezo ] yo kufata umunsi umwe wo kubiandika .
that day i wrote eight pages . ||| nntukura umunsi woseee ... nanditse , amapaji umunani , nrekera aho ngaho .
and from that day on , it is when i started talking about it ... writing about it . ||| kuri uwo munsi nibwo ntangiye kugira ... kuzajya nbivuga . kubiandika ; nibwo ntangiye kubyamndika . ariko impamvu yatumye nbiandika ,
and the reason as to why i was trying to do this is because at the trauma center they had advised that in order to overcome it i must try and talk it out or even cry . ||| ni ukubera ubuzima bwanjye njyae ... nitekerejeho . kubera hari ... muri ‘ traumatisme ’ nibo baangiriye inama , barabwira bati @: "@ uzajyae ugerageza kubiivanamo ;
but in my whole life i have never cried . ||| kubiivanamo uzajyae ugerageza ubiganiraeho n' undi muntu . kuko banbwiraaga ko nshobora ... cyangwa nkihangana nkarira , ariko mu buzima bwanjye ntinjya ndira ,
instead of crying , i can n't talk . ||| ahubwo umwanya wo kurair ,
whenever we go to gisozi , while others cry , i just can n't talk anymore . ||| kuvuga birananira . kuko n' iyo tugiye hariya nko ku gisozi , akenshi abandi mu kihae bari kurair njyewe , akenshi ntabwo njya nshobora kuvuga .
that is why whenever i go there ; i get someone i can keep talking to in order to avoid loosing my speech . but still i find myself quiet . ||| niyo mpamvu iyo ngiyeyo nreba umuntu tujyana , noneho tukajya tugenda tuvugana . kugirango bitaza kuncika , nkashiduka binaniye kuvuga .
i live with my dad 's younger brother . ||| ubungubu nibwo ntangiye ku ... ejo bunri nibwo ntekereje , kubera ko nbana na murumuna wa papa .
recently i was asking myself if my uncle understands the seriousness of genocide ; i wonder if he does n't know the heaviness of genocide or if he has a different perception about the genocide ... i do n't know . ||| kubera kutaumva uburemere bwa jenoside . niba ari ukutabwumva ... niba hari ukundi kuntu abifata simbizi . nk' ubu mu kuiga kwanjye niga ... niga nbijyana gahoro .
currently ... i do n't stress myself with studies . ||| iyo nize cyane ,
because whenever i read a lot , i find myself in a position whereby i can n't talk . ||| nshiduka no kuvuga binaniye .
afterwards when i come back home he shouts at me . ||| noneho nkajya nbijyana gahoro ,
saying that i should get 70 % not the 50 % i manage to score . ||| nza akaba arantutse ngo nta kuntu ngo ushobora kugira mirongo itanu [ 50 % ] ngo nshaka mirongo irindwi [ 70 % ] ngo abe ariyo ngira .
i have never told him ... i guess he does n't know my past and how i survived . ||| kugira ngo nzabimubwirae nawe ntabwo ... n' ubungubu tubana ntabwo azi uko nshobora kuba nrarokotse .
by the way , if he knows my story , he knows just a little bit of it . ||| ntazi n' ukuntu bigenze , no murugo ... niba hari n' ubimubwira amubwira igice kimwe , ntawe ubizi mbese . nawe ubwe agenda gutya ntacyo azi .
that is when i started realizing that keeping it silent is being stupid . ||| nibwo ntangiye kaumva yuko kutagira undi muntu nbibwira , ko ari ubujiji bwanjye .
therefore , i decided to start writing . ||| mpitamo kuzajya niandikair ,
and when i am able to get the counselors from the trauma centers , i tell them some things , which relieves me . ||| nbona hari umuntu wo ‘ traumatisme ’ nkapfa kuganira nawe ho bikeya nawe .
even now there are some things you skipped ... is there some information that you did not tell us ? ||| nk' ubungubu hari ibintu usimbutse ... hari ibintu utaigeze utubwira nk' ubungubu ?
yes , there are some things that i did n't tell you . ||| yee ,
there was a time i stole a gun the time i left jari . ||| harimo byinshi nta ... bikeya ... nk' ubungubu ntinigeze nbabwira nk' ukuntu ... hariho ubwo nigeze kufata decision yo kuiba imbunda , nyuma y' ahongaho igihe nri nvuye i jari . nibye imbunda baranfata ,
they found me and i was beaten . ||| barankubita ,
when they asked me , i told them that i just wanted to hear how a gun feels like . ||| ariko nbaumvaish yuko nshakaaga nnjyae kuyifata ngo numvae ukuntu imbunda imera ,
however that was n't my real intention ; i wanted to take it and use it to kill the old man nshaka . and i was ready to face any punishment . ||| ariko ntabwo ariyo objectif [ intego ] njyewe numvaaga nfite .
but i was so unfortunate because i did n't succeed . ||| kuko numvaaga nfite objectif [ intego ] yo kuyifata , nmara nkaumva nkahita njya kurasa uwo musaza witwaga nshaka kusa , bashaka bakahita bankoresha icyo bashaka . ariko icyo kihae ntinigeze nbigeraho .
generally that is what i can tell you about the genocide . ||| mbese urebye ... jenoside ni gutyo njyewe nyibabwira nta kunri .
why ? ||| kubera iki ?
i believe a woman might waste my time . ||| impamvu , numva ko umugore ashobora kuzantaish igihe ... kuzatuma ngira ubuzima bubi .
she might make me unhappy . ||| ntekereza yuko nramutse ngize amahirwe y' ubuzima bwiza , nkabona umugore ubaye imfu ... utafite papa we na mama we ,
however , i believe if i am lucky , i 'll come across one whose parents were killed in the genocide . ||| bose bapfuye muri jenoside , ariwe nbana nawe . kuko iyo ntekereje urugero @: ukuntu ngana ,
however , i think it will n't be possible because all those orphans of the genocide will be married before i will be in position to marry and those who may be still single will be too old for me . ||| nkatekereza abantu jenoside yabayeho bariho , igihe nzajya kushakira umugore nkaumva bose bazaba bafite abagabo , n' abatazaba batafite abagabo bazaba ari bakuru cyane .
i would n't want to marry someone who does n't know anything about the genocide . and when we will be living together and i see all his family members visiting us , it may confuse me . in the end i end up not thinking of getting married though at times i consider getting married so that i could have a child to replace those who died and to restore the memories of those we lost . ||| nkaumva ko bizansaba kushaka umugore utazi na jenoside icyo aricyo . nbana nawe nbona nka papa we aje kumusura , cyangwa mama we , cyangwa barumuna be , cyangwa basaza be . nkaumva nabyo ibyo bintu bizantaish ... bizamungabanya mu mutawe , nkaumva yuko nbireka . ariko na none , nkaumva yuko nshaka umugore kugira nzabonae umwana uzajya mu mwanya wanjye mbese . mu muryango iwacu ntihagirae umuntu ... ntiwibagirane , ukazajya uhora wibuka yuko , nubwo jenoside yabayeho uwo muryango w' i ... iyo jenoside yabayeho uwo muryango uri uyirimo . ni gutyo nbitekereza . kuri avenir [ ejo hazaza ] wanjye .
what would you like to do ? ||| urashaka kuzakora iki ?
i think after completing my studies , i 'll be self @-@ employed . ||| ku bintu kukora , ubundi ntekereza ko nrangije kuiga , nshobora kuzashaka ibyo kuikorera .
i want to make a project and it will involve agriculture and cattle breeding , which will be based at my now deserted home . ||| kuko ntabwo njya ntekereza n' umunsi n' umwe kugira umuntu nkorera . ntekereza ko nramutse nbonye uburyo nshobora kurangiza kuiga , nkagerageza gusha ... gucreya [ kuihimbair ] imishinga nkikorera ku giti cyanjye . ariko icya mbere ntekereza ni by' ubuhinzi n' ubworozi nkagenda kubishyira mu matongo yo mu rugo .
that means that you want to study agriculture ? ||| noneho ubwo uzaiga agricole [ ubuhinzi ] ?
i can not study agriculture because i am studying accounts . ||| oya , kuiga agricole [ ubuhinzi ] byo ntabwo bishoboka . kuko nk' ubu niga comptabilite ,
i think i will do "@ management @" at the university . ||| mbese mubyo niga ndi kaumva kugira ngo nzajyae kufata iyo faculte nabwo bitarii ... nibyo nvugaaga ko wenda faculte nzafata ni management .
but if i get a chance to study agriculture , i will do both since i feel i have it on my heart . ||| ariko n' ubwo ntari ... atari agricole [ ubuhinzi ] nbonye moyen [ ubushobozi ] byose nbikora nizera ko bishoboka . kuko mu mutawe wanjye numva ko ibyo byose bishoboka .
when you think about you future family , what do you think genocide will mean to them ? ||| nk' ubu wibaza ko umuryango wawe cyangwa famille yawe mu kihae kizaza , ubona jenoside izaba ari iki ku muryango wawe ?
afterwards the judges told me to see the prosecutor and tell him to make me a file . ||| noneho abacamanza bantegeka kujya ngo kureba i.p.j. , ngo mubwirae ankorerae dossier .
when i reached there , i found that he had written most of the things , although he rewrote them again . ||| nragiye noneho arangije arabi ... kubera ko ibyinshi bari babianditse baraongera baraandika arangije aranbwira ngo azabatumaho abandi ... abenshi bari mu rugo batafunzwe .
then he said that the court would call them , since most of them were not imprisoned . ||| umwe yari na responsable ,
and one of them was a local leader who is not imprisoned up to now . ||| ngirango n' ubu aracyari responsable . maze kubivuga , arangije aranbwira ngo nzagarukae ari kuwa gatatu . ampa n' isaha aranbwira ati @:
they told me to come back that wednesday at 9:00 a.m. i used a bicycle i had and while sloping down on my way back i was stoned by people i did n't know . ||| "@ saa tatu . @" nri nfite igare rya sport , nrizaho nrijeho nsubiye yo manuka bantera amabuye . abantu banteye amabuye ntabwo nri nbazi .
therefore , i decided to go back . ||| nkata igare nsubira inyuma . nsubiye inyuma , nrebye inyuma nbona abantu banyirukanseho . igare nraita hasi .
when i looked back , i saw a group of people running after me . ||| [ abo bantu ntinbamenye ] . nraitaye hasi nirukanse , nbona imodoka iturutse inyuma , mpita ntahagaga .
i went off the bicycle and started running , leaving it behind . ||| yari ... yari i toyota ya ba ntuza ya ardi . irahagara abo bantu nrababwira , nbabwira ukuntu abantu bari banyi ... bagiye kunyicira hano mu nzira . barangije baraza baranfata bashyirairmo iryo gare ,
luckily i saw a vehicle and stopped it . ||| turajyana , n' abantu bahita basubira inyuma bahita babura ... turababura . kuva uwo munsi kugeza na n' ubu , ibierekeraanye n' ayo madossiers simbizi .
i told them my story and then we went back , picked my bicycle , but the people who were chasing me were nowhere to be seen . ||| ntinzi ahantu bizanagarukair nrabiihoreye , ku buryo n' umwe muri ... muri bo uri urimo , [ muri babanri bari banyihakanaye ko batanzi ] nawe yarafunguwe yabaye umwere mbese .
since then i never went back to follow up with the cases and in fact one of them was freed claiming that he is innocent because all who were accusing him were defeated in court . ||| kubera ko abamushinjaaga , bose baransinzwe mu rubanza . njyewe ubwo ntinigeze nhajya , ntinzi n' ukuntu bigenze mbese numva ko yafunguwe kusa .
but personally i never went there and never even bothered to follow the proceedings . ||| mbese ibierekeye n' urubanza , nta muntu n' umwe tuvuga ko muri famille uba yara ... baba baraigeze baraburanaish bavuga yuko yaba yaragize uruhare rwo kubica . kandi umwe aracyari na responsible , kugeza na n' ubu nta kingombaw nshobora kujya kuhaka .
most of the killers are still free in butamwa and one of them is a local leader , up to now when i want to look for farg documents i no longer go to butamwa instead i go to shyorongi because i also know the place very well . ||| n' ibyangombwa nigairho bya f.a.r.g. njya kubiaka i shyorongi , kubera ko bo baranzi nta kibazo naho mpafite . ariko i butamwa , kuba ariho nvukair ntabwo ... n' ubu ntinhakandagira .
how many times have you gone back since the war ended ? ||| kuva intambara yarangira usubiye i butamwa kangahe ?
that was my second time . ||| ubwo iyo nshuro yari iya kabiri .
which means i went there three times . the first time i went to see if there was anybody who survived as i believed they were still alive yet they all had died . ||| ubwo ngiye yo gatatu kubera ko ubaw mbere ngiye yo ngiye kureba ko batapfuye . kuko numvaaga ko bahari kandi birarangiye .
the second time i had gone to look for an identity card and that is the time when i found a case . ||| ubaw kabiri njyayo , ngiye kureba irangamuntu , aribwo njyaagayo nkasangayo urubanza .
and the third time is when i had gone for a reply because they had asked me to go back on wednesday . ||| ubaw gatatu buri ubwo nri ngiyeyo nyine ngiye kureba igisubizo , kubera ko bari banbwiye ngo nzagarukae kuwa gatatu .
however , i never followed it up , i just came back . ||| nabwo ntabwo nigeze mbikurikirana nabwo nhise nigarukair .
when did you come from zaire [ congo drc ] ? ||| uvuye muri zairae ryari ?
i left zaire in january 1995 . ||| muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] , mu kwezi kwa mbere .
for how long were you there ? ||| umazeyo igihe kingana iki ?
i spent there about five or six months . ||| nmazeyo amezi nimba ari nk' atandatu ... atanu .
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana .
it would sound childish if someone said that the elders should be removed from the world . ||| uretse ko umuntu yaba atekereje nk' umwana aramutse avuze ngo @:
because if the old people were taken away , there would remain only children , which is not good . ||| "@ abantu bakuru babakuraeho , hasigaraeho abana .
for a better future of rwanda , they should educate the coming generation . ||| nabyo ntibishoboka . nraumva ko kugirango avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' abanyarwanda ibae nzima , ni uko uubyiruko ruri kuzamuka gutya , nirwo umuntu yaheraho yigisha .
because as they study and you give them a lot of examples , they understand better . ||| kuko nk' iyo umuntu yiga aba ... iyo umwigisha ukamuha exemples [ ingero ] nyinshi araumva .
however they can even be the first ones to disobey . ||| uretse ko , aba ari na ... ari nawe wa mbere uba uwa mbere kubiica ,
but when they have heard about it , they are far better than those who never went to school . ||| ariko iyo abiumvaishije aruta ba banri bari ha ... bataigeze bagera mu mashuri .
i guess they are the ones who should be sensitized . instead of teaching people how to forgive only , they should teach them the origin of everything , and the cruelty of it all . ||| numva aribo bantu umuntu yakuigisha . naho bino byo kugenda babaigisha kubabarira kusa , njyewe numva umuntu yabaigisha imvo n' imvano yabyo ,
then everybody will feel concerned in stopping such acts from happing again . ||| akabaigisha ububi bwabyo , noneho umuntu wese akaumva ko agomba kugira ishyaka , ryo kaumva ko ibyo bintu byose bitagomba kubaho .
how do you think you will train your own kids ? ||| wunva ari iki uzaigisha abana bawe ?
if i will be lucky to have children , i would n't want them to live that kind of a life . ||| njyae numva nta mwana wanjye uzaba ... ni ngira amahirwe nkamugira . numva nta mwana wanjye ntuma agira iyo ... yinjira muri iyo cas [ muri ubwo buzima ] .
because i believe that if there is anything i have to do for them first , is to teach them about those things . ||| kuko numva ko mu bintu byose bigomba kuzabaho , ngomba kuba aribyo nbanza kumwigisha .
i also believe that , even if i am very rich , a housemaid will n't be the one to take care of my children . ||| kandi nkaumva ko umwana wanjye n' iyo nba ndi umukire kutae , atareraw n' umukozi .
i think their mother and i are the ones who need to raise them . in case their mother will be working , she shall quit her job and first raise up the children . ||| numva ko ari njyewe uzamwirerera na mama we .
that is why i earlier told you that it would be difficult for me to marry due to my confusion . ||| biba ngombaw niyo mama we yaba afite akazi ,
telling my wife to stop working and raise a child will n't be easy and that 's why i told you i would n't want to marry . ||| akaba yakareka ariko akarera uwo mwana . niyo mpamvu nbabwiye ko ibyo byo gu ... byo kaumva nshaka umugore bizanvuna , numva ntabishaka . kuko numva no kuzabwira umugore ngo reka akazi urerae umwana kuko nabyo numva ari ibintu bitazaoroha .

indeed i did ... it is just that nowadays it does not exist anymore and it 's become difficult to determine who is the last @-@ born . ||| kabisa , nijyae usize ... [ araseka ] ni uko muri iki kihae bitakibaho , ntawukimenya bucura .
and what about your elder brother whom you are living together , which born was he in your family ? ||| naho mukuru wawe mubana se we yari uwa kangahe ?
he was the first @-@ born in our family . ||| we yari imfura mu muryango , niwe uri imfura .

tell us about your childhood , how you lived . ||| sa nk' aho utubwira ... ubwana bwawe ukuntu bugenze .
okay ... i may not be able to tell you what i went through in my mother 's womb , but from the time i was born , they used to tell me about my childhood . ||| ok , icyo ntashobora wenda kukubwira byo ni mbere munda , ariko nkimara kuvuka uko banbwira nbayeho , nuko nri ndi umwana ,
well , i was the last @-@ born . it is said that last @-@ born children always stress their parents ; they easily fall sick . ||| umwana w' umuhererezi ,
i was told myself i used to be very sickly . ||| cyane cyane bajya bakunda kuvuga ngo ni umwana urushya ; urwaragurika , kuko nnjyae ngo nararwaraguritse ,
people would run around looking for medicine . ||| biruka hose , banshakishiriza imiti .
i also heard that my mum died when i was very young . ||| kusa nzakaumvako mama yapfuye nkiri muto ,
i had not yet reached time to join primary school . ||| yapfuye nkiri muto ntaratangira n' umwaka wa mbere primaire .
but by then , my dad was still alive . therefore , we lived with him . ||| ariko papa we yari akiriho ni nawe tuhise tubana ,
he always used to draw me near him wherever he was and wherever he went . ||| akajya akomeza kunyiegereza ku ... , aho agiye hose , aho akora hose ; aho agenze hose ,
sometimes he could even take me at his working place because i was too young to be left alone and also , he was the only parent that we had . ||| tukaba turi kumwe kuko nrinri umwana , niwe uri usigaye ari nk' umubyeyi wanjye mukuru , ugomba kundair ; kuntetesha .
so he had to look after me , take good care of me and so on . when time came to go to school , he took me to school like other children . ||| ubwo ntakura nyine anshakira ishuri nk' abandi bose nraiga .
then in 1994 the war started and by then i had n't joined secondary ; i was still in primary . ||| intambara yo muri 1994 iza kuba ntaragera , ntarajya muri secondaire ; nri nkiri muri primaire ,
i remember i had sat the national primary leaving examinations p.l.e. by then primary school would stop at the sixth level . ||| nraibuka ko nri maze kukora icya leta cy' umwaka wa gatandatu icyo kihae umwaka wa munani uri umaze kuvaho .
level 8 had been removed . therefore i was waiting for my results but unfortunately enough that is when the catastrophes of 1994 started . ||| nibwo nri nkikikora ntegereje resultat [ ibisubizo ] , nibwo amahano rero yo muri mirongo 1994 yabaye .
i guess you too can imagine how my childhood was . ||| ubwo nawe urabiumva niko nvuga ubuzima bwanjye bw' ubwana .
when you try to remember between 1990 and 1994 , when did you realize that there was a problem ? ||| uko wibuka hagati ya 1990 na 1994 , uko ubibonye ni ryari utangiye kubona ko hari ikibazo ?
yes ... long ago in rwanda , that is before the war ... especially those of us who went to secondary school we used to study the history of rwanda . ||| yes , uraumva ubundi mu rwanda kera mbere y' intambara , haba ... , nkubu nkatawe tuigaga secondaire ,
we were taught about life in rwanda before the coming of the whites , after the coming of the whites and life before the war meaning how rwandans leaved before the war . ||| cyane cyane burya umuntu wize yagize chance tunabyigaaga tuigaga amateka ... amateka y' igihugu cy' u rwanda ; batubwira mbere y' umwaduko w' abazungu ; bakatubwira nyuma y' umwaduko w' abazungu , ndetse batubwira ... bakatubwira no muri icyo kihae cya mbere y' intambara ,
during that time , the hutu were on power . ||| uko turi tubayeho icyo kihae . aho niho bavugaaga ... icyo kihae abantu bari bafite power bari abahutu ; ubwoko bw' abahutu ,
even before the war , they were the ones in the leadership of the country . ||| mbere y' intambara ni nabo bari bafite ubutegetsi ,
their main goal was to teach how tutsis were bad . generally that was the main lesson . people were first shown how the tutsi used to lead during the monarchy . ||| ukasanga ikintu bimiraije inberae bakaerekana ububi bw' umututsi , mbese nizo nyigisho zari zigezaweho babanzaaga bakaerekana uko umututsi yategetse mu bwami .
then based on that , people were convinced on how bad the tutsi are . ||| barangiza noneho bakajya baerekana mu mayeri uko ... ububi bw' umututsi .
i could give you an example related to this @: they used to count the number of the tutsi in class , i would be asked to stand up in class . ||| ni muri urwo rwego nkuha nk' urugero ukuntu batangiraaga bati @: "@ tubarae nk' abatutsi bari mw' ishuli . @"@
sometimes there was only one or two tutsis in class . ||| bakakuhagurutsa wenda uri nk' umwe cyangwa muri babili ,
i felt so ashamed and i 'd easily ask myself many questions . ||| ukaumva isoni zirakuishe ukatangira kuibaza byinshi .
i remember my dad used to work in a place called ririma , he was working at the ririma prison . ||| ubwo nraibuka ko ... , jyae papa yakoraaga ahantu baitaaga i riraima ... i riraima kuri prison ya riraima .
i lived in ririma when i was young . ||| niho cyane cyane ninaho nbaye ubuzima bwanjye bwo mu bwana .
then in 1990 , 1991 and 1992 a rumor spread that inkotanyi troops had invaded the country . ||| noneho muri1990 , 1991 , 1992 , igihe ... igihe bavugaaga ngo inkotanyi ngo zateye ,
i heard that in our home village [ nyamata ] people 's houses were being burnt . the burning of houses used to be the first sign whenever there was a problem of tribes in this region . then the same acts started in ririma too . ||| numvaaga amakuru y' iwacu za nyamata iyongiyo baratangiye kutwika amazu .
normally in bugesera , it seemed as though people were bewitched . ||| niho batangiraiye ,
even when they heard that people were being killed ... i was lucky because i was living at the prison and the supervisors protected us . there were times when at the ririma prison everybody was scared that the inkotanyi troops were coming to take control of it . ||| ho iyo ikintu kikomaaga kaerekeraanye n' ubwoko ,
i remember that time we spent the night outside ; we could not sleep in our houses . then the local people started killing each other ; we could hear that hutu are killing tutsi . ||| batangiraaga kutwika amazu .
i was so lucky to be protected , by then i was at the prison , and nothing bad happened to us . ||| ntawe , aho nbaga i riraima biri byara ... ubundi u bugesair bwose wagirango buri bwararozwe naho tuumva ko abaturage batuye .. , kuko njyae nbaga kuri prison nizo mana zacu turinzawe nba surveillants , kuko hari n' igihe prison y' i riraima yigeze kugira ubwoba ivuga ngo inkotanyi baraza kubohoza kuri prison y' iririma .
later things cooled down . ||| icyo kihae turara ... ntanubwo nraye mu nzu icyo kihae twebwe turaye hanze ; ubwo nibwo wunvaaga mu kacae k' abaturage bicana ngo abahutu barikuica abatutsi . ni amahirwe ngize kubona nri nrizawe nri ndi ; nri ndi aho kuri prison ntacyo bibashije kututwara ,
we heard that nyamata people hid in the church . ||| bigeze igihe birahosha . ni ukuvuga ngo nab' inyamata tuza kaumva amakuru ko bahungiye kuri ... ku kiriziya ,
however some were killed on their way to the church but those who managed to escape and reach the church were protected . ||| uwo babashije kuica baramwishe , ariko abandi bahungira ku kiliziya , barabarinda ,
after sometime they all went back to their homes , most of them found their houses burnt . ||| igihe kiza kugera basubira mu ngo zabo . ariko babatwikiye amazu ,
some people had already been killed , those who went back home could help each other and construct huts [ rwandan traditional houses , made out of sticks and grass ] . ||| ba ... ndetse harimo abo baishe , abasubiye mu ngo zabo bagafashanya bakaongera bakasakara utuzu tw' utugonyi twa kinyarwanda , bakaongera bakatura . ubwo ni uko bigendaaga .
generally in bugesera we were always ready ; we knew we were being hunted and that at any particular time , we would all be killed . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo bugesair tuhoraaga tuiteguye muri make , tuiteguye ko tugomba kuhigaw ,
i had never seen hutu in good terms with tutsi . they were like leopards and ... or cats and rats all the time . that is how i could compare the two clans . ||| cyangwa kuicwa isaha n' isaha . ni ukuvuga ngo nta buumvikanae nbonaaga hagati y' umututsi n' umuhutu bahoraaga bameze nk' ingwe , cyangwa i pusi n' imbeba niko nbigereranya .
when did you realize it was a big problem ? ||| ubibonye ryari ko ari ikibazo ?
well , all problems began in 1990 , 1992 . ||| ubundi ikibazo n' ukuhera muri 1990 , 1991 ,
but it was in 1994 when i realized that any tutsi was in trouble . in 1994 the situation got worse . ||| ariko aho ntangiye kuvuga nti @: ak' umututsi karashobotse ni muri 1994 ,
i remember my dad had retired several years before and we were living in nyamata , which used to be called kayumba sector . ||| niho ibintu biri birakomeye nraibuka ko papa yari yarabonye pansion ( ikiruhuko cy' izabukuru ) kera , tusigaye tuba i nyamata noneho , aho baitaaga secteur kayumba , icyo kihae niko bahitaaga secteur kayumba .
in nyamata i saw the real change that had occurred ; that is when i opened my eyes . ||| niho ntangiraiye kubona ibintu bihindutse koko , niho nhumutse kuko ubundi muri 1990 ,
because from the year 1990 to 1992 , it seemed as though we were blind ; those days , we could flee and just go to the commune or to churches and the priests could protect us and then we could go back to our homes . ||| 1992 basaga nk' aho bari baratuhumye amaso . ni ukuvuga ngo turahungaaga , tuhungira kuri commune cyangwa kwa padiri ( ku kiliziya ) ,
therefore , we never thought it was a big problem . ||| bakaturinda tukasubira mu ngo zacu tukaumva ko nta kibazo ,
but in 1994 , i finally accepted that the facts the way they were . ||| bakakomeza baducengacenga gutyo . ariko aho tuje kubonera ... aho nje kubonera ko ukuri ari ukuri , ni icyo kihae kishyira 1994 ,
that is when the councillor who was also a tutsi held a meeting and said , "@ i am no longer invited in meetings that are held on behalf of the government . ||| aho konseye ... konseye w' iwacu secteur kayumba , yakoresheje inama ( yari umututsi ) . ndetse ... noneho akoresha inama aravuga ati @: "@ ngewe basigaye bampisha mu manama ya leta ,
therefore , i do n't attend government meeting . ||| ati @: iyo bagiye kukorana inama za leta ntinkijyayo ,
but be ready we are in danger ; stop that habit of fleeing towards the commune or to nyamata church . ||| ati kusa muitegurae ko akagiye kutubaho , kabaye ! ati bibinri mwamenyereye kujya kuhungira i nyamata , ati muirindae ntihagirae umuntu uzigera ajya kuhungira i nyamata .
this time the killings will start from those areas . all i can advise you , is to be ready and face what is going to happen here . @" ||| ati niho ibi bintu byose bigiye kuzaba ( kuko we yari umuyobozi yarabibonaaga ,
because he was a leader , he had spied and got that information . ||| yari umukonseye ) , ibigiye kuzaba byose bizaba biturutse hahanri mwahungiraga kuri komine , mu ma kiliziya niho bizaba biturutse .
"@ all the plans for killing that are going to take place are made in the nyamata commune , in churches ; they all have the same plans @"@ , he added . ||| ntihagirae umuntu uzaibeshya ngo ajyae kuhungira i nyamata , ati @: "@ muzirwanaeho mupfae mwiruka ariko ntimuzagirae mutae ?
he warned us that no one should make a mistake of going to the former hiding places . ||| ntimuzahungirae i nyamata . @"
i learned a lot in that meeting . normally when a leader says something of that sort , it means that he is sure of it . ||| naho ngewe iyo nama niyo urebye nhumukaiyemo , kuko umuntu burya iyo umutegetsi ; iyo akubwiye ikintu burya aba akizi koko . aho niho ntangiye kaumvira ubwenge ,
then i grew up in my way of thinking and was so scared . ||| n' ubwoba butangira kuza ,
that is when i really saw how much i was vulnerable . ||| nti koko kashobotse .
was that in the beginning of the year 1994 ? ||| aho ni muri 1994 mu ntangiriro ?
in the beginning ... at the beginning of the genocide and the massacre , it was in april , the early days of the month . ||| mu ntangiriro ! mbese intangiroro za genocide z' itsembabwoko , muri uko kwa kane ;
i began with the information concerning kayumba sector or bugesera . ||| mbese kukitangira . kuko nkubwiye ... ntiangiriye ubundi amakuru y' i nyamata cyangwa aho muri secteur kayumba . ubundi secteur kayumba cyangwa u bugesair ,
i mean i am starting from what took place in nyamata , kanzeze because in those areas there were so many tutsi . ||| nibanze muri nyamata , nibanze muri kanyenze yari nk' indiri ni nk' indiri y' abatutsi hari hatuye abatutsi benshi cyane ; ni ukuvuga ngo icyakorwaga kibi muri gouvernement , habanzaaga u bugesair .
whenever there could be any conflicts in the country , people in those areas could be in for it ; houses were burnt , blood was shed , in brief those were the target areas for genocidal acts . ||| bakatwikirwa , bakaicwa , mbese niho hambaire genocide yahitaaga ibanza gufrequa ... kugera .
so , what happened , first there was what one could call ‘ hunting ’ , the following day , one could see at the hill ... [ i have failed to get a better way of giving you examples ] normally there was a hill where we lived , that hill was called kayumba . ||| uko bigenze rero @: ni ukuvuga ngo habanje kuba icyo baita ihigaan , ihigaan noneho bukacya , bucya ukajya kubona ukabona ku musozi ... ‘ ubundi kayumba ntinzi ukuntu njya nbaha urugero ,
then there were other hills called murama sector , mwogo sector and muyenzi sector , which sectors surrounded kayumba . ||| hari umusozi umwe uwo musozi niwo nri ntuyeho witwaga kayumba hakaba n' indi misozi iyo misozi yitwa za ... za murama , secteur murama secteur mwogo , secteur muyenzi .
and tutsis resided in kayumba more than in other sectors . ||| zikikije kayumba iyo kayumba rero niyo yaririmo abatutsi benshi , kurusha ayo amasecteur yanri yose .
then in the morning , one could see houses in flames and one would wonder . ||| ’ noneho bucya ukajya kubona bakabona amazu atangiye kukurumaan , bakibaza ,
but the grown ups would vulnerably nod and say that there was no alternative , that we were going to be exterminated since they [ hutu ] had started with their habit of burning houses . ||| abantu bakuru kuri twebwe bakajya bibaza bati kashobotse , bati batangiye kutwika .
the counsellor once again warned us from fleeing towards nyamata . ||| konseye araturwanya cyane , aratubwira ati @: « ntihagirae uzahungira hehe .. ? i nyamata ;
instead , he advised us to go to the boarders of those sectors and our sector . ||| ahubwo mumanukae mujyae ku mipaka y' ayo masecteur .
by then habyarimana had not yet died . ||| [ icyo kihae habyarimana yari atarapfa ] mujyae ku mipaka ,
so , the counsellor advised us to go to the boarders between our sector and the neighboring sectors and prevent our sector from the interahamwe who were coming in . ||| muboroke , mukingaire interahamwe ziza muri iyi secteur yacu . »
there used to be few hutu in our sector about two or three and they even left later on and joined other sectors . ||| kuko secteur yari irimo abahutu bari barimo hari harimo nk nkamawe ; tubiri .. tubiri .. , dutatu gutyo , utwo duhutu turitoratoranya tuvamo tujya muri ayo masecteur yanri ;
then other tutsi who were in other sectors came to our sector kayumba . ||| noneho na ba batutsi bari mu masecteur , baza muri secteur yacu kayumba ,
therefore , kayumba sector became a sector of tutsi only . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo @: secteur kayumba iba nk' indiri y' abatutsi . bigenda bite rero ? noneho ,
what came next is that we started patrolling at night in our sector . ||| ubwo tutangiye kurara amarondo ,
there was a clan in kayumba sector , which was known as abamere which i am a member of . ||| hari ubwoko bw' iwacu [ aho muri iyo secteur kayumba ] bwitwaga abamerae , nnjyae ubu ndi umumerae .
this is a clan that used to own many cattle in the whole of bugesera @-@ kayumba . ||| abamerae ni abantu babaga bafite inka , mbese turi tufite inka ; ahomuri bugesair kayumba tubaga tufite inka , kandi bazi ikintu baita umuheto ,
people in that clan used to be good at using bows and arrows . therefore , we could guard our sector by moving around in our sector . ||| kurasaan n' umuheto . noneho ni ukuvuga ngo iyo kayumba rero tukirinda tukazenguruka secteur yacu .
at different boarder with other sectors , there was a swamp . ||| tubaga tutandukanaijew n' ibibaya ,
this swamp separated our sector from other sectors . i remember i was young but i could carry a machete . we were told that one should carry whatever weapon they could get . ||| ayo masecteur atandukanyaijew n' ibibaya tukamanuka nrabiibuka nnjyae nri ndi umwana n' ubwo ntafataaga umuhoro baratubwiraaga ngo icyo umuntu afite abe aricyo amanukaan .
sometimes i could get stones and we could descend down the hill and patrol the whole night . ||| nkafata amabuye tukamanuka , tukirinda , tukarara amarondo ahangaho .
that was before habyarimana 's death . the perpetrators would attack our home village but we would defeat them and send them back . and then habyarimana died . ||| noneho , mbere habyarimana ataranapfa bakajya baza bashaka kuegera secteur yacu ngo baze batuhigae tukabasubizayo . uko bigenze rero habyarimana agize atya ,
it was on the 6th at night . ||| hari mu ijoro ryo ku ... ku .. mbese bucya ari kuya gatandatu , ku tariki ya gatandatu ,
that night i had gone back home at around half past seven in the evening . ||| nibwo ninjoro ... turi turi ... njyae nri nsubiye mu rugo ni njoro , nko mu ma saa moya saa moya n' igice gutyo ;
someone standing in our home compound could see the airport 's security lights [ kanombe airport ] . ||| kuko iyo uri iwacu mu mbuga y' iwacu uba ureba kanombe amatara y' i kanombe ,
therefore , while we were milking cows , we saw sparks rising above the airport and suddenly joined up in the air and ignited . ||| tuba tuyareba atondetse umurongo kuriya . tugiye kubona turi kukamaish , tubona ibintu by' ibiriro birazamutse bihuye hejuru birakubitanye ,
then , objects in flames started falling downwards , which from a distance looked like a polythene material falling on the ground . ||| biraatse . bimanuka biaka ... ibishashi bigwa hasi ;
those who were grown up like my cousin who was quite intelligent and who had gone to school said , "@ this is not a sign of peace . @" ||| abatukuraiye , nri nfite mukuru wanjye kwa data wacu uri uzi ubwenge yari yarize , ati @: ‘ ibi bintu si amahoro !
everybody around said so . ||| ’ ni uko yatangiye kuvuga , ati @:
then we went to bed and in the morning , the news that president habyarimana 's aircraft had crashed and spread all over . ||| ‘ ibi bintu si amahoro . ’ turaryama bukeye nibwo batangaje rero ngo inkuru y' inshamugongo ; ngo prezida habyarimana baraye barashe indege ye .
eh ... what happened next ? ||| eh ! icyakozwe rero ni iki @: noneho bya binri bihoraaga bigira kutae ?
all the evil plans that were in their hearts were put out in open . ||| ... bitumbatumba babishyira ku mugaragaro .
i have no words to explain this ... they [ perpetrators ] started hunting people in our sector ; we had protected our sector . we could go to karambi swamp where we could meet the attackers . ||| ntinkubwira .. batangira kujya baza kuhiga muri iyo secteur ; turirinze tukamanuka tukajya mu kibaya icyo kibaya cya karambi tukahurairmo aho ;
those attackers could come while producing musical sound by the use of some local musical instruments made out of horns called amakondera and get in murama . ||| nabo bakamanuka bavuza amakondera aho ku murama ;
i wonder if you can imagine ... just put yourself in my shoe at that time and try to think about being attacked by people from all the neighbouring hills , all together for one hill . ||| ‘ ntinzi niba ... ubyimagine ubiishyirae mu mutawe urebae ukuntu nawe nk' imisozi iba imaze hirya no hino . ’ bakamanuka bafatanyae urunana ,
playing those makondera and dressed in banana leaves . ||| bavuza amakondera baambaye amakoma ;
that is how they became interahamwe [ people united with a common purpose ] and surely , they looked wild . ||| nibwo batangiye kuba interahamwe koko ukabona ko ari ibisimba .
so , they came playing the makondera and whistles with so much courage . ||| noneho , bakamanuka bagenda bavuza amakondera , bavuza amafirimbi , bagenda baterana inkunga ;
we could just be standing in the swamp , cursing or calling one another saying , "@ try and come here . @" ||| ubwo ntawe tuhagaze mu kibaya tukanatukana , tukanahamagarana , tuti @: « mutinyukae muzae . »
they [ attackers ] came and stood on that hill at the other side and we were standing on our hill on this side . ||| baramanuka ... bakamanuka bakaharara nko hakurya ntawe tuhagarara hakuno bakatera amabuye ,
then they started stoning us , shooting arrows , and we also did the same in turn . ||| bakatera amacumu , bakarasa imyambi , ntawe tukabaoherereza . ubwo ,
they used to come in a smaller number than ours , because for us the whole sector could gather yet for them , some would come while others would not . ||| tukaba ... kuko uraumva baba baje ari nka bakeya twebwe tuishyize hamwe tukamanuka igihiriri ;
therefore , we could put together our stones and stone them at a go . slowly by slowly they were defeated and went back running . ||| ubwo tukafata amabuye , tuesae tumanukaanye tukatera tukatera twavansa [ tubasatira ] tukabakubita bakasubirayo biruka .
a day would end like that . ||| ubwo umunsi wa mbere uba urashize .
the following day they came back . they came down the hill still playing the makondera . ||| umunsi wa kabiri baraongera , baramanuka bukeye bavuza amakondera ;
this time they brought some things i could n't identify ; they were holding things burning with flames . ||| noneho hari ibintu bari bazanye ntinzi ibyo ari byo by' ibiriro biaka ,
that was so scary . ||| batutera ubwoba , nka biriya biriro baba bagira ku kibuga ,
those flames looked like the torches that are always lighted when a team wins a match . the attacker were holding these flames while wearing banana leaves , i was a young boy who used to like joining others on the field . ||| iyo nk' ikipe itsinze ukabona ikiriro kiraatse . bakaza babicanye baambaye amakoma ! noneho , nnjyae nri ndi umwana ukundaaga kumanuka mu bantu bajyaaga kutabara ,
i would carry stones and we met them in the swamp and fought ; we shot each other until when they were forced to run back while no one had been killed in our group . ||| nkamanukaan amabuye , noneho tukahurair muri cya kibaya tukarasaan , tukarasaan , tukabakubita bakazamuka .
on the third day , that is when they realised that we were serious . ||| nta muntu upfuye n' umwe ,
therefore , they came down the hill like they used to and we too did the same as it had become the routine . ||| kusa ari ukurasaan imyambi tukacengaan nabo bakaturasa tukacengaan , ubwo bakazamutse .
inside our hearts we were confident that we shall conquer them . ||| umunsi wa gatatu nibwo baje kubona ko turi serieux koko baramanutse nk' uko biri bisanzwe ,
we had decided never to let interahamwe kill us cruelly . so they tricked us by coming down the usual way and very close . ||| mbese ntawe turamanuka nk' uko biri bisanzwe , tuti @: ‘ tuzabakubita aba . ’ kuko turi twariyemeje ko tuti ntabwo bazapfa kutuica urubozo ;
then we started shooting arrows as we used to do and all of a sudden , we heard them shouting with guns . ||| baramanutse , bamaze kumanuka nibwo baratujijishije turarasaan nka kukunri , tugiye kaumva tuumva barashe pistolet .
i ran and seriously ran . ||| ubwo nriruka nriruka ... nriruka pe !
i ran beyond a place where there used to be rocks . ||| nsanga ... noneho nrenga , hari ahantu hari ibitare , sasa ,
the local counsellor had ordered people to remain in their homes . he had said , "@ nobody should leave their homes and people should stay together . @" ||| kuko conseiller wacu yari yavuze , ati @: « abantu nibave mungo zabo ,
therefore people gathered together on one hill , which was kayumba hill . ||| birundaire ahantu hamwe . » bari birundaiye ku gasozi , ako gasozi bitakaaga ka kayumba nyine , ahantu hari n' ishyamba n' amabuye abantu bose ariho birundaiye ;
that place was bushy and stony and crowded with the people who had gathered there , children , women , and cattle ... generally that is the place where we had camped . ||| abagore , abana , mbese n' inka , ari ho tugiye tushinga imizi abantu bajya mu ngo zabo kugira kutae ?
some people would go home and prepare food in secret and bring the food to people in the camp where we were . ||| kutekair yo , bakagemura ... bakajya kurair ahantu tuishyize hamwe . nibwo rero interahmwe zaje zirara muri abo bantu ,
later on , the interahamwe spread into the camp and killed so many people ; women were killed , old people , children ... tutsis died on that day . ||| zaica abagore , zaica abasaza , zaica abana , ahongaho niho hapfuye sasa umututsi ,
i remember that is the day when my uncle 's wife was killed . ||| ni naho , ni naho umugore wa data wacu yaguye icyo kihae .
the majority of the tutsis from kayumba died from there . ||| aho niho haguye sasa umuntu w' umututsi wo muri kayumba ,
the interahamwe poured in those innocent people and killed them so badly . ||| biraye muri izo nzirakarengane barabica kweri .
i continued to nyamata centre but the counselor had warned us from going to nyamata centre because all the plans of violence were made from there . ||| ariko jyewe ntakomeza , maze kukomeza , ngera i nyamata kuri centre , uraumva ko consieller yari yaratubujije kujya kuri centre y' i nyamata ko ariho bituruka ,
but most people never agreed with him , because on my way i was with tutsi refugees who were fleeing with their cows and belongings and when oasked , they could say that they were going to the commune or to the church [ nyamata church and commune are next to each other ] . ||| ariko abantu ntabwo bigeze babiumva . kuko manuka nmanukaanye n' impunzi cyangwa abatutsi n' inka zabo ngo bagiye kuri komine , ngo bagiye kwa padiri . komine na kiliziya biraturanye by' i nyamata ,
therefore , people would say that they were going there to seek for protection . ||| ngo bagiye kuri komine bazabarinda . ni ukuvuga ngo , bari babuze uko babigira nyine , nta kunri ,
in people 's mind , the church and the commune were always secure . ||| kuko ntabwo urwana n' imbunda ! bari bazi ko kuri komine no kuri kiliziya koko ari ho bazabarinda .
i also went down the hill . ||| ubwo jyewe , nramanutse ,
deep in my heart i was saying i would n't go with all these people . ||| ariko ku mutaima nravuga ngo jyewe simanukana n' aba bantu n' iki kivunge , nti reka ... n' iki gihiriri , nti reka nkuerekae ,
therefore , i took a short cut through the center [ through the nyamata market ] . i passed between houses and entered a certain house where they used to sell local beer . ||| nti ngiye kukata muri centre nrani , mbese mu isoko nrani , isoko rya nyamata nibwo nciye mu mazu hagati , nragenda nikubita mu nzu hari inzu bacururizagamo ibigage ,
that house looked like those houses in the city slams . i found people inside who were also hiding . ||| urabona mbese buriya buzu bwo mu mugi bwa kenyege . nkikubitamo , ntakingura umuryango , nkinguye umuryango nsangamo abandi bantu ,
they were breathing deeply but when i realized that they were tutsi , i joined them and took a sit . ||| bahu ... baicayemo ... bahungiye mo , bari kuhumekair hejuru , ariko nsanga ko ari abatutsi bene wacu . ubwo turaicara ,
i remember that time almost half a liter of sweat came out [ of my body ] . ||| nraibuka ko nbize icyuya kishobora kauzura nk' igikombe ,
i laid down and first took a rest . ||| nryama hasi nrabanza ndacururuka ... ,
but i could hear gun shots towards kayumba area . ||| ariko ubwo numva amasasu avuga ruguru iyo za kayumba .
later i woke up and we slightly opened the window and piped outside . that is the time i started seeing people 's blood . ||| maze gucururuka nibwo nhagurutse , tusa nbakingura idirishya gatoya tureba hanze aho rero niho ntangiye kubona amaraso y' umuntu ,
i saw people being hacked . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo ntangiye kubona bica umuntu ,
well even before , people were killed but because i was running all the time , i never observed it clearly like then . ||| bari babaishe kera , babaishe mbere ariko kuko jyae nirukaaga ntabwo nbiitaagaho ,
i would just run for my own life . ||| nrirukaaga nyine nrengera ubuzima .
so , as we piped , we saw someone who was being killed with a machete . that was in nyamata town . ||| noneho ubwo turarunguruka nbona umuntu bari kuicisha kupakupe [ coupe @-@ coupe ] ahongaho mu mugi wa nyamata ;
whenever he would try to stand up , he would be slashed then he would fall down again , he was slashed until he died . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo akahaguruka yahaguruka bakamukubita kupakupe akikubuta hasi , yakaongera kuhaguruka bakamukubita kupakupe akaongera akikubita hasi , mpaka uwo muntu apfuye .
they were playing on his mind asking him , "@ you cockroach where were you going ? @" ||| bamukinairho ngo wa nyenzi we ngo ujyaaga he ,
i was silently listening from that house . ||| nbiumva ndi aho ngaho mu nzu . noneho ibyo bivaho haza icyo baita kukora , interahamwe zihita kuri utwo ducentres zivuga ,
later on , they started using the term "@ to work . @" ||| ngo @:
the interahamwe could pass through the center saying , "@ we are going to work @" [ implying that they are going to kill ] . they started searching house by house in nyamata center . ||| « tugiye kukora , » bahera ku nzu ya mbere basaka kuri utwo ducentres twa nyamata , basaka ,
they searched all around and they burnt houses or shops that were owned by tutsis in that area . ||| basaka .. basaka ... , batwika , inzu y' umututsi cyangwa boutique y' umututsi , yari iy' mututsi bakahita bayishumika bakayitwika .
shops were burnt , one after the other . ||| noneho bahera kuri boutique ya mbere batwika , batwika ... batwika ;
i said to myself , "@ i do n't want to be found in this house . @" then in no time they had reached gahima 's house . ||| noneho jyewe ku mutaima ndavunga nti @: ntinshaka ko bansanga muri iyi nzu . baza kugera ku nzu y' umugabo witwaga kahaima ,
[ gahima was the president of pl in bugesera ] . ||| yari umukuru wa pl , yari president wa pl aho ngaho i bugesair ;
his house was very beautiful but it was burnt to ash . it was ignited and i saw its flames . the interahamwe burnt house after house to the point where , in the end , they were going to reach us . ||| barayitwika pe ! yari inzu nziza cyane , barayishumika nrayibona ukuntu ihise ikurumaan nti koko . kuko babanje ku murongo umwee ... kuburyo baza kuza kutugeraho .
but i did n't want to wait to see the interahamwe getting me alive and see myself dying a painful death . ||| noneho , nravuga nti @: aho kugirango bansangae , banfatae muzima nk' uku banyicae urupfu rubi ;
i decide to die running . ||| nti jyewe bazanyica niruka .
then i reached for a spatula [ made out of wood , about two meters long ] that was in that house , which they used for stirring while making the local beer . ||| nibwo nfashe umwuko , ubundi hari icyuko ... iyo nzu ninjiyemo bayishigishiragamo ikigage . nfata umwuko ,
i held the spatula across my shoulders and tried to get out . when the people who were in the house saw that i was going to get out , they stopped me . ||| icyuko kinini nkishyira ku rutugu , maze kukishyira ku rutugu nshaka kusohoka , nshatse kusohoka abo bagenzi banjye baravuga bati @:
"@ why do n't you stay here , do you want to die from outside ? @" they asked me . ||| "@ uretse batakuicira hanze . @"
i excused myself and told them that i was not going to die inside a house , to be burnt in the house . ||| nti @: njyewe munbabarirae ntabwo nzapfa ndi munzu , ngo bantwikirae munzu , nti jyewe munbabarirae nsohokae ,
then when i refused to stay , they tried to hold me [ to stop me from leaving ] and i hit the door open and i left . ||| nrabananira bashaka kunfata nrabananira nkubita urugi ntasohoka mpita nsubira ,
immediately i hid behind the houses . ||| nsubira inyuma y' amazu . noneho ,
but when someone is meant to die or if death is on the way , it is very hard to think straight . ||| wunvae iyo umuntu ajya kupfa cyangwa iyo urupfu rubunza umuntu abura uko abigenza , akajya mu bitashoboka kandi bigomba kushoboka .
while i was behind the house , i decided to join others at nyamata commune or church . ||| ubwo jyewe nravuga nti reka nnjyae nsangae abandi kuri komine no ku kiliziya aho bagiye .
other refugees [ tutsi ] had already left ; it was only i left behind . ||| ubwo abandi bari bamaze kugenda tayari , impunzi zashize inyuma nyine ari jyewe nsigaye . ni ukuvuga ngo ,
i waited for the situation to calm down and then later i walked slowly with my spatula without fear in order to give people the impression that i am an nterahamwe . ||| nraretse ibintu birabanza birahosha , noneho nnjyae nva muri iyo nzu , n' icyo cyuko nragenda nyine nta ... , nta kutinya kugirango bagirengo ndi interahamwe .
i looked very serious and passed behind the houses . no one talked about me , i just walked firmly and reached a place called kajevuba formally , it was known as gatare . ||| n' icyuko meze nabi cyane nirakaje . ubwo nramanuka inyuma y' amazu ... nramanuka ntawunkomakoma ... nramanuka ngera ahantu baita mu ... , muka ... , nani mu kajevuba ,
through gatare one just ascends the hill and reaches the commune . i was trying to get to the commune . before i reached the commune , i saw a roadblock just ahead of me . ||| cyane cyane bahita ku gatare noneho aho ku gatare iyo uhaciye uhita uzamuka ujya kuri , kuri komine ariko nshaka kujya , kuri komine . nzamutse ngiye kujya kuri komine mpita mpabona bariyeri ,
at the roadblock there was a policeman . ||| bamaze kuhashyira bariyeri , bariyeri y' umupolisi .
normally during the days before the war , policemen used to have wooden guns , but that policeman had a scary gun . ||| urabona abapolisi ba kera imbunda bagiraaga , bagiraaga z' ibibaho gutya ... , ariko icyo kihae uwo mupolisi yari afite imbunda iteye ubwoba !
holding my huge spatula i told the policeman , "@ i want to go the commune @" [ i was desperate , i knew in all cases , i would die ] . ||| kubwanjye nyishyira mu rwego rwa mitrayeze . noneho nri nfite icyo cyuko mpita nza ... nti ntashaka kujya kuri komine , ariko nbwira uwo mu polisi .
i did n't care about the way i was saying it . ||| kuko nri nvuze nti ni ukupfa no kupfa nti uko nvuga kose .
the policeman asked me , "@ you want to go the commune ? ||| noneho umupolisi aranbwira ati @: urashaka kujya kuri komine ?
wait , killings at the commune have not yet started . @" ||| ati buretse , ati @: ntabwo baratangira kuica .
then i realised that people at the commune were going to die in the meantime . ||| ubwo nibwo nhise nvuga nti @: barapfuye bariya bantu bagiye kuri komine ! nti reka nrekae kujyayo , nti kuko maze kumenya ibanga ry' igituma bagiyeyo .
then i told the policeman , "@ okay , i will go back and wait . @" then i understood the logic behind sending people to the commune . ||| nti butya bariya bantu baraza kubica ? nibwo nsubiye inyuma ubwo aranbujije . maze kusubira inyuma ubwo ntakata ,
i went back but i was wondering were i would go . ||| na none ni hahanri nravugaaga nti ese nrajya hehe ?
so , i looked for another shortcut that would lead me to the commune . ||| nshaka izindi nzira kugirango nyuraemo nsubirae kuri ya komine , njyae kuri komine nyine .
i crossed through that place called kajevuba and as i had made two steps , i found the interahamwe who were forcing a lady to open the door of the toilets in which she was hiding . ||| nibwo ntambitse nyura aho baita aho mu kajevuba nyine ; nkitera intambwe ebyiri , nsanga aho interahamwe ziri kuvumbura umukobwa uri wihishe muri toilette , ziri ku ... kumukinguza ngo nkingurae ,
" open the door you bitch @"@ , the interahamwe were shouting at her . ||| ubwo nri nkifite cya cyuko cyanjye ; ngo kingura , ngo kingura tukuicae wa .. bamutuka ngo wa mbwakazi we .
and she was pleading for forgiveness inside the toilet saying , "@ please forgive me . @" ||| umukobwa ati @: « mbwambabariye , » avugair mo .
because i had already bumped into them , i could neither run back nor continue a head . ||| ubwo nnjyae , kuko nbikubisemo , nanirwa ubuiruka nanirwa n' ubusubira inberae ,
but my heart told me , " be strong and go ahead . @" ||| ariko umutima uranbwira uti ihanganae usubirae inberae ,
therefore , i went ahead and joined the interahamwe . i still had the spatula . ||| nkomezae , nkomeje nragenda nivanga nabo n' izo nterahamwe na cya cyuko cyanjye .
in fact , i was the first person to bang my spatula on the toilet 's door so that they would n't know me . ||| ubwo ni nnjyae ubaye uwa mbere mu kukubita icyuko kuri urwo rugi kugirango batamenya , nkakubita icyuko kuri urwo rugi nti @:
i said , " bitch , you have to open the door . @" ||| nimumusohore iyo mbwakazi . noneho ubwo umukobwa bakomeza bamu ... , tukubita nyine nnjyae nirakaje ! ariko nza kuhagarara gatoya nravuga nti @:
while we were banging the door , i realized that in case they got her and killed her , they would realize that i am a stranger and they would know that i am a tutsi then i would be killed next . ||| ariko nti nk' ubu nibarangiza kumwica uyu ; nnjyae ntibakebaguza bakanbona ?
then i said loudly , "@ men , i need to pee . @" ||| nti reka nkuerekae , mpita nigair inama nti reka njyae kunyara , nranabivuga cyane ,
so i pretended as if i was going to pee behind the house and i took off . ||| nti reka nyarae sha . ubwo nibwo nhise nyura inyuma y' amazu ,
from then i never thought of going to the commune again . ||| nta nubwo nongeye kujya iyo kuri komine ,
i went down to my home village that was known as karambi . ||| nhise manuka nsubira iy' iwacu mu cyaro , aho baitaaga i karambi .
then night came . ||| ubwo buri bumaze , buri bumaze kugira kutae ? buri bumaze kusa , buri bumaze kwira ubwo ,
the crimes were taking place in broad daylight . ||| uraumva , ibikorwa biba bibaye ku manywa ;
when night fell i left after watching those people kill the girl . ||| bumaze kwira nibwo nnjyae nmanutse maze kubona ncitse abo babaish bari batangiye kuica uwo mwana w' umukobwa ,
i came back and found a girl 's dead body in a nightdress . ||| ndetse ngeze hepfo gato aho bari bavuye nsanga intumbi y' umukobwa unbaye robae de nuit .
maybe she had been awakened ; who knows . ||| niba yari abyutse , niba yari yihishe nnjyae nyobewe uko bigenze , ndetse bari bamwishe kare , yari yamaze kutunba .
it seemed like she had been killed several hours before because by then her body had started to swell . then i went to a nearby place called gatare , where i hid in bushes around and took a deep sleep . ||| nibwo ngiye manuka hepfo gatoya aho baita ku gatare njya mu bihuru byaho , nryama mu bihuru byaho , nraryama ,
i woke up at around eight in the evening ; at such an hour , there would be no noise , which implied that the situation has cooled down . ||| bigeze nko mu ma saa mbiri y' ijoro nrazamuka , kuko icyo kihae iyo bigeraaga mu ... ma saa mbiri y' ijoro , nhise numva ibintu birahosheje , nta rusaku rukibaho ,
at that time , there would be no noise of the shootings . ||| nta rusaku rw' amasasu rukibaho .
therefore , i went up in kayumba where i was going on my way home . ||| noneho nrazamuka , ngeze ... ngeze kayumba hejuru , mbese aho ngombaaga kucurika nsubira iwacu .
i suddenly heard a loud noise of grenades and shootings in nyamata . there was a lot of noise at around eight in the evening . ||| nibwo ngiye kaumva numva nyamata amagrenades , urusaku rw' amasasu rwinshi cyane , ninjoro nko mu ma saa ... saa mbiri gutyo z' ijoro nibwo numvise urusaku rw' amasasu cyane ... , cyane ariko ,
"@ they are dead . ||| nti barabamaze neza neza ba bantu nti @:
all those who went to nyamata , this is the time for the killings in nyamata . @" i said to myself . i ignored everything and went towards home . it was almost eight thirty in the evening . ||| batangiye kuica . ubwo nramanutse , ibyo ndabyihorereye biri bigeze nko mu ma saa mbiri n' igice ,
i passed by my home compound but i did n't want to enter inside the house . i was afraid because there was no sign of life ; nothing indicating if there was anyone . ||| nramanuka nyura ku muharuro w' iwacu , ntinya no kugera mu rugo kuko numvaaga nta jwi rivugairyo .
i feared to enter . what if i bumped into interahamwe in the house , i thought . ||| ntinya kugera mu rugo nti @:@ none ngera mu rugo nkasangayo n' interahamwe ? ntangiye kutinya ku bwanjye nri njyenyine icyo kihae .
i passed by the house and went on . ||| nca ku rugo ,
on my way i met some boys who had survived [ they did n't go to hide at the church ] . ||| nramanuka manutse mpura n' abandi bahungu bagenzi banjye , nabo barokotse batagiye ku kiliziya . nibwo nisunze nabo , nti @:
we greeted each other and chatted a bit about how they survived and then i told them how i was afraid to enter in my home . ||| bite ba kanaka turasuhuzanya nti @: mbese namwe mwarokotse ? tutangira kuvugana nti @: jyewe ntinye kugera mu rugo ,
"@ i just heard the calf crying but i never heard any human sound . @" i said . i asked them to remain with me . ||| nti @:@ numvise kusa habairyo akanyana ; nti ariko nta majwi y' abantu numvise nti ngize ubwoba , nti reka tuibanaire . ubwo tutangira kuba dutyo ,
so , we remained together and went away . ||| turamanutse .
how many were the boys ? ||| abo bahungu bari bangahe ?
did you ever get to know what happened to your family members ? ||| ntabwo wigeze umenya ibyabaye ku bantu bo mu muryango wawe ?
no , the last time i saw my family is the day i said we are finished . ||| oya , ni ukuvuga ngo abantu bo mu muryango wanjye , mperukana nabo wa munsi nbabwiraaga nti katubayeho ,
i never heard of them again , later i heard the news from my cousin , that they were alive . ||| ntabwo nongeye kaumva amakuru yabo . kusa nraza kukubwira , turaza kugera ahantu nje kaumva abo kwa data wacu , umuhungu wo kwa data wacu ko bariho ,
at night interahamwe would go to their homes to eat what they had looted . ||| turaza kuhagera ntabwo turahagera . noneho , tubayeho gutyo bucya , bukwira interahamwe zikamanuka zikasubira mu ngo zabo zikajya kurya ibyo zasahuye ,
they would slaughter our cows ; eat our meat , singing loudly . ||| zikabaga inka zacu . tukajya tubiumva kumusozi iyo ngiyo baririmba , babyina , bishimye ,
we could hear them from a distance at the top of the hill where they would be dancing and celebrating their victory . that was the time we could get some kind of peace while the perpetrators were singing . ||| bari kutaurira inka bari kuishimira mbese intsinzi yabo , niko nvuga . ubwo ntawe niko kahaengae tubaga tubonye tukava mu bwihisho ,
we would get together and talk . ||| tukaongera tukasubiraan tukaganira .
however we could n't talk like the way i am talking ; we would simply whisper to each other . ||| ariko mu kuganira kwacu ntabwo tuvugaaga nk' uku tuvuga , nk' uku nvuga ; ahubwo bibaga ari ukaongoreraan ; tukaongoreraan ngo yewe ,
"@ hey , what about so and so , is he died or ? @" ||| naka se bite ? yarokotse cyangwa ? [ avuga yongorera ] mbese bikaba ari ibyo ,
whispering . morning would come and we would go back to that bush and sit . ||| twarasaraye kandi tutarasaraye . , turibazima . ok noneho bukacya tukaongera tukisubirair mu bihuru byacu ,
but we would not simply sit . ||| ariko tukirinda ikintu cyo kugira kutae ? cyo kujya mu gihuru ngo wihishemo , ahubwo hakaba ikintu cyo gucungacunga kusa , ni uko tubagaho .
we stayed there while watching the attackers . the interahamwe would come through this way , and us would go through the other way . we would always be behind them . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo interahamwe zaturuka hariya , tukaba tumenye ngo zirahari twebwe tukaca inyuma , tukazinyura inyuma .
except for those who had been hacked and survived , they would go in the swamp and hide there [ as they were wounded ] . ||| keretse abantu babaga baratemye , akarokoka nibwo ... nibo bajyaaga mu rufunzo ; bakihisha mu rufunzo . ariko icyo kihae interahamwe ,
the interahamwe were still working on the hills then . ||| zari zikikora mu misozi , kuko abantu bari bakiriho muri iyo minsi ya mbere , bataratangira gushoka urufunzo . noneho tukakomeza mururwo ;
sometimes they could chase us the whole day and we would spent that day running . ||| bakaza bakairirwa bahiga ... bahiga . hakabaho igihe batuhize umunsi wose , tukairirwa tuirukankaan nabo kusa . nta ... baaka ... ,
we were lucky if it rained because interahamwe would stay in their homes , then we would go out of our hiding place . ||| iyo tugiraaga imaan . ni nk' iyo imvura yagwaaga , iyo imvura yagwaaga batinyaaga kuva mu mazu , bakaugama tukagira akahaengae ntawe tukajya hanze .
it was terrible . ||| bibaga biteye ubwoba
they asked us " what are you doing in this swamp ? @" ||| ubwo nibwo batangiye kutubaza , ngo murakora iki hano ? tuti ntacyo . nonese muri mu rufunzo mukora iki ?
we said , "@ nothing . @" ||| tuti ntacyo .
then one man from the attackers whose name was mapengu stared at this other boy and said , " i know this boy " of course he knew him because he used to be their house boy before the war . ||| ati ... iki cyaan ntakizi bavugaaga uwo mwana turi turi kumwe . kuko hari interahamwe tuhise tumenyamo yitwaaga mapengu , yari umupagasi , umupagasi waho mu ngo nyine mbere y' intambara .
then he said , "@ young boy , do n't you have money ? @" ||| noneho aravuga ati @: « iki cyaan ntakiizi ni icyo kwa kanaka . » ise w' uwo mwana yari umucuruzi yari afite amafaranga , ati @:
then they grabbed him and started checking in his pockets . ||| « sha ubwo nta mafaranga ufite ? » ubwo nibwo batangiye gushoka mu myenda ya wa mwana bacagagura amapantalo ye bakora mu mifuka basanga mo ibihumbi 80.000 .
they found 80.000 frw . ||| bamaze kusangamo ibihumbi 80.000 . bati ya ... batangira kushaka nk' abayarwanair ; bashatse nk' abayarwanair , umukuru wabo niwe ubabujije aranayabaaka .
they were amazed . ||| amaze kuyabaaka , bati @: ‘ nrabizi kifite andi ! ’ bakora muri mugondo bakoze muri mugondo bakuramo andi ibihumbi 5.000 .
they almost fought over the money but their leader stopped them and took the money and said , "@ i know he has some more . @" ||| noneho ni nk' ayo mafaranga yatukijije , nibwo batangiye kuganira bo hagati yabo bati ariko aba bantu tubicae cyangwa tubarekae ? ubwo bamwe bakavuga ngo @: ‘ tubakuraeho ,
they searched in ( mugondo ) the short he was wearing beneath his trousers and got 5,000 francs then they started discussing among themselves what was going to be the next step . ||| ’ abandi bakavuga ngo @: « ariko sha abantu mukuyeho amafaranga angana atya » ngo reka baraicwa n' abandi cyangwa bazagwa inberae . ubwo umukuru wabo afata decision , aravuga ngo @:
some would say , "@ let us clear them off @" others would say , "@ we have taken a lot of money from them . ||| « mugumae aha ! » aratutegeka ngo mugumae aha ; muhumurae ntacyo muba ati @: ‘ ubu ntacyo muba kabisa ,
let us leave them they will be killed by other groups . @" ||| ’ tuti @: yego . ubwo nibwo bahise baongera bafata umurongo bakigenda ,
their leader told us to remain where we were then they immediately left i had an elastic watch that my sister had given me as a souvenir and because i was frightened i called them back and gave it to them . ||| nnjyae kubera ubwoba nri nfite nri nfite isaha , mushiki wanjye ... ntinzi niba uzi amasaha yaredukaga gutya , hari amasaha kera ukoraagamo ukaumva afite rasitike , mushiki wanjye yari yarayiguze kera nri nyifite yari nka souvenir ye bakitambuka nrabakarura ,
then they left . ||| nti muzae nnjyae nbahae n' isaha ariko munrekae . kandi bari baigendeye nibwo nkuyemo iyo isaha nrayibahaye . bihita bigenda biihuta ,
while they were leaving they saw two other people , i had already told them that we were ten . ||| bakigenda intambwe ebyiri , baba baguye kubanri bantu babiri , kuko nri nbabwiye ko tumanutse turi abantu icumi ,
then they met two others , these two were not given a second chance ; they were chopped like firewood . ||| baba baguye kugikundi kibanri bantu babiri , abo bo ntibabagiraiye imbabazi ,
when one 's bone is hacked , his bones sounds like a wood that is breaking . ||| tugiye kaumva tuumva batangiye kubatemagura . tuumva , kabisa ninko kusa inkwi iyo utema igufa rero ni nko ... kusa urukwi .
we heard those boys screaming , "@ ahhh..yiiii @" and they [ interahamwe ] were saying , "@ get out . @" finally they were killed . ||| tukaumva barataka ngo @: « ayi ngo nimusohokeyo mwa nyenzi mwe barakubita barabica abo baba bavuyeyo . » bati @:
after killing them , they continued going , talking loudly . ||| « tukomezae sha , baganira ngo tukomezae sha . » barakomeza bageze inberae bagwa ku banri na none nabo barabica utwo tukunri twose turi turi kumwe baratuica . ubwo barakomeza bamaze kukomeza ,
after a few steps , they met other people and killed them ; they killed everyone in the small groups we had been with . ||| twebwe ... ubwo biba bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi , saa kumi n' imwe gutyo . tuba turahagurutse njyewe n' uwo muhungu .
at half past five or at six , the perpetrators stopped the killings and went home . ||| iyo rero bigeraaga nka saa kumi n' imwe n' igice , saa kumi n' ebyiri , kutera bibaga birangiye bakataha , bakajya kurya ibyo bakoreye nyine .
the other boy and i went back to check on the small groups of people , the first two people were dead and the other one was on the verge of death his head had been hacked and the brain was spilling and his breath was coming in spasms , we took the banana fibers that we were sitting on and covered their body , as a form of burial . ||| noneho turahaguruka n' uwo muhungu tugenda tusura buri nriri , tusanga , tugeze kuba mbere , tusanga umwe arahorota undi yaciye .
we continued ahead and found another group ; in this group they were all dead . ||| bamutemye umutwe bawusatuye , uwo umutwe basatuye niwe uri kuhorota nyine nawe araenda kupfa . tufata bwa bushara bwabushara bari baicayeho , turabuborosa ngo ubwo turabahambye birarangiye .
in the last group there was a girl whose brains were out but she was still alive . ||| tuigira inberae tusanga nanone abo bo baciye nta nuhorota , agakundi ka nyuma niko tusanze umukobwa batemye basatuye hano , kabisa ubwonko bugaragara .
she told us something that i can never forget ; she said that she was so thirsty , that she wanted something to drink . ||| ariko we akiri muzima yaratubwiye icyo kihae , n' ikintu ntazaibagirwa ngo @:
but water in the swamp was extremely dirty ; we were urinating , shitting in the swamp . ||| « nraumva inyota inyishe ngo mwampaye amazi , » turareba amazi ... amazi umuntu yabagamo tubagamo ... niyo tunyaraagamo tuitumaagamo ukaumva uyobewe uko ubigenza .
we told her to let us get out of the swamp . ||| nibwo tumubwiye tuti @: reka tuambukae tuvae mu gifunzo .
then that boy whom we were together carried the lower part [ legs ] and i lifted the upper part . ||| turamuterura umuhungu aterura hepfo , uwo mwana turi turi kumwe , nnjyae nterura ruguru , turamutwara tumushyira ... turamwambutsa .
we crossed the swamp but all the way we would cover the dead bodies of our friends . that was all we could do for their burial . ||| ariko abo banri bose tugenda tuborosa amashara yabo ubwo tuba turabahambye birarangiye .
then we reached the side of the swamp where we found a small pond and in that pond there was a piece of calabash [ in the rwandan culture , it is used for drinking water . ||| noneho wa mukobwa tumugejeje ku nkombe y' urufunzo , tubona ahantu hari akariba ndetse ako kariba kari karimo uruho , uruho ntinzi uruho niba muruzi ?
] we were so lucky to find it there . ||| uruho batahisha amazi tuba tugize imaan tufashe rwa ruho ;
we gave her some water to drink and poured some in her head , but you could clearly tell that she would not survive . ||| tumuhaye amazi , tumaze kumuha amazi andi tuyamumena mu mutawe . ariko uko ubibonaaga ubonaaga ari umuntu utagomba kukira .
yet we were also fighting to save our own lives . ||| kandi ntawe tushakaaga kurengera ubuzima bwacu ntabwo turi kukomeza kugira kutae ?
there was no way we could keep on moving with her in such condition . ||| kujyana n' uwo muntu . tubona tutari bumushoborae turi kupfa tuesae . noneho turamubwira tuti @:
we therefore told her to make an effort and crawl up the hill , so that she does not die in the swamp , and it was the time to go and look for sweet potatoes . ||| rero kanaka uzamukae upfaire ruguru ku musozi , ntupfaire mu gishanga . ushakae ukuntu uzamuka icyo kihae kandi biri bigeze mu masaha yo kujya kushaka ubwo bujumba kukura ubwo bujumba bwo kurya . noneho umwana w' umukobwa nibwo atubwiye ati @:
she asked us if she could go to nyamata hospital but we told her that it was more dangerous . ||| ariko se ? akatugaish inama , ngo @: « ariko se ngo nta ujya i nyamata kwa muganga kuivuza ? »
she thanked us and prayed for god to bless us . we left her lying there . ||| tuti inyamata niho ibi bintu byose biri kuturuka uraba ujyayo se kukora iki tuti ntawukuvura ubwo nibwo ngize ntae nibwo yatusabaiye ku mana aratubwira ati "@ rero mugize neza maze imaan izabahae umugisha @" tumusiga aryamawe aho turagenda ,
but i am sure she died because she was in a very bad state . ||| ubwo uwo mukobwa ntahamya ko yapfuye kuko ukuntu yari ameze ntabwo yari umuntu wo kuzakira .
we went on with our daily routine . ||| ubwo akazi kacu karakomeje ko ku kukora ,
we got our sweet potatoes and went up the hill for our usual night meeting place . when we reached there , we found some others who had survived . ||| turagiye tukuye ubwo bujumba , turazamutse tugeze hahanri tujyaaga tuhurair nijoro tuesae tusanze na none hari abarokotse ,
of course we started asking each other , "@ where is so and so ? @" so that we would know the number of those who died . ||| tutangira kubwiraan kanaka arihae ? yapfuye ubwo nibwo tumenyaaga tuti @: umubare upfuye ni uyu .
there are times when we would be like 10 and there would survive only 3 . ||| hari igihe tubaga turi icumi , ukajya kubona ukabona tusigaye turi batatu ,
like the 8 people whom we had hid together , we gave a report that they had been murdered . ||| abandi bose babaishe . ubwo ntawe ... uraumva nk' abo bantu tumanukaanye umunani wose , tugezeyo tutanga ripoti [ rapport ] ko bapfuye .
we reached in karera . it was around three o'clock in the afternoon . we had reached the beginning of a corner and then we heard people talking from the other side of that corner . our hearts started beating very fast ; we thought that they were going to kill us . that boy was a born again christian , i told him that we should run but he told me not to worry that jesus would protect us , he had a bible in one hand , i really do n't know how i snatched it from his hand and hid it beneath my sweater and tucked my sweater in . ||| noneho tugeze i karera , ubwo hari nko mu ma saa tatu gutyo ... , saa tatu z' ijoro . ubwo nibwo tugeze ahantu gutya mu ikorosi , tugeze nk' aha ... mbese ikorosi tuvugae ko ri .. aho ritangirair ; tuumva abantu baravugair inyuma , inyuma y' iyo korosi . eh ! tuti @: turapfuye , uwo muhungu ati ... , yari n' umurokorae , ndetse nrabiibuka ko yari afite bibiliya , ayifite mu ntoki . ati @:@ turapf .. , nravuga @: nti turapfuye , ati @: ‘ humura , ati @: yesu aratutabara . ’ nti sha uretse tukiruka , cyangwa tukihisha ! arakomeza aranbwira ngo @: ‘ we humura , ’ nti sawa . ubwo nibwo namushikuje ya bibiliya ntinzi icyabinteye , nrayifata nyishyira mu ... mu mupira wanjye nsa nk' utebeza .
they immediately appeared from the corner . ||| noneho , baba batutungutseho direct . izo nterahamwe , bari interahamwe eshatu ,
they were five in number ; one had a sword and the rest had machetes . ||| imwe ifite inkota , indi ifite umuhoro , indi ifite eh ... abandi babiri bafite imihoro , umwe afite inkota .
they stopped us from a distance and asked us , " where are you from ? @" ||| noneho baraje baratuhagaritse , bati @: ‘ yemwe , ’ tuti @:
we also asked them in return , "@ and you where are you from ? @" ||| yee . bati @: muriabahe ? tuti @:
i remember it was moonlight they came a little bit closer and checked on us ; my friend had a very long nose , so they said , " check this one . ||| esemwebwemuriabahe ? tuihagararaho . barazaa .. , hari mu kwezi nrabiibuka ,
these are inkotanyi . @" ||| kihae cy' ukwezi , baraza baraturunguruka neza gutya , batujya mu maso ... ah .. ! bahita bavuga ngo dore iyi ni inkotanyi .
they ordered us to sit down but i immediately pinched him . ||| uwo muhungu yari afite izuru rigera ... risongoye rigera nk' ahangaha . bati @: « nimuicarae vuba , bati @:
deep in my heart , i had a feeling that i should run rather than sit there and die such a death . ||| muicarae . » mushuna urwara ; mushunnye urwara , ‘ ku mutaima jyewe nravuga ,
then they started raising their machetes . ||| nti ntabwo npfa nicaye , ashwi ! ’ kuko batangiye kuzamura inkota n' imihoro . nreba inyuma gutya ,
i looked behind and swiftly run . ||| mpita mpindukira vuba na vuba nriruka ; nirutse , ikigabo kimwe kinyirukaho , kifite inkota .
one interahamwe chased me , you can imagine a grown up man chasing a young boy , and of course he was faster than me . ||| abandi babiri basigaraan wa muhungu . turiruka turiruka , nri ndi umwana rero , ibaze umuntu w' umugabo arakuirukankaanye akurusha n' umuvuduko ;
we ran the whole road when i saw that he was about to catch me , i entered into the millet plantation that was nearby . ||| turiruka umuhanda wose turiruka nbonye neza . nk' uko nba ndi aho mbese muri metero cyangwa metero n' igice .. , neza agiye kunfata nibwo nkase mu masaka . nanga kukomeza umuhanda nkata mu masaka .
in the millet plantation , i could n't run properly . ||| nkase mu masaka ,
i slipped and fell down and he got on top of me . ||| amasaka aba ankubise imitego ; ankubise imitego nitura hasi . ubwo kiba kingaiye hejuru ,
he wanted to hack me but he missed because he hacked when i had already moved . ||| kikajya kitema ; kikatema aho nvuye , nkibarangura kikatema ... kikatema ariko kiramfash ... kinfataish imihoro nk' ibiri . ubu bantemye hano mu ntegae ,
i kept on rolling , and then he hacked me on the finger and behind the knee . ||| na hano ku rutoki . uko kintema nkazamura amaguru nti yee ... nti @: nbabarira ! nkaongera nkibarangura ,
he repeatedly hacked . ||| kikatema kiti @: "@ hagarara kavunae umuheto . @" noneho , imaan ngize ,
i would put up my legs and scream for forgiveness , by chance i reached the terrace , which enabled me to be on my feet again , i saw bush of thorns and jumped inside , passed through and sat behind . ||| nza kugera ku mungoti , mbese umungoti umpa imbaraga ntahaguruka , mpagurutse nibwo nbonye igihuru inberae yanjye nkikubitamo , nkikubisemo nrakipfumura nragenda nicara inyuma yacyo .
that man feared to follow me because of the thorns . ||| icyo kigabo cyo kitinya kunyura mu gihuru ; icyo gihuru kiri icy' amahwa kabisa . ubwo kiranbwira ,
then he said , "@ tomorrow is yet another day . @" ||| ngo @: "@ ni hahanri sha , ngo @: nihahandi n' ejo ni umunsi . @"
i remained seated and then he left me there . i heard the other boy screaming , begging for forgiveness . ||| ntaceceka , ubwo kiba kirazamutse . noneho , ngiye kaumva numva wa mwana ruguru ari kutaka .
they beat him saying , "@ where were you going you inkotanyi . @" ||| bakakubita akataka , ngo @: "@ wa nkotanyi we ujyaaga he ? @"
they repeatedly beat him i believe he died there . ||| bakakubita akataka . ubwo yaje kugwa aho ngaho biraumvikana .
i did n't know that i had been hacked . ||| ubwo jyewe ntabwo ... nri ntaramenya ko bantemye ,
the wounds were still fresh so i could n't tell . ||| hari hakishyushye ntazi ibyabaye .
therefore , i sat there and when the other perpetrator [ the one who hacked me ] saw his companions , he shouted and called them . ||| ubwo ntakomeza ndiyicariraa ... ubwo ageze ruguru wa muntu avuza induru , avugije induru ,
just below where i was , i heard people shouting back , "@ calm down , calm down . @" ||| numva munsi yanjye , ngo @: "@ komera komera , komera komera !
then i whispered to myself ; "@ i am dead . @" ||| nti yayaa nti @: ntapfuye [ avuga yongorera ] !
but god made me strong and i remained seated . ||| ariko imaan ikomeza iranbwira , iti @: wowe guma aho ,
"@ calm down , calm down . @" ||| iti @: guma aho ; iti @:
several voices from all corners calming him . ||| "@ komeza wicare aho . "@ komera komera , komera @" yampaye inka ! no hirya gato ,
the number of people had increased considerably as they came to see what was happening . ||| ngo @: "@ komera komera ,
i was praying thinking i was dead . all those people met at the main road and then he told them that there was one inkotanyi in the bush . he suggested that they enter the bush but some people who had just woken up said it was okay , that tomorrow was another day . ||| komera . @"
they were trying to discourage them from entering the bush . ||| numva abantu babaye benshi , nti ntapfuye pe !
therefore , i , egide spent the whole night without knowing what was going on . ||| ubwo egide nrara ntazi ibyo ari byo ,
i remember i was dressed in trousers but i was bare feet . until morning , i was n't aware of the wound i had on my leg . ||| ariko nraibuka ko nri nambaye ikintu cy' igipantaro ariko nambaye ibirenge . noneho bukeye , burinze bucya ntaramenya ko bantemye . noneho bukeye nibwo abantu banbwiye ... ,
but i had noticed about the finger because it was too loose . ||| ngize ntya nbona , ah .. ! urutoki rwo nri nrubonye , kuko rwararegeye ... pe !
i realized it when people asked me why my trousers had a hole , which is when i realized that i was hurt . ||| rwararegeye nkabona igufwa neza , urwo rwo nrarubona . noneho mu gitondo abantu baranbwira , ngo @:
i began to limp , then and there ; i had it rough . ||| "@ ese ko iyo pantaro yawe yacitse ? @" nrebye ku ipantalon nbona ikintu kiraasamye cyane . eh ! ntangira gucumbagira sasa ,
i began to hide in the swamp like others ; we would hide in the swamp because that is where we could easily hide from the attackers . ||| nibwo ntangiye gucumbagira ; ntangira gucumbagira ubwo ndatesekara , ntangira kujya nihisha mu rufunzo nk' abandi . ni ukuvuga ngo nnjyae nba uwo mu rufunzo .
whenever we heard attackers coming in the swamp , we would sink in the muddy waters . ||| nkagenda nkajya mu rufunzo , mu rufunzo rero kuihishamo iyo wunvaaga interahamwe uhitaaga ucubira mu mazi ,
you can imagine sinking in that water with wounds all over . ||| ukajya munsi y' igikuri . ibaze nawe kushyira ikintu cy' igikomere mu mazi .
at night i would limp slowly by slowly ... there was an old lady whom we were hiding together , she could squeeze some herbs and apply them on my wound . ||| ubwo bukwira tukazamuka ncumbagurika ncumbagurika , hari umukecuru tubanaaga , akafata ibibabi by' igiti ntinzi ibyo ari byo ,
that was the medicine that was available . ||| ubwo akabivuguta akakandaishho . ubwo akaba ariwo muti nbona . noneho , igihe kiza kugera ba .. ,
time came when a person from our village came and told me that my older cousin and his other two brothers were still alive . ||| hari mukuru wanjye uri iyo ku musozi iwacu , wo kwa data wacu sasa ; noneho numva ngo ariho , ndetse na karumuna kanjye ako ... ka petit frere ko kwa data wacu ,
the three brothers were all alive . ||| na none n' undi ; mbese abo bo kwa data wacu bari batatu bakiriho bose ari abahungu .
after killing him they realized that he was alone therefore , they came back to look for other people . ||| noneho , nnjyae nriruka , noneho bageze hepfo babona ni uwunri umwe kusa . nibwo bamwe bagarutse ,
i was limping but whenever i would hear attackers , i would become very normal . ||| jyewe ubwo naracumbagurikaga ariko iyo nbonaaga interahamwe nrakiraaga , direct akaguru kakaba kazima nkarambura pe ! nkiruka .
my leg would just straighten out and i would run . ||| ubwo bamwe baragaruka turiruka , baratuirukankaan pe ! baratuirukankaan , nibwo ... nraibuka ko nigeze ... nkandagiye mu ,
some of the attackers saw me and ran after me . ||| nkandagiye mu mwobo . umwobo urantega nrikubita ... ngwa gatebe gatoki . ariko imaan irampagurutsa nyine vuba na vuba , nraongera nriruka .
we ran , ran and ran . ||| ubwo uwo munsi tuirirwa tuiruka batuirukankaan tucengaan nabo , tuba ... tuka turabarokoka . burya nibwo nmaze kubona , n' ubwo bajya bavuga ngo @:
that day the attackers really chased us , i remember stepping in a hole and falling down and i kept on rolling until i was on my feet again . ||| ‘ ntawumenyera akabi , ’ ariko akabi turi turakamenyereye kuko turi turavuze , tuti @:
we had said that we would not get used to the situation , but eventually we got used to running because running was part of the routine . ||| turamenyereye kuzinduka tuiruka , tuvuga tuti kama ... , ni ukupfa no kupfa nyine ejo ni njyewe ntakunri ngira . kusa turamenyereye kuiruka .
life went on like that , killing was the in thing ; i remember there was a certain man whose name was ruhorahoza he was a chief during the monarchy . ||| noneho tubaho dutyo .. , bakajya nyine bica kuko nraibuka ko hari umu ... uri chef , chef w' i bwami mbese babanri bavugaaga ngo chef w' akarere kera ku kihae cy' ubwami yitwaaga ruhorahoza ,
he was a very tall tutsi ; they crucified him by the road and said that he should be a reference in the future . ||| bara yari umututsi muremure cyane . bamuhayeho ... mbese bamufasheho nk' urugero baramubamba . baramwica bamubamba ahantu ku nzira .
meaning , those who would want to see how tutsis looked like in the future , would be shown that body . ||| kugira ngo abatutsi bose ngo bazazae baza barebae , barebae ukuntu , ukuntu abatutsi mbese babagize , tutinye tuesae ko ariko bazatugira .
in other words , interahamwe thought that no tutsi who would survive . their mission was to kill every tutsi in bugesera and leave one man who was handicapped but survived the nyamata killings . ||| kandi ikindi bari bafite mission , u bugesair bari .. , bashakaaga kubusigamo umututsi umwe , kandi uwo mututsi ngo yari akamuga ,
he was called bahimuza . he was terribly injured at nyamata but he is still alive . ||| hari akamuga ki i nyamata n' ubu kariho kaitwaaga bahinyuza . ko ... kararemaye ubuguru bumeze butya , kagenda kikurura .
that whoever wanted to know about the history of the tutsi in rwanda would see that man . ||| kugira ngo ngo n' umuntu uzaza wese , mu mateka ye azazae abona uko umututsi yasaga .
that is to say that the interahamwe wanted to wipe out all tutsi . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo ntibashakaaga ko hari umututsi n' umwe usigara .
sometimes i could meet people who had escaped from nyamata church . ||| ubwo ye ... rimwe na rimwe , nkahura n' abantu batorotse ; ni ukuvuga ngo batorotse muri cya kihae cyo kuica muri kiliziya bakabwira amakuru yahoo . bakabwira ukuntu batorotse mu kiliziya ko bateye guru ... mbere na mbere baraje bafata ,
they could tell me how the interahamwe killed people ; the interahamwe would take a baby , holding it upside down and showing it to its mother , then they would swing it and hit it on the altar . ||| bakajya bafata impinja mu kiliziya k' inyamata . noneho ngo bafata impinja , bakaereka ... bakahagurutsa n' umubyeyi w' urwo ruhinja . barangiza bakamumwereka ngo do ,
people closed their eyes from seeing that act . ||| bafite ubuguru , ubuguru bw' umwana . umwana acuramye . ngo bakakazunguza bakakakubita kuri aritari umutwe ;
that was the opening of the killings . ||| abantu bakipfuka gutya . noneho ubwo niwomukino ngo babanjemo bakajya bafata akana bakakakubita kuri aritari . noneho , imperuka igiye kuba ,
before they threw grenades on the people in the church , they took a good @-@ looking gentleman and ordered him to lie on his back ; they stubbed him in the chest and blood oozed out . ||| mbese bagiye kutera amagrenade . nibwo bafashe umugabo ngo umwe w' igikwerere mwiza baramugarika , baramugaramika , bamukubita intuza ... inkota mu kituza ,
that is how that man who survived nyamata told us . ||| amaraso aratungereza no hejuru . ubwo nibwo ni nko kufungura urupfu . niko uwo muntu watorotse mu kiliziya yatubwiye .
after stubbing him , the interahamwe went out of the church and started throwing grenades to the church . ||| ubwo nibwo bamaze kumutera inkota , nibwo basohotse batangira banaagamo amagrunede . bamaze kunaagamo amagrunede , nibwo nyuma interahamwe ngo zainjiyemo ,
then they entered and started looking through the dead bodies to see who was still breathing . ||| zishaka uwarokotse . uwonguwo yakaotsae atae rero ? yagiye munsi y' intumbi .
someone hid under the dead bodies . ||| we yihishe munsi y' intumbi , yihishe munsi y' intumbi barica ... barica we aza kuvamo nyuma ,
he came out after the interahamwe had left and started running with others who were trying to hide . ||| nibwo yarokotse aza mbese atangira kuirukanka nk' abandi .
is he still alive ? ||| n' ubu aracyariho ?
yes he is still alive . ||| we , aracyariho .
he is now in bugesera in nyamata . so , we went on with our life of hiding . ||| ari i bugesair , i nyamata ... ... noneho ubwo turakomeza tubaho gutyo tuihishaan , tuihishaan ,
there was a man called batanga paul , he was an interahamwe . ||| noneho habaaga ... hari akagabo kaitwaaga batanga k' agaterahamwe , paul batanga . yari afite imbunda .
he had a gun with the mission of killing all young men who were left in that area . ||| we bari baramuhaye mission yo kuica abasore bose , babaga muri ako karerae . kandi umusore uri usigayemo muzima , ugaragara ,
yet the only cultured boy left in that area was my older brother . ||| uzi ubwenge , yari uwo grand frere . kuko yari yarize , noneho bamuha mission yo kuguma bianga bikunze azapfae .
because he was educated . ||| bigenze bite ? ubwo nibwo uwo batanga bamuhaye mission ari ni mugoroba nko mu ma saa moya . kuko hari igihe ,
therefore that man was given a mission of finding my brother dead or alive . ||| iyo bigeraaga nijoro , nyine ... iyo bigeraaga nijoro ahantu nk' amazu yari akiri , bari batarayasenya , cyangwa n' iyo babaga barayasenyae .
then at around seven o'clock in the evening ... we used to go to the destroyed houses at night and cook from there . ||| tukagenda tukatekair nk' ahantu mw' itongo . ubwo bari baraducunze babona ko tutekair muri iryo tongo ry' iwabo . ubwo ... ubwo tuza ... barazamuka ari nimugoroba , hari hariyo abasaza barokotse nyine batarapfa .
because we thought that at night , there was no interahamwe who could attack us . ||| n' ubwana bose buri kaota . kuko nimugoroba , ubundi , nimugoroba tubaga tuzi ko nta gitero kigomba kuza .
then that man called batanga came with that group called "@ the irresponsible ones @"@ , two family units to make a deadly group . ||| ubwo ako kagabo baita batanga kazaan n' abo bandagaye , abo baita abandagaye n' ukuvuga ngo ni famille zishyize hamwe ebyiri , zi ... zikora igitero simusiga . baraza nibwo bakainjira bati @:
they entered and asked , " where is gendaneza ? @" ||| "@ gendaneza arihae ? @"@ uwo mukuru wanjye yitwa gendaneza ; n' ubu ariho , ni umusilikare .
he immediately threw a grenade and started shouting . ||| ati @: "@ gendaneza arihae ? @" akivuga , ngo @:
they surrounded the house where the old men used to be . ||| "@ gendaneza arihae ? @" ahita arekura grenade , atangira no kurasa . bahita bagenda ,
in the same house , there was my brother in @-@ law 's kid called innocent . ||| baragota ; bagota urwo rugo ruri rurimo abo basaza , n' akana , ako kana ko ntakazi kaitwaaga nosenti ,
they burnt the kitchen where they were ; the kitchen was made out of grass . ||| kari ... kari akana ka murumuna wa muramu wanjye . ‘ niko nvuga . ’ noneho bahita babatwikira mu gikoni , aho ngaho bashumika cya gikoni ,
so , they just ignited the kitchen stopping them from getting out . ||| ibya ... kiri ik' ibyatsi babatwikiramo , baanga ko basohoka . bahairmo pe ! neza .
they were burnt alive . ||| ibyo bivaho .
life continued like that . we kept on hiding from them , some died , we would be attacked and we kept on hiding . ||| bikomeza bityo tuihisha , hapfamo bamwe ,
some out of our group would be killed . ||| bukacya igitero kikaza tukairirwa tuiruka , bakapfa . noneho hari ,
but my cousin had a small radio called mera . ||| abantu bari bazi inzira z' ikinyarwanda ariko ubwo haje kuza si ... mbese uwo mukuru wanjye yari afite i radiyo , hari i radio za kera zaitwaaga mera , hari akaradiyo yari akifite rero , agendana .
he used to walk around holding it in his hand but he would hide it in a bush from the public . ||| bucya ... bukwira nako bwa ... bucya , akakahisha ahantu mu gihuru .
the rest of the day we could spend it running and at night he would listen to the news . ||| tukairirwa tuiruka ... ariko bukwira akakafata akaumva amakuru .
the batteries were not yet discharged by then . ||| kari kakirimo amabuye atarashira .
we used to have those weapons expecting to use them to protect your life . ||| ibyo , eh .. ! tubaga tubifite erega aho tubaga tuihishe . kuko turavugaaga ,
however not every one of us still had them . ||| tuti @:
but we borrowed the weapons from the people who still had them yet they were afraid to join us . ||| « umuntu nkugeraho ushobora kuitanga . » ariko bibaga bikisigaraanye abantu bakeya , ntabwo ari bose ni ukuvuga ngo tugiye tuaka ... tuifashaish abantu babifite , bagize nk' ubwoba bwo kugira ngo tujyane .
we left when we were about 24 in number . ||| abaemeye ko tujyana bageraaga kuri makumyabiri na bane , kuko ba ... tujyaaga tuumva amakuru y' abantu ba ... tujyaaga tugenda urusororongo .
we all knew each other because we were following each other in a line . there was a group , which left before us and after sometime , we heard that they were thrown in nyabarongo river . ||| hariho n' abatugiye inberae , ukajya kaumva ngo bapfairiye ahantu kuri nyabarongo , bataranambuka babaroha muri nyabarongo .
therefore , most people would be afraid to go because , even those who left , did not survived . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo iyo abantu bagendaaga abandi bagiraaga ubwoba , bati @: "@ baragenda babicirae inberae ni hahanri . @" kuko nta bantu na bamwe bigeze bagenda ,
no one had ever left for somewhere and got there ; they would be killed on the way . ||| ngo bagerae iyo bagiye . bahitaaga babicira mu nzira .
people would wonder if those who went to burundi stopped running . ||| noneho , ubwo abiyemeje ngo bagiye i burunri ni hahanri ntibazaguma biruka .
were n't they killed on the way ? ||| bagera inberae bakabicira mu nzira , ni uko bijyaaga bigenda .
generally there were some people who were afraid of moving . ||| noneho hakabaho rero abagira ubwoba bwo kugenda .
they would prefer running around in the neighbourhood to dying on their way going somewhere . therefore , they would stay behind saying ; "@ we are used to running and we survive by chance . ||| bati @: ' tuzakomeza tuirukae ariko ntabwo tugiye kuicirwa mu nzira , bati @: ibingibi biri bitubeshejeho tuiirukair tukabona turarokotse ,
it is all the same , we can go and die in a place where we have never been before . @" ||| bati @: « ni hahanri turagenda , ahubwo bahitae batuicira n' ahandi tutazi tugeze . »
at around seven o'clock in the morning , we got up and agreed with each other that we must defend ourselves , no matter what would happen , we should fight . ||| noneho twebwe tuishyira hamwe nijoro , nko mu ma saa moya , tufashe urugendo . ariko tuva aho tufashe intego y' uko hagomba ... tugomba kupfa n' uwa nyuma akapfa .
we decided we were no longer going to run . ||| tugomba kurwana nibatuvumbura ,
we used to run because we were at home ; we knew the hiding places , and the best bushes . ||| apana ibyo kuiruka , ntabwo ukuiruka utazi ahantu uri kuirukair . nibae n' ubwo tuirukaaga tuzi akarere k' iwacu , tuvuga ngo turihishair aha ;
but then , we did n't know the place . the place where we were going was new to us . and we did not know where to run and hide . ||| eh ! tuzi utuyira ... ibihuru byiza tuzi ahantu tukuihisha . ariko turavuze ,
we decided not to run even if we met the attackers . ||| tuti @: ' nitugenda muihanganae ntihagirae ... tuti @:
we decided to fight for our lives . and even if we all died and there remained only one of us , that person was asked to die like a man ; fighting for his life . ||| « tupfae nk' abagabo . tuti @: uwa nyuma nyine , apfae yemerae apfae nawe akirwana . »
we walked down the hill towards the valley . it was around seven o'clock in the morning . ||| ubwo tuba tufashe inzira nka saa moya . turamanutse tuikubise mu kabande ,
through the swamp we reached the banks of river nyabarongo . we walked for three nights and three days . ||| mu gishanga . turagiye tugenda iruhande rwa nyabarongo , ku nkuka ya nyabarongo nraibuka ko tugiye amajoro atatu n' iminsi itatu . ni ukuvuga ngo iyo nshyizemo iminsi ;
at daytime we would hide . ||| umunsi iyo ucyaaga tujyaaga ahantu mu nkuka tukihisha neza hasi .
and at night , we would walk by the riverside . ||| noneho , bukwira tukagenda iruhande rw' inkuka . ariko nraibuka ko hari ahantu tugeze ; ni ukuvuga ngo turagiye turagenda ... turagenda ... turagenda !
we walked for a long time and finely reached a place where rpf had already chased the interahamwe . ||| tuza kugera ahantu nyine inkotanyi zi ... zageze . ni ukuvuga ngo zairukanye interahamwe , interahamwe ziragenda nazo , zihungira ahantu mu rutoki .
after chasing them , they went and camped somewhere in a very big banana plantation . the banana plantation was very bushy ; we walked holding one another 's shirts in order not to break away from each other . ||| zishinga ikambi ... inkambi mu rutoki . urwo rutoki ruri inzitanae , ndetse no muri uko kugenda twebwe , tufataanaga ishati ;
you can imagine a line of twenty @-@ four people through a bushy plantation . ||| umwe inyuma y' undi . ni ukuvuga ngo turi abantu makumyabiri na bane , ibaze tukajya ku murongo , umwe akafata ishati y' undi .
at some point we saw fire and asked one another , "@ what is the fire about ? @" ||| noneho tuza kugera ahantu muri urwo rutoki rw' inzitanae , tubona umuriro uraaka , mbese mu rutoki . eh .. !
no one knew . ||| tuti ibi n' iki ?
so , we went ahead and passed through the camp of interahamwe , but we saw it was only children and women . we passed through the camp and did not talk them . ||| ubwo tuba tubanyuzemo neza . ah .. , abagore kusa benshi . noneho tuanga kubavugaish .
we were still holding each other 's shirt . ||| twebwe tukifataaniye umwe ku wunri umurongo ; tubacamo hagati na hagati .
we continued until we reached the other side of the river and then walked by the riverside . ||| turaongera tugeze hirya .. , tuhita tuisubirair mu nkuka iwacu . ni ukuvuga ngo aho twiyemeje kugenda ;
it was almost coming to morning around four o'clock . ||| ubwo buba bugiye kucya nko mu ma saa kumi , nibwo twacyebutse inyuma ,
then the last person on the line looked back and saw a woman who had followed us all the way , when he looked clearly at her , he found out that she was interahamwe . ||| uw' inyuma , umuntu w' inyuma abona umugore yamukurikiye .. , yadukurikiye , amurebye abona ni interahamwe kabisa !
then that woman also noticed that we were not her people . ||| noneho umugore nawe yaratubonye , ati @: aba bantu si abacu ;
she went back running and called others . ||| ahita asubirayo yiruka . aravuduka ,
they came shouting and , remember we had agreed not to run but we forgot and got scattered ; we were traumatized . ||| ariruka pe ! ageze ruguru ahita ajya kutabaza bene wabo . nibwo rero bamanutse batuvugiriza induru , batuvugairije induru uraumva ko bigombaaga kutatana .
then we hid separately in nyabarongo river . ||| bibinri twiyemeje byo kuvuga ngo @: ... ngo ntituzatataane , kubera ko turi turahahamutse nyine tuba turatataanye . nibwo tutangiye kuihisha ,
one had to lift the head out for air . ||| mu ... mu ... ukutandukanye . kuihisha byo turi turabimenyereye , kuburyo umuntu yajyaaga neza neza mu mazi , agasigaza umutwe kusa wo kuhumeka ;
when you heard a person coming then you would sink in the water for a few seconds , and then if there was nobody nearby , we would put our heads out . ||| nabwo yakaumva umuntu agiye kumegeraho akaba ya ya ... yacengera mu mazi akamaramo akanya gato akazamuka ,
that was our way of hiding . ||| ni uko tuihishaaga .
the perpetrators chilled and moved around the riverside but they did not see us . it seemed like god was with us . ||| noneho baratuja , interahamwe zijagata muri iyo nkuka ariko ziratubura . ni nk' imaan yatugenzeho nta numawe baishe .
then they got tired and left . ||| ubwo bararambairw baranazamuka .
it was getting dark . so , for about an hour we started searching for one another . ||| ubwo bawije tugenda tushakana ; tumaze hafi isaha tushakana . umwe akahamagara @:
we whistled our names because that was our sign . ||| ‘ kana , ’ [ ikivugirizo ] niyo signe [ ikimenyetso ] yacu . tukavugiriza ,
everyone was around . ||| tukabona bose baraje ;
we held each other 's shirts and walked on a line again . ||| tuesae turaongera tusubira uko turi tumeze . turaongera tufataan intuza imipira mu mipira .
after that place , we did not meet other hardships in other places . ||| jugujugu turagenda ... turenga aho ngaho .
it seemed to be paradise . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo ahandi hose tugeze hari paradizo !
because we could n't understand it . it was too unusual for us to move without hiding . ||| nta kintu tuumvaaga gikomakoma . turavuze , tuti @: ‘ ibi ntibisanzwe !
therefore , we moved ahead and night was falling . ||| ’ noneho turagiye ... ubwo uraumva buri bumaze kwira . tugenda iryo joro ryose ... mbese bugiye kucya , tuanga kuihisha ; mbese nko mu ma saa kumi .
we also found that unusual . ||| mu a saa kumi burya activites ziba zatangiye . [ ibikorwa by' abantu ] . ni ukuvuga , ngo @:
we continued walking the whole night and when it was almost dawn , we did not hide instead we continued to walk . ||| tugiye kubona tubona nta nyoni itamba ;
at around four o'clock in the morning , there was nothing moving . ||| nko mu ma saa kumi , saa kumi n' imwe ... bishyira saa kumi n' imwe ,
[ of course at around four in the morning some activities take place ] . but that time there was none . ||| tukabona nta nyoni itamba uuh !
around four thirty there was still no activity or action [ openly taking place ] . ||| tukakomeza tukaigendera , saa kumi n' ebyiri tubona nta nyoni itamba ! ahubwo tutangira kubona inka ,
at around five in the morning , there was not a single activity , not even birds singing . ||| tutangira kubona inka ziragiye nta muntu uziriho ; eh ! tuti , ‘ ibi ni iki ?
on the other hand , at around six in the morning , we started seeing cows without a shepherd ; we were surprised . ||| ’ noneho , turakomeza turagenda tu ! tuti @: ‘ ariko twiyemeje noneho ,
we continued to walk but later on we had a problem of how we were going to cross nyabarongo in order to go to juru hill . ||| ubu ni ukupfa no kupfa , turakomeje turagiye ... tuza kugira ikibazo , cyo kuambuka nyabarongo , kugirango tugae ku wunri musozi wa juru .
then the young boy who was leading us who knew shortcuts told us that river nyabarongo branches off somewhere . ||| noneho , ah ... uwo mu type uri uturangaje inberae yari azi utuyira ; aza kutubwira ko hari ahantu nyabarongo ishamikira . ni ukuvuga ngo igira itya yagenda igashamikamo utuntu tw' utu ... utugezi ,
and he assured us that he knew the place . ||| ati @: « ntahazi tugende . » n' aho hantu rero ,
but to reach that point , it would require another whole hour . ||| hari ukaongera kugenda nk' umunsi wose . turaongera turakubanuka ... ni ukuvuga ,
we walked and reached that point and then he dived in . ||| ngo @: tutaye ahantu turi kuhita tugera ako kanya , tubanje kujya kushaka ako kayira . turagiye ... ,
the water level was up to his chest and yet he was tall . ||| tugeze kuri ako kagezi gatoya , tuikubisemo . uwo muhungu hamugeraaga nk' aha kandi yari muremure ‘ mu katuza .
they had to put young boys like us on their shoulders . ||| ’ twebwe nk' abana batushyira ku rutugu .
we crossed it without any one shouting at us yet it was daytime . ||| ubwo tuba tugize imaan turakaambutse ; tukaambuka nta nduru kandi hari ku manywa ,
normally we were used to walking at night when nobody at the hill could see us . ||| ubundi turi turamenyereye kugenda ninjoro . nta muntu tuumva ukomakoma ku musozi .
but this time we decided to walk and climb the hill . ||| twebwe turiyemeza tuti @: ‘ tujyae ku musozi . ’
we got out of the river and went up the hill . ||| tuva mu nkuka , ni ukuvuga ngo @: tuzamuka imusozi ;
we had spent three days and three nights without eating . ||| tuzamutse imusozi uraumva turi tumaze iminsi itatu n' ama .. , iminsi itatu n' amajoro atatu , tutarya ! nibwo tugize dutya tubona ,
we walked up and came across a banana plantation , which belonged to tutsi people who had fled their properties . ||| tugeze ahantu ku rutoke ! urabona ibitoki bya ker ... nk' umuntu ... yabaga ari iki ? yabaga ari umututsi baramutorongeje mu muraima we , ibitoki bikinekesha .
the bananas were ripening and we were all grabbing them ; those who were tall could grab a banana from up high and those of us who we young like me would pick the ones that were falling . ||| tubonamo nk' igitoki cyanetse tukirwanairho . abatusumba bakajya kurwanair hejuru , ibiguye hasi akaba ari byo jyewe nfata . kuko nri umwana ,
others went to a cassava plantation . ||| nkarya . noneho abandi batangira kujya mu mirima y' imyumbati barakura , uh .. ! nta nduru turaumva n' imwe ,
all that time there was no distraction , no one shouting , eh ... it was unbelievable . ||| nta muntu uratukoma ! tuti @: ‘ ibi ntabwo ari amahoro kabisa ! ’ ubwo wa muhungu aravuga ati ,
that man had taken up the responsibility to be our leader ; he stopped us and asked us to continue our journey . ||| aratuhagarika ; ni nkawe uri utuyoboye . arangije ati @: « tukomezae urugendo . »
we never walked in anarchy , we walked in a line . ||| turaongera turagae ... , ntabwo tuigeraaga tugenda ikivunge , tutondaaga umurongo . turagiyee .. ,
then we reached near the main road but the same man who was like our leader told us to wait before we crossed . ||| ubwo tugeze , urabona nk' uyu tuvugae ko ari umuhanda principale , hano hari akayira , noneho .. ,
he advised us to hide in the banana plantation and let him go to spy the situation . ||| uyu tuvugae ko ari akayira turimo , hano hari umuhanda principale tugiye kuikubitamo . noneho muri ako kayira tugeze nk' aha , uwo muhungu aratubwira ,
he had a spear . ||| ati @: « mubae muhagaze . ati mwebwe mwihishe mu ntoki , ati @:
he told us that , if we heard him scream we would know that he had been caught , which meant death . ||| ngewe nragiye , » yari nfite icumu . aragenda , twebwe turihisha mu rutoki ,
therefore , we should run away . ||| tuti nitwumva .. , aratubwira , ngo @:
he went and reached the main road . ||| « nimwumva nvugije induru , mumenye ko tayari bagiye kunyica ,
he looked ahead of him and saw nothing . ||| mwihu ... muirukae .
when he looked behind him , he saw a soldier wearing a cap . ||| ubwo aragiyee .. , ageze muri wa muhanda principale gutya agikandagizamo ikirenge , arebye ruguru abona nta kintu kiriyo , akebutse amaso hepfo ahita abona umusirikare .
he was a tall man wearing a yellow t @-@ shir with inkontanyi uniform trousers . ||| umusirikare muremure yari yambaye agashapo , ka songa mbere aka ... aka kagofero kano k' inkotanyi ; yambaye baotae , yambaye tisheti [ umupira ] y' umuhondo ,
he was wearing gumboots with a piece of cloth tied to his waist . ||| nta gishati cya gisirikare yari yambaye hejuru , yambaye i pantaro ya mukotanyi , akenyeye igitenge mu nda gutya akihambiriye .
then the soldier told him that he was of the same side with him . ||| noneho umusirikare nibwo yaje kumwita ... kumwisobanuraho , ati @: "@ jyewe ndi uwanyu ! eh ,
and then the soldier asked him to go and call the rest who were hiding . ||| umuhungu yumva ... ntabwo yamwitambuweho ... ntabwo ari we yabwiye . ahubwo yaramubwiye , ati @: "@ genda uzanae bagenzi bawe mwari muri kumwe ! @"
so , the guy left but doubting his coming back . ||| eh .. ! noneho umuhungu arabaza ati @: ‘ umuntu unbwiye ngo ngendae , koko aranshakira amahoro ,
he thought that the soldier wanted him to bring those who were hiding with him so he could kill us together . but he did not fear much so he said maybe he is an inkotanyi . ||| uwagenda nkahita nigumairyo ? ’ noneho tuti ni inkotanyi tu ! ubwo aragiye , aragiye ntanamukurikiye !
so the guy came and told us the whole story and then he took us to where the soldier was . ||| aragiye ... ati cyangwa aragirango tuegeraan sha atuicirae hamwe , ati @: ariko nta kibazo . araza aratubwira amaze kutubwira turaza .
imagine a line of all the twenty @-@ three people plus him making twenty @-@ four . ||| abantu ... uraumva ba bantu makumyabiri na batatu , tuesae tuba tubaye makumyabiri na bane .
as we had reached there , we saw almost a battalion that was hiding in the same place where we were . ||| tukigera aho tu ... tubona ni nka ... ni nka bataillon !
we could n't tell where they were from . ||| ivuye hahanri turi turi hose ,
they just surrounded us . ||| baraje bahise batugota .
we were trembling and thought that our death had come . ||| eh ! aba bantu baturutse he ? tuumva ubwoba turatangira turatitira tuti turapfuye ,
in our hearts we were cursing the guy that he had led us into death . ||| eh .. ! tuti sha ... tutangira kaumva mu mitima yacu tuvuga , tuti @: utuzanye mu rupfu .
then the soldiers started to ask us where we were coming from and where we were heading to . ||| noneho baratangira baratubaza , ngo @: " murava he mukajya he ? @" baraongera baratubaza ,
we told them that we were from bugesera . ||| tubabwira ko tuvuye i bugesair ; ubwo tubabwira uko bimeze noneho nta kibazo . batangira kutubaza ,
until then they had n't told us that they were inkotanyi . then they asked us again , "@ how are the people who remained behind ? @" ||| bati @: "@ ese abandi basigaye bameze batae ? bataratubwira ko ari inkotanyi . bati abandi se musize bameze batae ? @"
we told them , "@ everything is going wrong ; people are being killed , others are injured . ||| tuti @: ‘ tusize nta kigenda abantu bari kuica , abandi ni inkomerae barashaka kubasonga ,
generally the situation is too bad . @" ||| mbese bimeze nabi .
then they asked us to calm down , "@ we are on the same side . @" ||| bati @: "@ muhumurae rero muri abacu .. , turi abanyu .
they told us . ||| bati @:
then they started to ask us about a lady who was living in our village bugesera . they said that she used to visit them in mulindi . ||| « ese umuhu ... umukobwa ... » , batangira kutubaza umukobwa ujyaaga ajya ku mulindi ; w' iwacu iyo i bugesair ajya kusura inkotanyi . bati :
we told them that she was still alive but the perpetrators had cut of her leg . ||| "@ kanaka aracyariho ? @" tuti @: aracyariho ariko bamutemye ukuguru . ati @:
then one of them said that before the end of the day he would have reached there . ||| « yewe ! ati @: nrarara ngezeyo . »
we were so happy and we started talking loudly and we forgot about the tactic of whispering . ||| ubwo turishima , tutangira kuvuga cyane , bibinri byo kaongorera biba birashize .
we started to laugh and became generally happy . ||| turatangira turaseka , turishima ,
we told them that since we have seen them , no one else is going to kill us unless they killed us themselves . ||| tuti @: mushaka mutaicae ubu tubabonye ; tuti @: iyaba mwatwiyiciraga tukavaho .
suddenly they stopped us from shouting . ||| eh ! baumvise tusakuje bahindura isura .
they said , "@ listen ! @" ||| bati @: "@ nta soni ! bati @: mucecekae muumvae ,
we heard gunshots not far from where we were . ||| " baumva ... tuumva imbunda zivugair hafi aho koko . nibwo ba ... tuhise tuceceka , tuti @: karabaye [ avuga yongorera ] .
then they told us to stand up and hide in the banana plantation . ||| ubwo baratuhagurutsa tuesae , tutonda umusururu nyine umurongo baratujyana .. , batugejeje inberae , bati @:
then we saw a line of about 200 soldiers passing on the road where we were . ||| mubae mugiye aho mu rutoki mwicaremo , batwicaje mu rotoki . tuti bagiye kuturasairmo hano . tugiye kubona tubona umurongo nk ' abantu bagera kuri magana abiri ,
they were lifting heavy weapons . ||| barahise b' abasilikare , inkotanyi zikoreye ibitwaro , batambuka , bamaze kutambuka ntawe tuba tuvuyemo .
then we joined the line , we were shown a house where we were going to be living , and they asked us to eat . ||| baraongeye baratujyanye , batueretse ahantu hari inzu bati @: "@ mubae ahangaha , bati @:
they said , "@ even if it means to eat man 's flesh we shall bring it to you but make sure you eat . @" ||| uwaba arya umuntu uwaba arya iki , icyo ashaka atubwirae tukimuzanirae , bati @: ariko muryae . @"
then we became so excited because our life had improved . ||| ubwo nibwo , tutangiye kaumva tubayeho neza , tutangira kurya , abasore bamaze kutora ubuyanja bari baturimo ,
we had started getting food , some of us who had gained stamina asked to join the rpf . ||| batangira kujya mu nkotanyi , mu gisirikare .
in brief that is how life went ... i even lived in the refugee camp shortly , it is the nkotanyi members who took me there in juru . ||| muri make ni uko ubuzima bwanjye bwage .. , nba mu ... nkambi gatoya ni nabwo batuvanye aho kuri juru batujyana .. ,
later they took me to nyagasambu , where i found several other refugees [ i could call them survivors ] . ||| batujyana aho baita i nyagasambu nsanga aho , nanone izindi mpunzi cyangwa abandi barokotse babashyize ;
we stayed there for a while and after i joined the rpf army and i became a soldier . ||| hashize igihe gitoya nnjyae ninjira mu gisirikare . nba umusirikare ,
during that time , people were very hostile ; sometimes i wonder and ask myself what had happened to the hutu . ||| ubundi muri make ni uko ubuzima bwanjye bugenze , kusa icyo kihae abantu bari ibikoko . kusa ntinzi ikintu kiri cyara .. , njyewe n' ubu njya nbiibaza nti @:
i can not imagine how they were thinking during that period . ||| ‘ umuhutu muri icyo kihae yari ameze atae ? yari ameze atae ,
i wonder where their hearts had gone . someone reaching a point of getting hold of a machete just to hack his fellow human being ! ||| umutima ukuntu yari awufite , umuntu kufata umuhoro akatema uwunri ? nkiro ... tuki ... nkirokoka ho ;
after the genocide i thought that i would never talk to a hutu for the rest of my life . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo intambara ikirangira nravugaaga nti @: ‘ ntabwo nzaongera kuvugana n' umuhutu bibaho .
i hated the hutu so badly . i knew they were real enemies . ||| ’ kuko numvaaga meze nabi cyane , numvaaga umuhutu ari umwanzi kweri !
and every time i would see a hutu , i would almost be traumatized . whenever i would see a hutu i would wish them death . ||| nbonaaga umuhutu nkaumva , muri make ntahahamutse nkaumva akwaiye kupfa nawe .
in brief , that is how i lived during the war until i survived . ||| muri make rero ni uko ubuzima bwanjye bugenze bw' intambara nkaba nriho .
when you were in the banana plantation , how did that gentleman come to you and convince you that he met a soldier and he is asking him to take all of you to him ? ||| igihe mwari muri mu rutoki aho uwo musore aza kubabwira , ati @: "@ nhuye n' umusirikare aranbwira ngo @: muzae tukoranae , yabibabwiye atae ?
he came shaking and he looked so afraid . ||| yaje , we yaraje ataitira , yaje nyine asa nk' ufite ubwoba turi dusanganywe ,
and then he said , "@ i was told to call all of you . ||| ati @: "@ sha ati muzae ati @: baranbwiye ngo nimuzae muesae . ati @:
but i am not sure if the guy is an inkotanyi . ||| simbizi , niba ari inkotanyi ... niba ari inkotanyi turakira ,
in case he is one then we will have survived and if he is an interahamwe then we will die . ||| niba ari interahamwe turapfa ,
but come , let 's go . @" ||| ati nimuzae . @"
we followed him but we were afraid . ||| ntawe tuza tufite ubwoba ,
then we were asked the questions i told you above , and then they told us who they were . after which , we felt at ease . ||| tufite uko gukekeranya , ubwo nibwo tuhageze tubazaw ibyo bibazo , tumaze kubazaw ibyo bibazo , baratuimenyaish ubwo tuba tuumva turakize .
you were living with your family at the market centre , do you know what happened to them ? ||| aho mwari mutuye ku gacentre uri utuyeho n' umuryango wawe , ntabwo umenya uko bigenze ?
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana !
we were taken to join the army in nyagasambu . ||| ubundi mu gisirikare nbayeyo , ba ... baje ku kututwara ngo tujyae mu gisirikare nba i nyagasambu . ndetse mu kugenda kwanjye ,
i found my aunt and my younger cousin whom i survived with called rwikangura john . ||| ngeze i nyagasambu nsanzeyo umushangazi umwe , n' umukecuru . ngeraanyo n' aga petit frere ako turokokaanye kaitwa rwikangura john .
we started a life of looting . ||| noneho tuba ahongaho , tutangira ubuzima bwo gusagata .
we would sometimes go to villages and loot . ||| tubagaho mu buryo bwo gusagata , tukagenda mu baturagae ,
there were some people who lost their lives then . ||| rimwe na rimwe n' uko gusagata n' ubwo turokotse hari abapfaagamo ... abapfairiyeyo .
sometimes the interahamwe would see us . we were so lucky to survive . later on , there came a soldier he had the rank of a captain . ||| mukagenda mugasagata mu misozi interahamwe zikabavumburayo zikabicirayo . ubwo nba muri ubwo buzima , nibwo rero haje abo bagabo b' abasirikare uwo mu capitaine ;
he asked if there was any person who wanted to join the army . ||| araza aratubwira ngo abashaka kujya mu gisirikare ,
i joined the army without telling anyone because i would be asked so many questions . ||| ngenda ntorotse .
i only let know my cousin . ||| ako ga petit frere kanjye niko kari kabizi konyine , uwo mushangazi nanze ko abimenya kuko yari kunbuza .
i did much training , although i did not go to the front to fight . ||| ndatoroka mpita ngenda nta nubwo nkoze imyitozo myinshi cyane ya gisirikare , kusa hari aho kutabara . ni ukuvuga kujya ku rugamba . ubwo ntabwo ngiye ku muriro ngo nrwanae ,
but i joined the unit that was known as the "@ general headquarters @" which was concerned with gathering the wounded people , supplying bullets and food . ||| kusa ngiye mu unitae baitaaga , unitae baita @: "@ general headquarters , " yari ishinzwe kutarura ama kajoriti ( inkomerae ) no kutanga umusada w' amasasu ,
that 's the role i played in the army and how i can not tell you how i left . ||| ibiryo , ibintu nk' ibyo . ni uko igisirikare nkikoze .
it is my secret . ||| mu kuvayo rero ni ibanga ryanjye , ntinzi ko npfa ku kubivuga neza .
why did you join the army ? ||| icyatumye ujya mu gisirikare ni iki ?
there are about three reasons why i joined the army ; the first one was the bad impression i had of the hutu . ||| igituma , cyane cyane ni ibintu nka bitatu @: icya mbere , numvaaga kubwanjye ,
i felt like the war would never end . ||| numvaaga remord nfite y' umuhutu kunza . nkavuga kweri umunyagaw w' umuhutu , nkaumva ko intambara itazapfa irangiye , mu buzima bwanjye .
therefore , i had to join the army and get trained and maybe own a gun so that in case i was attacked , i would be able to fight back and then go and save others who were still being killed . ||| ati ... ko agomba kuza aka nyica bianga bikunda , ariko noneho nravuga nti @: ' reka nzae nkuerekae .
i had left them behind . ||| reka nzae njyae mu gisirikare ,
secondly , i wished to be a hero . ||| niyo yaza asangae nfite imyitozo ya gisirikare , cyangwa nfite imbunda nshobora kumurwanya . ’ ikindi cya kabili @:
i wanted to save those who were still being killed , well i had left them behind but i wished to go back and save them . ||| numvaaga nshaka kukomeza , nnjyae cyane cyane ntabarae ; ntabarae abari kukomeza kupfa . kuko nnjyae numvaaga nrabasize inyuma .
thirdly , i joined the army because the life i was leading in the refugee camp was horrible . therefore , i decided to join hoping to find a slightly better life . ||| icya gatatu @: ni ubwo buzima nri nbayeho , ahongaho mu buhungiro . nkavuga ngo reka nvae muri ubu buzima njyae mu gisirikare wenda niho bizamerair neza .
given the life you experienced , where do you think rwanda is heading ? ||| wowe iyo urebye , ukurikije ibyo unyuzemo ubona u rwanda ruri kugana he ?
are you asking me rwanda at large or you are asking me the political point of view ? ||| mu ruhae rwego ? ku rwanda muri rusangae cyangwa ku .. , ni mu rwego rwa politique ?
i am asking you in general . ||| ntakubaza muri rusangae .
generally , i have come to realize that rwandans are wise people . ||| ubundi , bidatewe .. , ubundi muri uru rwanda abanyarwanda maze kubona ko turi abantu ,
we are wise but hypocrites . ||| turi abantu b' indyarya . tuzi ubwenge ariko turi n' indyarya .
if rwandans were open to one another , i mean they can be honest towards each other ; the future of rwanda would be good . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo abanyarwanda turamutse tubaye abantu bakingutse , bakinkukiraanye nikonavuga ; bashobora kubwizanya ukuri . u rwanda ubona rujya ahantu heza .
in my country rwanda there are honest people , however there are also others who are still greedy . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo mu rwanda rwacu hari abantu b' inyangamugayo ariko harimo n' abandi ba ruryi bakimeze ... bakifite inda zi .. , zijya inberae ,
if you critically observe rwanda , you will find that rwanda has a good vision . ||| bashyize inda inberae . rero u rwanda rwacu ururebye , ururebye inberae gutya ubona ari u rwanda rujya ahantu heza . rufite vision nziza .
the only condition is that some of its people do not become selfish . ||| ariko mu kihae hataje za kirobya nk' ibiakair ,
it has been happening , people who put their personal interests forward . ||| ngo abantu bashyirae inda inberae . kandi bigenda bigaragara , ugenda ubibona ko hari abantu bafite inyungu zabo .
sometimes i say they are selfish . ||| bashyize inda inberae . jyae niko nbibona .
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana !
sometime ago when i was still in the army , i was asked if i could accept to be taken abroad and get my scar removed but i refused . ||| ubundi njyewe , kera mu gisirikare nibwo bigeze kuvuga , ngo @: « ariko uje tukajya kukusibaish iyi nkovu yawe ! »
i told those people that my scar would stay as y souvenir of the genocide , because i personally do n't find it easy to forget the genocide . ||| ngo banjyanae hanze ! nrabianga , nrabianga , nti @:
never . ||| ' njyewe nimundekere inkovu , inkovu izaba amateka . kuko jyewe ku bwanjye numva jenoside ntashobora kuyibagirwa , ntibibaho .
i want to appear in the history of rwanda . ||| nnjyae ikintu nshaka ku , ubundi nshaka kukora , ntashaka kuba inararibonye , mu mateka y' u rwanda .
i will never forget what happened to me and i will tell it to my grandchildren and my great grand children . whoever will generate from my family will have to learn that genocide is very bad . ||| ntinzaibagirwae ibiambayeho , nbibwirae n' ubuvivi n' ubuvivure niko nvuga , umuntu uzanturukaho wese abimenye , amenye ko genocide ari mbi .
i will expose what was in it [ genocide ] . ||| kandi njyae ... ni ukuvuga ngo @: njyae mpora nyamagana . ukuyamagana kwanjye ngaragaza ibibi bibayemo ;
the way i am now giving you this testimony . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo kuko jyewe biambayeho nbigaragazae nk' uko n' ubu nbibabwirair inberae .
do you believe that consequences of the genocide will affect your offspring ? ||| ubona ibibazo bikomoka kuri jenoside , bizaffecta abana bawe [ bizagira ingaruka ku bana bawe ] n' ubuvivi bwawe ?
it will affect them because already now i became the person responsible for survivors by the time i was in a school in shyogwe in gitarama . ||| yee ! biza affecta [ bizagira ingaruak ] kuko ; nk' ubu jyae nbaye responsable w' aba rescapes nkaiga aho baita i shyogwe muri kitaarama .
i try to listen to the children and to understand their problems . ||| nkagerageza kaumva abana , abana bakajya banbwira ibibazo byabo ,
someone did not see what took place during the genocide , for example the people who came from the neighbouring countries and who did not see what happened besides hearing it from people . ||| ukasanga nk' umuntu uturutse hanze , sibyo ? ntabyo yabonye n' amaso ,
well some of these people say that they want to join the survivors association . ||| ariko ku ... kubimubwira kusa , tuvugae ubimubwiye . ukasanga ... cyangwa ukaumva arashaka kuza mu muryango aba rescapes .
some join and sometimes get traumatised after hearing people 's testimonies within the association . ||| ati @: « jyewe ntashaka kuza mu muryango w' aba rescapes . » kuko azi ububabare bwabo . ndetse hakabaho n' igihe ahahamuka .
that is a simple example . ||| urwo ni ... ni urugero rworoshye . noneho nkanjyae rero ubyaye ,
but i personally if i get my own children , i will tell my children the stories of genocide and show them the consequences of it . ||| tuvugae nimbyara umwana wanjye nka bimubwira , nkanamwereka ... nkanamwereka ingaruka mbi ,
i will show them my scar of the 1994 genocide . ||| nkamwereka exemple n' igikomere , cyangwa nani inkovu nfite ya genocide yo muri 94 .
i know it will be hard . ||| bizaba ari ikibazo ,
but my children will have to keep it at heart . but i am worried because there are some people , the hutu for example who will keep on harassing my kids . ||| umwana wanjye agomba kubibika mpaka ! kusa impungenge wenda nfite , ni uko hariho abantu bazakomeza kumanjirirwa nk' abo bahutu ; bazakomeza bamanjirirwe ,
but i really wonder if they will one day feel free to live with us with no worries ? ||| tuzajya tubivuga bamanjirirwe , iyo niyo mpungenge nfite nti est @-@ cae @-@ que bazatinyuka ?
i find it impossible , i do n't know how i can put it . ||| baongerae babanae ntawe neza baumvae bisanganywe ntibi ... nba numva bitashoboka ntinzi uko nbivuga .
is there any particular message you would like to pass to the world at large especially to those who will came across this testimony . ||| noneho nraumva ushobora kutanga nka message [ ubutumwa ] , uha isi yose cyangwa n' abantu bashobora kaumva ubu buhamya .
money has no value if you do n't use it appropriately . ||| amafaranga ntakinri amaze , niba ukunda u rwanda , kandi wunva uvuga ngo @:
but sincerely if you are a nationalist and you really need reconciliation among rwandans then show that love , take in the orphans who are starving out there , who have no school , take them in and raise them in your home . ||| ubwiyunge bw' abanyarwanda uhora ubushyira inberae , bierekanae . fata ba bana bari kugwa aho ngaho , bari kubura amashuri ubaegerezae ubatungae mu rugo rwawe .
let 's not be selfish . ||| twe kushyira inberae inda kusa zacu ,
rwandans in general , we should love one another that is how we will be able to develop our country . ||| ahubwo turebae abanyarwanda muri rusangae . nidukundana nibwo igihugu cyacu kizatera inberae . kandi icyambere ni ukukunda igihugu , aho kugira ngo tukundae ... buriya hari umugabo njya nemera perezida wacu wa repubulika ,
i like our president because he loves his country and the people in the country , which i find very wise . ||| ni umugabo . ni umugabo perezida , kuko we akunda igihugu n' abanyarwanda . kusa ,
may god bless him . i wish he works together with people who love the country and the nation at large , and then our country will develop . ||| imaan izamufashe akoranae n' abantu bakunda igihugu ,
to love the people who love their country and rwandans in order do develop it . ||| bakunda abanyarwanda . kugirango igihugu cyacu tukizamurae .
the message i can pass on to all rwandans is to love one another and strive for the improvement of our country . ||| nraumva ari aho ... ariyo message [ ubutumwa ] ntanga @: ‘ kuba umunyarwanda yakundana n' undi ; kandi akaharanira i gihugu cye .
the other thing is and i will not stop repeating it , anyone who denies the genocide should be opposed . ||| ’ niko nvuga . ikindi nraongera nbisubiraemo @: ‘ umuntu wese wibeshya gupfobya genocide ... ijambo genocide uwo ni ukumwamaganira kure .
thank you . ||| ’ murakoze .
when they came home to kill , they were very many . some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons . ||| ariko ubwo hagati aho , ubwo baza kuica murugo nyine , baje ari benshi abazanye intwaro , abafite impiri ,
so they came home and found us there . ||| abafite iki ,
we were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else . ||| ni uko batusanga nyine aho turi turi mu rugo kuko turi abantu benshi cyane , hari n' abari babashije kuhungira mu rugo abari hafi abari batuegereye , kuko babonaaga ko nta hanri hantu bashobora kuba ba ... ba ... baca cyangwa se bakwitabaza .
therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together . ||| bahitamo kuza mu rugo rero kugirango tuifatanyae , ubwo niba ari ukurokoka turokokae cyangwa se niba ari igihe cyo kupfa nyine ubwo tupfae .
so it happened but ... well , i managed to escape . ||| nibwo rero nyine bije kuba , ok nbasha kuvamo ,
they came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people . ||| ubwo baje ari mu kihae cya saa kumi n' ebyiri nigice . baza ari benshi , kiri nk' igitero cy' abantu bagera hafi nko kuri magana abiri ,
soldiers came first and then the interahamwe followed . ||| kuko habanje abasirikare bafite imbunda ,
they [ interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] . ||| nyuma y' aho nibwo haje kuza mo interahamwe , ariko nazo zikaba zo zari zitegereje ko uri bubashae kurokoka asimbuka nabo babashae uburyo bashobora kuba bamurangiriza nyine ,
they used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ . ||| ibyabo baitaaga ngo ni ukurangiza .
then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... i am the one who came out of there alive . ||| ubwo ... bon , hari harimo abatwite , ababyeyi batwite , abandi bantu b' inshuti bari bari aho ,
it was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many . ||| ubwo ni njyae muntu ubashije kuva mo muri abo bose . hari igihe cya nimugoroba , baturasa bari abantu benshi cyane ,
as i was lying down , i stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . there were only floods of blood . ||| kusa ariko aho nri ndi nbashije kuhabyuka ngo nrebae ko hari uwaba yarokotse nsanga nta n' umwe , nsanga imivu y' amaraso , iki .
but because by then i was ... well , i had become numb ; i could n't think of doing anything at that time yet i needed to find my way out of that place . ||| ariko kubera ko icyo kihae nnjyae ok , nri maze kuba igishushungwe numvaaga nta kintu nshobora kubasha kukora hagati aho , biba ngombaw ko nnjyae nshakisha uburyo nshobora kuba nva aho hantu .
it was n't easy to leave that place because i was difficult to find space where to step . ||| kuhava birangoye cyane , kuko ntari kubona inzira y' ahantu nshobora kuba nca n' iki .
well , i hid myself and i was lucky to see a new day . ||| ok ! nbasha kuihisha ahantu nihishe , nza kugira imaan nbona burakeye ,
that is when i got out of that place . ||| nibwo nbashije nnjyae kugerageza uburyo nva aho hantu .
i thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing i was waiting for . ||| kuko nbonaaga ko birangiye , nta kinri kintu nkihategereje ,
then i thought , " let me find a way of protecting myself and see if i would survive . @" ||| nravuga nti @: nnjyae reka nshakishae uburyo nshobora kuba nkuirwanaho nrebae ko nrokoka .
i escaped them . even those who came later ... in fact , i left a green shirt where i was shot ; i was at the back . ||| nbasha kubatoroka , kusa n' abaje nyuma , kubera ko aho banrasaiye nhataye ishati y' icyatsi , bari baranrashe hano mu mugongo .
so i left my shirt there and the following morning , when some people came to loot , they realized that someone had managed to escape . ||| mpata ishati yanjye , ubwo bukeye baje kusahura nibwo bamenye ko hari umuntu ubashije kuhava .
they tried to look for me but they could n't find me . ||| bagerageza kushakisha ngo barebae wenda ko banbona ,
they even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed . ||| kuko bari batanze n' amatangazo cyane bavuga bati @: "@ umuntu turi busangaane uwo muntu , nawe tushobora kumugirair nabi . @"
but i did n't hide near there , i continued fleeing . ||| ariko kubera ko hafi ahongaho atariho nbashije kuba natorokera , ubwo ntakomeza nragenda ,
it was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing . ||| kiri igihe cy' imvura , imvura igaw n' iki , n' abandi bantu bahunga , bagira kutae .
i looked for a way of going to e.t.o [ a technical school in kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because i had no one to help me [ get there ] . ||| nshakisha uburyo nshobora kuba nhunga ngo njyae kuri e.t.o [ ishuri rya kicukiro ] nbona bitashoboka , kuko hagati ahongaho nta bufasha bunri nri nfite .
i tried all possible ways but i failed . ||| ngerageza kushakisha uburyo bwose birananiraan ,
then i started moving around . ||| ubwo nibwo ngiye ndorongotana ahantu hose n' iki ,
however i thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died . ||| ariko aho hose ntekerezaaga ko hashobora kuba hari abavandimwe , nabo bari bamaze kupfa .
i continued doing that and the war went on , the 1994 war . ||| ubwo nkomeza gutyo iki , intambara irakomeza y' ikiendaan kane [ 1994 ] ngenda nca mu bantu bagiye bapfuye ,
i would pass through dead bodies , people who were terribly hacked and could n't do anything for themselves . ||| abo basize babatemaguye batari bubashae kugira icyo bimarair .
i had also been shot on the back but i would try and walk . ||| kubera ko nnjyae bari banrashe ariko mu mugongo , nkapfa kugenda gutyo kusa .
i remember the shootings took place at seven in the evening . ||| kuko nrabiibuka , barashe ari muma saa moya ,
later after the shooting , i tried to get out of the fence where we were but it was a problem to me as they had destroyed all the behind passages . ||| bamaze kurasa , ngerageza kusohoka muri urwo rupangu turi turimo . kurusohokamo ariko binbera ingorane ndende cyane , kubera ko hari abandi bantu bari bamaze kuzitira aho inyuma ,
they blocked the way out so that they could see anyone who would try to jump over the fence . ||| bategereje ko hari uri busimbukae .
they waited and realized that there was no alive , then they told each other , "@ you can now enter and start looting . @" ||| ariko noneho hagati ahongaho bategereza ko hari uri bukomae , ubwo bari bamaze kuica mo indani bababwira bati @: "@ nta kinri kisigaye mushobora kuinjira noneho mukatangira kusahura . @"
that is how i survived and i was taken to the hospital . ||| nza kuharokokair gutyo banjyana mu bitaro ,
i was treated because i had been injured . ||| baranvura , kubera ko nri nararashwe ,
but they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound . ||| ariko bavura ibikovu kusa , ntibabasha kukuramo isasu ryari ririmo .
in july , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating . ||| ubwo intambara irarangira mu kwa karindwi , ubwo nyine ibintu by' amashuri biri bitarajya ku murongo . nibwo ubwo ,
then f.a.r.g [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school . ||| f.a.r.g. [ ikigega gishinzwe kutera inkunga abacitse ku icumu ry' itsembabwoko ] nyine batangiye kutubwira ngo tuitabaire ibintu byo kujya kuiga n' iki ,
we started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools . ||| tujya mubyo kuiyandikisha , batuohereza kuiga , kuko bagendaaga ba disitiribiwa [ bakwirakwiza ] abanyeshuri muri za minisiteri .
so i managed to study but because i had a problem with my arm , which was due to the wound where i was shot at the shoulder , i was not very okay mentally . ||| ubwo nbasha kuiga , ariko kubera ko nri nfite ikibazo nyine cy' akaboko kubera urutugu ahantu barashe , kubera ko nri ntara ... , mu mutawe nri ntara ,
life went on like that . ||| ntaratungana neza . ubuzima bukomeza gutyo , bukomeza gutyo ,
they were other children who survived . ||| hakaba hari n' abandi bana nabo baba baragiye barokoka , bamwe na bamwe tukasanga nabo bari aho ,
we used to meet there and talk about what happened to us and to our people during the genocide . ||| tukagerageza kuganira ibyagiye bitubaho n' ibyo bagenzi bacu bagiye bahura nabyo mu ntiambara ,
but days were very bad during that period . ||| ariko ukasanga yuko ibyo bihae biri ibihe bibi cyane .
no one was able to ... imagine one killing a person who is not fighting back . ||| nta n' umuntu ubashaaga kuba ... urabona kugira ngo wice umuntu utakurwanya burya ,
it is a big problem ; killing someone who can never fight back , it is like killing a lamb . ||| byo buriya ni ikintu cy' ikibazo cyane . uraumva nta kuntu ukuicwa n' umuntu utakurwanya burya ,
the killer was capable of torturing the victim as much as he wished . ||| uraumva ni nk' aho ari intama burya , ushatse umushinyagurair icyo wunva ushaka .
fortunately , the war ended . ||| ni uko nyine tugira imaan tubona intambara irahagaze ,
life went on as it used to be . ||| ubuzima buratangira uko bisanzwe ,
well , life was still very hard but peace was certain . the rest comes slowly by slowly . ||| yego ukasanga hari ibintu bimwe na bimwe bigoraan mu buzima ariko kuva umuntu burya afite amahoro , ibindi burya umuntu agenda abishaka buhoro buhoro .
from then up to now life is going on fairly . ||| eh , ubwo nyuma y' aho nyine kugeza ubwo iki kihae tugezemo ,
well , people get problems like health problems and others but one keeps trying to look for a living . ||| nrabona ubuzima burimo bugenda nta kibazo , ok , hari ibintu by' ibibazo umuntu agenda ahura nabyo mu nzira , ibibazo by' ubuzima ,
we believe that it is god , who knows . ||| ibintu nk' ibyo , ariko umuntu akagenda agerageza , agerageza uko bishobotse kushakisha ubuzima .
when we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that god played his role . ||| umuntu akavuga ati buriya imaan niyo ibizi kuko uko ibyagiye bigenda byose muri jenoside no kuba abantu barabashije kurokoka , numva ko hagati cyane hashobora kuba harimo n' uruhare rw' imaan cyane kuko ,
because human beings would never manage it without god 's power . ||| abantu ubwabo bwo numvaaga batari kuba bafite ingufu zihagije cyane kusa hatarimo ingufu z' uwiteka .
now that you have told us about your life in details , i would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ? ||| utubwiye ubuzima bwawe kuburyo burambuye . ndagirango , numvaaga nkubaza utubazo tumwe na tumwe ; ubundi utubwira amazina y' ababyeyi bawe ?
eh , my dad was called macumi francois and my mum was called umulisa odetta . ||| eh , ubundi papa bamwitaga macumi francois , mama yitwaaga umulisa odeta .
and how many were you in your family ? ||| mukaba mwaravutse muri abana bangahe ?
we were two ... three kids at home . ||| turi abanaa ... babiri murugo , batatu .
we were all boys . ||| turi batatu bari abahungu . tuesae turi abahungu .
they all died and i am the only one who survived . ||| ubwo rero nyine nibo bapfuye bose aba ari njyewe urokokamo .
among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ? ||| ni wowe urokotsemo ?
i am twenty @-@ five years old . ||| ubu nfite makumyabiri n' itanu .
before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ? ||| tukiri mu buzima bwa mbere ya jenoside , urabizi neza ko abantu bakundaaga kugenda bahiga , bagatorezwa , bakafunga ibyitso bakagira kutae na kutae ;
if it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ? ||| ese iwanyu icyo kintu kigeze kihagera wenda kuburyo wowe cyangwa se ababyeyi bawe bataotaijew ngo ubae utunyurairmo muri make ukuntu bataotaijew ?
yes it used to happen especially within families . ||| yee , kirahageze , kirahageze cyane mu miryango ,
some people were victimized in that way . ||| hari bamwe na bamwe bagiye bazira ibyo bintu ,
our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift . ||| wenda nko mu miryango yacu yagiye yimurwa . hari aho babaga batuye nko ku musozi , ariko kubera ko bavugaaga bati @: "@ harimo ibintu by' ibyitso by' inyenzi hariya . @"
i remember how my family was tortured and we had no security . ||| bikaba ngombaw ko nabo bagenda baimuka , kuburyo no murugo twaratotejwe icyo kihae tubura securite .
my father used to work in exile ; he used to go on long trips and then interahamwe would attack us at night ; they would bang on our door ... but we would be patient because the same people we were supposed to report to were the ones to initiate everything . ||| kuko umusaza wanjye yari umuntu ukunda kukora hanze , mu bintu byo hanze by' amasafari , ariko tukatotezaw ukasanga nijoro interahamwe zateye mu rugo , bakubise inzugi ,
i guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it . ||| bagize kutae . ariko nyine umuntu akapfa kuihangana , kuko abo uregairaga kirya kihae ni nabo banabikoraaga . uraumva rero ko hagati ahongaho ntabunri buryo umuntu yagombaaga kuba yakwidefanda [ kuirwanaho ] uretse wenda kuhamagara nk' abaturanyi ukababwira uti @:
still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ i got such and such problem . @" ||| "@ tugize ibyago ibi n' ibi , " nabwo abo wishyikiraho wunvako bashobora kuba bagufitiye ikaizerae mufitanye ikaizerae . ukababwira uti @: "@ nhuye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi ,
but since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do . ||| " ariko nabo kubera ko nta kintu bakufashaaga wenda bakakubwira bati @: "@ gerageza ugirae gutya cyangwa se ihanganae cyangwa se gira gutya , nta kunri kuntu tubigenza . @"
we definitely used to get such problems . in fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . but they never did any harm to us . ||| ariko ibyo bibazo byo turabigize cyane kugeza n' ubwo jenoside yagiye kuba mu rugo bamaze kuhatera nk' incuro nk' eshatu . ariko ntibabashae kugira icyo bageraho .
you told us some of your family members would be forced to shift . ||| utubwiye ko hari abantu bagiye bimura bo mu muryango wawe .
do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ? ||| hari abo wibuka utubwira amazina ,
where did they go or where were they taken ? ||| babakuraaga he babajyana he ?
yeah ... okay , there was ... well i can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in gikondo and in kinazi before . ||| yee , ok , harimo nka mu ... ok namwita nk' aho ari marume ,
when they left kinazi , they went to cyangugu . ||| kuko cyo kihae we bari batuye hano i gikondo ariko bakaba barabanje kutura i kinazi . bava i kinazi , bamaze kuva i kinazi bajya i cyangugu ,
they made move to cyangugu and then they came back here in gikondo . ||| naho barabimura nibwo bagarutse kutura hano i gikondo .
during the time when people were suspected to be traitors , there is one of my relatives who was beaten up to the extent that he died after going crazy . ||| so , hagati aho rero igihe iby' ibyitso biri bikomeye , hari uwo bafashemo wacu . baranamukubise ku buryo yanapfuye yarabaye umusazi ,
his name was francois . ||| yitwaaga francois .
he died in the genocide in gikondo , an area where there used to be a terrible interahammwe called ‘ congolais ’ [ congolese ] . ||| ubu jenoside ejobundi niyo yabatsinze i gikondo , ahantu baitaaga ngo hari interahamwe ikomeye baitaaga kongore [ congolais ] .
his mother [ francois ' ] was called nyinakazi w'inyezi [ meaning ‘ mother of inyenzi ’ ] in gikondo . the genocide found them in gikondo . ||| bakaba rero nyine uwo mukecuru baramwitaga ko ariwe nyinakazi w' inyenzi muri gikondo hariya . ubwo nyine jenoside niho yaje kubatsinda nyine ,
their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work . ||| abandi bakagenda babaaka ibyangombwa , ntibabashae kusohoka , ntibabashae kukora akazi .
whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to inyenzi . ||| bavuga ko iyo basohotse bagiye hanze , baba bajyanye amabanga y' inyenzi ,
and whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from inyenzi . ||| bagaruka bakaba aribyo babaga bagarukaanye .
they would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . one could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family . ||| ariko bagerageza kubisaka ntibanabibonae n' ibintu nk' ibyo ... ariko ukaumva ko hagati aho babaga mu muryango hari insecurite .
it was well known that there was a tribal war between the hutu and the tutsi . ||| birazwi ko muri icyo kihae hari hariho intambara y' amoko , y' abahutu n' abatutsi .
and you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home . ||| utubwiye yuko papa wawe yakundaaga kujya hanze , na maman wawe akasigara ahongaho ,
do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a tutsi ? ||| ubwo papa wawe yaziraaga ko yakundaaga kujya hanze ? cyangwa yaziraaga ko ari umututsi ... ?
well , he was not harassed because he was a tutsi but because he used to say things the way they were . ||| eh , yazira ko ... we yaziraaga , si nibyongibyo by' ubututsi we yaziraaga ko avugaish ukuri ,
another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an inyenzi . ||| ubundi akazair ko yashatse mu mafamiye baitaaga ko ari iy' inyenzi nyine ibintu nkibyo . ubundi akazair ko nanone ari umuntu uvugaish ukuri ,
he was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort . ||| ari umuntu ukunda kugira inshuti cyane z' ahantu henshi cyane zitandukanye . hakabamo n' ibintu by' amashyari nyine by' amako ; iby' amoko bikajya ku ruhande , uturere ibintu nk' ibyo .
the place where we lived was located in a very bad area . ||| kuko n' ahantu turi tutuye hari habi cyane ,
you have probably heard of a place called ‘ camp butaro ’ . ||| ni ahantu mwumvaga baitaaga ngo ni muri "@ camp butaro @"@ ,
all the refugees who came from ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area . ||| za mpunzi zavaaga za ruhengeri za he bose bazaaga hariya mri ako kacae .
could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... what was his behaviour ? ||| utubwira muri makeya ... kuko wambwi ... uvuze ko bamuzizaaga ko yavugaishaga ukuri , ariko ... uko yabiitwaraagamo hagati ahongaho ,
the times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ? ||| n' iyo mwaganiraga avuga ati @: "@ bariya bantu banziza iki ? @"
tell us in brief how he used to handle it . ||| utubwira muri make ukuntu yabiitwaraagamo ?
in fact what he was accused of , he was accused ... first of all he was someone who ... did not like the ideas of jealousy or of ethnic or regional segregation . ||| ubundi ikintu we bamuzizaaga , bamuzizaaga ko ... icya mbere bamuzizaaga ko ari umuntu donc ... utakunda ibintu wenda tukuita ko nk' ahoari amashyari cyangwa se by' irondakoko cyangwa se irondakarere .
secondly , he was not afraid of saying the truth , he did not fear anyone and he could n't support anyone he would see doing something wrong . ||| kandi bakanamuziza ko we yari wa muntu utatinya ibyo kuvuga ngo nrakutinya kuko uri umuntu , cyangwa se nrakutinya kubera yuko nbona ukora aya makosa wunvae ko nyakushyigikiyemo ,
never ! ||| oya .
so , they thought he was against them . they would say , "@ why is it that when we tell him our ideas he never agrees with us ? @" ||| sasa bikatuma rero bavuga bati @: "@ uyu muntu araturwanya , kuki tushaka kukora ibi , twe tumubwira ibingibi akabianga . @"
what made things worse is that whenever he would go away on long trips , he would bring us tapes of inkotayi or kayirebwe 's video tapes . ||| binakubitairho ko yabaga yagiye nk' iyo mu masafari akatuzanira amakasete wenda inkotanyi iki ... zaba iza video zaba iza ba kayirebaw ibintu kibyo .
so there was always a question mark . ||| bikaba rero nyine biratumaaga bagira ikintu cy' ako kabazo cyane . kuko ...
he was victimized because other hutus would say , "@ this is our fellow hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @" ||| mbese icyo bamuzizaaga n' uko abandi bahutu bavuga bati @: "@ uyu muhutu mwene wacu kuki atakora kimwe ntawe ? @"
he would tell them , "@ this is not the way things should be . @" ||| nawe akababwira ati @: "@ ibingibi ntabwo ariko bimeze . @"
could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that habyarimana 's plane crashed ? ||| utubwira muri makeya mukimara kaumva ko indege ya habyarimana yaguye , cyangwa bamaze kuyirasa . mu rugo iwanyu babiakiriye batae ?
i remember i was revising my lessons and my mum was cleaning up my young brother in the sitting room . ||| donc , njyewe nrabiibuka icyo kihae nri ndi muri etude umukecuru wanjye yari arimo yoza karumuna kanjye muri salon .
my dad owned a small bar where he was sharing a drink with other people , and then we heard that habyarimana died . ||| ubwo muzehe nawe yari afite akantu kameze nk' akabuvette aho yarimo asangira n' abandi bantu tugiye kaumva tuumva ko habyarimana yapfuye .
i could tell that there was a change on my parents ' faces . ||| ariko uko nbibonye nbonye ko ababyeyi bahise bahindura isura , ubwo uraumva ko kiriya kihae turi abana ntabwo bashoboraaga kutusobanurair buri kimwe cyose . ariko nhise nbona harimo nk' akantu ko kukonja hagati y' ababyeyi ,
by then we were young , and although they would not tell us exactly what was going on , i could feel the tension in my parents and in everyone who was at home . ||| hagati y' abantu donc bari mu rugo .
tell us in brief ... from where he said , "@ let 's flee . @" ||| utubwira muri make ukakomeza uhereye mbese kuba yarabwiye ati @: "@ tuhungae , " nyuma y' aho bya ... , niba wibuka n' amatariki ,
what happened later ... if you remember the dates or if it was two or three days later ... up to his death , what happened ? ||| uti @: "@ igihe iki n' iki ; hashize iminsi ibiri , cyangwa itatu wenda ... kugeza ku rupfu rwe bigenze bite ? @"
i do n't remember the days but i know we were ... yeah , what happened in the meantime . ||| icyo kihae ntinibuka ariko nzi ko twebwe ... yeee ukuntu bigenze hagati aho ,
the morning after the plane crashed , i remember he tuned in radio muhabura to listen to news at around five in the morning . ||| bakimara kurasa indege . bukeye bawho mugitondo , nrabiibuka ko yafunguye muhabura nka saa .... , nka saa kumi n' imwe gutyo arimo yumva amakuru .
then some man called evode called , he was my brother 's godfather . ||| ubwo noneho haza guterefona umugabo uri utuye ku kicukiro baitaaga evode , evode ariko akaba yari yarabyaye muri batisimu karumuna kanjye .
as they were talking he told my father how things were , he said we had no way to flee before it 's too late . ||| barimo baganira aramubwira ati @: "@ sasa rero ukuntu ibintu bimeze ,
secondly , he said that those who could have helped us were too far . ||| ntabwo tufite ubufasha bw' ukuntu tushobora kubaba tuhunga hakiri kare , ikindi cya kabiri , n' abashobora kututabara bari kure yacu cyane . @"
there was no way we would walk up to c.n.d ; it was impossible . ||| nta kuntu tugombaaga kukora urugendo ruva ahangaha ngo tugerae kuri c.n.d. ntibiri kushoboka .
he tried making phone calls ... people who were outside the country would call him asking about the situation in kigali . ||| agerageza guterefona , abantu bagaterefona bo hanze babaza bati @: "@ ese bite i kigali bimeze kutae ?
they would say ; "@ we have heard that habyarimana 's plane was crashed , how are things there ? @" ||| tumaze kaumva ko indege ya habyarimana yarashwe , ariko se bimeze bite ? @" arababwira ati @:
we were waiting to see what would happen because they had forbidden people to go out of their homes . ||| "@ twebwe tutegereje kusa ko hari ikindi kintu kishobora kuba wenda kibaho , " kuko bari bavuze ko abantu batagomba kusohoka mu mazu ,
nobody was allowed to go out of his or her house . but the wise men had already sensed what was going to happen next . ||| nta n' uwemerewe kusohoka . ariko abari bazi ubwenge bari bamaze kumenya ikigiye kuba icyo ari cyo .
meanwhile he received several phone calls from inside and outside the country , people were asking him how the situation was . ||| ubwo hagati ahongaho yakomeje kugenda yakira amaterefone yo hanze no hino , amubaza uko bimeze .
he would tell them , "@ i am at home with my family but we do n't have a way out . ||| ababwira ati @: "@ nnjyae ahantu ndi , ati @: ndi kumwe na famille yanjye ariko tubuze ahantu tuca ,
people are being killed in front of my house , things are horrible here . @" ||| ubu n' abari kuica bari kuicira inberae y' umuryango w' iwanjye hano , ati @: hagati ahongaho ati @: nrabona ari ibintu bikomeye .
a certain neighbour whose wife was my mom 's sister . ||| ubwo hakaba hari undi musanzire we bari baturanye ,
his wife was pregnant ; she was carrying twins . he had several other brothers . ||| nawe yari afite umudamu utwite kabisa , inda y' impanga . kubera ko uwo musanzire wacu nawe yari afite barumuna be banri ,
they were all together in the same house . ||| nabo bari bari kumwe munzu ,
then my dad told him , "@ instead of ... there is no way you will hide your wife , you 'd better bring her to my home and leave her there . then the rest , everyone should find his own way . ||| papa aramubwira ati rero ati aho kugira ngo , ntahantu uri bucaishe uwo mudamu , ibiiza reka tumuzanae umusigae murugo ,
whoever will survive will tell the story . @" that is what happened , they brought he home and others started fleeing in different directions . ||| namwe buri umwe acae ukwe n' undi ukwe , ubwo uzarokoka azabara inkuru . niko bigenze umudamu aza mu rugo , ubwo abandi nabo bakomeza kuhunga ukwabo .
as people would keep on coming to hide at home , the interahamwe would also plan how to attack us . ||| noneho uko abantu bakomeje kugenda bisuka mu rugo , ni nako interahamwe nazo zajyaaga imigambi yo kugira ngo babae batutera .
although they were making plans , they were also afraid that my dad would fight them . ||| ariko noneho mu kututera bakaba baratinyaaga ko ibyo ari byo byose muzehe ashobora kuba wenda yabarwanya .
indeed he tried though he failed ; they were very many . ||| ariko yaranabigerageje birananiraan , kuko bari benshi .
they first shot our gate ; it was a very big gate , they shot with so many bullets and it never fell down . they fought to open the different gates around the fence for two days in vain . ||| kuko babanje kurasa portaille nini cyane babanje kuyirasa amasasu menshi irabananira kuko murugo baharwanaiye iminsi ibiri , inzugi zaanze kufunguka zo hanze z' amaportaille .
it was one day in the evening when they finally decided to climb up the fence and get inside the compound . ||| noneho nimugoroba nibwo bize umugambi kumugoroba , bashobora kurair ibipangu nibwo baguye mo inberae .
for two weeks things were still the same ; phone calls time after time ... in that area where we were living , others had already fled . ||| ariko ubwo tumaze nk' ibyumweru nka bibiri , bikiri ahongaho , amaterefone agicicikana n' iki ... ubwo muri iyo quartier turi tutuyemo abandi bari bamaze kuhunga ,
people 's houses were being burnt and people were being killed . ||| abandi bamaze kutwikirwa , abandi bamaze kupfa .
generally there was no place to hide . ||| nta hantu donc na hamwe , umuntu ashobora kuba yabona yahungira .
two weeks later ... they came to kill us ... on a friday at around 6:00 p.m. i do n't remember well the dates but i am sure two weeks had passed . ||| ubwo nyuma y' ibyumweru bibiri kuko batuishe ari ... , kuwa kangahe ... kuwa gatanu mu ma saa kumi n' ebyiri . ntinibuka amatariki neza , ariko nzi ko ari nka nyuma y' ibyumweru bibiri .
that evening they entered our home . ||| ubwo , nibwo bainjiye ari nimugoroba ,
they jumped the gate and shot the front door and it opened . ||| baraza barasimbuka urupangu , barasa urugi rw' inberae urw' inberae rurakinguka . nibwo bazaaga mu rupangu bagezemo , baravuga bati ,
then they all entered inside the gate but we had locked ourselves inside the house . ||| ubwo turi twifungiranye . baravuga bati @: "@ mukingurae . @"
they ordered to open the door but my dad said , "@ whether i open or not will n't make any difference , they will still shoot the doors and open them by force . @" ||| muzehe aravuga ati @: "@ ninkingura , byose ni hahanri nta kunri kuntu turi bubigenze n' ubundi , bararasa inzugi ni hahanri bari bwifungurire ku ngufu . @"
that line of people ... it was the people who were inside the house and the ones inside the compound . ||| uwo murongo w' abantu , uwo murongo w' aba ... abari bari mu rugo ni abari bari mu rupangu n' ubundi bari bahahungiye .
they had sought refuge at home . ||| kuko muzehe yarabaterefonnye arababwira ati @: "@ mwebwe nimubona binaniraanye , bamwe mubaoherezae hano murugo ,
my dad would call people and tell them that in case things got worse where they were , some should come to his house while others flee to other areas . ||| abandi mucicikane , buri umwe ahungae ukwe ahungae ukwe ,
he would warn them from fleeing in a big group saying that , in case they ambushed them , they would die in a big number . ||| ntimugendae muri muesae . kuko nibabatega , bashobora kubatega bakabica muesae . ibiiza ,
"@ send me the ones i can hide and tell the strong boys and girls to flee in separate directions . do n't let them flee in a big number . @" ||| muoherezae abo mushoboye , ab' abasore barimo cyangwa se inkumi zikirimo , baumva bafite ingufu , mushakishae uburyo buri umwe agendae ukwe ukwe ,
he would tell them . ||| ntimugendae muri benshi .
he never thought that such a thing would happen . mostly , he felt pity for the children and the women who were n't able to run . ||| ariko ku bwe nyine yabonaaga ko bitashoboka kuko cyane cyane yababazawaga n' abo bana batoya , n' abo bagorae babo batari bubashae kuiruka ,
he thought such people would easily be killed . ||| bari bugendae bica umugenda .
at least a man is capable of fighting or running . ||| ariko nk' umuntu w' umugabo aravuga ati @: "@ biibura baranrwanya ndi buirukae banrase wenda cyangwa se bankubitae umuheto [ kumurasa n' umuheto ] nkomezae ariko wenda kugeza igihe nribuze kupfair ,
even if they are shot while trying to run they can keep on running only if they are not fleeing with the rest of their family . ||| ariko tutapfaanye n' umuryango wose . @"
they got us out of the house . we were very many forming a rank and they took us outside . ||| yee , ubwo rero uwo murongo batusohoye turi benshi , batushyira hanze .
they would shoot every person to get out , i was the fifth person to be shot . ||| ubwo barasa uwo babanzaagaho nyine wabo , ubwo barakomeza , jyae banrashe ndi uwa ... ndi uwa gatanu .
after shooting me ... they shot me while i was trying to escape ; i was sitting somewhere where there was a drum supported by stones . ||| bamaze kunrasa , ariko ubwo mu kunrasa akaba yaranrasaaga njyae nshaka gutoroka . kuko ahantu turi tuicaye hari hari ikintu k' ikigunguzi kiri hejuru cy' amabuye ,
around there , there was a small door , which they [ militias ] had shot and it was open ... the militias entered in a big number and i could see that no one was standing at the door . ||| ariko hakaba hari akantu k' akaryango k' inyuma bari bagize barashe karafunguka , ubwo noneho bo bainjira ari benshi kuburyo uwo muryango nrawurebaaga nkabona ko nta muntu uhahagaze .
as i was trying to stand up , he shot me here [ he shows ] and i fell down . ||| sasa muri kwa kujya kuhaguruka gutya nibwo yahise anrasa hano [ yerekana mu irugu ] nikubita hasi .
when i fell down , maybe he thought i was dead . he skipped me and shot those who were around me . ||| ubwo nikubise hasi , niba yaraketse ko npfuye simbizi . anca hejuru , arasa ubwo abandi bari bari iruhande rwanjye
at the end one of them said , "@ this is not enough , open a grenade . @" ||| ubwo barangije , umwe ati @: "@ ariko , ati @:
they opened one . ||| ibi ntibihagije , ati @: nimufungurae grenade . @" baba barayifunguye .
i even still have its scars somewhere here ; i have two fragments inside ere . ||| n' ubungubu nfite ahantu zanfashe hano , nfitemo fragment ebyiri . ubwo uko zakakubise , zirakubise ubwo nnjyae iba iranyinjiye ,
as they threw the grenade , i was also hurt but it just felt like an injection so i ignored it . ||| ariko mu kunyinjira , numvise ari nk' akantu kameze nk' urushinge . ntinbiitaho ,
i thought in case i breathed , they would hear me . ||| nravuga nti @: sasa nimpumeka , abantu baranyumva .
therefore , i remained in the floods of blood and kept quiet . my shirt was full of blood and everyone who was lying on top of me had blood all over . ||| nnjyae nguma muri ya maraso ntaceceka ndaturiya kusa ... ariko ubwo ishati ubwo inyuma yahindutse amaraso , abanryamye hejuru bose babaye amaraso .
i just kept quiet . and then they threw another grenade and some of them walked over people 's bodies stabbing them with knives . ||| ubwo jyewe icyo nkoze nracecetse kusa , ntaceceka nrabiihorera basubiramo batera grenade , abandi bakajya bagenda bakandagira bajomba ibyuma ,
i did n't notice one who wanted to stab me . ||| ntinzi uwaje kunjomba ubwo icyuma ariko arahusha ,
fortunately he missed and hit the ground on the grass instead . ||| kijomba muri pasiparume hasi ariko nrakiumvaaga kabisa ko ari njyae yaje aje kukijomba ;
i sensed that it was me he wanted to stab . he again raised up the knife and stabbed me on the shoulder . when he saw me bleeding , he thought we were all dead . ||| araongera arazamura ajomba hano [ yerekanye ku rutugu ] , arebye asanga amaraso arava , aravuga ati @: " ibyo ari byo byose nta wukihumeka urimo . @"
therefore , they left . ||| nibwo bazamukaaga .
i was watching them as they were leaving . ||| ariko muri uko kuzamuka ubwo bazamukaaga nbareba .
i rose up my head a bit but everybody was silent ; they were all dead . ||| noneho icyo nkoze nhise negura umutwe , ngize ntya ngize gutya , nsanga abantu bose nta n' umwe uri kuvuga , bose babaye intumbi intumbi bose .
i stood up ... one thing i remember is the way i entered the house and picked up the blanket ; it was raining and the blanket was very big . ||| nrabyuka ntahagarara . kusa ikintu njyewe nibuka nkoze , ninjiye munzu , nsohora ikiringiti ,
therefore , i covered them and covered myself with a loincloth , which belonged to my mum . ||| imvura yaragwaaga , kinini cyane ; ndorosa . maze korosa icyo nfashe nhise nfata igitenge cy' umukecuru ntakitera .
i had lost my mind ; i would wonder if i should get into the house and sleep . ||| ariko ubwo nkaumva nbaye igishushungwe nravuga , ese @: njyae munzu nryamae ?
i was confused . sometimes people cry but i did n't have tears to cry , not even a drop . ||| numvaaga nta n' umutima nkifite , bya binri byo kuvuga ngo umuntu ararira , numvaaga nta n' amarira , habae n' ikitonyanga .
instead i would think about what had happened to me and i 'd suddenly feel so confused . ||| kusa ahubwo ntekerezaaga ibintu binbayeho izo saha , nkaumva nnjyae binshobeye .
yes ... my mum was also shot . ||| yee , umukecuru nawe baramurashe kusa ,
she was a "@ born again christian . @" she liked praying so much ; all i would hear her say was , "@ jesus christ @"@ . ||| yari umuntu w' umurokorae ukunda kuisengera , numvaaga za yezu kristu kusa . ubwo barumuna banjye nabo ubwo , bari baegeranyae gutya .
and my brothers were next to each other ; they were made to sit in a line like this ... i heard people screaming besides . ||| kuko babicaje ku murongo , bari baicaye ku murongo nk' uko tuba tuicaye gutya . ubwo abandi numva induru ku ruhande ... iki ,
i remember my aunt ... there was no other way but if i had had help , she would have survived . ||| hakaba ariko hari harimo umutante wanjye umwe ,
she died in the banana plantation but i too was helpless , i could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant . ||| ni uko nyine nta kunri biri kugenda ariko iyo abasha nko kubona ubufasha wenda aba yaranakize kuko we yanpfairiye mu ntoki kabisa gutya . nta bunri bufasha nri nfite , nta ki ... yari afite inda y' impanga ,
for her she still had some strength to breathe . ||| ubona kabisa ko akifite umwuka .
there was nothing i could do for her , myself i had lost conscience due to what had happened to me . ||| kuko nta kinri kintu nri kubasha kukora nnjyae , numvaaga nnjyae ntazi ukuntu nbaye . kuko we mamusize ahongaho bimaze kurangira ,
i left her after she had breathed her last breath . by the time i left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead . ||| nibwo njyewe nhise ngenda . ariko ubwo muri uko kubyuka , nta n' umwe ukomaaga , umukecuru we bari barangije kumurangiriza ,
they shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here . ||| bamaze kumurasa , bamurashe amasasu atatu . abiri yaciye hano irinri rica hano ,
my brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head . ||| barumuna banjye bo bagiye babakubitagura ubuhairi , amasasu aha [ yerekanye mu mutawe ] n' iki ,
there was a big stream of blood . ||| kuko yari umuvu munini cyane w' amaraso menshi cyane .
but when you left , you never got a chance to know that ... ||| ariko urahavuye ntiwongeye kumenya ngo ...
i never got another chance to know what happened next . ||| nta kinri kintu nongeye kumenya .
i came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up . ||| kusa icyo nzi cyo nongeye kumenya nyuma yaho ni uko kusa nje intambara irangiye bibinri nyine , jenoside imaze kurangira , ubwo aribwo igihugu kikitangira nyine kwisanasana n' iki .
and i found only corpses lying in the compound . ||| nibwo nje nsanga intumbi kusa ziri aho mu rupangu hose zirajyaye ,
i tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide . ||| ahantu hose . nbasha kushaka abanfasha , kuko hariho abandi bacitse ku icumu bagenzi banjye bo kuri uwo murengae ,
they helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ... ||| babashije wenda kunfasha kuba umuntu yapfa kubarenzaho akataka kusa kugira ngo umuntu arebae ...
by that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ? ||| icyo kihae ushoboraaga kumenya ababyeyi bawe cyangwa ...
by that time , i could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing . ||| icyo kihae ntabwo nbashaaga kubamenya buretse nk' ipantaro papa yari yambaye n' igitenge umukecuru yari yambaye . ok , wenda na burumuna bwanjye nabwo nbashaaga kumenya wenda nk' igice cy' umwenda yari yambaye ,
i could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing . ||| ikabutura cyangwa se ishati ,
things like that . ||| ibintu nk' ibyongibyo .
were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ? ||| ubashije kubashyingura mu cyubahiro ?
i was n't able to do that . ||| mu cyubahiro ntabwo bibashije ,
you see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal . ||| kubera ko kirya kihae urabona ubuzima buri , abantu niyo bari bakiva mu bibazo n' igihugu ariyo kikitangira kwisuganya kugira ngo barebae ko batangira kudemara .
we did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony . ||| urebye ntabwo tukoze ibintu binri bihaambaye nta kinri ,
we just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil . ||| tufashe kusa , tushaka imyenda myiza n' iki , ni uko turabasasair mo indani , turenzaho itaka .
then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else . ||| kusa icyo tukoze tumennyeho ikintu cy' igisima cyo hejuru kusa nta kinri kintu .
from the time you left your home . ||| kuva uvuye mu rugo .
when i left home i continued to walk . ||| nvuye mu rugo ubwo nrakomeje nragenda , ariko ubwo muri uko kukomeza ,
but even as i was going , there were some people who were behind me . they tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving kicuciro for gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there . ||| niko nkifite n' abampiga inyuma , kuko bagerageje kushakisha ahantu hose , bava ndetse n' aho baitaaga ku kicukiro bajya i gikondo . ahandi hantu turi tufite amazu ,
therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me . ||| baza kureba ko wenda abantu b' aho aribo baba bampishe .
they found out that i never went there . ||| ahubwo basanga na hariya ntinigeze mpagera .
after the struggle , that is after meeting the inkotanyi i told them [ inkotanyi ] all i went through and where i had been . ||| ubwo hagati ahongaho aho souffrance [ imibabaro ] zirangiye , nibwo maze kuhura n' inkotanyi nbashije nabo kubasobanurair ibibazo nhuye nabyo , nbabwira n' aho narokokeye .
they helped me as much as they could . ||| bagerageza kunfasha uko bishoboka ,
they asked me , "@ how are you ? @" ||| baranbwira bati @: "@ ese bite ? @"
i told them that my problem was the injury i had . ||| nrababwira nti @: kusa ikibazo nfite ni invunae ,
they could see it had rotten because i never used to get treatment . ||| kandi murabona hari haraboze kabisa , kuko nta muti nbonaaga nta n' ikintu nbonaaga kinvura .
they treated me and later asked me to go home and start looking for a living . ||| babasha kunyondora , n' iki . baranbwira bati @: "@ genda usubirae mu buzima bwawe busanzwe . @"
my current life ... well i can not say that it is very good but still i can not say that it is too bad . ||| ariko ubu hagati aha ibyo aribyo byose nrabona ubuzima bwanjye , ok , si bwiza cyane , ariko nta n' ubwo ari bubi ,
when there is peace in the country and one is able to sleep peacefully , then life goes on . ||| kuko burya iyo ubasha kuryama mu mahoro , ukaramuka , ubuzima burakomeza .
after you met the inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ? ||| ukimara kubonaan n' inkotanyi zikakubwira ngo ujyae mu buzima bwawe busanzwe , ukoze iki hagati ahongaho , ugiye he ?
whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ? ||| ubanye na nde ? ikikutunga ukibonaaga utae ?
what happened later after they left me , i went to kicuciro . ||| hagati ahongaho ... ubwo ... ukuntu bigenze ubwo nyuma , bamaze kunreka ubwo nibwo nhise njya ku kicukiro , hakaba hari umuntu wo muri famille uri uraharokotse . ariko nawe ,
there is someone from my family who had survived but i never knew ... when the war began , i guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them . ||| nkaba nibuka ko , eh , intuza ... intambara igeze , nyuma wenda y' icyumweru kimwe .
therefore , i thought they had all died . ||| bakaba bari bamaze kutumenyaish ko bo deja batutanze kupfa . numvaaga rero ibyo ari byo byose nabo batakiriho ,
i went to remera near iamca , where kie [ kigali institute of education ] presently is . ||| ubwo nragenda njya i remera hafi na iamca [ aho k.i.e iri ubu ] .
then i met a certain man who had come from uganda ; he knew my family . ||| nibwo nje kubona umugabo umwe uri uvuye i buganda , ok nawe yari aziraanye no mu rugo .
he took me to school in uganda . i studied there for a while and came back to rwanda . ||| aza kunjyana kuiga i bugande nigayo igihe gitoya nragaruka ,
i registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . that is how things used to be . ||| ino ahangaha nraiyandikisha ntakomeza nraiga buhoro buhoro buhoro . ariko uko nrebye nbonaaga ubuzima ibyo aribyo byose uko ngiye nbubamo ... ubwo n' ukonguko bigiye bigenda ,
i would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on . ||| nkahura n' abantu b' inshuti abari inshuti ab' inshuti ntinzi cya ... nabo wenda ba ... baangirira impuhwe kubera ibibazo nfite n' akanrimo . ubuzima bugenda bugenda gutyo ...
i finally got used to it and started living a normal life . ||| kugeza ubwo nje kumenyera nsubira mu buzima busanzwe .
i would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened . ||| nkanavuga nti ibyo ari byo byose n' ubwo na jenoside yabaye ibyo ari byo byose ibyabaye ,
one can never forget what happened but life has to go on . ||| ibyo aribyo byose ariko umuntu agomba kushaka ubuzima . n' ubwo umuntu atabiibagirwa ariko ubuzima bugomba kukomeza .
did you manage to finish school ? ||| ushoboye ku ... kuiga ? urangiza se ... ?
i used to have a problem of headaches . ||| ngiraaga ikibazo cyo kurwara ku ... umutwe .
i would be attentive in class but all of a sudden i would get terrible headaches . another problem was due to my arm ; it would hurt me so much and i would n't ... ||| nba nakurikiye nkaiga nkaiga ariko ngeraho nkaumva nrwaye umutwe cyane , no kubera ikibazo cy' aka kaboko , kakarya cyane simbashe kugira ... ntuza ...
you said you suffered a lot . ||| wigeze kutubwira y' uko watesetse cyane .
but you never explained very well to us how you suffered . ||| ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo utusobanuraiye neza uko guteseka ...
eh ... the way i suffered ... ||| eh , guteseka kwanjye ukuntu bigenze ...
what happened in your life in general ? ||| ukuntu bigenze mu buzima rusangae usibye ibyo byose ,
not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now . ||| mu buzima rusangae watesetse kutae kuva ababyeyi bawe ukimara kubabura kugeza ubu ,
what has been the most challenging thing ? ||| wunva ari iki cyagutushije kugeza ubu ?
loosing both my parents ? ||| ok , kuba nbura ababyeyi ? ok !
well ... first of all i started another kind of life , which i was n't used to . ||| icya mbere , ngiye mu buzima ntari menyereye ,
because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living . ||| surtout [ cyane cyane ] kubera ko burya iyo uri kumwe n' ababyeyi kandi ukiri na mutoya , burya hari ibintu ... hari imyaka burya ugeramo , wenda bamaze kukukuza nawe ukamenya aho niveau y' ukuntu ushobora kuba uba ushaka ubuzima bwawe .
i entered another life that i was not used to . ||| ariko ubwo nringiye mu buzima ntamenyereye .
living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something i needed . ||| kuba nta muntu nfite ushobora kuba unfasha wenda mu bitekerezo runaka , wenda nvugae nti nkeneye iki mbe nhita nkibona .
those are the things that would disturb me . ||| ibyo nabyo biri ibintu bigiye bingora .
the fact that ... those are things i noticed . ||| no kuba byonyine kusa ... n' ibyo nbonye byonyine ,
the way i saw people dying and the way i was skipping corpses , people i would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me . ||| n' ukuntu nbonye ukuntu abantu bapfa , n' ukuntu ngiye nbona nsimbuka intumbi , abo ngiye ngeraho nziko aribo bashobora kunrokora ahubwo nkabona nabo barashaka kunyica .
until when i met the inkotanyi . ||| kugeza ubwo nje kuhura n' inkotanyi .
i remember there was a man who lived here and we met at sainte famille . ||| kuko nrabiibuka hari umugabo wa hano tuhuraiye niba ari ... hano munsi ya sainte famille ,
he assured me that he was going to save me . ||| anbwira ko agiye kunrokora .
but we reached somewhere and i noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . i escaped him and run away ; i escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where i went . ||| ariko tugeze ahantu nbona ahubwo ahantu anjyanye , ni ku cyobo . ndamutoroka nriruka . nkwepera mu bantu bari bari ahongaho ntiyamenya ahanyu nrengeye .
i saw different things in life . ||| so , ngiye nbona rero ibintu bigiye bitandukanye cyane mu buzima ,
i saw people suffer . ||| nkagenda nbona ukuntu abantu bafite ibibazo ,
i saw how after the genocide orphans got problems , i included . ||| nkareba ukuntu nyuma y' aho jenoside birangiraiye ukuntu imfubyi zagiye zihura n' ibibazo , cyangwa se nnjyae ibyo ngiye nbona n' iki .
i got used to a different life style . ||| n' ubuzima ngiye menyera ntari menyereye .
god helped me now i am used to the new life style . ||| uko imaan yagiye infasha ubu maze kubimenyera .
there is a saying that , "@ akabi ntikamenyerwa nk'akeza . @" it means it is more difficult to get used to bad things than to good things . but later you get used due to the situation . yeah ... ||| burya yego baravuga ngo @: "@ akabi ntikamenyeraw nk' akaeza , " ariko bigera aho ukabimenyera bitewe na cas [ n' ubuzima ] urimo . umh
life went on like that ... i would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could . ||| ubwo nyine ubuzima bukagenda gutyo . uwo nbashije kubwira igitekerezo cyanjye , yabona ari ngombaw ko anfasha akanfasha .
until i got totally used to it and i grew older , which made me so happy . ||| kuza kugeza ubwo numva maze kabisa kumenyera , no kuba maze kuigira hejuru , numva ari ibintu bishimaishije cyane .
in your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ? ||| wunva kuri wowe ari iki wibuka kikakubabaza kurusha ibindi , muri wowe ;
something that takes away your joy . ||| kandi kikakutaish kuba ukuishima .
what hurts you most whenever you remember it ? ||| ni nk' iki wunva wibuka kikakubabaza cyane ?
living without my relatives ... no family , which is the most important thing ... living without anybody to tell my problems . ||| kuba ntari kumwe n' abavandimwe kuba ... ok , nta famille , ibyo nabyo biri mu bintu bya mbere , ko kubaho ntawe nfite nbwira ibibazo byanjye nimba we yabikemura .
sometimes i say , "@ i could get this or that in such a way , but since there is nobody to help me , what can i do ? @" ||| surtout ukasanga icyo kintu [ arimyoza ] nkaicara wenda nkavuga nti iki kintu nkagombye kukibona muri ubu buryo . ariko se ko nbona ntawe nfite ukinfashamo , bigenda kutae ?
then i remember that , i could have been with my parents or relatives and they could have helped me in such a time . ||| [ arimyoza ] bikatuma mpita nibuka nti @: ubu iki kihae iki n' iki , iyaba umubyeyi aba andi hafi , cyangwa undi muvandimwe yaka kinfashijemo .
however , it does n't discourage me . secondly i am hurt by the kind of life orphans lead yet they were n't meant to live that way . ||| kusa ntibicae intege , kandi na none nkababazaw ubuzima imfubyi barimo ku viva [ kubaho ] butakagombye kuba ngombaw .
especially when they are three or four orphans who can not help one another . ||| na none ukasanga wenda muri ... surtout muri nk' imfubyi eshatu enye , ariko muesae ukasanga ntacyo mumariranye ,
it is a pity . ||| nabyo ukasanga ari agahinda na none .
well ... even if you are an orphan , life has to go on whatever the case may be ... ||| ibyo aribyo byose , eh bigaragara ko niyo uba uri imfubyi ugomba ... ubuzima bugomba kukomeza .
yes , that is true life has to go on . and it is still going on . ||| yee , kabisa ibyo byo nbona ko bugomba kukomeza ... n' ubu buranakomeza rwose .
what advise can you give someone like you who passed through such hardships and who experienced a hard life ? those who lead a life like yours ? ||| eh ! nragira ngo nkawe ubinyuzemo ufite experience [ inararibonye ] y' ubuzima bugoye nk' ubwo , ni iyihe nama ugira abantu bafite ubuzima nk' ubwawe ?
the advice i can give them ... first of all i would encourage them to have morale . ||| kusa inama nbagira , ikintu cya mbere nbaha moral .
they should know that in life such things ... well , such things happened because people had become wild due to bad governance . ||| bakamenya ko mu buzima biriya ni ibintu , ok bibayeho kubera y' uko abantu kirya kihae bari babaye inyamaswa kubera na politique mbi .
another advice i can give them is to use their time efficiently . ||| ikindi kintu nbagiraho inama , ni uko uwunva afite ubu afite occasion yo kuba igihe cye yakikoresha neza , akaba yakikoresha .
if one has a chance to go to school , he or she should study . ||| niba abashije kuiga akaiga ,
if one gets a job then he or she should work . ||| niba abashije se kubona ako kazi akakabona ,
or if there is someone who has a farm with destroyed houses , he or she should try to build there his or her own house and put there his or her own family when they get an opportunity to do so . ||| niba se hari n' uwo iwabo wenda baba bararangiye ariko afite n' ako ga parcelle wenda basenyae ; nkaba mubwira ko igihe cyose yaba afite possibilite ishoboka nawe ashobora kuba wenda yasubizamo ... wenda nawe iye . akasubizamo umuryango ,
any one who has a chance should use it well . ||| mu kihae cyose azaba afite ... possibilite zishoboka kuzikoresha . igihe cye akaba yakikoresha neza .
that is the advice i can give them . ||| njyae nraumva ari cyo kintu nbagiraho inama .
if you admit that you committed a crime then your punishment would be reduced or ... whatever the case , the truth would be revealed . ||| noneho umara kuemera ko ukikoze , ubwo ibyo aribyo byose niba ari n' ibihano uzabigabanyirizwa cyangwa se ukuri kuzabakugaragaye .
maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't . ||| wenda nibyo bavuga ngo @: "@ umuntu yanakubabarira , " wenda nraumva no kubabarirwa wenda sinaku ... hari abatanga imbabazi hari n' abatazitanga .
but they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood . ||| ariko , babanzae baemerae bati @: "@ tukoze icyaha , twaraishe koko tumennye amaraso . @"
after they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier . ||| ubwo nibamara kuemera ko ibyo bintu kabisa ko icyaha bakikoze ibindi bizaoroha .
but since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... i think they should just acknoweldge what they did . ||| ariko mu kihae bataemera ko icyo cyaha bakikoze , kandi hari n' ababi ... n' ibimenyetso wenda bibagaragaza ko babikoze koko . numva ibiiza ko ari uko babiemera ko babikoze . yee .
what message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ? ||| abantu baba bara ... rirokotse iri tsembabwoko bo ubaha ubuhe butumaw ?
the message i would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading . ||| kusa bo nabo ubutumwa nbaha ... ok barimo ingeri myinshi , kuko hari nk' uba yararokotse [ arimyoza ] ariko kubera kuko nabo imyumvire yabo si imwe . kandi noneho kubera ... n' ikindi kinabitera ni ukubera ubuzima baba barimo .
there are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh ! ||| hari nk' uhagarara ku murengae w' iwabo akareba akasanga nta kintu na kimwe kikihari , umh !
but the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully . ||| akabona abo bantu bamwiciye wenda amafamiye [ imryango ] yabo arimo arakidegembya aho .
the only advice i could give such a person is to kind of overlook what happened and go on with life . ||| kusa nmuha inama yo kugira ngo asae nk' umuntu ubiirengagiza gato , abanzae akomezae ubuzima . ashakae ubuzima nmara kubona ubuzima azabona ko n' ibindi [ arimyoza ] byoroshye .
he or she should look for a living . ||| yee ,
he or she will later find out that everything is possible . however , such a person will never forget what happened , that is impossible . ||| kusa ntibiteze kumushiramo , ibyo ntibishoboka .
but he or she should just find a way to ignore it and look for a living because that is how life is . ||| ariko biibura azarebae uburyo abyikarumamo [ yakwiyumanganya ] nawe arebae ubundi buryo yabigenza . kusa ashakae ubuzima kuko niko bigenda .
because even those who were killing us never knew that we would survive . ||| kuko n' abatuicaaga baumvaaga ko tutashobora kurokoka ,
to them , the fact that we survived is unbelievable ; imagine killing about a hundred people from the same family and one survives . ||| baumvaaga ko no kuba turarokotse ni ... bo baumva ari inzozi kuri bo . ntushobora kaumva ukuntu ushobora kuza ukica tuvugae umuryango w' abantu ijana , harokokamo umuntu umwe .
they never knew it was possible but god proved to them that everything is possible . ||| bo baumvaaga ko bitashoboka ariko imaan yo yabaeretse ko buri kintu cyose kishoboka .
umh ... ||| umh .
what do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ? ||| iki kikorwa cyo kuibuka abantu bajya bakora , wowe ukivugaho iki ?
i appreciate that ceremony and i find it very good . ||| icyo kikorwa njyae nrakishima cyane ni na kiza ,
there is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten . ||| kuko nta kuntu ushobora kubona milliyoni hafi zingahe zapfuye . ngo tu turenzeho tusae nk' aho ... tuvugae ngo biribagiraanye ?
that is impossible . ||| oya ntabwo bishoboka .
it is a good ceremony because ... whenever that period comes , people always say , "@ at such a time , disasters occurred in this country due to this or that reason . @" ||| iki kikorwa ni kiza kugirango ... iyo cas icyo kihae buri muntu wese bazajya bavuga bati @: "@ iki gihugu habaye amahano aya n' aya yatewe n' impamvu izi n' izi ,
that act of commemoration for those who died in the genocide ... constitutes an example to other nations ... it gives an example to other countries and they get a chance to judge that what happened to our country was terribly wrong and should never happen again . ||| ariko noneho icyi kikorwa tukora cyo kuibuka abagiye bapfa mu ma jenoside n' ibiki ... kiha n' abandi urugero , kiha n' ibindi bihugu urugero , bakavuga bati @: "@ iki gihugu ibyabaye koko ni ibintu bibi kandi ntibizaongerae .
i find that ceremony very important because it helps people to predict our country 's future and it helps us to avoid its reoccurring . ||| kusa nkabona ko iki kikorwa ari kiza cyane kugirango kikanguraire abantu kumenya aho igihugu cyacu kigana , n' ayo mahano yabaye ko atazaongera kuba .
today you are leading a life that is different from the one you would be living if your parents were still alive . you certainly desire a better life . ||| ngira ngo nkubaze ikindi kibazo , urabiumva ko uri mu buzima utakwaiye kuba urimo iyo uba ukifite ababyeyi , ariko nanone wifuza ko ugira ubuzima bwiza .
whom do you think should play a role in improving your life and for you to get peace at heart ? ||| muri make wunva ari nde ubigiramo uruhare kugira ngo ubuzima bwawe buongerae bubae bwiza ushyirae n' umutima hamwe ?
saying that one has a role to play in it ... f.a.r.g tries its best to help some of us . ||| kusa , ibyo byo kugira ngo umuntu abigiraemo uruhare byo ... nraumva cyane cyane . ok , na f.a.r.g [ ikigega gishinzwe kutera inkunga abacitse ku icumu ry' itsembabwoko bataishoboye ] ikoresha uko ishoboye ibasha kufasha bamwe ,
the fund tries to advice those who are leading a difficult life about how they should behave in such a situation . ||| ababaho ubuzima bugoye ikabasha kubagira inama , uburyo bashobora kubiifashamo . ariko numva cyane cyane ibyo ari byo byose ubuzima ubundi umuntu yakakwaiye kugira , si ukuvuga ngo wifuze ibyo utazabona ,
i believe in life it ’ [ s important to ... not that we should wish for things we will never get or let someone make promises they will never fulfill ... ||| cyangwa ngo umuntu akwizeze ibyo atazakuha .
i believe reconciling all rwandans would be a very big step forward . ||| njyewe uko nbona ubwiyunge bw' abanyarwanda numvaishije bikabaye kuba intabwae ndende cyane .
when you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts . ||| kuko iki kihae tugezemo ntabwo ari igihe cy' imyiryane .
it is time for every rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country . ||| ni igihe cyo kugira ngo buri munyarwanda wese aho ari yumvae ko akunze igihugu cye ,
they should love each other as rwandans . ||| yumvae ko akunze umunyarwanda mugenzi we ,
rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country . ||| baumvae ko bagomba ku kaunga ubumwe bakafatanya bakaubaka igihugu cyabo .
conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation . ||| naho ubundi ibintu by' imyiryane nbona ntacyo bibagezaho , kuko ni ibisubiza igihugu inyuma bikairirwa bitaeza imvururu , imyiryane mu bantu .
there is no interest in conflicts . ||| ukasanga hagati ahongaho njyae nba nreba ukasanga nta imyiryane nta nyungu irimo .
instead , i believe reconciliation based on principles for developing the country would be a big step forward for a better life . ||| ahubwo nkareba nkasanga ubumwe bushingaiye ku bitekerezo bizima mu kaubaka igihugu , numva aribyo bishobora kuba biba intambwe ndende cyane . kugira kigira ngo abanyarwanda babashae kubaho neza , cyangwa se babashae kugira ubuzima bwiza .
i believe they should first understand clearly how important reconciliation is and what an important step it is . ||| numva aricyo kintu bakagobye kubanza kujijukairw cyane cyane bakamenya ko aricyo kintu kifite intabwae ndende cyane .
in your opinion , do you find it possible for rwandans to reconcile ? and if it is impossible why is that ? ||| wowe kubwawe ubona bishoboka ? yuko abanyarwanda baiyunga . niba bitashoboka wowe ubona ni izihe mbogamizi ... ?
in my opinion , reconciliation among rwandans ... well , it is possible but it will be a long process . but in the end it will happen . it is even taking place nowadays . ||| kugira ngo ... ukuntu njyewe nbibona nbona kuiyunga kw' abanyarwanda byo ... ok , bishoboka buretse ko bishobora kutwara igihe kirekire , ariko bizashoboka .
today people do interact yet they belong to different ethnic groups . ||| kuko n' ubu biranatangiye kuko urabona ko ibyo aribyo byose umwe abasha kaumvikana n' undi niyo yaba ari ubwoko runaka n' undi ari ubundi runaka .
they talk with no problem . they visit each other . and when it 's time to share , they share . ||| ariko ukabona ko babasha kuvugana , niba ari ukusangira bakasangira , niba ari ukugenderana bakagenderana .
but it is possible it is on its way ... and personally , i think those who do n't want to move forward and make that step are fools . ||| ariko nbona ko bizashoboka . kuko nbona ko niyo ntabwae yatangiye ... kuko ibyo aribyo byose , numva n' uzasubira inyuma akaba yakuanga wenda iyo ntabwae , nraumva ibyo aribyo byose njyae ku giti cyanjye namwita nk' injiji .
because there is no way one will live alone in this world ; there is no way one can decide to live with only one ethnic group . ||| kubera yuko ntazibana wenyine se , ntabwo azavuga ngo @: "@ nzabana n' ubwoko runaka kusa ,
it is impossible . ||| " ntibishoboka .
if you feel like living with only one group of people , then even governing this country will become a problem . ||| kuko niba wunva ukeneye kugira ngo uzabanae n' abantu runaka kusa , icyo kihae nraumva no kuyobora igihugu bigoraan cyane .
that means that all rwandans would n't be able to live with each other . ||| n' umunyarwanda uwo ari we wese bya ntabwo yabasha kubaan n' undi . ubwo tuba tusubiye nko muri ya periode n' ubundi nk' uko imyiryane yagiye iba ,
it would be like going back to the time of conflicts when people would kill others without any reason or because of what you own or because of your ethnic group . ||| abantu bica abandi babaziza ubusa ,
it was said that due to your ethnic group , you were not allowed to pass in school . to me , that is nonsense . ||| umuntu akuziza ibyawe . ngo @: "@ umuntu uri ubwoko runaka ntabwo ashobora kujya mu ishuli ngo atsindae ! @"
it can not contribute to the development of the country . ||| ibyo nkaumva ko ibyo aribyo byose ari nta kintu bishobora kugeza igihugu inberae habae na gatoya , umh .
some people would always put forward the issue of ethnicity . ||| hari nk' abantu bakishyira ikintu cy' ubwoko inberae . hakaba n' ikindi kibazo kiba kihari ,
i have just understood that your parents were from different ethnics groups . how do you feel about it ? ||| ubu nibwo nkimara kaumva y' uko uvutse ku babyeyi batandukanyaije ubwoko . wowe ku bwawe wunva ubiakiriye utae ?
to me i do n't feel anything ... saying that so and so is from this or that ethnic group ... even the genocidaires killed some people who did not belong to the ethnic group that was hunted . ||| njyewe kuri njyae numva kuri njyae nta ... ibyongibyo byo kuvuga ngo uyu ni bwoko runaka , uyu ni bwoko runaka , kuko n' uwagiye kukora jenoside hari abo yagiye yica kandi batari ubwo bwoko .
they were victimized because they had positive ideas and they did n't believe they should hack the mother of their children just because she is of a different ethnic group . ||| kandi kubera ko bo bashyigikiye noneho ibitekerezo bizima , no kaumva ko atashobora kufata umuntu babyaraanye ngo amutemae nk' uko uriya abikora .
some did it in the name of taking up a challenge . ||| kuko hari n' abagiye babikora ngo babiita ngo ni ukuca agahigo .
they would say , "@ so and so has killed somebody 's family , therefore i also have to kill a certain family . @" ||| ngo njyewe ... ngo ... ngo @: "@ uyu yishe kwa kanaka , noneho nnjyae ngiye kuica uyunguyu . @"
just because somebody killed they also had to kill , which is so stupid . ||| ngo kuberako kanaka yabikoze . ukasanga ibyo ari ubujiji cyane .
you just mentioned survivors who say that , "@ hutu killed my people . @" ||| ibyo ari byo byose uri utubwiye ngo nk' umu rescape ajya yicara akavuga ati @: "@ abahutu baranyiciye ,
do you personally believe it were the hutu who did you wrong or do you believe it were the tutsi ? ||| " kuri wowe wunva ari abahutu bakugiraiye nabi cyangwa ari abatutsi bakugiraiye nabi ?
which of both sides do you blame ? ||| mbese wunva ari bande ukiriza ibintu bikubayeho hagati y' umuhutu n' umututsi ?
i believe it was the hutu who did me wrong because no tutsi would have come to kill me . ||| njyewe umuhutu nbona ariwe ubikoze kubera ko nta ibyo aribyo byose nta mututsi uri kuza kunyica .
first of all , there was no way tutsi would come to kill me since we had no problems with each other . secondly there was no way they would find the courage to kill us yet they were also hunted . ||| icya mbere cyo nraumva nta n' ahantu yari no kuhera kubera ko ntacyo npfaaga nawe . ikindi cya kabili . nawe ntiyari kutinyuka kuza kunyica kandi nawe ahigaw ;
i guess you understand that they had no possibility of killing me . ||| icyo nicyo kintu cya kabili , uraumva rero ntahantu yari kuhera .
but since the hutus had the power and the ability to do anything they wanted , they are the ones who killed . ||| ariko kubera ko uriya ariwe uri ufite power [ ubushobozi ] ari nawe wunvaaga ko afite ubushobozi bwo kukora buri kimwe cyose , niwe uje kubikora .
there is a certain program for gacaca courts , which is meant for punishing the criminals . ||| hari gahunda iriho yo kuhana ibyaha baita "@ inkiko gacaca . @"
what can you say about it ? ||| yo uyivugaho iki ,
in the name of revealing the truth about the genocide and bringing reconciliation among rwandans , what is your view about gacaca courts or how do you understand it ? ||| mu rwego rwo kuza kushaka ukuri kuri jenoside no kaunga abanyarwanda .
what do you think about it ? ||| uyibona utae ? uyumva kutae ? uyivugaho iki ?
the way i consider the issue of gacaca ... well , something i always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to arusha . ||| ubundi njyewe ukuntu nbona ibintu bya jenoside ... bya gacaca . kuko wa mukani ikintu kusa njyae nshimaiyeho leta yakoze kusa yacu , nyishimiraho ku kintu kimwe cyo kuba barafashe bamwe ... abari ... donc abakoze propagande babajyana arusha .
it was important to let the other perpetrators be judgeded from their local courts where the local people have access . ||| noneho abandi biba ngombaw ko bazajya baburanairw mu nzego zaho zo hasi nyine ahari abaturage .
because ... for example if someone killed in gikondo or remera and he is imprisoned in muhima ; there is no way someone from muhima would accuse him without knowing him . ||| kuko ntabwo ibyo aribyo byose niba umuntu yariciye muri gikondo , cyangwa muri remera , akafungairw tuvugae muri ... ku muhaima . ntabwo azajya kushinjwa n' uwo ku muhaima kuko uwo ku muhaima ntamuzi .
therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted . ||| azaza hahanri kavukire ke , aho yari atuye n' ubundi . kugirango babashae kubona ko ibyo biha koko bimukurikirana cyangwa bimuhama .
i believe it was a very good idea . ||| ibyo rero so numva ari byiza cyane ,
because if they had not simplified it in that way , maybe it would be more difficult to judge them . ||| kubera y' uko iyo bataza no kubyoroshya ngo babikorae kuriya numvaaga biri kuzagoraan cyane . kubacira imanza biri kujya bigoraan cyane . ariko kuko bagenda bakabazana mu maselire bavukamo ,
but when they take the prisoners in their respective provinces , communes and cells , it facilitates the judges who examine their cases . ||| amakomine bavukamo amaprefecture . bituma na n' abangaba b' aba avocat bababuranaish nabo bibaorohair ,
and it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts . ||| n' ikigega kikadu ... kikabaorohair , n' abo bantu nabo babasha kujya kubashinja bikabaorohair .
there is no way you can witness someone whose trials are taking place in nyamirambo when you are from gikongoro . ||| kuko ntabwo uzajya kuburana n' umuntu uje gushinjirizwa ku rukiko i nyamirambo uvuka ku gikongoro .
it is hard to get means of transport or accommodation ... i guess the idea was good . ||| icya mbere bizakugora amatike kugira kutae ... aho kurara . eh ! kusa njyae numva biriya ... igitekerezo bafashe biriya aribyo byiza ,
so that the defendant are judged and punished for their crimes . ||| kugira ngo abacirwa imanza bamenyekane ko baciriwe imanza kandi n' ibyo biha babihanairwe .
it is unbelievable that a neighbour could actually have the courage to kill his or her neighbour ... that someone would come to your place and kill your whole family when you used to go to the same school with his children or when your families intermarried , or when they used to pay you a visit when you threw parties at home . ||| kuko ni agahomamunwa cyane kubona umuntu mwaturanye atinyuka akica umuntu w' umuturanyi , nka gutya nkaza iwawe ... akica umuryango wawe wose akawurangiza . abana be mwariganye se , cyangwa se mwarashyingiranywe cyangwa se urakoreshaaga imisi iminsi mikuru akakusura .
i believe gacaca is very good idea . ||| nkaumva ko ibyo aribyo byose ibya gacaca ari ibintu byiza cyane .
what do you think of the program of getting prisoners to say the truth about people 's death and ask for forgiveness ? ||| iriya gahunda yo kuihana no kuirega ibyaha by' abantu bari muri gereza , yo uyivugaho iki ?
what i can begin with is ... the message i 'd like to give is @: when we were young , we used to talk to our grandfathers and they would tell us about the 1959 war , the 1962 war and what took place there . ||| kusa njyewe icyo nheraho n' uko ... ubutumwa ntanga ni nk' uko ntawe kiera nyine ujyaaga uganira na ba sogokuru bakakubwira intambara z' itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , bakakubwira iby' itandatu na kabiri [ 1962 ] uko bigiye bigenda ,
now in our case ... the 1994 war particularly terrible . ||| ariko noneho twebwe cyane cyane ku mwihariko icyenda na kane ho bibaye ni birebire cyane .
people were killed in an extremely horrible way . ||| kuko ukuntu bagiye bica byo biri ibintu bikabije cyane .
i used to hear that in the past they would kill women and children ... i am not sure but it was something like that . ||| kuko numva ko kera ngo bicaaga bakica niba ari abagore n' abana , ntinzi ibintu nk' ibyo .
but this time the whole family with its offsprings would be killed and completely finished ... such things ... ||| ariko noneho bibaye ku miryango yose ku buryo ntacyo basigaaga n' ikikuvukaho n' iki ... ibintu nk' ibyo .
it seems like what happened will never be forgotten . ||| kusa numva ibi bintu byo ntibiteze kwibagirana ,
because even my children will one day ask me , "@ dad where is our grandfather or our grandmother ? @" ||| kuko n' umwana nzabyara , azagerageza ibyo aribyo byose kunbaza ati @: "@ se papa ko ntagira sogokuru ko ntagira nyogokuru bite ? @" umh .
in that case what i would tell them is "@ your grandparents died at this period , when conflicts rose in the country and some people hated others based on their ethnic belonging or on their honesty about their [ political ] opinion . ||| icyo kihae nawe ubuhamya uzamuha uzamubwira uti @: "@ sogokuru yapfuye igihe iki n' iki na nyogokuru wawe kubera ibibazo bibaye by' imyiryane mu gihugu , abantu baanga abandi . babaziza ubwoko ,
others were victimized because of their families ... it went to an extent of families killing each other because of grudges already existing within them . ||| babaziza ko bavugaish ukuri ; abandi na ndetse bakanazira y' uko bafite ni wenda amafamiye [ imiryango ] mu bintu nk' ibyongibyo . kubera y' uko cyane cyane hari n' ibyi ... kuko no mu kuica hari ibintu bigiye bigera n' imiryango bagezeho kubera n' amafamille bikarenga cyane noneho .
i would explain to him how things were , how people hated each other in 1994 . ||| nkamusobanurair uko ibibazo bimeze nkamubwira ukuntu icyenda na kane [ 1994 ] abantu baanganye ,
i would tell him how they killed his relatives simply because of their ethnic belonging or to their honesty about their [ political ] opinion . ||| ukuntu baishe umubyeyi wawe bamuziza ubwoko ubu , cyangwa se bamuziza kuvugaish ukuri kwe .
then i would advise him not to ever follow such ideologies especially when based on people 's ethnic groups and never to give importance to such ideas . ||| kandi noneho nkana mu considera [ yashatse kuvuga gukonseya cg kujya inama ] mubwira y' uko we mu kukura kwe ibyo bintu atagomba kubaigenderaho . ngo yumvae ko hari ibyo azakomeza kutera inberae , cyane cyane nko kugendair ku bwoko ,
that is the first thing i would warn him about . ||| akaba aricyo kintu cya mbere ngomba kumukuramo .
i would explain to him that the reason he does n't have grandparents , is because of the hatred somepeople developed towards others . ||| ahubwo nkamubwira ko mu kihae atabafite ubwo ari icyo kibazo kibiteye ko abantu bari banzae abandi ,
i would tell him how there once were conflicts between two ethnic groups and as a result , people hated one another and killed each other . ||| ko habaye ibibazo hagati y' ubwoko ubu n' ubu . abantu barangaan baricana bigira kutae . ‘ niyo mpamvu ubona utafite sogokuru wawe , ' n' iki .
i would want to try and teach him the truth . ||| ariko nawe biibuze nkagerageza kumwumvisha ko ... aho ukuri kuri .
so that he may never be affected in his life as grown up . i would encourage him never to believe in such ideas . ||| ku buryo nawe bitazamubangamira mu buzima bwe nkura ,
i would tell him that his grandparents were killed either because of the ethnic group they belonged to or because they were supporting a certain ethnic group . ||| ngo yumvae ko icyo kintu azakaigenderaho . wenda ko baishe wenda ba sekuru kubera ubwoko ubu n' ubu cyangwa se kubera bari bashyigikiye abantu aba n' aba .
i would tell him so that he grows up knowing what happened . and the point would be to avoid him wasting his time doing the same thing . ||| kusa nawe akakura azi ko bibaye ariko atari ikintu mbega kituma ... kimutaish umwanya we nawe ngo abe yagira .
in the past while you were still with your parents , you saw the government , the political parties and the development that were in the country then . ||| iyo umaze kureba ... ubona hari ibyo ubayemo , ibyo ukiri kumwe n' ababyeyi bawe ibyo ubayemo , ubuyobozi buri buriho bw' amashyaka uko iterambere ryari rimeze mu gihugu .
what do you think is the future of this country when you consider its past ? ||| ubona kugeza ubungubu wowe urabona avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' i gihugu cyacu ari iyihe , nyuma y' ibyabaye byose ?
our country 's future ... well the first thing i am thankful for is the government of unity ; it is trying to bring back rwandans into transparency . ||| avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' i gihugu cyacu ... kusa ikintu cya mbere wenda nshimira wenda leta y' ubumwe , n' uko bagerageje kugira uruhare rw' ukuntu biibuze abanyarwanda bakaongera bakasubira mu mucyo .
they also try to find a way of punishing those interahamwe who did those things [ killed ] so that it all comes in the open ... in the future there would be no more bad spirit among rwandans . ||| bakabasha wenda no kugira ngo wenda izo nterahamwe nazo zakoze ibyo bintu zibashae kuhanaw . kugira ngo bierekanae ... bitangae urugero , kugira ngo n' ikindi kihae hatazaongera kuba hagira ikindi kintu cy' umwuka mubi kiza mu banyarwanda ,
things like hacking one another or killing one another . ||| usangae batangiye kaongera kutemaan , batangiye kaongera ku kuicana .
therefore , i believe the government played a great role and now the country is developing ; new houses are being built , there is a change in the governance . ||| so , nkaba numva ibyo aribyo byose nabo baragizemo ba yaragizemo intabwae ndende cyane . kuko i gihugu nrabona kitera inberae ,
generally , things are changing for the better . ||| nrabona hari imyubakire se ,
according to me , as years go by , the country will farther develop . ||| n' imiyoborere se , nrabona intambwe ... birimo bigenda biza . nkabona ibyo aribyo byose nizera ko ibyo aribyo byose no mu myaka iza ariko bizagenda igihugu kirushaho kutera inberae .
is there anything you would like to add on the testimony that you are giving us ? ||| kuri ubu buhamya utuhaye nta kinri kintu ushobora kaongeraho ?
it could be a message or anything you would wish to say as a conclusion . ||| yaba ari ubutumwa cyangwa se mbese icyo wifuza kaongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe mu rwego rwo kubusoza .
i think that is all . ||| nraumva ari ibyongibyo .
my name is clemence uwamahoro . ||| nitwa uwamahoro clemence ,
i was born in kibuye in a district , which was called mabaza in sector called rubengera , in kibagiro cell . ||| nkaba nravukaiye ku kibuye ahahoze ari commune mabanza secteur rubaengair , cellure kigabiro .
i am 21 years old . ||| nkaba ... ubungubu nkaba nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe [ 21 ] .
well about the testimony of my life before the war , i was with my parents , my relatives , and my family at large . ||| ku bierekeraanye n' ubuhamya bwanjye ... bw' ubuzima bwanjye mbere y' intambara nri kumwe n' ababyeyi n' abavandimwe na famille [ umuryango ] .
then time came for me to start studying . ||| noneho ngera igihe cyo kutangira ishuri ,
the war started while i was in primary four and from then , we started having hardships in our studies . ||| ubundi intambara yabaye niga mu wa kane primaire [ w' amashuri abanza ] .
we would be asked about our ethics , they would come and say , "@ tutsis stand there and hutus stand here . @" ||| ariko hagati aho ngaho tujyaaga tuiga nabi bakagera igihe bakababaza amako , bakavuga bati @: "@ abatutsi bajyae ahangaha , abahutu bajyae aha . @"
but on my side , i never knew any thing . ||| ariko ku ruhande rwanjye jyewe nta kintu nri nzi ,
i remember sometimes they would ask me and i would tell them that , "@ my family belongs to abanyiginya ... @" [ a clan ] i could n't understand what they meant . ||| kuko hari n' igihe bajyaaga baambaza nkababwira nti @: "@ twebwe iwacu turi abanyiginya , " nkaumva ntinumva ibyo bashaka kunbwira ibyo aribyo .
but my teacher knew my dad , so he would go and ask my father and then he would know it from there . ||| umwarimu utuigishaaga kuko yari aziraanye na papa ,
otherwise , all the time he asked me , i never used to reply him a single word . ||| akahita agenda akamushaka akamubwira ... ubwo akabimenyera igihe cyose kuko igihe cyose . kuko igihe cyose yaraambazaaga jyewe ntingirae na kimwe mubwira ,
because in my home , they never used to brief us about where to stand in case they asked for tutsi or hutus to stand @-@ up . ||| kandi mu rugo i wacu ntabwo bajyaaga banbwira ngo bababwirae ngo @: "@ nibajya bahamagara abangaba , mujyae muhagaruka muri aba , [ mu batutsi cyangwa se mu bahutu ] .
therefore , things continued like that and it never took long , i shifted from the first class to the second class to the third up the fourth . ||| bikomeza kugenda gutyo , ntibitinze nyine nraimuka ngera mu wa kabiri ; mu wa gatatu ;
i remember it was in the first term in april . ||| mu wa kane turi mu kihembawe cya mbere ,
i remember one time when habyarimana had died ; he died on the 6th of april 1994 . ||| ari mu kwa kane . nraibuka igihe kimwe ... ubwo habyarimana yapfaaga .
but on the 7th that is when i knew that he was died yet others knew it earlier . ||| yapfuye ku itariki esheshatu [ 06 ] ariko ku itariki zirindwi [ 07 ] nkanjyae njyae nibwo nbimenye . abandi bo bari babimenye .
we were seated outside the house with several other people who were wondering about the president 's death . ||| tuicaye tuesae ku irembo n' abandi bose baicaye barimo bibaza iby' ukuntu umukuru w' igihugu yapfuye !
and after some time , we saw across in mushubati and other areas , houses burning . ||| ni uko hamaze umwanya tugiye kubona tubona hakurya aho baitaaga za mushubati na hehe hose ... batangiye kugenda batwika amazu .
we were many people seated outside . ||| ni uko muri ako kanya turi tuicaye ku irembo turi abantu benshi ,
and , immediately we saw a very big group of attackers coming from bandamiko they were the bakiga , who lived just across . ||| hamanuka igitero cy' abantu benshi bari baturutse aho baita za bandamiko n' abakaiga bari batuye ruguru ,
they were with a certain man who was called fayineto ; he was our neighbour . ||| bari bari kumwe n' umugabo umwe baitaaga fayineto turi tuturanye .
he was introducing them the areas , which were mainly occopied by tutsis . ||| agenda avuga abaereka mbese ama quartiers [ utucae ] y' ahantu hari hatuye abatutsi . bamanuka batunyuramo hagati bagenda bavuga bati @:
they passed in the midst of our group and said , "@ there is a big number of tutsis living in this area ! it is only the tutsis covering this hill . ||| "@ ahangaha naho hari umuryango munini w' abantu b' abatutsi batuye muri kano kacae , aka gasozi ni akabo ubwo naho nimumara kuzamuka epfo iriya ,
therefore , once you are done with those areas in the valley , you will come and do a good job here . @" ||| ubwo muri buzamukaire hano mugendae mukora ahangaha . @"
then they said , "@ it must be the tutsis who killed our president . ||| ubwo baravuga bati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose abatutsi nibo batuiciye umutae ... umukuru w' igihugu ,
therefore , they must n't live . @" ||| bianze bikunze ntabwo mugomba kubaho . @"
then the former burgomaster of mabana district ; mr. bagirishema ignace came . ||| ubwo uwahoze ari bourgmestre wa commune mabanza , yitwaaga bagirishema ignace .
he was moving in a car speaking loudly using a microphone , he was saying that , "@ all tutsis wherever they are should come up at the district 's offices in oder for them to ensure all the tutsi 's security at once . @" ||| araza ... yagendaaga n' imodoka avugair muri micro [ indangururamajwi ] avuga ngo @: "@ abatutsi bose aho bari nibazamuke bagendae kuri commune , babashae kubarindira hamwe bose . @"
because they had started burning from all sides except our home village . however they would begin from the valley and come up to the hill slowly by slowly . ||| kubera ko bari batangiye kugenda batwika impande n' impande , hasigaye ahongaho i wacu . ariko baheraaga hasi bagenda bazamura .
they had burned all those ends of mushubati , gihara sector , and they were proceeding towards rubengera . ||| ahitwaaga za mushubati bari bamaze kutwika , za secteur za kihara , noneho baza bagana i rubaengair .
therefore , after realising that houses were being burnt , yet someone was anouncing that all tutsis should seek refugee at the district 's offices where they would offer security services to all of them . ||| tubonye bari kutwika rero tuumvise n' imodoka ihise ku muhanda , ari kugenda avuga ngo , ngo @: "@ abatutsi bose ngo nibahungire kuri commune ,
we all went to the district ; my father , my mother and families all of us we left for the district . ||| kugirango babashae kubarindira hamwe bose . @" tuesae turazamuka , na papa na mama n' imiryango , turazamuka .
when we reached there , there were many people , it was on the 7th of april . ||| tugeze kuri commune hari abantu benshi cyane , hari ku itariki zirindwi [ 07 ] . burira buracya , ku itariki umunani [ 8 @/ 04 /1994 ] abantu bakomeza kuza ari benshi ,
morning come , which was on the 8th of april 1994 but people continued coming in big numbers . ||| kugeza n' ubwo babura ahantu bahagarara , kuko ikibuga cyose cya commune kiri kiuzuye . kandi abantu bakiza ari benshi . noneho bourgmestre bagirishema akomeza kuvuga ati @:
then bagirishema the burgomaster went on and said , "@ since several people are still coming , yet the bakiga are coming from up there with a plan of killing you from here . ||| "@ kuko abantu bakiza ari benshi , kandi abakaiga bari kumanuka ruguru iriya , babafitiye umugambi yuko bagomba kubicira ahangaha . ibyaba byiza kurushaho ni uko mwafata ibintu byanyu ,
i guess the best idea is to carry your properties and babies , and help those who can not walk , up to the stadium . ||| n' abana n' abantu batabashije kugenda mukabasindagiza , muesae mukajya muri stade kuko niho hantu hagari , kandi hakolotiriye [ cloturer @hazitiye ] neza ku buryo mwabasha kurindaw neza , nkuko byakogombye kugenda .
since it is a big place and well fenced , it will be easy to protect you as required . @" ||| kuko aho ngaho nta mutekano uhagije uri uhari , kuko ni ahantu harangaye abantu bari kuza ari benshi , abandi bari mu mihanda , abandi baje bazanye n' ibintu byabo ... nuko ... akibitubwira gutyo abantu bari bakimanuka ari benshi .
truly at the district it was not secure because it was an open place with people coming in big numbers , others were on the road ; some would come with all their belongings ... so he said that we had to go to the stadium where we would all be protected . ||| aravuga ati @: "@ muesae mugomba kugenda , mwagera muri stade bakabarindira hamwe , ba ... mbese niho muba mufite umutekano uhagije ,
geneerally it was the safer place where no one would attack us and be able to do any harm to us . ||| kuko hari abasirikare bari bubae batatse [ bagose ] impande zose , baraba ari benshi , nta muntu ushobora kuza kubainjiraan , ngo abashae kugira inabi yabagirair » .
as soon as he had finished saying so ... people were still coming in big numbers and others were leaving . ||| akimara kubivuga atyo abantu bari bakiza ari benshi , ubwo abandi bahita bamanuka .
we were seven children and home ; two girls and five boys . ||| iwacu turi abana barindwi , abakobwa babiri n' abahungu batanu .
i was the fourth born , the first three were boys . ||| njyewe nri uwa kane ,
so one of them said ... he was called epa ... epaphrodite dushimimena . he was a bit old ; he was in senior four [ secondary ] . ||| nkurikiraaga abahungu batatu umwe aravuga ati ... yitwaaga epa ... epaphrodite dushimimana yari mukuru yigaga 4ieme secondaire [ mu wa kane w' amashuri yisumbuye ] aravuga ati @:
he said ... but dad had told us that , we should all go to kibuye because there was no other alternative . @" ||| "@ njyewe ... [ ubwo papa yaratubwiye ati @: @"@ ni ukugenda tuesae tukajya ku kibuye kuko murabona ko nta kunri bigenda . @"
then epa said , "@ i will n't go to kibuye to wait for death like a dog , follow all these people ... i have to go back home and rather die there than taking a journey to kibuye . @" ||| ] aravuga [ epa ] ati @: "@ njyewe ntabwo nshobora kujya ku kibuye , ngo nemerae kupfa nk' imbwa , njyenda njyana n' aba bantu bose ntinzi ... njyewe ngomba kusubira mu rugo wenda bahanyicire ariko ntinshobora kufata urugendo ngo njyende ku kibuye . @"
so , he refused going and went back home . ||| ubwo arabiihorera we asubira mu rugo ,
then my other brother called aimable with pacific whom i followed , they followed him and they were taken to ... there was a certain man who was a family friend . ||| noneho uwitwaga aimable na pacifique njyewe nkurikiraaga , baramukurikiraga . bo babajyana ku ... hari mugabo umwe uri inshuti yacu ,
he was related to the burgomaster and they were living in the same gate . ||| yapfaanaga ikintu na bourgmestre banabana mu gipangu ,
that is where they were taken . ||| aba ariho babajyana .
then my sister and i , we were taken to ... there also another lady , to whom my mum was a godmother . at times we would live together . ||| noneho jyewe na murumuna wanjye batujyana ... hari umukobwa umwe mama yari yarabyaye muri batisimu tubanaaga ,
we were taken to her home and we stayed there . ||| batujyana iwabo tuba yo .
the remaining two who were the youngest , stayed with mum and went to the stadium with her . ||| abandi batoya babiri nabo basigaraan na mama bose bajyana muri stade .
after we left , they also left and when they got there we were informed . ||| ubwo tumaze kugenda baragenda bagerayo turabimenya ko bagezeyo .
the other one went back to the abandoned home ; it was already demolished though they had n't burnt it . ||| undi nawe yasubiye ku matongo ... kunza hari ku matongo kuko bari bamaze kuhasenya ariko batari batwika .
we stayed there and we did n't what had happened . ||| twebwe tuguma ahongaho ntabwo turi tuzi uko bibaye ,
we thought that those who went to kibuye are going to be protected and after some time , we would join up again . ||| turi tuzi bagiye ku kibuye bakabarindirayo barangiza tukazaongera tukabonaan ,
because they had sent us in a home that was well off ; ‘ people who were related to the burgomaster ! ’ we thought we were really safe . ||| kuko bari batuohereje n' ahantu ubona hagaragara . kandi abantu bari baziraanye na bourgmestre ba hafi muri famille tukaumva ko nta kibazo tushobora kugira twebwe .
so , we stayed there on the 8th/04/1994 . ||| tuba ahongaho ku itariki umunani [ 8 /04 /1994 ] , bigeze nimugoraba ,
and , in the evening uncle gasasira brought all the cows , which were at home in that home where we were . ||| nibwo uwari data wacu witwaga kasasair yagize gutya azamura inka zose zo mu rugo turi tufite azizana ahongaho turi turi ,
then he went back . ||| amaze kuzizana ahita asubirayo , ati @:
but before he left , he told us that , "@ several people are still coming in kibuye but they are all worried because there is a rumor that they are going to kill them . ||| « ku kibuye abantu baracyari kuza ari benshi ... ati @:
there is a possibility that we will never see each other again . @" be said bye to us and left . ||| « ariko hari ikihuha abantu bose bafite ubwoba ko bagiye kubica ati hari igihe wenda tushobora kutazaongera kubonaan aba atusezeyeho gutyo aragiye .
we stayed there and suddenly there came a group of attackers saying [ they were singing ] ; we have wiped away all the people who were in the stadium in kibuye . ||| amaze kugenda tuguma aho ngaho haba hamanutse i gitero kiza kivuga ngo @: « ku kibuye ... [ bari kuza baririmba ] ngo abantu bose bari muri stade ngo @: turabatsembatsembye , ngo @:
they are all finished . ||| turabamaze ,
maybe those who remained in their home areas are the ones who have survived and we have to search for them seriously . ||| abasigaye ngo n' utwagiye tusigara muri quartier [ mu tucae batuyemo ] ,
we shall use dogs to hunt them so that no one stays behind . @" ||| ngo abo ngabo nibo tugomba kushakisha uruhindu , tukahiga n' imbwa kugirango ntihagirae umuntu n' umwe usigara .
apparently those who went to kibuye were the old people and they had killed all of them . ||| kuko benshi bari bagiye ku kibuye biragaragara ko ari abantu bakuru , mbese bose bo bamaze kupfa .
they had set roadblocks on every entrance and exit of the stadium . ||| kuburyo no kuri buri muryango wa stade hose hari bariyeri nta ubashije kusohoka ,
no one was able to get out ; whoever would need to pass they would hack him or her . ||| uri kusohoka wese bari kugenda bamutema ... bamutema .
after hearing that ... since i was the eldest to my sister whom we were together , i realized things had worsened . ||| tumaze kubiumva gutyo nkangae ninjye uri mukuru , na murumuna wanjye turi turi kumwe , numva ko ari ibindi binri .
then i wondered , " since they have killed them , where are we left ? @" ||| nti bamaze kubica , noneho twebwe tusigaye hehe ?
then , the owner of the home where we were living . ||| uwo mugabo rero ... uri ... aho ngaho turi turi ,
after hearing that he said , "@ all in all they will come back for you @" his name was munyagishari . ||| amaze kubiumva , aravuga ati @: "@ ibyo ari byo byose namwe ... [ yitwaaga munyagishari ] ... ati @: ibyo aribyo byose namwe barahita bagaruka kubareba .
he continued , "@ among the people who are most wanted in rubengera , there are three men . those three must die ; "@ gahizi is among them . @" ||| ati mu bantu bari kushakisha bagomba kupfa bianze bikunze hano muri rubaengair , harimo abagabo batatu . ati @: kahaizi arimo ,
my father , he was called gahizi evariste . ||| niwe uri papa wanjye yitwaaga kahaizi evariste ;
then he went on mentioning the names ; "@ karungu is one of them and leonard . @" ||| hagomba kupfa karungu ; hagomba kupfamo n' umugabo witwa leonard .
leonard was my father 's colleague ; they were teachers in mushubati . ||| abo ... uwo leonard barakoranaaga bose bari abarimu baigisha i mushubati .
"@ whatever it takes , they must die . they will even come to kill you in my eyes . @" he told us . we could n't understand what he was taking about . ||| ati @: "@ abo bagabo bagomba kupfa ati @: bianze bikunze ubungubu namwe bari buze kubanyiciraho . @"@
therefore , we sat outside with other kids . ||| twebwe tuumva ni ibintu tutaumva tuicara hanze turi kumwe n' abandi bana ku irembo ,
when we had that all those who went to kibuye were killed , we knew that we are the next to be killed . ||| noneho ubwo tumaze kaumva ko ku kibuye ho bamaze kubica , tuumva nyine ko ntakisigaye ntawe tugomba kupfa .
and , whenever we would try to enter in the house , that man would tell us that , "@ remain outside because they will come to check in the house . ||| noneho tujya mu nzu , umugabo akatubwira ati @: "@ mwebwe mwiza hano mu nzu kuko bari buze kuza basaka ,
and in case they found you inside they would kill me not leaving you , and demolish my house . ||| kandi nibaramuka babasanze mu nzu bari bunyicae , namwe babicae , kandi bansenyaire n' inzu .
therefore , keep on playing with other kids outside they will n't know you . @" ||| mubae mukina n' abandi bana ntabwo bari bubamenye . @"
and then certain group of attackers went to karungu 's home . ||| haza kumanuka igitero kigiye kwa karungu ,
karungu had also refused to leave his home so he remained there in ndara where he lived just across a place called gacaca . ||| kuko uwo karungu we yari yanze ... nawe yari yanze kujya aho muri stade yasigaye ahongaho , yabaga ahitwa mu nrara hakurya aho baita mu gacaca gutyo .
and when that group past , there was some lady called seseko , who knew our family . ||| kihanyuze , habonekamo umuntu umwe uri uzi iwacu , ni umukobwa witwaga sesaeko .
then she said , "@ the man who lived here was a good friend to gahizi . ||| araza aratubwira ati @: @"@ ibyo ari byo byose hano hantu uyu mugabo utuye hano n' inshuti yo kwa kahaizi , yamurerairaga abana , ati @:
he used to look after his children and now i guess his children are in his home . @" ||| ibyo ari byo byose hano hari abana be . noneho mu kihae akivuga gutyo , atuhiseho tuicaye ahantu ku muhanda n' abandi bana , aravuga ati @:
as soon as she had said so , they past where we were seated with other kids . ||| "@ uyu mwana arasa na nyina cyane , ati @: uyu mwana arasa na dativa . @" nibwo yazaaga ngo @:
then she said , "@ this kid resembles the mother so much ; she ressembles dativa . @" ||| "@ turebae mu ntoki , ngo @: seka turebae , ngo @:
then she came close to me and said , "@ show me your hands ... smile for me ... @" she said that tutsis have a dark gum , long fingers , their ribs have a special shape ... the she asked me , "@ you must be gahizi 's child , do you disagree ? ||| abatutsi baba bafite mu kanwa hairabura , intoki ndende ... mu mbavu , bafite ukuntu bateye ati @: wowe bianze bikunze ,
i just kept quiet . ||| uri uwo kwa kahaizi . @" ati @: "@ ntabwo ubiemera ? @" amaze kuvuga gutyo ndamwihorera .
"@ look the way she is proud ... anyway , let 's go to work first ... @" it was a very big attack of about thirty people . ||| maze kumwihorera ... ngo @: n' agasuzuguro kenshi cyane ... ngo @: "@ reka tubanzae tugende tujyae kukora ... @" kiri igitero kinini kirimo abantu nk' abantu mirongo itatu ,
i only knew seseko plus a another man who was called byiringiro ; he lived in kigabiro . ||| harimo uwo sesaeko niwe nbashije kumenyamo , n' undi mugabo witwaga byiringiro uri utuye aho ku kigabiro ,
those are the people who seemed to be so active and they were the leaders of the whole group . ||| nibo mbese ubonaaga bakikuraiye bakiyoboye .
then they said that , "@ let 's go , we shall work on you when we come back . @" ||| ngo @: "@ reka tugende ngo @: mwebwe ngo ... turabakoraho tugarutse .
therefore , they continued their journey towards karungu 's home as we stayed there . ||| bamaze kutubwira gutyo baraambuka bajya kureba aho ngaho kwa karungu , ntawe tusigara ahongaho .
therefore , when munyagishari heard that , they would come back and destroy his house just because of gahizi 's children [ us ] , whom is keeping , he told us that , "@ find a way of leaving this place and go somewhere else . ||| nibwo uwo mugabo nyine yamaze kaumva y' uko ... uwo munyagishari amaze kaumva ko bari bugarukae bakamusenyair kubera abo bana bo kwa kahaizi afite , aratubwira ati @: "@ mwebwe mushakae ukuntu mushobora kugenda , mushakishae ahantu mwajya ,
look your father is dead , your mother is dead too , your brothers none is alive ... @" it was around the 10th of apri 1994 . ||| ati @: kuko iso yamaze kupfa ; nyoko yamaze kupfa ; basaza banyu ... nta muntu n' umwe musigaraanye . @"
then we left his home after telling us those words . ||| aho hari nko ku itariki ... hari hamaze kuba ku itariki icumi [ 10 /04 /1994 ] ni uko ... atubwiye gutyo turamanuka .
i told my young sister that , "@ let us just take the road and go because there is no where else we can hide . @" ||| turamanuka nravuga nti @: ibyo aribyo byose ... njyewe nbwira murumuna wanjye nti @: reka tugende ... tufatae umuhanda tugende kuko nta kunri kuihisha .
where could we hide ? ||| turihisha hehe se ? tusigarae se , tuzasigarae hehe ?
"@ dad i dead , mum is dead , no one is alive . ||| mama yapfuye , papa yapfuye nta wunri muntu ,
are we going to stay with this people ? can we live with them ? @" ||| ubu se tuzasigaraan n' abangaba nibo tuzabana ?
in my whole life , it was my first time to feel a lot of pain within me . ||| mu buzima ... niko nvuga yenda mu buzima bwanjye , nibwo bwa mbere nri numvise ikintu cyo kubabara muri jyewe .
i never knew how to cry neither did i know malice . ||| ntinri nzi kurair , ntinri nzi inabi ,
generally , i never knew ‘ suffer ’ i just got confused . ||| ntinri nzi kaumva ngo umuntu yapfuye , ntinri nzi kuhangayika mbese icyo ari cyo . numva ni ibintu binyobeye .
when i saw all that , i said to myself , "@ this is how i will die . after killing this cow , i am the one who is left . @" ||| jyewe nmaze kubireba nravuga nti ukunguku niko nribupfae . ukuntu baishe iyi nka , ibyo aribyo byose nnjyae nraumva aricyo kisigaye .
after taking the cow , they said that , they should n't find us in that home when they come back . ||| bamara kuyitwara , noneho baragenda baravuga bati @: @"@ nitugaruka aba bana ntituhabasangae . @"
they had taken one cow out of the five that were there . ||| bari bamaze kutwara inka imwe , hari hari inka eshanu .
"@ if we find then here , we shall slaughter them in your presence . @" they warned him . ||| bati @: "@ nitugaruka tuka habasanga turababaga ubabona . @"
my sister told me that , "@ look at how we are going to die ! @" ||| noneho murumuna wanjye aravuga ati @: "@ reba ukuntu tugiye kupfa . @"
so we left ... he told us [ the man were we were living ] "@ please help me and leave this place . ||| nibwo tusohokaaga . umugabo aratubwira ati @: "@ munbabarirae muvae ahangaha .
look for somewhere else to go because i do n't wish to ... you have seen how they have killed that cow . ||| [ uwonguwo tubanaaga ] munbabarirae muvae ahangaha murebae ahandi hantu mujya , ntabwo nifuza ... murabona ukuntu baishe iriya nka ,
definitely that is how they will kill you . so please i do n't want you to die from here . ||| ibyo aribyo byose namwe niko muri bugombae kupfa . mugendae mushakae ahandi hantu wenda babicirae ahandi hantu ,
they would rather kill you from where i can not see you than in my presence . @" ||| ariko ntinshaka ko mupfair mu maso yanjye . @"
therefore we left very sure that we were going to kibuye . ||| ubwo turamanutse twiyemeza kugenda ku kibuye ,
we were ready to go to the stadium walking . ||| twiyememeza kugenda muri stade n' amaguru ,
saying that if we met some perpetrator , then he would kill us and end the story like it happened to others ; we had forgotten about their stories , we had that they died and it was over . ||| wenda icyo tuhura na cyo mu nzira kituicae ariko birangirae byibagirane , nk' uko n' abandi turi tumaze kubaibagirwa , tuumva ngo barapfuye birarangiye ,
we were left no where . ||| ntawe ntaho tusigaye .
so we went through some place called gacaca ... in gacaca . ||| tugira gutya tumanuka inyuma ahantu nyine mu gacaca aho ngaho ni muri secteur gacaca ,
there was a short cut to the main road . ||| ahantu hari akantu k' akayira k' ikinyarwanda tugwa mu muhanda . tugeze mu muhanda ,
then we saw a group of attackers who were coming from ... they coming saying that , "@ even those who had remained we have completed them . @" ||| eh ... tubona igitero kiturutse ku ntuza ... barimo kuza bavuga bati @: @"@ n' abari basigaye bose tumaze kusubiramo . @"
one would say , "@ i have killed the family of so and so . ||| umwe akavuga ati @: "@ njyewe nishe abo kwa kanaka . ati @: ngiye ahantu hari hari umuryango wo kwa kanaka ,
i looked for them and killed them because they are the ones i never liked most . ||| nbaheramo nibo njyewe ... nibo niiciye kuko nibo bantu numvaaga batajyaaga banjyamo ,
we never used to talk and heart was never happy with them . @" ||| nibo bantu tutajyaaga tuvugana , nibo bantu igihe cyose numvaaga umutima wanjye utabishimaiye .
then another one said the same story . ||| undi nawe tuumva avuze gutyo , noneho umugabo umwe aravuga ati @:
and then another man said , "@ in gahizi 's family though i never saw many of the members ; i did n't see gahizi . ||| "@ muri famille [ mu muryango ] yo kwa kahaizi , ati @: njyewe ... n' uko nbonye nta bantu benshi nri nzi mo . kahaizi ntawe nbonyemo ,
but the wife died . ||| ati @: ibyo aribyo byose umugore we yapfuye ,
that is the only family i killed . @" ||| ati @: ariko ... ati @:
he was imitating how he hit them using a club , saying how he was cutting them with knives . ||| njyewe niho honyine nishe . @" avuga ukuntu yagiye abakubita ubuhairi , avuga ukuntu yagendaaga abakubita icyuma ,
"@ but i did n't see all their kids . @" ||| ati @: "@ ariko na bwa bwana bwose ntabwo nbonye . @"
he added . ||| eh !
when i had him saying that , i told my sister that , "@ i do n't know your idea but i suggest we sit here so that they find us and kill us from here . ||| numvise avuze gutyo mpita nbwira murumuna wanjye nti @: "@ yenda wowe simbizi , nti @: ariko tuicarae ahangaha baze batuicirae ahangaha ,
hope you can here that they are very many and there is nothing left . ||| ni benshi ... kuko urabiumva ko nta kisigaye ,
we are not even left anywhere . @" ||| nta n' aho tusigaye .
across the road there was a sorghum plantation , we were still in the shortcut almost getting to the main road . ||| ubwo nka gutya inberae y' umuhanda hari hari ahantu hari amasaka , turi muri ako kayira nyine tugiye kugwa mu muhanda , tukimara kubiumva . eh !
as soon as i heard them saying those words , heart charged ... i can not explain how i felt . ||| mu mutaima wanjye numva bibaye ukundi kuntu , ntinzi ukuntu nbiumvise mbese .
it was beyond my understanding . ||| numva biranrenze nravuga nti @:
then i said , "@ i am going to sit here . let them kill me from here , i will n't walk anymore . ||| "@ njyewe nraicara ahangaha bahanyicire ntabwo nshobora kugenda bibaho . @"@
they should find me here and kill me . @" it was around 1:00 ... "@ i can not continue walking , how can one land in a group of such people ? @" ||| baze bansangae hano banyicae [ hari nko mu ma saa saba ] . ariko ntabwo nshobora kukomeza inzira , witure mu bantu nka bariya ? noneho nti @:
i would imagine them killing us like they killed the other cow ; cutting a finger , a leg ... i said , "@ i will not move further . @" ||| bari butuicae nk' uko baishe ya nka bagenda bagenda bakata urutoki , bakata ikirenge . nravuga nti @: jyewe simva aha .
then i sat down . ||| mpita nicara .
i sat in the sorghum plantation next to the road . ||| nicara aho ngaho mu masaka hafi y' inzira ,
then i laid down , "@ if they find me lying then may mistake me to be a corpse . @" i imagined . ||| nraryama nravuga nti @: wenda nibashaka bagirae ngo ni umurambo barekae kunyica .
i decided that it was better to lie on road maybe one would hit me accidentally and then i would rest . ||| ariko byiza byo reka nryamae mu nzira nti @: wenda ntihari bauburae n' uwijijisha akubitaeho ikintu ariko ... eh !
because i would imagine living alone in this world and i would find it very hard to understand . ||| birangirae mbese . nraumva kubaho kuri iyi si jyewe jyenyine ... numvaaga ari ibintu binrenze .
i got confused with a lot of sorrows . ||| numva biranyobeye agahinda karanyica murumuna wanjye aranbwira ati @:
then my sister told me that , "@ let me tell you ... @" she was called dudu as nickname but her true name is uwumukiza grace . ||| "@ rero reka nkubwirae ... @" [ yitwa dudu ... ubundi yitwa uwumukiza grace ] ... aranbwira ati @:
she said , "@ listen , clemence . ||| rero clemence reka nkubwirae ,
if you decided to stay here , i will not stay here with you . @" ||| niba wiyemeje kusigara hano , jyewe ntabwo ndi busigarae ahangaha . @"
she is so brave . ||| ni umuntu w' intwari cyane . ati @:
she told me that , "@ i have accepted dead , i will meet them and proceed to the stadium . perhaps i would meet there at least one person from home then we would continue together . ||| "@ njyewe nzaemera npfae , ngiye kugenda mpure nabo nikomereze , nkomezae muri stade wenda ntinbura umuntu n' umwe nzi wo mu rugo , wenda tujyae tugendana .
but you with your cowardliness ... i can not stay with you because i can not die seated just watching . ||| ariko wowe ubwoba bwawe ... ntabwo nsigaraan nawe ... ntabwo nshobora kuemera kupfa nreba .
so , i sat and imagined , "@ well , i am incapable of landing in a group of those people . @" ||| ubwo nraicara , nravuga nti @:@ basi njyewe ntabwo nshobora kuitura muri bariya bantu .
i was tall and slim . ||| nri nnutse cyane ndi muremure ariko nnutse ... nnutse .
my sister was fat and short . ||| noneho we akaba yari abyibushye kandi ari mugufi .
and , wherever i would pass they would shout at me saying , "@ look at that snake ... @" all kids we would met they would say the same thing . ||| njyewe aho nnyuraaga hose bavuga bati @: "@ dore ya nzoka . @" abo tuhuye nabo ... abana tuhuye , bati @:
but my sister they would n't recognize her . ||| "@ dore ya nzoka . @" ariko undi we ntibamumenye .
therefore i asked her , "@ did you hear what those kids said ? ||| nravuga nti @: uraumva bariya bana tuhuye ukuntu banbwiye , bavuga ngo @:
they said that , [ look at that snake , where is it heading at this time ? ||| "@ dore inzoka , ngo @:@ ubungubu iracyajya hehe ? @"
and now you are telling me that we go and meet those people , how do you think they are going to kill us ? ||| none wowe ngo ; "@ tugende tuiturae muri bariya bantu ? @" bari bunyicae kutae ?
and in case they killed me first , how will you handle it ? definitely you will dye of sorrows . ||| nibabanza kunyica ? urabibona utae wowe ? ko uri buicwae n' agahinda .
i will stay here . @" ||| nti njyewe nsigaye hano .
it was in the sorghum plantation . ||| ubwo mpita ... hari mu .. mu masaka ,
then i decided to lay in the way so that they come and step on me or hit me at once rather than being killed with torture . ||| nravuga nti reka nzae nryamae no mu nzira wenda bari buze bankandagirae . umwe akubitae undi akubitaeho birangirae , aho kugirango banyicae nabi . mpita nururuka ku gakingo kari kari aho ,
therefore , i came down the hill and laid in the way . ||| nicara neza mu nzira nraryama .
then she said , "@ bye ... i can not dye just seated here . @" ||| we ahita anbwira ati @: @"@ bayi njyewe ntinshobora kupfa nicaye ahangaha . @"
immediately she left . ||| ubwo ahita agenda .
that was the last time i saw her , [ it was around the 12th april in 1994 ... until towards the end of september , that is when i saw her again ] she just left me and said that she could not sit and wait for her death . ||| tuherukaan ubwo ngubwo hari mu matariki nka cumi n' abiri [ 12 /04 /1994 ] gutyo tuherukaanye ubwo ngubwo , tuongeye kubonaan mu kwezi kwa cyenda kushira . ahita agenda ubwo ngubwo ati @: "@ njyewe ntinshobora kupfa nicaye . @"
i laid in the road . ||| nryama ahongaho ,
i guess there is a way that one dies due to fear , to the extent of not feeling anything though being hurt to death . ||| ntinzi hari nk' ukuntu ahari umuntu ajya apfa kubera ubwoba , ku buryo umuntu ashobora kuza akaba yanakuica ntugirae icyo wunva ,
because you are already dead . ||| kubera ko umaze kupfa .
therefore , i laid down and i was taken by sleep . by the time i woke @-@ up it was about 6:00 p.m. in the dark . ||| ubwo nraicara nraryama nrasinziraiye nicura ari nka saa kumi n' ebyiri hatabona . umh !
i looked around and found out that i was in the sorghum plantation on the road . ||| nrebye nbona ndi ahantu mu masaka ku muhanda ,
"@ how is it possible ! @" ||| nravuga nti @: ese bishoboka kutae ?
i wondered . i looked around but i could n't see doudou . ||| nrebye doudou nramubura ,
"@ this is my death . @" ||| nravuga nti uru nirwo rupfu rwanjye .
i looked at the place where i was and compared it with the life i led before ... i sat there till around 6:30 p.m. it was in dark . ||| nreba ahantu ndi ntekereza ubuzima nri nrimo nrahaicaye mpava nka saa kumi n' ebyiri n' igice hatabona .
i started imagining my childhood life , my school life , and how far i had reached . ||| ntatangira ntatekereza ubuzima nbayemo kuva nkiri umwana muto , maze kutangira kuiga ,
eh ! ||| aho nri ngeze ... eh !
my father , my mother , my brothers and my young sisters , all i have lost them . ||| papa ... mama ... basaza banjye ... barumuna banjye ... bose nrabareba .
i imagined all that and got confused . ||| nrabireba numva biranyobeye .
i started searching my family members but all of them were killed . ||| ntangira kureba muri famille [ mu muryango ] hirya hose nbona abantu bose bapfuye ,
i was left alone . ||| nbona nsigaye jyenyine ,
so i could n't understand it . ||| biranyobera .
then i woke up and asked myself , "@ what can i do ? @" ||| nibwo nhagurukaaga nravuga nti @: "@ ese nkorae iki ? @"
i thought about going to the stadium but it was impossible , then i thought bout going back to the other family where they had chased me but still it seemed impossible . ||| ntekereza kufata umuhanda ngo ngendae muri stade , nbona ntabwo biri bushobokae . ntekereza uko nribusubirae hahanri banyirukanye , naho nbona ntibiri bushobokae .
then i said , "@ i wish dogs would come and eat me , because i would die and there would be nothing much left to worry about . @" i failed to find a decision . ||| nravuga nti @: ahari niba hari haje imbwa nonaha ahari zika nyica , ariko nkaumva ko nvuyeho nbitekerezaho ... bigeze aho ... nshaka igisubizo ntakibura .
later i decided to follow some small route that was in the sorghum plantation . ||| mpitamo kukomeza akayira karimo aho hagati mu masaka ,
i was hoping that i would attackers , who would be looking for survivors to kill them so , they would kill me . ||| nvuga nti wenda nhura n' igitero kirimo kugenda kishakisha bakahita banyica .
i decided to keep walking aimlessly , wherever night would find me , i would sleep there . ||| decision [ icyemezo ] nfashe ni iyo , yo kugenda ngendaa ... ngendae , aho buzair ngeze azabae ari ahongaho .
i did n't want to hide myself anymore . ||| numva ntinshaka kaongera kuihisha .
then i stood up and started moving . ||| noneho nkihaguruka ahongaho ,
i walk a distance of about a kilometer ; i would walk though ways where i would meet people hunting others . ||| ngenze nko muri kilometero ngenda gutya mu masaka , ngendaaga ahantu kugirango ahari mpure n' abantu bari kushaka abandi bantu .
because i wanted to die . ||| bahitae banyicira ahongaho ,
i did n't want to people to ever see me in exile . ||| birangirae ntihazagirae n' uzanbona no hanze .
while i was still moving , i met a certain man called alexis . ||| nkijyenda mpita mpura n' umugabo umwe witwaga alexis ,
he was teaching me in place of my mother because ; my mum had injured her leg . therefore , he replaced my mum . ||| uwo yajyaaga anyigisha ariko asimbura mama . mama yari amaze iminsi yaravunitse ukuguru , noneho uwo mugabo akaba yaramusimburaaga . eh !
so when we met i told him that , "@ please help me and kill me . @" ||| tukubitanye nramubwira nti @: "@ nbabarira unyicae . nti nbabarira unyicae ,
i pleaded . ||| monsieur , nbabarira unyicae .
then he said that , "@ how can i kill you ? ||| aranbwira ati @: @"@ wowe nkuica ntae ?
i killed too many people and i will kill more but i can not kill dative 's child . @" ||| ntabwo ... mubo ... nishe benshi , ntakica benshi , ariko ntinshobora kuica umwana wa dativa ntibibaho . @" umh !
but i insisted , "@ please kill me . ||| nramubwira nbabarira unyicae .
my mum and dad are dead ; all my three brothers are dead , and my young sister desperately went to attackers now they killed her . ||| mama yapfuye , papa yapfuye , musaza wanjye batatu bamaze kupfa murumuna nawe aragiye igitero nonaha kiramwishe ,
i am the only one left and i am left nowhere . ||| none ngewe nsigaye hehe ?
so please , if you like me , do me a favor and kill me . @" ||| nbabarira unyicae ... niba unkunda nbabarira unyicae .
we had met from somewhere in the sorghum plantation . ||| tukubitanair gutya mu masaka ,
and he was holding a glittering knife , which was dropping blood . it seemed like he was coming from killing someone . ||| yari afite inkota irabagirana , irimo ijejeta amaraso ibyo aribyo byose yari amaze nko kuica umuntu .
but i kept on asking him to kill me in fact we fought for the knife . ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ nbabarira ... @" turayirwanair ,
i begged him ; "@ i am left no where , please kill me . ||| nti @: "@ nbabarira unyicae ntaho ndi ,
this is the worst death . the best you can do for me is to kill me . @" then he said , "@ sincerely bebe ! ||| uku niko kupfa nabi ... ungairiye neza ... @" ati @: "@ rwose bebe ... [ bajyaaga banyita bebe ] ... ati @:
i like you and i used to like your parents . ||| ndagukunda , mama wawe nmukundaaga , papa wawe nramukunda .
but i can not kill you though i killed so many people , and i am still killing others . ||| ariko wowe ... nishe benshi n' ubu ntakica benshi ,
the people i have killed are uncountable and i will kill other more . ||| maze kuica benshi ntibabaarika . kandi ntakica benshi .
but i can not kill you because i can be accused of your blood . ||| ariko wowe ntabwo nshobora kukuica . kuko amaraso yawe nzayabazaw .
i knelt down and begged him again ; "@ you would be of much help to me if you killed me . please i am begging you . ||| nramubwira nti @: ungairiye neza ... ntapfukama . nbabarira ntakuinginze . unbariye uka nyica ahari ko ... simbizi ,
there is nothing i can offer but god would reward you for that . @" ||| imaan yonyine yazakuihembair .
he looked at me and said , "@ no ! ||| nuko aranreba ... amaze kunreba aranbwira ati @: "@ oya , ati @:
i would never commit such a sin . @" ||| icyaha nk' icyo ntabwo nshobora kukikora . @"
"@ but you already committed it , because you killed others . ||| nti @: urangije kubikora kuko n' abandi ubaishe .
but now i am begging you to do it for me . @" ||| nnjyae nbabarira ntakuinginze .
i said to him . ||| aranbwira ati @:
then he said that instead of killing you , "@ let me show you . @" ||| "@ aho kugirango nkuicae reka nkuerekae . @"
but i told him that , "@ wherever you may take me , it would be the worst death for me . ||| nti @: aho unjyana hose nirwo rupfu rurenze .
the best you can do for me is to do something that would end my story . because surviving alone in this world ... look i will never stay there where you are going to take me . @" ||| kuko ungairiye neza nakwibagirana kuko kusigara njyenyine ... kandi aho hantu ushyira ntabwo ariho nzahora .
he took me to his home . ||| aramanura anjyana iwabo . anjyanye iwabo ... eh ,
they were living in gacaca and when his mother saw me , she shouted and said , "@ look at the other snake ! ||| nabo batuye aho ngaho mu gacaca , mama we anbonye , ahita atera hejuru ngo @: @"@ dore ya nzoka .
where are you taking such people ? ||| ngo @: eh ... eeh ... ! ngo @: abantu bameze gutyo urabajyana hehe ?
just do me a favor and take her out of here ; i do n't want her here ... i do n't want her ... not at all . @" ||| ngo nbabarira ngo @: simbashaka . simbashaka ... simbashaka , nsohorair ahangaha . @"
their home was situated just above the road and then , a group of attackers was coming from the other side [ below ] of the road . ||| kuko bari batuye hejuru y' umuhanda gutya , hepfo haba haturutse igitero .
then she said , "@ let me call them . they will kill her and she will be a gone story . i can not let my house accommodate such a snake . @" ||| ngo @: "@ reka nzae nbahamagarae baze bamwice avaeho rwose anibagirane . ati @: kuko ntinifuza yuko mu nzu yanjye hashobora kubamo inzoka nk' iyingiyi . @"
then he held his knife on his mother and asked her , "@ mother , you know that you produced me , is n't it ? ||| umuhungu ahita afata inkota yari afite afata nyina mu ntuze ... aramubwira ati @: "@ mama , wowe uranyibyaraiye , ntabwo ubiemera ?
i am your first born . ||| ndi umwana wawe w' impfura .
but as i killed so many people , i will kill several others . ||| ariko uko maze kuica abantu benshi , ninako nzaica benshi ,
and you can be among them . ||| kandi nawe ntabwo ushobora kuburamo .
watch this kid as you watch yourself . ||| uyu mwana umurebae wirebe .
the day i will hear that she died , that is when you will follow her . @" ||| umunsi nraramuka numvise ngo yapfuye umenye ko ujyana nawe . @"
the old lady said , "@ you rather kill me but i can not live in the same house with a snake . ||| umukecuru ati @: "@ wenda unyicae , ariko ntabwo nshobora kubangikana n' inzoka mu nzu . ntabwo bibaho ,
impossible ... how can a person live with a snake ? @" ||| umuntu ntabwo yabana n' inzoka ! @"
the old lady rolled herself down . ||| eh ! umukecuru arasara . arisararanga hasi .
the son warned her , "@ i will kill you ! ||| umuhungu ati @: "@ ntakuica . ati @:
i will kill you myself . @" ||| wowe , ati ntakuica . @"
"@ you rather kill me but it is impossible . @" immediately she rushed to the door and shouted for help , "@ help me ... help me . ||| ati [ umukecuru ] : "@ nushaka unyicae ntabwo bishoboka . @"
i am attacked by snakes . @" ||| aba aragiye ku muryango akoma akaruru . ati @: "@ nimuntabare ... ... nimuntabare hano inzoka zanteye . @"
as the neighbors were still preparing to intervene , the son grabbed her and held her mouth and then pushed her under the bed . ||| noneho mu kihae bakijararanganya kuko ni ahantu hari amazu menshi , bakijararanganya , umuhungu nibwo yahitaaga amufata amupfuka umunwa , amusunikair munsi y' igitanda ,
"@ can you hear me ? ||| ngo @:
i said i will kill you . @" ||| "@ nravuze ngo @: ntakuica . ngo nrabikubwiye ngo @: ntakuica . @"
he told the mother but she refused , "@ maybe you kill me but it is impossible . ||| umh ! umukecuru ati @: "@ wenda unyicae , ariko ntabwo bishoboka .
do you want the interahanwe to come and demolish my house and kill her and then kill me later ? ||| wowe uragirango baze kuza bansenyaire , nibamara kunsenyair bamwice , nibarangiza nnjyae banyicae ?
will it help you to remain alone in this world ? @" ||| ubwo se kusigara wenyine bizakumarair iki ? @"
then the son told her that , "@ those are totally different stories . ||| umuhungu aramubwira ibyo ntaho bihuraiye ,
you are talking about me staying alone ? besides giving bath to me , there is no other relationship that is between you and me . ||| kusigara njyenyine ubundi uheruka unbyara nta hanri mpuriye nawe .
i am just warning you about that kid , and if you make any other noise ... @" he went on , "@ anyway , i will cut off your arm , then your leg ... you will die in slowly when you can not even call them anymore . @" ||| icyo nkubwiye uyu mwana aramuka apfuye ... kandi uraongera kuvuga . usibye ko ndibuguce ukuboko nkakuca ukuguru ukapfa utapfuye , utari buongerae kubasha kusohoka ngo uragiye .
immediately he removed his knife from it 's pocket and held her like this ... he was going to cut her leg then she screamed , "@ please forgive me ! @" ||| nibwo yabanguraaga inkota , amufata atya , agiye kumutema ku kaguru ubwo umukecuru ati @: @"@ nbarira . @"
the attackers were still looking for that person [ me ] , but they did n't find anyone . therefore , they proceeded . ||| ubwo ibitero bararanganyaije babura umuntu , batangira kushakisha mu masaka babura umuntu barikomereza .
in was the same night and they never used to search a lot at night . ||| ubwo biri muri iryo joro burira ... ... ubundi nijoro ntabwo bajyaaga bakunda gusaka cyane .
therefore , in the morning , alexis had of course left for work . ||| bigeze mu gitondo umuhungu ubwo yari yagiye ... uwo alexis yari yagiye mu kazi nyine .
when he came back he told his sister who was called therese ; she never used to go out of the house because she looked like the tutsi . ||| aho agarukaiye nibwo yabwiraaga mushiki we ... yari afite mushiki witwa therese nawe yabaga mu nzu kubera ko ngo yasaga n' abatutsi ,
she was tall and slim and wherever she would pass they would attempt killing her . ||| yari muremure ananutse , noneho aho anyuze hose mu nzira bakashaka kumwica ,
they would let her go after mentioning her brother because he was known as a colleague whom they worked together . so she would come home after they released her . ||| mbese bakamureka ari uko amaze kuvuga musaza we , kubera ko bari baziraanye bakoranaaga , akahita aza bakamwihorera .
then the brother told her , "@ therese , you have to stay with this kid . she should never fail to get water for bathing or food to eat . ||| noneho aramubwira ati @: @"@ therese rero uyu mwana ugomba kubaan nawe nta zigerae abura amazi yo kukaraba , ntazigerae abura ibyo kurya ,
you should be together wherever you may be . @" ||| mugomba kubaan ku buryo aho uri ,
her sister agreed . ||| akaba ari ho mbese nawe agomba kuba .. @" mushiki we arabiemera ,
she took me to the bedroom , washed me , and gave me food to eat . then i slept . ||| aragenda ashyira mu cyumba arankarabya arangaburira nraryama .
at around 11:00 o'clock , the other old woman came [ the one whom we first lived together ] she coming looking for us from every where because she was told that , "@ gahizi 's children died from some place . @" ||| bigeze nko mu ma saa tanu haza kuza ... bigeze nko mu ma saa tanu haje kuza umukecuru w' aho ngaho tubaga , agenda ari kushakisha ahantu hose kuko yari amaze kaumva yuko hari ahantu abo bana bo kwa kahaizi bapfairiye .
she heard it from the people who passed us from where we were seated . they imagined we later died . ||| kubera abantu batunyuraagaho tuicaye aho ngaho bahise baumva ko tupfuye birangiye .
therefore , those people went straight to that old lady [ the mother to munyagishali ] and told her that , "@ the other kids who were here , must have died . ||| noneho bahita bazamuka babwira uriya mukecuru ... umukecuru wa munyagishali , baramubwira bati @: @"@ ba bana bari bari ahangaha ibyo ari byo byose bapfuye ,
because we saw them while we were passing by and in a few minutes we saw one lying down and the other one disappeared . ||| kubera ko tugiye tunyura ahantu tubabona , tuza kubona umwe arambaraye mu ntuze ... undi turamubura ,
maybe she died somewhere else . @" ||| ariko kuko bari bajyanye ibyo aribyo byose n' undi afite ahantu yaguye .
then the man told me that , "@ young girl , get out of my house . ||| umugabo niko kunbwira ati @: @"@ rero mwana nbabarira unsohokaire ahangaha . @"
when he told me like that ... it was about the 20th ... then i said , "@ fine . @" ||| eh ! amaze kunbwira gutyo biri bimaze kugera nko mu matariki nka makumyabiri [ 20 ] gutyo ... nravuga nti @: " basi . @"
the 20th of april ... ? ||| makumyabiri z' ukwa kane ?
a certain man held me by the hand and said , " come here , you must die like others . @" ||| umugabo umwe anfata ukuboko aransohora ati @: "@ ngwino ugomba kupfa ... ugomba kupfaan n' abandi . @"
there was a way they used to shout when they saw a person . ||| noneho hari ukuntu iyo babona umuntu bahitaaga bavuza induru .
and then all of a sudden i had people shouting . ||| noneho ngiye kaumva numva bakomye akaruru . bakomye akaruru ,
when i reached at the road , i realized that it was n't me instead , it was another man who was called rukemasibe . he was a teacher and they had revealed him . ||| ngeze ku muhanda nsanga si njyewe bakakomeye ahubwo hari undi mugabo witwaga rukemasibe uri umwarimu ,
"@ we have found rukemasire . @" they said . ||| nawe bamuvumbuye . bati @: " rukemasire turamubonye . @"
the kids they were together , some were hacked but they were still dying ; they had n't died completely and they were taken on a wheelbarrow to a certain pit hole to be dumped . ||| abana bari kumwe hari harimo abantu bari baishe ... batemye ariko banzae kupfa , babatwara ku ngorofani . bagiye kubaroha ahantu mu cyobo .
there was a certain pit hole in gacaca just behind the commune 's offices . ||| hari icyobo kiri kiri hariya nyine aho mu gacaca inyuma ya commune ,
and , all the people who would be hacked but not dead , they would carry them on a wheelbarrow and dump them in that pit . ||| ku buryo abantu babaga batemye bakabona ntibapfuye babatwaraaga ku ngorofani bakagenda bakabarohamo .
but there was a trench of water and it was during a rainy season . ||| noneho hari hari umuferege uyoboramo amazi , hari mu kihae cy' imvura ,
therefore , water would run through that trench to the pit hole . ||| noneho imvura yagwa amazi agashokera hahanri .
then i told that man , "@ please kill me , but kill me at once because i do n't want to be like those . ||| nbwira uwo mugabo nti @: "@ nbabarira unyicae , ariko umpwanye npfae burundu simere nka bariya . niba wiyemeje kunyica ,
look at how they are ! ||| nyica . unkubitae ubuhairi ariko simere nka bariya . urabona ukuntu bariya bantu bameze ,
they are going to be dumped in the hole while they are still alive ... @" some never had legs , others were seeing ... machetes , others were bleeding . ||| bagiye kubaroha mu cyobo kandi baraumva ... @" ubwo nta kuguru kuriho , abandi barareba ,
they would be carried on a wheelbarrow because all their joints were not functioning and they would be dumped in the pit hole . ||| imihoro ... kandi baravirirana amaraso ... kubatwara ku ngorofani , nta rugingo na rumwe rukora , bakagenda bakabaroha mu cyobo .
then he asked me , "@ have many brothers did you have ? @" ||| umugabo aranbwira ngo @: "@ harya uri ufite basaza bawe bangahe ? @"
i replied him that , "@ i had five brothers but they are all dead . @" ||| nramubwira nti nri nfite basaza banjye batanu bose bapfuye . nuko , ngo @:
"@ what if i save you ? @" ||| "@ nonese ngo ubungubu uwagukiza ? @"
he asked me . ||| nramubwira nti @:
then i told him that , "@ that is not the solution . ||| "@ icyo ntabwo aricyo gisubizo , wowe nyica nraumva aricyo gisubizo ,
i believe that , the answer to the problems i have now is death . therefore , just kill me . ||| njyewe ... cy' ibibazo nfite ubungubu .
my younger sister was killed too , i am the only one still existing . @" ||| murumuna wanjye nawe baramwishe nsigaye njyenyine . @"
he was a mukiga man ; he did n't even know my home village yet all the people who lived in our home village knew us very well . ||| iso ... yari umugabo w' umukaiga pe ! nta n' ubwo yari azi n' aho ngaho iwacu , kuko abo iwacu bo bari batuzi neza , neza ... neza cyane .
"@ what was the name of your father ? @" ||| ati @: "@ nonese iso yitwaaga nde ? @"
he asked me . ||| anbwira mu bantu , aravuga ngo @:
he mentioned names of people and mentioned gahizi and karungu . ||| "@ kahaizi , ... anbwira karungu ... ngo @:
he said , "@ there is one called gahizi , and another one called karungu and another one called leonard ... they were teachers . ||| hari uwitwa kahaizi ; hari uwitwa karungu ; uwitwa leonard , abantu bari abarimu ... ati @:
is he among those ? @" i said , "@ yes , it was gahizi and he died but i am begging you to kill me please . @" ||| muri abangabo ... @" nramubwira nti @: "@ ni uwitwa kahaizi yapfuye nnjyae nyica nrabikusabye . @"
then he asked me , "@ there must be a reason why you survived while the rest of your family members died . how do you expect me to kill you ? ||| ubwo nibwo yahitaaga anbwira ati @: "@ ibyo ari byo byose kuki wowe usigaye abandi b' iwanyu bose bapfuye none wowe usigaye njyewe nkuicae ?
me too i will n't kill you , go and die in the hands of someone else . @" ||| nnjyae ntinshobora kukuica , genda uzagwae ku banri . @"
he threw me like that . ||| aranjugunya .
then the other killers came . ||| anjugunye gutyo , babanri nabo nibwo bahitaaga baza ,
then one of them asked , "@ what about this one ? ||| baranbwira . ngo @:
why are you tossing her from one person to another ? @" ||| "@ uyunguyu we se bigenze bite ? ngo @: bigenze bite ko nbona murimo kumuhererekanya ? @" noneho amaze kuvuga ngo @:
after asking why they were not doing something with me , one of them explained to him , "@ this kid her whole family is dead and no one can tell about her past . ||| "@ bigenze bite ko nbona muesae murimo mumuhererekanya ... ko nbona nta cyo muriho mukora ? @" umwe ahita umubwira ati @: "@ uyu mwana ati @: iwabo bose bapfuye ntawamenya ibye .
all her family died ; both her parents died , all her family members were killed from the stadium , and her brothers were all killed . ||| iwabo bose bapfuye , ise yapfuye ... nyina , imiryango yabo yo yaguye muri stade , basaza be bose bamaze kubica niwe wenyine usigaye .
she is the only one who has remained . can one kill such a person ? there must be a reason why she does n't die , who knows ? ||| uyunguyu se wowe uramwica ... hari impamvu yasigaye uyu ntawamenya ibye .
better leave her . @" then that man said , "@ to hell ! ||| nimumwihorere . undi nawe ati @: "@ reka da !
if you have failed to kill her , me too i will n't kill her . @" ||| uwabananiye nnjyae ntabwo arijyae wamwica . @"
they left me there . and then i went back to the other home . those perpetrators were all from the tribe called bakiga and they wondered why i was going to that home . ||| baranyihoreye nraongeye nsubiye muri rwa rugo .
"@ maybe those cows in that home belong to her family ! @" ||| bati @: "@ ariko hariya hantu ari kujya muri ruriya rugo ... [ bari abakaiga kusa ] ... hariya hantu ari kujya muri ruriya rugo harimo inka ,
they were guessing . ||| umenya ari iz' iwabo .
and then added , "@ let us go and ask that man to give us a cow in order to leave him with the kid . @" ||| reka tubwirae uriya mugabo aduhereze inka , noneho tumurekerae umwana we . @"
they came and took another cow but it was still the same way ; one would hack and the other one would take another part till when the cow is finished . ||| baragurutse baraongeye barayitwaye , abahaye inka ni kwa kunri nyine ni ukutema umwe atwara , undi atwara .
sometimes they would leave part of the cow on the ground and go . ||| barangiza bakaba basiga yenda nk' igihimba kimwe kisigaye ahongaho barangiza bakaigendera .
then i asked the old man in that home , " since the cows are over , what will you give out next time they come ? ||| noneho nbwira muzehe nti @: "@ ariko se muzae ... ? nti @: ubu noneho ko inka zishize ,
it should be me . @" then he said , "@ definitely that is why i told you that i do n't want to see you here anymore . @" ||| ubutaha uzatanga iki ? ni njyewe uzatanga . @" umusaza aranbwira ati @: "@ ibyo byo urabiumva niyo mpamvu nkubwiye ko ntashaka kaongera kukubona hano . @"
"@ so , what can do ? @" ||| "@ ... nonese nbigirae ntae ? @"
i asked him . then i got out of the house and said , "@ well , i have to leave ... @" i decided to start moving in open . ||| ubwo ngubwo ntasohoka , nravuga nti @: "@ reka ngendae ... @" numva ko igisubizo ari uko ngiye kufata urugendo , nkagenda ku mugaragaro .
i did n't care about who i would meet and what he would do to me . all i was avoiding was staying in that home . ||| uwo mpura nawe yanyica yakora iki ... icyo yifuza cyose . ariko numvae ko ntiicaye hariya .
i saw how he would bribe them with a cow every time they came to his home , till when all the cows were finished . ||| kuko nrarebaaga ukuntu baje atanze inka . ukuntu baje atanze inka . none zirashize .
there had remained two cows , now the two cows were also taken . ||| hari hasigaye inka ebyiri .
therefore , since the cows are finished ... definitely he would not accept to remain with nothing . ||| none zirashize . ubwo zimaze kushira ... noneho ibyo ari byo byose ngaruka , nawe ntabwo azaemera kusigarair aho . ibyo ari byo byose ... nawe yaragendaaga ,
he also used to move ; i could not see him at home , he would come back in the evening . ||| ntinigeze mubona yica , ariko yaragendaaga . akaza kugaruka nimugoroba .
ever , he would go and come back in the evening . ||| akagenda akagaruka nimugoroba .
i would say , "@ they will kill me next . @" ||| nkavuga nti ubu ninjyewe bazaica .
but i would imagine how they killed the cows ... in fact that is the only reason why i never wanted to stay there . i would imagine it is would be same way they would kill me . ||| noneho nreba ukuntu baishe inka ... nicyo kitumaaga ntashaka no kuhaguma ... kuko nbonaaga nnjyae ari ko ngomba kupfa .
i told him that , "@ now i have left . @" ||| ... nramubwira nti @: "@ ubu nragiye . @"@
then he asked me that , "@ please go and never think about coming this way . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ genda rwose unbabarirae ,
hope you can see that next time they will demolish my house . @" ||| ntiwongere kutekereza kugaruka zino nzira , kuko urabona ko ikisigaye uri butumae bansenyair . @"
i told him that , "@ do n't worry , i am going . @" ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ muzae nta kibazo nragiye . @"
again i sloped down . ||| nraongera nramanuka nraigendera urebye kikoze ni imaan igira ukuntu ikora . njyae nravuze nti @:
but some times i wonder , i think that is god works ; i always say that if the sorghum plantations were not there , no one would have survived among those who survived in rubengera . ||| iyo aya masaka ataza kubaho nta muntu uri kurokoka mu bantu barokokeye i rubaengair .
i left that home . i lived in the sorghum plantation for days . ||| nragenda ... njyae nbaye mu masaka bukira bukacya ,
at night i would go and drink some water and then come back and sit some where in the sorghum plantation . ||| bumara kugera nijoro nkagenda nkanywa amazi , ubundi nkagaruka nkaiicarair ahantu nka gutya mu masaka gutya .
i would see everyone passing , the attacker , although i would notice them . they used to be mixed up with the bakiga from up there . ||| nkareba ababa bahita , bahita mu bitero , usibye ko abenshi ntabamenyaaga babaga bacanze n' abakaiga b' iyo ... ba ruguru iyongiyo .
i would see seseko ... that lady who was called seseko was the common figure , maybe it was because she was the one i knew before . ||| nkabonamo abaitwa ba sesaeko ... uwo mukobwa witwaga sesaeko niwe nbonaaga cyane ,
i also knew dushimimana , they passed by ... night would fall . ||| kuko arinawe nri nzi , n' uwitwaga dushimimana barahita . bukira ,
i would sit and watch . ||| nkaicara nkabireba .
they came up with a new system of hunting people with dogs , after realizing that people no longer live in the house . ||| noneho haza kuaduka systeme [ uburyo ] y' uko bamaze kumenya y' uko nta bantu bakiba mu ngo ,
they would send dogs in the sorghum . ||| noneho bakajya baohereza imbwa mu masaka .
truly , most people survived from the sorghum plantation . ||| kuko koko abantu benshi barokotse mu masaka .
lets say one would walk a bit trying to change a position or when one is tired of either sitting or sleeping . ||| nkajya niicarair gutyo ... imbwa ... noneho ukajya ugenda niba ushaka nko kuimuka cyangwa ugendagenda , unaniwe kuicara no kuryama ,
then we would separate the sorghum plants slowly and we would move without shaking . ||| ukagerageza ukuntu utandukanya amasaka mo hagati buhoro buhoro , ukajya ugenda atanyeganyega .
because it was in the valley , they would stand on top of the hill and see shaking sorghum plants . ||| noneho kubera ko hari ahantu mu mucyamo hasi bakahagarara hejuru ku musozi , bahagarara babona amasaka anyeganyeze ,
immediately they would send dogs and blow whistles . ||| bakahita bashumurizamo imbwa .
and , maybe it would show signs of raining . ||| noneho ukaumva bavugije ifirimbi .
whenever it would rain . ||| noneho imvura iba irakubye ,
i would fell relieved , because i used to know that no one would hunt me from the sorghum plantation , while it was raining . ||| ikubye ... iyo imvura yakubaaga njyewe muri jyewe nhitaaga numva nruhutse nkaumva nfite amahoro yose . nravugaaga nti @: mu nvura nta bari buze kuza kunshaka hano mu masaka .
maybe they will go to homes but no one can allow to be beaten by rain just looking for me . ||| n' abari bujyae gusaka baragenda mu ngo ariko ntawe uri buze ngo yemerae kunyagirwa .
suddenly , i heard ... i was trying to shift from where i was , because it was very close to the road yet groups of attackers were still coming from the stadium . ||| noneho ngiye kaumva ... ubwo nri mvuya ahantu hamwe nbona haegereye hari umuhanda , kandi nbona ibitero bikikomeza kuza bituruka muri stade , nravuga nti @:
therefore i decided to extend upwards because i was afraid of dying while i was watching . ||| "@ reka nzae nigaire haruguru . @" ntinyaaga kuba npfa nreba . wenda nzamukae nibanyirukaho bari busangae nahwereye . nraimuka nrazamuka nigair haruguru .
i said to myself , "@ i better expend a bit and in case they run after me , they will find when i already fainted . @" so i changed the place and went a bit up . suddenly , i heard whistles . ||| eh ! ngiye kaumva numva bavugije ifirimbi . bati @:
"@ there is somebody there . check in all sides in the middle of the plantation . the plants are moving , there must be people . @" ||| "@ hariya hagati ... murebae murebae impande n' impande , hariya hagati mu masaka ... turabona arimo ahungabana ibyo aribyo byose harimo abantu . @"
they finally died while still tied together . how i saw it ... they were lying down in the road with their intestines tied together ; they were dying . ||| umugabo ubwo barinze bapfa bameze gutyo , kuko ... uko nbirebaaga baryamye ahongaho bapfundikanyaije ubura bwabo baryamye gutyo mu nzira , bariho basamba .
then i saw another group of attackers coming from the stadium and i said , "@ how am i going to die ? @" ||| nibwo nbonye igitero kiturutse kuri stade kizamuka nravuga nti @: "@ ubu noneho njyae baranyica batae ? @"
i could n't imagine how . ||| numva biranrenze .
then i decided to go back to the other family in gacaca in the other man 's home . but i would imagine going back there yet all cows were finished , i knew he would handle me to the perpetrators . ||| mpita nfata decision [ icyemezo ] y' uko ngiye kugenda nkaongera nkasubiza ruguru , aho ngaho mu gacaca . nkazamuka nsubira kwa wa mugabo ... ariko numva kusubirayo ,
he wanted some profits out of those cows . ||| noneho nta nka afite ari butangae , kandi nawe n' ihari araumva atavairmo aho n' ukuntu yari yaraziruhiye , ariwe uzahairira azigirair kutae ... byose .
because he looked after them and cared about them all the time . then i said , "@ if i go back , he will handle me to the perpetrators . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose ninsubirayo , nti @: nangae arahita antanga ,
then they would kill me in the same way . @" ||| nangae banyicae gutyo birangirae . @"
days had gone ; it was about mid may . ||| ubwo biri bya ... hari hashize iminsi nyine ari nko mu kwa gatanu mu matariki ... mo hagati .
i took sometime imagining how i would go back to that home but finally i decided to go back in the sorghum and sit . ||| hashize umwanya ... nibaza ukuntu ngiye kusubira muri urwo rugo biranyobera , noneho mpitamo kaongera kuiicarair hahanri .
it was in some trench and they had lied grass [ vetiveri ] on top of the trench . ||| hari ahantu hari umuferege nyine aho ngaho harengejeho amavetiveri ,
therefore , i sat in there up to night . ||| niicarairmo ... ntakomeza niberamo burira . nmazemo nk' iminsi nk' itatu , nta kintu noneho numva kuko hari igihe cy' imvura , kandi mu kihae cy' imvura ntabwo bakundaaga kugenda cyane .
i spent almost three days in there . ||| ndicaraa ... hashize nk' iminsi nk' itatu ntahaguruka , nongera kujyendagendamo hagati mu masaka , ngiye kaumva numva bavugije induru . imbwa ziraongera ziramanuka .
it was very silent because those days it would rain a lot yet they would n't go out for people while it was raining . ||| eh ... nikubita hasi ... icyo nzi ni uko nikubise hasi , nkaza kaongera kukanguka nko mu ma saa cyenda . nta nbaw nbona , kandi zaje nzibona zingeze iruhande ari nyinshi .
therefore , after those three days i stood up and walked in the sorghum plantation again . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ ubungubu zigiye kunrya nabi zinshinga inzara nabwo sipfe . @" nherutse nikubita hasi ahari umuntu ajya muri coma [ kuta ubwenge ] agahwera ariko igihe kizagera akazayivamo . nikubise hasi birarangira .
what time was it ? ||| hari nka saa nkahae ?
it was around 3:30 ... i lost my understanding when i fell down . ||| hari nko mu ma saa cyenda n' igice . ... nikubita hasi nbiheruka ubwo ngubwo .
and in the evening ... yes it was in the evening because it was dark , that is when i gained consciousness . ||| bigeze nimugoroba ... ... nimugoroba rwose . ntabwo habonaaga , nibwo nicuye .
i did n't know where i was ; i felt like i was coming from very far and i would n't imagine what had happened to me . ||| njya kureba nbona ndi ahantu ntazi , mu mwijima , numva nvuye ahantu kure cyane . ariko numva ntinibaza ikintu kibaye .
then later i started recalling what had happened , all that had happened to boniface ; how he was killed . ||| nibwo nje kutekereza . nongera kutekereza ukuntu ibyo bintu bigenze , ntekereza iby' uwo boniface ukuntu bari bamwishe ,
i began wondering if i was dreaming or if it was real . i spent a long time thinking about it . ||| ntangira kutekereza niba ari inzozi ... niba ari ibintu nrebaaga nbitekerezaho umwanya munini rwose ,
and a round 11:00 p.m. in the night ... but they were still blowing the whistles ; they would retrieve someone just next to me , then retrieve others the other side . ||| bigeza nko mu ma saa tanu z' ijoro . ariko amafilimbi ari kwa kunri bikivuga , ariko nkaumva bavumbuye abantu hano iruhande ,
i would hear others shouting only once and for all . ||| nkaumva bavumbuye abandi ahangaha ... abandi nkaumva baranishyae rimwe kusa ... basi .
then i said ... i would imagine how i would die ... i would thing of anything i would use to commit suicide and i would see that it would n't kill me . ||| nravuga nti ... nkatekereza ukuntu nzapfa bikanyobera . ariko se ... nkareba n' ikintu nkuiicisha nkabona ntinpfa . nkatekereza nkavuga nti ... simbizi .
i would think but find no solution . ||| nkaumva simbizi ,
i did n't know what to do . ||| ntinzi icyo nkora .
i remained seated all night through , until when there was nothing moving anymore . ||| nraicara burira muri iryo joro ryose , biza kugera aho nta n' ikintu kikikoma .
morning found me in the sorghum plantation alone . ||| buracya nibereye ahongaho mu masaka , ndi jyenyine ,
but i was affected by only one thing , ‘ thinking too much . ||| ariko noneho nkaicwa n' ikintu kimwe . cyo kutekereza kusa .
’ then i would recall the memories of the place where my brothers passed . ||| noneho nza kuibuka hahantu ba bana bo mu rugo banyuze , numva binjemo .
then i said , "@ i should sit up and try to see that place . @" then i would compare my passed life with the life i was leading . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ ariko uwakongera nkaicara nkahareba wenda . kusa nkaicara nkahareba , nkaongera nkatekereza ku buzima bwanjye bwa mbere .
i was only remaining with death . ||| kuko ubwo nrimo kusa ikisigaye ari uko npfa ... nta kinri .
i went to the road and sat there . while i was sitting there , i the burgomaster passing again . ||| nrazamuka nicara ahantu ku muhanda nitegeye . ngiye kubona nongera kubona na none bourgmestre amanutse ,
on his pick @-@ up behind , there were people saying that , "@ we have finished all the tutsi , they are all dead . ||| inyuma mu ntuze ... yari pick @-@ up harimo abantu bagenda bavuga ngo @: " abatutsi tubamaze twabatsembatsembe ngo @:
the rest you should work hard rewards are awaiting . @" ||| abasigaye ngo mukorae ... ngo mukorae mushikamye ngo ibihembo birahari @"@ .
i saw a certain policeman in that car , who reminded me of that time of searching for traitors ; during that time of searching for traitors , the burgomaster was searching in our home area . ||| noneho nza kubonamo umupolisi umwe biza kutuma nibuka ... ... nsubiye inyuma gatoya , ngo mukihae barimo bashakisha ibyitso , bourgmestre we yaje gusaka muri quartier [ mu kacae ] iwacu .
he came to my home by himself yet it was the policemen who were supposed to do that . ||| mu rugo araza ... ubundi ahandi n' abapolisi bagendaaga bainjiramo bakagenda basakasaka ,
but he said that , "@ i ... @" he went to my grandmother [ my dad 's mother ] ; her two kids were living in kigali . ||| ariko we noneho aravuga ati @: "@ njyewe ... @" ajya kwa nyogokuru , kuko nyogokuru yari afite ... [ ubyara papa ] ... yari afite abana babiri babaga inahangaha i kigali .
therefore , the burgomaster said that , "@ there is no way this old lady would be ... @" she was a very old grandma , she could n't walk . ||| noneho aravuga ati @: "@ nta kuntu uyu mukecuru ... @" [ yari umukecuru mukuru ushaje cyane rwose wa wunri utakibasha no kugenda ] ati @:
so he said , "@ there is no way this old lady would be having children living in kigali , and have no gun in her house . ||| nta kuntu uyu mukecuru yaba afite abana baba i kigali ngo abe atafite imbunda mu nzu .
i will have to check her home myself . @" ||| njyewe ngomba kuigirayo . @"
he entered in the house himself while the rest remained outside . ||| ubwe niwe winjiye , abandi bose basigara hanze ,
his car was parked at home like this with many policemen around our home . ||| imodoka yari iparitse mu iwacu rugo gutya , abapolisi ari benshi cyane .
the burgomaster said , "@ i have to search in this old woman 's house and gahizi 's house by myself . ||| aravuga ati @: "@ uyu mukecuru na kahaizi njyewe ngomba kubisakira njyewe njyenyine ,
because you can not search them as i may wish . @" ||| mwebwe mushobora no kugeramo ntimubashae kureba neza nk' uko nbiifuza . @"
therefore , he searched in the houses himself . he entered and ordered every body to get out except my grandma . ||| we ubwe arainjira aravuga @: "@ ati abantu bose nibasohoke mukecuru wowe wenyine usigarae ahangaha ,
"@ you will remove everything and i will check by myself . ||| akantu kose ujyae ukuraho njyae nirebaire ,
because i am sure you have a gun . ||| kuko bianze bikunze nzi neza ko wowe ufite imbunda . @"
" he told my grandmother . ||| umukecuru ati @:
then she asked him , "@ my son , as i am can i have a gun ? ||| "@ ariko mwana wanjye rwose ,
as you see me ... which gun would it be or from where ? ||| njyewe ngira imbunda ... nkanjyae uko unreba uku ... iyo mbunda imeze itae ... ? igenda itae ... iva hehe ?
how would i hold it or use it for ? @" ||| ubusae nyifata ntae ... nyikoresha iki ?
the burgomaster seemed to have enough respect and honor to enter the old lady 's house and go under the bed by him self . ||| bourgmestre rero ukuntu umureba ubonaaga ari umugabo rwose ubona ... wiyubashye , w' umunyacyubahiro uteye ubwoba . utatinyuka no kuinjira mu nzu y' umukecuru ngo agendae yinjira mu nsi y' igitanda ahantu hose .
i was living with my grandma but he chased me out so badly and said , "@ i must remain with this old lady alone . @" ||| ariko ubwe ... kuko icyo kihae njyae nbanaaga na nyogokuru ... turabanaaga neza gutya . aransohora nabi rwose ... ati @: "@ njyewe ngomba kusigaraan n' umukecuru hano mu nzu . @"@ arasaka ,
then he checked . we followed them when they left but he never found anything . ||| turabakurikira bazamutse ntiyagira ikintu abona .
then they went to my home and when they reached there , still he entered and checked ; he through everything up and he was with one policeman to unveil things for him . ||| arazamuka ajya mu rugo ageze mu rugo naho arasaka , ibintu byose aterera hejuru . ari we wenyine urimo , n' umupolisi ugenda amwegurira ibintu .
they looked around the house in the gardens but they did n't find anything . ||| noneho tuesae tusohotse nta muntu n' umwe uri mu nzu usibye we n' uwo mupolisi kusa . hanze muri jardin [ mu busitani ] hose barashakisha babura ikintu ,
then after they got into their cars and left . ||| barangije burira imodoka baragenda .
later they met my dad and told him that they found a gun in his house . ||| bamaze kugenda nibwo bahuye na papa , aramubwira ati @:
they showed his a pistol they had . "@ we found a gun in your house . get into the car . @" they commanded him . ||| "@ rero iwawe tuhakuye imbunda ... [ ahita amwereka pistolet bari bafite ] ... iwawwe tuhakuye imbunda , hita wurira tugende . @"
but my dad told them that , "@ you can kill me but i can not agree with you . ||| papa ati @: "@ wenda munyicae .
let 's go and you show me where you got it and how you got it . @" ||| nzi ko ntayo ihari ngwino unyerekae aho uyikuye , unanbwirae n' uburyo uyibonyemo . @"
the burgomaster said , "@ i got it and it is here . ||| bourgmestre ati @:
let 's go you have to be arrest and get out rubengera . you must have been having a gun . it should be there . @" ||| "@ nrayibonye ngiyi tugomba kugenda ugomba kufungwa wowe nta kuntu ugomba kusigara hano muri rubaengair bianze bikunze ugomba kuba ufite imbunda ... yagombye kuba ihari . @"
then my dad told him that , " that is very impossible . ||| noneho papa aramubwira ati @: "@ ibyo ntabwo bishoboka .
i will n't get into your car . @" ||| ntabwo bishoboka ntinshobora kuyurira . @"
the burgomaster insisted , "@ you will enter it unwillingly . @" ||| ati [ bourgmestre ] : "@ ururair nabi . @"
but dad refused ; "@ i can not get into that car . @" ||| undi [ papa ] aramubwira ati @: "@ ntabwo nshobora kuyurira . @" aramanuka arikomereza araza .
then he started working towards home and then the burgomaster said to him that , "@ though we did n't find it ... though i am telling you that it is here yet it is not the one but you should be aware that you will never stay here . ||| aramubwira [ bourgmestre ] ati @: "@ nubwo itabonetse ariko , n' ubwo nkubwira ngo @: ngiyi ariko siyo ,
you have to join others . @" ||| ntayo ubonye . ariko ugombae umenye ko utagomba kusigara hano utajyanye n' abandi . @"
dad ignored him and continued to go . ||| aramwihorera aramanuka .
i recalled all that after i saw that policeman who was with the burgomaster when they were checking at home . ||| ... ubwo ibyongibyo nyine nhise nbitekereza ari uko nbonye uwo mupolisi umwe nawe uje ... ugendanaaga na bourgmestre basaka mu rugo iwacu . ubwo rero mu mwanya nyine nri ndi ahongaho ,
in a moments time after the car had passed , i would see how they were catch people and killing them . ||| imodoka imara kugenda , noneho nkabona ukuntu bariho bavumbura abantu ... kubica .
on one would get a person and kill him ; let 's say hit him or at once with a club . ||| nta muntu numawe ubonaaga umuntu nrangiza yenda ngo amukubitae ubuhairi birangirae .
they would cut off a foot first , then hit him or her with a club , and leave him or her still alive . ||| akaza ... akafata nk' ikirenge akakubitaho ubuhairi gutya akaigendera ,
they had clubs of this shape ... they used to call them ‘ ntampongano y'umwanzi . ||| ubuhairi bumeze kutae buri ubuhairi baitaaga ‘ ntampongano y' umwanzi .
’ they were spiked clubs , with nails and if they hit it on the leg , there would remain holes on the leg . ||| ’ bugiye buteyemo imisumari . ku buryo niba kakubise nka hano ku kaguru hahita hasigaramo imyobo .
and , if they hit it in the head , it means that , the bone would be crashed and one would keep bleeding . ||| niba akukubise mu mutawe n' ukuvuga ngo birakubita utugufa ... ibintu byose bijanjagurike usigarae uvirirana .
but one would n't die , depending on which part they hit . ||| ariko ntupfae ngo uhwane bitewe n' ahantu bakubise .
therefore , whenever i would see how they kill people , i would just tell that i would die a painful death and i would immediately move . ||| noneho ngiye kubona ukuntu baishe umuntu gutyo , nkahita numva ko ndi bupfae nabi nkahita mpaguruka .
i immediately stood up and started walking around in the sorghum plantation . that time i was not meeting people anymore instead i would meet dogs . ||| nraongera nragenda nkajya nizembazembagirira mu masaka ... noneho nza kugi ... nta bantu banri nri nkihura nabo cyane ahubwo imbwa .
whenever they would see plants shaking they would send dogs . ||| babona amasaka anyeganyeze bakavuga bati @: "@ hariya harimo umuntu . @" imbwa zikahita ziza ... zikamanuka . zaza nkahita ... nkikubita hasi kubera ubwoba ,
so i would faint and wake up the following day in the morning . ||| basi nkisinzirair . nkazicura nk' ejobundi mu gitondo .
and , i would neither tell where i was nor what had happened . that is how days would go by but if there were no sorghum plants , i wonder what would have happened . ||| ntazi aho nvuye , nkabona ndi ahantu ... ntinzi uko bigenze ... ubwo niko iminsi yagenda yicuma ... yicuma ... yicuma ... ariko iyo hataza kuba hari amasaka simbizi .
i guess none would have survived . ||| nta n' umwe ahari uba urarokotse . niko njyewe ... niko nbibona .
from then , people stopped coming instead they would send dogs . ||| birarangira hagati aho ngaho urebye imbwa nizo zakomezaaga kuza .
then i got so hungry but i did n't know what to do . ||| noneho nza kaumva nshonje , numva ntinzi ukuntu nbigenza ... amasaka ,
there were no other crops rather than sorghum . therefore , you would imagine eating grass , which was impossible . ||| nta kinri kintu kirimo ni amasaka ... ukareba kuba urya ibyatsi ukasanga nabyo n' ibintu bitashoboka ,
after all , thoughts about food would come to your mind only when you were resting , which was for a small time . most of the time one would n't feel hunger or ... we could n't drink , that was out . ||| usibye ko ari nk' akantu kazaaga gato wenda uruhutse utakomeje kutekereza naho ubundi nta nzara nta ki ... nta kuyumva wapi . ibyo ntabwo bibaga birimo .
then i left and said to myself , "@ what if i go back to the other old man 's home ... maybe they stopped because i no longer see attackers moving . @" ||| nraongera nrazamuka nravuga nti @: "@ ariko uwasubira kwa wa musaza , wenda nkagenda ... kuko ibyo aribyo byose ... nta bitero nkibona bikigenda cyane , ibyo ari byo byose bishobora kuba birahagaze . @"
therefore , i went there . ||| ntaterera nrazamuka , nsubira mu rugo .
but days had passed ; it was around early june and they had remained with two cows . ||| ubwo hari hashize igihe ari nko mu kwa gatandatu , biri bimaze kuba mu kwa gatandatu mu matariki ya mbere . noneho ubwo hari hasigaye inka ebyiri .
i stayed in that home after two days and nights , in a certain morning ... very early around 6:30 a.m. it was slightly dark though there was some kind of light . ||| noneho nraicara muri urwo rugo , maze kuicara burira buracya , noneho bigeze mu gitondo ... mu gitondo cya kare rwose nko ma saa kumi n' imwe n' igice , hamaze kucya buke ariko bigaragara ko hakaijimye ,
then i had a group of attackers knocking on the door . ||| nibwo ngiye kaumva numva igitero baraje barakomanga . barakomanga bati @:
"@ munyagishari , in your house there are gahizi 's children . and since they are here , we can not do anything before we wipe them away . ||| "@ munyugishari wowe , ahangaha hari abana ba kahaizi . none kuba bahari nta kintu na kimwe kigomba kukorwa batari bava mu nzira . bati @:
and , in the whole of gacaca , you are the only one remaining with people , all others died . @" ||| kandi hano muri iyi ntuza ... ya gacaca ni wowe wenyine usigaraanye abantu , abandi bose barapfuye bararangiye . @"
they told that man ; munyagishali . they were talking while standing outside the door . so , he took me behind the house . ||| noneho ubwo baganiraaga nawe bari ku muryango bari inyuma noneho ahita ansohora anjyana mu kikari .
they started checking in the main house yet i was in the small house behind the big one . ||| ansohoye anjyana mu kikari bakomeza kushakisha ahongaho ndi mu nzu yo mu kikari barangije baraigendera .
later they left . ||| bati @:
"@ we shall come back in dawn while we can see clearly . you will n't lay to us anything . ||| "@ turi buze kugaruka hamaze kucya , nihamara kucya ibyo ari byo byose ntacyo uri butubeshye .
we shall look for her and in case we do n't see her ... we know you still have their cows . ||| turamushaka kandi tutamubona nitutanamubona tuzi neza ko hasigaye inka zabo .
they will also be taken . @" they said . ||| nazo zigomba kugenda . @"
therefore , i saw him coming and behind him there were about fifty people . ||| nuko ... ngiye kubona nbona aramanutse inyuma hari igitero cy' abantu nka mirongo itanu [ 50 ] .
then i wondered , "@ pastor ! @" ||| eh ! nravuga nti se pasiteri ... ntahaguruka nragenda nramusuhuza .
i went and greeted him though , he was looking at me so badly . ||| nragenda nramusuhuza , eh .. ! nkabona aranreba nabi .
as he was walking , he was carrying his small bag of bibles . ||| ubwo uko agenda afite agasakoshi k' iwe karimo amabible ;
he used to walk with that bag so , i saw him . ||| ibintu byose ... isakoshi yarayigendanaaga .
"@ what is between pastor and this whole group of attackers behind him ? @" ||| mpita mubona ‘ ... se pasiteri n' iki gitero kimuri inyuma gutya ... umh ?
i was outside but i swiftly entered in the gate . ||| ’ ndi hanze gutya , mpita ntaruka nragenda njya mu kikari . nraicara nti @: "@ nbonye pasiteri aje ,
" it is over now . ||| nti @: kandi inyuma ye hari igitero . nti noneho ntapfuye , ntapfuye noneho birarangiye ,
i am going to die . @" ||| nti ntapfuye . @"
i told verediane , the girl whom we lived together in that home . ||| nbwira uwo mukobwa uwo nyine tubanaaga uri unjyanye ahongaho iwabo , yitwaaga verediyana . nramubwira nti @: "@ verediya nti @:
"@ all i used to say was just what i thought , but now i am going to die . ||| bibinri byose ni ibyo njyaaga nibwira , nti noneho ntapfuye .
can you imagine i have seen the pastor kanani coming here ! ||| nti uziko nbonye pasiteri kanani aje ... aje hano ,
he is coming here and behind him there is a big group of attackers . ||| nti ari kuza hano , nti kandi inyuma ye hari igitero .
do you think there are other people whom they have come to kill in this area ? @" ||| nti none se hano hantu hari ahandi hantu hari abantu bashaka kuica ? @"
i said to her . ||| aranbwira ati @:
but she told me that , "@ just be strong . ||| "@ wowe tuza wihangane ati @:
although there is no one else here , the god that protected you all this time will protect you now . @" ||| ibyo aribyo byose hano nta wunri muntu uri ahangaha , imaan nyine yakurinze n' ubundi irakomeza ikurindae . @"
i said , "@ no , i do n't want to survive . ||| nti @: "@ oya simbishaka . nti reka nzae nsohokae . nti @:
in fact let me get outside but , since there is pastor they may not kill me because he knows me . @" ||| ahubwo uriya pasiteri kuba bari kumwe , nti @: nrabona ari burumae batanyica , kubera ko anzi . @"
then she said to me , "@ you never know , he may be the worst of all . ||| noneho aranbwira ati @:
just stay calm . @" ||| "@ ahubwo uriya usanga ariwe mubi . ati @: wowe guma hamwe , utuze . @"
but i said that i would n't hide myself . ||| nti @:
"@ i will in the open . @" ||| "@ oya ntabwo ndibwihishe reka njyae kumugaragaro . @"
umh ! ||| umh !
suddenly i heard people knocking . ||| ngiye kaumva , numva barakomanze .
the whole group of attackers came running behind the pastor . ||| pasiteri ... pasiteri igitero bose baje bamwirukanka inyuma bafite ubuhairi ,
they had clubs , sharp sticks ... then i asked myself , "@ fifty people have come to kill only me . ||| bafite ibisongo ... nravuga nti @: "@ noneho abantu mirongo itanu bagiye kunyica njyenyine ,
how will they kill me ? @" ||| baranyica batae ? @"
i could not understand it because i had seen how they killed several people in several ways depending on ‘ who was who . ||| nkaumva simbyumva . kubera ukuntu nri nbonye bariho bica abantu ,
’ ... some would be cut fingers , other would be cut feet . ||| biteye n' umuntu babonye uwo ariwe ... akaba yakata intoki undi akakata ikirenge ... nravuga nti @:
then i would wonder , "@ all these people ... ! @" they seemed like a whole market . ||| "@ noneho abantu bangana gutya ... @" nbonaaga ari nk' isoko ryose .
they were saying , "@ some kid from gahizi survived and she is just in front there . @" ||| ngo @: "@ kwa kahaizi hasigaye umwana ... kwa kahaizi hasigaye umuntu , ngo ari hariya inberae . @" bari kuza bivuga .
"@ is that true ? @" ||| nravuga nti @: "@ aah ... nibyo ? @"
i would ask myself but i would never understand it . ||| nbitekerezaho nkaumva simbikurura ngo nbiumvae .
"@ all these people for me as i am ... @" i would look at myself and could n't believe it . ||| "@ aba bantu bose ? njyewe ! @" nkaongera nkasubiza amaso inyuma nkireba "@ ... njyewe uyu nguyu ?
"@ all these people with pastor leading them ! @" ||| abantu bangana gutya ... pasiteri abari inberae ? @" umh ,
i would not believe it . ||| nkaumva biranyoboye .
but i refused to enter in the house . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ ntininjira muri iyi inzu rwose muzae ... ntugirae ikibazo ngo ... ntibari bukusenyair kubera njyewe .
i wanted them to kill me so that i would rest . ||| nraguma hano hanze bakorae icyo bashaka .
"@ they should come and finish me , maybe you would get a chance to sleep . @" i told the girl . ||| birangirae binibagirane rwose pe ! nawe uzaryamae usinzirae . @"
as i was sitting there , pastor kanani came ; he was holding his bag . ||| nraicara ngiye kaumva numva barakomanze . baraza baramubwira ... ... pasiteri uwonguwo . uwo pasiteri kanani na ntuza na ... afite agasakoshi k' iwe ,
then he told the old man , "@ we heard that in your home , there are gahizi 's children who survived , now these people are on my case . ||| ngo @: "@ rero muzehe ngo hano ngo tuumvise ko hari abana ba kahaizi basigaye , ngo bakaba bari ahangaha . ngo none ngo aba bantu bamereye nabi ngo bagomba kubica ,
they said they must kill them or take gahizi 's cows , which remained here . @" ||| sinon ukabaha inka za se zisigaye ahangaha . @"
the old man said , "@ i told you that there is no child here . come in and see . @" ||| umusaza arababwira ati @: "@ nbabwiye ko hano nta mwana uhari nimuzae murebae . @"
but he imagined and said , "@ i do n't want them to demolish my house . ||| umusaza we yararebye aravuga ati @: ntinshaka ko bansenyair ,
because , they will still kill the child after demolishing my house . ||| kandi na none nibamara no kunsenyair n' umwana baramwica .
after all , this has lasted for so long ; they took all the cows just because of the same kid . ||| nk' uko n' ubundi bihereye kera . inka zose bamaze kuzimaraho kubera umwana ,
and , now they are still looking for her . ||| none baracyamushakisha .
in case i do n't give them the kid , they will demolish my house and if they demolish the house , even the kid will die . @" ||| nimubima bari bunsenyaire . kandi nibansenyera n' umwana nawe azapfa .
therefore , he told them that , "@ come into the house if you get her , then you will take her . @" ||| umwana nimuzae mumusake nimumubona mumutwarae .
they all entered in the house . fifty people in one house . ||| barainjira barasaka abantu mirongo itanu mu nzu umwe .
some climbed on top of the house others looked around in the sorghum and coffee plantations , they checked everywhere and said , "@ we must know the kid , who is here . ||| abandi burira hejuru , abandi impande zose mu masaka barataka , mu makawa impande zose , bati @:
we know there is one . @" ||| "@ tugomba kumenya neza umwana arahari , arahari turabizi neza . @"
they were informed by the kids we were together ... those kids went saying that , "@ one kid died , the one who is tall and slim and resembled her mother , is the remaining one . ||| kumbi ba bana turi kumwe , bagiye inyuma bagenda bavuga ngo @: "@ umwana umwe yarapfuye ngo hasigaye undi , ngo wa wunri muremure unanutse ,
she is and the old man 's home . ||| wa wunri usa na mama w' iwe . ngo wunri niwe usigaye kandi ari kwa muzehe hariya ,
we have been together just now and then , she was called to go and eat but she is there . @" ||| turi tukaumawe none aha bamuhamagaye none aha agiye kurya , arahari . @"
pastor said , "@ she was with other kids out there in the past few minutes . ||| araza ati @:
i saw her ; she was just seated there with other kids and entered here while i was seeing . ||| "@ kandi ntiyari ari kumwe n' abana hano none aha mu kanya ? ... [ ariko pasiteri avuga ] ... mu kanya yari ari kumwe n' abana hano njyewe nmubonye . kandi yinjiye iwawe nbibona .
bring her out and do quickly . @" ||| sohora umwana gira vuba . @"
i would be a bit afraid but on the other hand i would say , "@ yes let it be over maybe all the worries will be gone . ||| noneho mu mutaima wanjye nkaumva akantu k' ubwoba , ariko ku rundi nuhande nkaumva "@ ... yee ... nibyo birangirae ... birangirae .
i will never spend more days running or wandering in the sorghum plantations . ||| wenda iyi mihangayiko yose irahita ishira . ntinzaongera kuirirwa niruka , ntinzaongera kugenda mu masaka ,
i will never ... umh ... it will be over and that will be it . @" ||| ntinzaongera ... umh ... birahita birangira nkaumva ntyine ko ari uko .
therefore , they all went out and sat at the slop waiting for me to get out ; the road was on slopping up to our home . ||| nuko bose baragenda baicara ahantu bategereje ko ngiye kusohoka hari akantu k' umukingo , kuko umuhanda uramanukaaga ukainjira mu rugo ,
therefore , there was a steep slop so , they all went and sat there . ‘ it was similar to how jesus went before pilato . ||| noneho hari umukingo muremure bose baicaraho nyine ... ‘ biri bimeze nk' uko yesu yagiye inberae kwa pilato .
’ i came out and saw the whole line . ||| ’ eh ! nsohotse nbona umurongo wose .
about fifty people sitting and me standing in front of them . ||| abantu nka mirongo itanu barazamu ... baicaye ahantu hejuru nnjyae ndi inberae yabo .
the other feeling of joy for death , turned into a problem . ||| noneho ka kantu ngiraaga ko kuishima ko kupfa noneho numva binbereye ikibazo .
i said to myself , "@ i alone ? @" ||| nravuga @: "@ umh ! njyewe njyenyine ? @"
i would n't believe it . ||| nkaumva simbyumva .
i was so afraid and said , "@ will i survive this point of time ? @" ||| ubwoba buranyica nravuga @: "@ nti ntahava se aha hantu ? @"
i sat down . ||| nraicara .
then i told that woman ... [ she was normally called mama vincent . ||| noneho nbwira uwo mukecuru [ bakunda kumwita mama vincent ] . nti @:
] "@ mama vincent tell me , look at all those people . ||| "@ niko mama vincent , nbwira nawe @: reba bariya bantu bose .
my dad and mom are already killed . doudou and epa all died . ||| papa bamaze kumwica , mama bamwishe ... barapfuye ... doudou yarapfuye ba epa bose barapfuye ,
no one is remaining . @" ||| nta wunri muntu . @"
however my uncle and aunt lived these ends in kigali , but i never thought about them . ||| ariko ubwo uwo mu oncle n' umutante babaga ino ahangaha bo ntinnabatekerezaaga . nta n' agatekerezo .
i considered only those whom we were together , after all they were the majority but they had all died . ||| njyae nrebaaga abo turi kumwe , ni nabo bari benshi , nkabona bose bapfuye .
in addition , no one had survived in kigali . ||| nkahita niumvaish en plus [ noneho ] i kigali ho noneho nta n' usigaye .
i told her everything . ||| nraicara ndabimutondorera , nramubwira nti @:
i told her ; "@ imagine how they killed boniface , i was watching ; they pierced him from the ribs and some things came out , then they tied them with the wife 's . ||| "@ reba ukuntu baishe boniface , nti njyewe bamwishe mureba ,
and then after they [ perpetrators ] asked them to stand up and stop them from passing . ||| bamupfumuye urubavu hasohokamo ibintu barazirika n' umugore barababwira ngo nibabatangire ,
well , tell me how are they going to kill me ? ||| none njyewe baranyica kutae ?
i am alone but look at all those people @" i was so afraid and sat there . ||| ndi umuntu umwe reba bariya bantu bose ukuntu bangana . @" ubwoba buranyica nicara ahongaho .
she came and pulled me and said , "@ stand here . @" ||| araza arankurubana aranbwira ati @: "@ hagarara ahangaha . @"
though i would n't believe it ... it was a problem to me . ||| uraumva ariko simbyumva . ariko se ... umh , binbera ikibazo .
i stood in front of them , trembling and feeling weak due to fear . ||| nraza nbahagarara inberae , ndagadwa ariko nta ntegae nfite ... kubera ubwoba .
i would imagine how i was going to die ... killed by hundreds of people . ||| nreba ukuntu ngiye kupfa ... kuicwa n' abantu magana angahe bose .
i would look at myself and see how small i was and compare it with all those men carrying several weapons , then i would wonder , "@ how will i die ... ? ||| nrirebaaga nreba ukuntu ngana , nreba n' abantu b' abagabo n' intwaro bafite , nkavuga nti @:
how will i die ? @" ||| "@ ntapfa ntae ... ntapfa ntae ? @"
i would imagine one taking out my eye and another one doing other weird thing to me ... then i would wish that , if it was possible ... i used to watch films and see how people who die being shot , die in a nice way . ||| nkaumva umwe ari bujyae akuramo ijisho , undi agirae kutae ... nkaifuza nti ahari niba bishobokaaga ... kuko njyaaga nbona ku mafilime ukuntu umuntu yicwa n' isasu .
it is just a single shot and one dies straight away without a clue on what happened . ||| akaba ari filingi ya mbere itabaho . ari ukumukubita kusa ... umh , mbese bikahita birangira ntamenye n' uko bigenze .
therefore , i would look around and wonder , "@ is n't there someone with a gun to fire me with just a single bullet now ? @" ||| nkavuga nti @: ... noneho njyewe . nkareba muri abo bantu bose ... nkavuga nti @: "@ nk' ubu koko hakaburamo n' umuntu ufite imbunda ngo anturitse rimwe birangirae ? @"
i sat down because i had failed to stand due to fear ; i was shaking so hard and i would fall down . ||| nraicara kuhagarara birananira kubera ubwoba , nrinrimo ntitira cyane nikubita hasi .
therefore , two of them came and made me stand . one held here and the other one held here . ||| noneho baraza barampagarika , babiri umwe aranfata undi aranfata gutya ,
then they said to the old man , "@ mr. munyagishari , you have been telling us that there is no gahizi 's child here . so , tell us the background of this kid . ||| nuko babwira uwo mugabo bati @: "@ ariko munyagishari wowe uhereye kera utubwira ngo nta bana ba kahaizi bari hano . uyu mwana tubwirae amavu n' amavuko ye utubwirae ibye ,
tell us all about how you got her because we know that in your home there is no child who ... you have never had a child who looks like this in your home . @" ||| utubwirae byose n' ukuntu umubonye . tuzi iwawe mu rugo ko nta mwana ko nta ... n' uwo wigeze wigera umwana usa utya mu rugo rwawe . @"
then he replied them that , "@ this child is my wife 's niece . @" ||| umugabo arababwira ati @: "@ umugabo arababwira ati uyu mwana ni umwisengeneza w' umugore wanjye . @"
"@ who is your wife ... is your wife a tutsi , a hutu , who is your wife ? @" ||| bati umugore wawe se ni iki ? umugore wawe umugore wawe ni umututsi , umugore wawe ni umuhutu ... umugore wawe n' iki ? @"
they asked him . ||| arababwira ati @:
then he replied then that , "@ my wife is a hutu . @" ||| "@ umugore wanjye ni umuhutu . @"
"@ so , if your wife is hutu , how is she related to these children ? ||| "@ ... none se niba ari umuhutu ahurair he n' aba bana ... n' uyu mwana usa utya .
look at how she looks like , see her height ... @" they asked him again . ||| dore ukuntu areshya ... @" bakanrambura intoki , bakareba inzara iki ... ?
they would straighten my fingers and observe my nails . then his wife said , "@ this is my cousin 's daughter and ... @" she was trying to show them that his cousin was a tutsi but they never shared parents . ||| umugore arababwira ati @: "@ uyu mwana n' uwa musaza wanjye ariko musaza wanjye wo mu miryango kubera ko ... @" mbese ababwira ukuntu musaza we yari umututsi badahuje se .
therefore , they went and took out another cow . ||| nibwo bagenda bakasohora indi nka ,
and kill it in the same way . ||| kwa kunri na none .
critically , their major concern was n't killing ; they were more interested in eating . ||| urebye muri make , mbese icyabo ntikiri ukuica ,
so they took out the cow and killed it like they killed other cows ; cutting off horns , ears , until when it falls off . ||| ahubwo kuri ukushaka kwirair . basohora inka bakiyigeza hanze kuyica ni kwa kunri ni ukugenda bayitema , batema amahembe ; bakatema amatwi ;
and then everyone would take what he managed to cut . they would cut they would piece with the skin on . ||| bakatema iki ... ? nyuma ikaza kuikubita hasi . umwe icyo aciye ajyana , n' undi icyo akase ajyana ... n' uruhu byose .
and , one of the attackers , after others had left with the meat , he told the old man [ mr. munyagishari ] that , "@ let me give you some piece of advice , with this child , in the end all things that you have ... all their cows , everything will get finished . ||| noneho umwe muri bo muri icyo gitero ... bamaze kugenda ... abandi bo bamaze kuibonera inyama baraigendera . bamaze kugenda hasigara umwe aramubwira ati @: "@ umva rero wa mugabo nkugirae inama @: uyu mwana amaherezo ... ibintu byabo uri ufite ... inka zabo uri ufite ,
and the end will be her ; they will kill her . ||| byose bikushiraiyeho . amaherezo ni we kandi bazamutwara bamwice .
find another way or let her go and be killed with other perpetrators . ||| we shakisha ukundi kuntu , cyangwa umusohorae azapfae yishwe n' abandi ,
and after she dies , no one will come to you again because you have been giving out things as to bribe for her . @" ||| asohokae bamwice ariko nibamara kumwica , ntawuzagaruka kukureba kuko biriya byose ubitangaaga nk' ingwate @"@ .
then the man said , "@ that is true . @" ||| umugabo aravuga ati @: "@ koko nibyo . @"
immediately he threw me out of his house and said , "@ look for another place to hide , i do n't want to see you here . @" ||| muri ako kanya ahita ansohora ati @: "@ nbabarira ushakae ahandi hantu ujya , ntinongerae kukubona hano . @"
i said , "@ it is okay . @" ||| nti @: "@ pe ! nta kibazo . @"
after he told me that , immediately i left and stayed in the sorghum plants in a trench . ||| akibinbwira ubwo ngumbwo nyine nhise nsohoka , nragenda nkomeza kuibera mu masaka ,
it would rain but i would enter in the trench and whenever it would shine i would sit in the sorghum plantation . ||| mu muferege , imvura ikagwa , nkigira mu muferege , haba ari ku zuba nkibera mu masaka gutyo nicaye .
dogs would come and i would faint because of fear and i would come back to my senses when they had left . ||| imbwa zo zirazaaga , zaza ... ni nko kugwa muri koma kubera ubwoba ni iki ... nkazicura zagiye ,
i wonder why they never bit me . ||| ntinzi n' impamvu zitanryaaga .
the war stopped before someone 's finger or any dog 's teeth neither touched me . ||| intambara yarinze irangira nta n' unkojeje urutoki nta n' iryinyo ry' imbwa riigeze rirangairho .
i was alone . ||| ndi jyenyine gutyo .
about two days later after that cow was eaten , that when the other old lady came to look for me . ||| noneho hashize nk' iminsi nk' ibiri nyuma y' uko iyo nka bamaze kuyirya , nibwo uwo mukecuru yaje kunshaka ,
[ the wife to munyagishari ] she was looking everywhere in there sorghum plantation because , i never used to go very far . ||| uwo mugorae w' uwo mugabo . araza kunreba aza kushakisha ahantu hose mu masaka yabo ... kuko ntabwo njyaaga kure .
because if i walked very far , it would mean crossing roads . and if i crossed roads , i would have met people who knew me who would kill me so painfully . ||| kuko iyo hariya nza kukomeza kure biri kuba ngombaw ko nambuka imihanda kandi iyo nza kuambuka imihanda nibwo nri kuhura n' abanzi noneho bakananyica na nabi .
i continued walking and reached the other pit hole . ||| noneho ubwo nramanuka , ntakomeza nragenda , eh ... ngiye kubona nbona mpingukiye kuri cya cyobo .
i heard people talking from inside the pit . ||| numva abantu barimo bavugamo hasi .
i asked myself , "@ should i get in ? @" ||| nravuga nti @: "@ eh , njyaemo ? @"
i never peeped inside because it was across the road but on the roadside . ||| ntekereza ... ntinigeze nrungurukamo , kuko kurungurukamo kuri ukuambuka umuhanda , kiri kiri ku muhanda gutya .
i imagined that in case i peeped in it , i would also go inside it and i would die with suffer yet that is what i was avoiding . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ nrebyemo nhita njyamo , kandi nkapfa nabi numva kandi aribyo nanze . @"
i went and sat in the sorghum plantation . ||| ntakomeza nraigendera mu masaka nraicara ,
in the evening ... it was already dark in the evening . ||| bimaze kugera ku mugoroba ... ... ku mugoroba cyane rwose hatakibona .
i heard someone who was walking slowly and talking to herself . ||| ngiye kaumva numva umuntu ari kuza buhoro buhoro yivugaish , ariko yari umu mama , ngiye kubona nbona ni wa mukecuru ungezeho .
it was the other woman , she bumped into me and said to me , "@ listen , they have planned to come and kill you and demolish our house . ||| ati @: "@ rero reka nkubwirae , rwose bamaze kwiyemeza y' uko bazaza bakakuica , bamara kukuica ntawe bakatusenyair bakagenda .
so , i will take you somewhere very far from here since it is at night . ||| none ngwino nkuhungaishe nkuerekae ahandi hantu nkujyana kure , kuko ari nijoro ,
you will stay there and luckily enough , they do n't know your family . @" [ it was near gitesi in a different district ... near the stadium . ] and when the war chills a bit , you shall come back and we live together . ||| noneho uzabaeyo kuko ho nta nubwo babazi ... [ ni hafi ya ntuze ... i gitesi ni mu yinri commune aho hafi ya stade ] ... noneho intambara nimara kucogora uzagaruka ahangaha tuibanaire . @"
me too i said there was no problem with that . ||| nnjyae nravuga nti @: "@ sawa nta kibazo rwose . @"
therefore , we started our journey in that night at around 7:00 p.m. it was dark . ||| ubwo tufata urugendo muri iryo joro nko mu ma saa moya gutyo . ntabwo habonaaga .
we crossed and went to gitesi . ||| turagenda turaambuka tujya ahongaho muri gitesi .
she was taking me to her eldest daughter who lived there . ||| turagenda anjyanye ku mukobwa we mukuru , uri utuye yo . tugezeyo , nyina arara ,
when we reached there she spent the night there and left the following morning . ||| bukeye aragarutse . tugezeyo ho narakubititse biteye ubwoba . nifuje kuba njya muri ya masaka nbona nta n' ayo nyabona . kubera ko ngezeyo ,
when i reached there , i surfed terribly . ||| yari afite abana bakuru tunganaaga ... uw' imfura turangaanaga kuko nawe icyo kihae yigaga muwa kane primaire . noneho rero ashaka kungira nk' umukozi mu rugo , kandi nri ... mu kubaho kwanjye ibyo ntinri nbizi , nbonaaga nkaraba nkarya nkaryama ,
i even wished to go to the sorghum plantation but i could n't see it . ||| nta kinri kintu . noneho we ashaka ko nba umukozi w' abana be ahongaho mu rugo . nramubwira rero nti @: "@ beatrice ... [ nri muzi ] ... nramubwira nti @:
she had old children whom we were of the same age . ||| ibingibi ntabwo nshobora kubishobora . @" akajya anbwira ati @: "@ wowe ugomba kujya ubyuka ukajya kuvoma , uva kuvoma ukaza ... uzindutse kare sa kumi n' imwe .
we were of the same age with her first born because we were both in primary four by then . ||| ati @: kugirango tukundae tubanae ; taumvikanae ... umh ? mbese ntiuzagirae ikibazo mu rugo .
she treated me like a maid in her home though in my whole life i did n't know such a thing . ||| ujyae ubyuka ujyae kuvoma , nuvayo uzae . numara kuza tujyane kuhinga ... @" nti @: "@ ntabwo nbishobora .
i used to shower , eat and sleep nothing much . ||| nti ibyongibyo ntabwo bishoboka . @" "@ ... nitumara kuvana kuhinga , ubundi ujyae uza uzae hano mu cyumba cyanjye unreraire umwana , noneho nawe uryamae uruhukae . @"
i asked her , "@ digging ... ? ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ kuhinga ?
fetching water ... ? @" ||| ... kuvoma ?
then she said that , "@ you will be fetching three jeri cans of water . @" ||| ati : "@ uzajya uvoma amajerikani atatu . @"
i told her that , "@ that is impossible . @" ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ ibyo ntabwo bishoboka . @"
i would imagine how i never knew how to carry even a small jeri can , and just conclude that it was the worst death i would ever experience . ||| ntekereza na kabido nta nubwo nri nzi kukatwara . nkaumva urwo n' urupfu ahubwo rwa rundi rurenze .
to me , it worst than the time i was alone without anybody . ||| kuruta uko niberaagaho nta muntu nreba nzi ngo ndi jyewe jyenyine ,
i would remember that even at home i never did such work . ||| ntekereza ko no murugo iwacu ibyo bintu ntigeze nbikora ,
so i told her that , "@ i will never do that work . @" ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ ibyo ntabyo nzakora . @" aranbwira ati @:
then she bet , "@ you will do it . @" ||| "@ uzabikora . @"
however the first days i did it ; she would wake me up in the morning while others were sleeping and take me to the stream to fetch water with a big jeri can . ||| kikora mu minsi ya mbere bwo nrabikoze . akanzindura mu gitondo cya kare njyewe njyenyine , abana basigaye baryamye , akanjyana aka nyereka umugezi .
i told her that i could n't manage the big jeri can . ||| nvomae nvomaishe ijerikani nini . nramubwira nti @:
so , she gave me a smaller one . ||| " iyi jerikani ntabwo nyishobora . @"
i would keep fetching until when i fill three jeri cans . ||| akampa akabido nkavoma , nkaza nsuka ... nkaza nsuka nkauzuza amajerikani atatu .
and then after , we would go together in the garden to dig . ||| turangiza tukajyana mu muraima ngo tujyane tuhingae . eh ... !
she would dig as i am sitting , and later she would say , "@ i am fed up . ||| nkagenda akahinga nkaicara ahongaho . ati @: "@ noneho biranrambaiye .
you can not work anymore , so why am i keeping you ? @" ||| wowe nta n' icyo ukinkorera , ubu se nkutunzemo ibiki ? @"
those days she would n't give me food . ||| n' ubwo ngubwo ntiyangaburiraaga .
she would let me eat only if i fetched water , allowed to go digging and look after . ||| yangaburiraaga ari uko nvomye nkaza nkamwemerera tukajyana kuhinga , nkaza nkamurerair umwana ,
but it reached a point and i told her my mind . that time she had sent me at the stream and it had rained . ||| bigeze aho ndamwerurira ... eh ... noneho ubwo yanyohereje kujya kuvoma ,
therefore i slipped and fell in a water channel . ||| njyezeyo imvura yari yaguye nranyerair nikubita ahantu mu muferege w' amazi .
that is when i said , "@ this is the worst life ever . ||| eh ... nibwo nhitaaga ntekereza nravuga nti @: "@ ubu buzima nibwo bwa mbere bubi bubaho .
i am doing things i never did at home ; i never fetched water , i never woke up at this time . it is my first time this to happen to me . ||| ikintu ntigeze nkora mu rugo iwacu , ntinigeze nvoma , ntinigeze nbyuka iyi saha nibwo bwa mbere binbaho mu buzima .
i have never dug before ; i never eat because i did this or that work . ||| ntinigeze menya kufata isuka mu buzima bwanjye ... ntinigeze nrya ari uko nkoze ikingiki ... nubwo inzara yendaaga kunyica .
though i fetched the water i was not allowed to shower on it . @" i had because like a slave ; i was like a servant who does n't have rights to work freely . ||| nubwo nvomaaga amazi , ariko ntinbashaaga kuyakarabaho . nbona nbaye umukozi mu rugo wa wunri ariko nawe utafite liberte [ uburenganzira ] ze ngo akorae yisanzuye .
i thought about it and then told her , "@ listen to me , " that is after i had left the stream . ||| nrabireba ... nbitekerezaho , nravuga nti @: "@ rero reka nkubwirae ... @" nzamutse . nramubwira nti @:
i told her that , "@ in my life as long as we still live together , i will never wake @-@ up to go for water or go digging again . ||| "@ mu buzima bwanjye tukiri kubaan , ntabwo nzigera nongera njyewe kubyuka njya kuvoma , ntinzigera njya kuhinga ,
you would rather chase me . @" ||| wenda uzansohorae ngendae . @"
though i told her like that , i asked her to be letting me sleep in her house . ||| ariko ubwo kumubwira gutyo ... nramubwiye nti @: "@ wenda ujyae umpa icumbi nzae nryamae .
"@ and if you refuse , i know i can not fail to get where to sleep . ||| kandi nabwo nurinyima nziko ntazabura aho nrara ,
even where i was i would sleep well . @" ||| kuko n' ubundi n' aho nri ndi naho nryamaaga kandi nkasinzira . @" eh !
it hurt her so much and then she asked me , "@ is that what you have said ? ||| biramubabaza cyane biramubabaza . ati @:
you are in excess of all things ? @" ||| "@ ni ukonguko uvuze ... ? umaze kurengaw ? @"
eh ... i would remember how i never eat , how every thing was a problem ; it was only stress and worries . ||| eh ... eh ... , yanbwira ngo umaze kurengaw nziko ntajya nrya , nziko ari ibibazo kusa , ari ukuruka ,
i developed some kind of desire of committing suicide and i would ask myself , "@ how can one commit suicide ? @" ||| ari ukuza nhangayitse . ngira umutima hahanri numvaaga ... nravuga nti @: "@ mana nti @: ahari ... @" ntekerezaaga @:
then i would remember what i used to watch in movies , how one can use a knife to commit suicide or hung himself or herself to death . ||| "@ ... ariko harya umuntu yakuiica kutae ? @" nkahita ntekereza uko njyaaga nbona mu mafilime , ukuntu umuntu ashobora kuitera icyuma , ukuntu umuntu ashobora kuiahura akimanika .
and then i would wonder , "@ where can one do it ? ||| nkavuga nti @: "@ ese abikorera hehe ?
in fact , how can i start it or who can help me ? @" ||| ahubwo se nbihera he nkanjyae ... ninde se ubinfashamo ? @"
i would not understand it . ||| nkabona simbyumva .
therefore , i died of sorrows . ||| noneho nicwa n' ikintu kaitwa agahinda . nkareba kukora ibyo byose ,
i would imagine all the work i do without any appreciation ... well , she would leave her food , but at least say ‘ thank you ’ or ‘ do n't worry ’ or say anything in a nice manner . ||| nrangije kubikora nta kintu na kimwe ampembye , nibura n' ibyo bairyo abiihorerae , ariko anbwirae ati @: "@ ukoze ,
she would tell me , "@ get out , where is the water ? ||| cyangwa se ihanganae , cyangwa ... mu mvugo nziza . akanbwira ati @: "@ sohoka .
how come things are not like this or that ... ? ||| amazi arihae ? ... ko nbona bitameze gutya ?
why do i see some weeds there ... ? @" weeds ... ? ||| ... ko nbona urwiri hariya bimeze ... @" urwiri se ... ?
i would n't understand her . ||| nkaumva ntinumva ibyo anbwira .
"@ i told you that i will never do that again . ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ nkubwiye ko ibyo ngibyo ntazaongera kubikora .
if you want you can chase me out of your house but i will never go digging or doing this or that . @" i would tell her . ||| wenda uzansohorae mu nzu yawe .
she was mistreating me but hiding it from her husband . ||| ariko ntabwo nzigera nongera kujya kuhinga ... kujya kugira kutae ... @" ibyo aribyo byose akaba yarabikoraaga abihishe umugabo .
whenever her husband would be around , she would be a good person and sometimes say , "@ hi mahoro , how are you ? ||| umugabo yaba ahari nkabona n' umuntu ubaye gentille [ umwana mwiza ] cyane akanbwira ati @:
how do you feel ? @" ||| "@ mahoro bite ... amakuru ... nonese umeze utae ? @"
i would be confused and ask myself , "@ but why ... ? @" ||| nkagirango ... simbyumve nkavuga @: "@ ariko se kubera iki ... ? @"
another time she would be hash to me . then i imagined that there must be a reason why sometimes she acts so nice to me and another time she ... i started things that i was the one with a problem . ||| undi mwanya akanshiha nkavuga nti @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose buriya hari impamvu . kuki hari igihe inbwira neza , hakaba n' igihe ... @" numva noneho ko ari jyae ufite ikibazo .
i thought it was me who would cause him to talk in a bad way . ||| ari jyewe ... mutera kuvuga nabi .
then i asked her , "@ beatrice , why do you talk to me so badly ? ||| ni uko nramubaza nti @: "@ ariko se beatrice , nti ni ukubera iki unbwira nabi ,
what did i do ? ||| ni ukubera iki ... nkoze iki ? @"
"@ it seems like you do things you do n't want to do forgetting that you depend on me . @" ||| akanbwira ngo @: "@ nbona ukora ngo ibintu utashaka , kandi ntumenye ko nkutunze . @"
immediately i told her that , "@ that has got nothing to do with it . @" ||| mpita mubwira nti @: "@ aah ! nti @: ibyongibyo ntaho bihuraiye .
i was open and told her , "@ you know my home , you know how things used to be . ||| mpita mwerurira nramubwira nti @: iwacu mu rugo urahazi ... uko biri bimeze ,
i had never held a jeri can before or dug . ||| jyae ntabwo nri nzi kuigera nfata ijerikani , nta n' ubwo nri nzi kuigera nfata isuka ngo mpinge .
but even though i did , you can teach me . ||| kandi naho nbikora ,
mean while talking to me well is enough . ||| wabinyigisha nkabikora .
not coming to me and begin ordering ; do this or that and when i finish you do n't give me something to eat . ||| nti @: ariko hagati ahongaho kubikora nawe ukagira ... naho unbwira neza kusa . ukajya ureka kuza umpatiriza unbwira kora ibingibi , kandi nrangiza ntiunangaburirae ngize kutae ... nramubwira nti @:
well it is okay . @" ||| sawa , nti @: ntacyo . @"
i tolerated it in those days because some days she would talk to me well that was if her husband was around . ||| nrabiihanganair muri iyo minsi , kubera ukuntu nbonaaga anbwira neza rimwe na rimwe , umugabo ahari ,
whenever we would go to dig together with her husband , she would say to me ; "@ mahoro sit a bit and look after the baby . ||| undi munsi tuba tujyanye n' umugabo kuhinga akanbwira ati @: "@ mahoro ba wicaye hariya urebae umwana ,
do n't do anything else . @" ||| ibindi ubiihorerae . @"
but whenever the husband would be absent ... i do n't know what he used to do somewhere he would go and come back after a couple of days . she would time when the husband would be away and then torture me horribly . ||| noneho umugabo yaba atahari ... [ ntinzi ibintu yajyaaga ajya kukora akaza hashize iminsi ] . yabona umugabo atahari noneho nkasigara natesetse bimwe biteye ubwoba .
then i told her that , "@ i will be fetching water one with a jeri can . ||| noneho nramubwira nti @: "@ rero , nzajya njya kuvoma kugira ntasubirayo ,
at whatever time vi will be coming back , that will be it . ||| ntwarae ijerikani . igihe cyose nzajya nzira nzajya nza .
but i will be bringing a jeri can of water here . ||| ariko nzanae ijerikani imwe igihe nzayiturair njyae nyishyira ahangaha ;
about digging , at least you will be digging and i will be weeding . @" ||| kuhinga basi ujyae ugenda uhingae ibyatsi nbikuraemo , kuko njyewe ntabyo nshobora birananiye pe . @"
i had totally failed to learn dig ; i would aim higher but still the hoe would n't penetrate deeper . ||| nrazamuraaga isuka ntigerae hasi .
therefore , she told me that , "@ i have agreed with you on that . @" ||| nuko arangije aranbwira ngo @: "@ ibyo ngibyo ngo nrabiemeye . @"
when she realized that i was getting used , she asked me to be using a big jeri can . ||| yumva nyine ko ngiye kutangira , maze kumenyera , ngo nzajya ntwara ijerikani .
well that was okay with me ; taking a jeri can only ... i would take it , but there was pipe in place where i used to fetch water . ||| ariko njyewe kutwara ijerikani nta kinri . nrayitwaraaga nkagenda ... aho hantu nvomaaga ni ahantu hari itiyo ,
it was between gardens on a hill that one would see people digging . ||| iri hagati gutya mu mirima , ariko ari ahantu ubona ku gasozi bari kuhinga .
though they never hurt me , they would look at me strangely . ||| ariko nkabona abantu n' abanyuzeho n' ubwo nta kintu banbwiraaga ariko nkabona baranreba nabi .
then i would imagine , "@ these people may betray me ; they may go and tell the other killers that they saw a child who looked like this or that . @" ||| nkavuga nti @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose bariya bantu nibo bari busubirae inyuma bagendae babwirae babanri banri , bababwirae bati @: ‘ hariya hantu tuhabonye umwana umeze gutya ,
i thought they would go and say to them , "@ it is our first time to see her in this area though she must be living around . however we do n't know where she lives . @" ||| nibwo bwa mbere tumubonye hariya muri iriya quartier [ kariya kacae ] afite ahantu yavuye nta nubwo tuzi n' ahantu ataha . ’ @"
therefore , i allowed to be going to the garden . ||| noneho nkamwemerera kuzajya ngenda nkajya mu muraima ,
but whenever they would come , i would bend in the ... i would remove the grass from the garden . ||| nbona baje , nkaunama mu ntuze ... nkatondora ibyatsi nkabikuramo .
and if they found me at the stream , i would bend in the water pretending to be busy fetching water . ||| baza ndi kuvoma nkaunama mu mugezi nkavoma ,
and after they would leave , i would also stop . ||| bamara kurenga nkarekera aho .
and later i would go home . ||| basi birarangira ... nkataha . noneho umugabo we ... ubwo nratahaaga nimugoroba umugabo we yaba ari ahongaho ari mu rugo , nkataha nkaumva ndi umwana .
i would go home in the evening and whenever her husband would be at home , i would feel like am a child too ; we would chat and he would calm me , "@ you have to be strong , if your father and the rest of your family died . ||| tukaganira , akaambaza , "@ ... noneho ihanganae ...

he was called damien then i told hiim that , "@ it was impossible . @" ||| "@ ntabwo bishoboka . @" nrabimubwiye . nramubwira nti @: "@ ntabwo bishoboka ,
i told him ; "@ how can we live together ? ||| tubana kutae ?
i can not manage waking up in the morning and go for water then go digging yet i do n't know how to dig . ||| ntabwo nbasha kujya nza ngo njyae nbyuka ngo njyae kuvoma , nindangiza njyae kuhinga .
and in case i do n't do it , i do n't eat . and if i do it i will injure myself because i do n't know how to dig . @" ||| ntabyo nzi . nti @: kandi nintabikora ntinzarya . ubu se kandi nimbikora na none nzavunika kandi ntabizi . @"
then the man asked me ; "@ do n't you eat ? @" ||| umugabo aranbwira ati @: "@ none se ntujya urya ? @"
"@ me ? ||| nramubwira nti @:
never ! ||| "@ ngewe reka da !
i eat rarely only after i did that work . i did n't dig to her desire , then i do n't eat . @" i replied him . ||| nti @: nrya rimwe na rimwe ari uko nkoze . niba ntahinze ngo abonae ko nhinze ntabwo ngomba kurya . @"
i did n't feel like doing it . ||| nkaumva eh , ntibinrimo .
but i had started walking in the road and it seemed to be safe . ||| ariko ubwo nri ntangiye kujya ngendagenda , nkabona mu nzira ... nta kibazo . nta bantu nbonaaga ... noneho nkaba ngenda mu muhanda ,
i would not see people even if i walked for the whole hour . ||| nubwo ngenda nk' isaha yose , nta muntu nri nbona ,
but as i would be walking , i was very desperate and i did n't care if someone decided to kill me . ||| ariko nkaumva ndi kugenda . nkaumva ari hahanri maze kwiharurukwa wenda noneho nzapfae n' uzanyica bizagendae uko bikagenze ,
but i would imagine the other death of working for someone who does n't appreciate and it would go beyond my imagination . ||| ariko ntabwo ibyo kupfa ruriya rupfu ... eh , nrabikururaaga nkaumva biranrenze . kukorera umuntu noneho ntanakushimae .
i told him openly . ||| ndabimwerurira nrabimubwira .
then he said to me that , "@ do n't worry , i am going to ask her and find out how the situation is . ||| noneho aranbwira ati @: "@ noneho wowe humura , buretse ngiye kumubaza numvae uko bimeze ,
she supposed to handle you like rose ... @" [ his daughter ] "@ you should be going to fetch water together , if it is time to dig , you should go and dig together . ||| agomba kujya akufata nka ba rose [ abo ni abana be ] , mukajya mujyana kuvoma . niba ugiye kuhinga mujyanae ,
you should everything together . because in september if they go to school you will also go . @" ||| byose ... kuko ejo bunri mu kwa cyenda nibajya kuiga nawe uzajya kuiga .
to me that sounded impossible , "@ going to school ! @" ||| umh ... , ibyo rero nkaumva n' ibintu bitashoboka kuri njyewe kuiga ?
when was that ? ||| ubwo hari mu kwa kangahe ?
it was in the late june ... in fact the month of june had ended , it was in july . ||| hari nko mu kwa gatandatu kushira ... kunza ukwa gatandatu kuri kurangiye hari nko mu kwa karindwi .
because i would hear people saying that , "@ there has remained one month or one and half month for students to begin studies . @" ||| kuko numvaaga bavuga ko hasigaye ukwezi kumwe , cyangwa ukwezi n' igice ngo abana batangirae .
only a month ? ||| ... ukwezi ?
no . ||| oya .
i would imagine it but i could n't figure it out . ||| nkabikurura nkaumva simbyumva .
"@ how can i go to school ? @" ||| ‘ ubusae nzajya ku ishuri ntae ?
everything i would first think about it in advance . before , whenever we were going to begin school , everything would be new at home . ||| ’ ikintu cyose nhitaaga ntekereza mbere . mbere iyo tujyaaga kutangira ... mbese byose bibaga ari bishya mu rugo .
"@ so , what about now ? ||| naho ubu ... ubu se nzajya kutangira ,
will i start studying and in the evening go to dig ... ? @" ||| ninjya nza njyae mu muraima ... ?
i would ask myself but i could n't understand it . ||| nkaumva simbyumva .
i never used to think about such life or believe in it . ||| ubwo buzima ntabwo njyaaga nbutekereza ,
he told and i chilled because he had told me good news . at least he was sympathetic with me , so it was fine . ||| ngo nbukururae mbwumve . nuko umugabo arabinbwira , ntaceceka kuko numvaaga anbwiye neza , nkaumva ko ibyo aribyo byose ,
he used to make me work but at least somehow i see that he would sympathize with me due to the agony that i was baring within me . ||| ni umuntu mwiza ... ntacyo . nubwo yabaga yankoresha , ariko ukabona ko amfitiye impuhwe . bitewe n' agahinda njyewe nbaga nifitiye mu mutaima wanjye ,
but it was okay . ||| nkaumva nta kibazo .
therefore , "@ i told him that it was fine . @" ||| nuko umugabo arabinbwira nramubwira nti @: "@ nta kibazo . @"
he spent some long time at home ; he spent about a whole month at home . ||| noneho amara igihe kinini ahari . yamaze nk' ukwezi kose ahari .
then said that , "@ you all have to go together for water and come back together . @" ||| nibwo yanbwiye ati @: "@ wowe mugomba kujya mujyana n' abandi bana , mukajyana kuvoma mukavayo mukaza ... @" tukajyana nibyo ,
we would go in the morning ; if it meant early morning , we would all wake up and the wife was there . but we were not on good terms with the wife . ||| mu gitondo niba tuzindutse nibyo tuesae tukajyana . umugore ahari ... [ ariko ubwo umugore ntabwo turi tukivugana ] .
if it were digging we would all go . ||| nuko , tukavayo . niba ari ukujya kuhinga ,
they would dig because they knew how to dig . ||| tukajyana bakahinga bo bari babimenyereye ,
as for me , i would pick up all the grass and later , we would sit and chat up to mid @-@ day then we would go back home . she would stay at home preparing some food . ||| nnjyae ngatotora ibyatsi tukacara tukaganira saa sita tukataha .
and he would say , "@ you all have to sit here and share with no quarrels . @" ||| ubwo nyina yasigaye atetse , ise akavuga ati @: "@ muesae mugomba kuicara hano mukasangira nta kibazo ... @"
then he ... during that time i would n't see any problem ; people would move freely . people would come and we talk , i mean people who would come to visit that family . ||| noneho umugabo ... ariko icyo kihae nri maze kubona nta kibazo , abantu bakagenda mu nzira , nkabona abantu baraje tukaicara tukaganira yenda baje nko kusura abongabo ,
they would not talk about anything like war stories . ||| nta kibazo numva nta kintu kaerekeraanye n' intambara bavuga .
therefore , i started getting a feeling that the war stopped . ||| ntangira kaumva nyine ko noneho intambara ishobora kuba yararangiye .
i felt like i should stop hiding myself . ||| nkaumva ntinkigomba kugenda nihisha cyane .
people had started cutting the sorghum . ||| amasaka bari batangiye ... bamaze kugira ... kutema ,
therefore i said , "@ since they have cut this place , there is no other place remaining . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ nta n' ahandi .
i will be walking in the open and if they are to kill me they should kill me . @" ||| noneho n' ukujya ngenda ku mugaragaro nibashaka bazanyicae ... @"
so ... a month before students went back to school , damien travailed . ||| nuko . eeh ... , ubwo habura nk' ukwezi ngo abana batangirae nibwo umugabo yongeye kufata urugendo .
he used to go up country ; i do n't know what he used to do there . ||| yajyaaga hakurya iyo nyine mu misozi ahantu yajyaaga agenda ntinzi ibyo yakoraagayo ,
therefore , i said , "@ since he has left , i am going to die . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose aragiye , noneho ngiye kupfa .
i am going to die a horrible death . @" ||| ngiye kupfa rwa rundi ariko . @"
so i decided not to stay in that home . ||| nibwo nvugaaga nti @: "@ ntabwo nzaguma hano .
"@ i would better go @" i decided . ||| reka nfatae inzira ngendae . @"
it was supposed to be a journey from gitesi to mabanza in some place in rubengera at the other man 's place . ||| ruri urugendo kuturuka ahongaho i gitesi uza hano muri mabanza , ahantu turi ahongaho i rubaengair kuri uwo mugabo ,
[ the place where i lived at first ] . ||| uwunri nbagaho mbere .
it was a long journey about three or four kilometers on a road . ||| hari urugendo rurerure hari nk' ibirometero nka bitatu cyangwa bine . kandi ari umuhanda .
then i said , "@ let me show you ; i am going to leave gitesi and go to rubengera . ||| nravuga nti @: "@ reka nzae nkuerekae . ngiye kuzaturuka hano i gitesi , ngendae nsubirae hariya i rubaengair ,
i will go back to the other home and if i reach there before anyone tries to kill me , that will mean that i will never die . @" ||| nsubirae kwa babanri , ningerayo mu nzira nta muntu uri unyica , nzamenya ko ntakipfuye . @"
because i was supposed to go through the other road where i used to pass hiding . ||| kuko ni umuhanda noneho ndi kugendamo , kandi mbere niwo ngendaagamo nikinga .
so i started my journey . she had sent me to go digging . ||| nfata inzira nragenda ... ubwo yari antumye ... yari anbwiye ngo ninjye kuhinga ,
therefore , i went with children and when we had reached some where , she called them saying that , i must stay there alone . ||| tumanukaan n' abandi bana tugeze hepfo arabahamagara ngo nibaze ngo ngomba kuhasigara njyewe .
"@ really ! ||| ‘ eh !
i stay in the other garden alone ? ||| kweri ? njyewe nsigarae muri uriya muraima jyenyine ?
why does n't she do the same things when her husband is around ? ||| kubera iki iyo umugabo we ahari atabikora ?
" i wondered . immediately i took back the hoe and gave it to the kids and i told them that i have left . ||| ’ mpita nzamura isuka nyihereza abana , nti @:
"@ where are you going mahoro ? ||| "@ njyewe nragiye . @" "@ ... none se ugiye hehe mahoro ... [ bajyaaga banyita mahoro ] ... garuka ,
came back we show you . @" ||| garuka tukuerekae . @"
they said to me . ||| nti @:
[ they used to call me mahoro ] i told them that , "@ no , there is nothing to show me , i have gone and if they kill me , that will be it . ||| "@ oya ntacyo munyereka nragiye nibanyica bazanyicae .
and if they do n't kill me , we shall meet some other time . @" ||| nibatanyica ubwo tuzasubira ikindi kihae . @"
then he told me that there somebody who told him that she is alive . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ nyamara hari umuntu unbwiye ko ariho . @" noneho binbera ikibazo . nravuga nti @:
so it became another problem and i said , "@ think person is a killer , he is the one who will kill he ; he who is mocking me saying such things . ||| "@ uyu muntu ibyo aribyo byose n' umwicanyi wanjye . uyunguyu niwe nzagwaho . umuntu uza kunshinyagurair anbwira ibingibi .
other people would tell how people died , "@ it is over all people died , you have to be strong though you survived alone . @" ||| kandi abandi bose babaga banbwira ukuntu abantu barapfuye ‘ ... birarangiye , nta muntu n' umwe usigaye , wihangane kuba usigaye wenyine .
but how could he come saying that so and so is still alive yet i was very sure they died ? ||| ’ ariko we araza akanbwira ngo @: kanaka ariho , kandi nzi neza ko yapfuye ?
then i told him that , "@ never tell me that anymore . @" ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ ntabyo nshaka ko uzaongera kunbwira . @"
then he left , he was a neighbor to that family . time passed before he came back to tell me about it . ||| aragenda yari umuturanyi w' aho ngaho . ibyo biratinda biribagiraan , hashize nk' iminsi atongera kugaruka kubinbwira .
in july ... i remember it was in the late july , i had n't known that my sister was alive . ||| mu kwa karindwi ... nrabiibuka hari mu mpera z' ukwa karindwi icyo kihae . nri ntaramenya ko murumuna wanjye ariho ,
we had separated in the 10th of april 1994 , that time we saw a group of attackers . ||| turi turatandukanye nyine ku itariki icumi z' ukwezi kwa kane [ 10 /04 /1994 ] .
the time she decided to go to them so that they should kill her moving rather than dying sat . ||| ubwo nyine icyo kihae tubonaaga igitero we akaemera kukihuramo wenda bamwice agenda , ariko ntapfaire ahongaho .
i stayed there in that family and there was no problem i would get out by then . ||| ntahaba ahongaho muri urwo rugo , nta kibazo noneho nsohoka ,
i would go at the road and come back safe . ||| ngenda ku muhanda , nta kibazo nkagaruka .
i would see children from that family but i would n't see any of the people i used to know . ||| nkabona abana b' ahongaho , ariko nkabona abantu bose nri nzi nta muntu n' umwe nbona .
so it became a problem to me . ||| noneho nabyo binbera ikibazo .
so i asked myself , what is all about such life ? i would try to see the future but i would just go beyond my understanding . ||| nravuga nti ariko se ubu ... ubu buzima nkareba inberae hariya nkabona biranrenze n' ibintu binri kure . nkavuga nti @:
therefore i decide to stay there . the old lady told me that i wait in september i would go to school . ||| "@ sawa noneho ubungubu reka nicarae ahangaha ... umukecuru aranbwira ati @: "@ wowe ejo bunri mu kwa cyenda uzajya kuiga . @"
but i would not believe it ; "@ i will go to school ? @" ||| "@ ... nzajya kuiga ? @"
but still i would remember that at home , my father used to like children who liked studying . ||| ariko nkaumva na none ... kubera ko iwacu papa yakundaaga abana baiga cyane ,
and indeed we liked studying . ||| kandi ntawe turabikundaaga kuiga .
both my father and mother were teachers . ||| yari umwarimu na mama yari umwarimu .
therefore they would say that , "@ you must study ... you shall study till when ... @" and we were many kids at home . ||| noneho bakajya bavuga bati @: ‘ mugomba kuiga ... mugomba kuiga mpaka ... @" noneho , turi n' abana benshi gutyo ,
mum would tell us that , "@ all of you must study ; you will go secondary schools and complete university . ||| mama we akajya atubwira ati @: "@ mugo ... muesae muzaiga , muigae secondaire , muigae universite murangizae ,
even though we miss salt at home , you will go school . @" ||| wenda mu rugo ... eh , n' umunyu uzaburae . ariko mugomba kuiga . @"
and surely i wanted to study and go secondary schools ... and reach university . ||| ariko nnjyae nkaumva ntashaka kuiga nkagera muri secondaire ... nkagera muri universite .
therefore , i would think , "@ where will be living while i am studying ? ||| nkatekereza "@ ... ariko se ibi byose nzaiga ndi he ?
whom will i be with ? @" ||| ndi nande ? @"
so i would not understand it . ||| noneho nkaumva simbyumva ,
i would go through all those things . ||| nkaumva ni ibintu binrenze nkabiikuramo .
then i told her , "@ it is okay i will go to school . @" ||| noneho nramubwira nti @: "@ ntacyo nzagenda njyae kuiga . @"
i knew that i would go to school and maybe meet other people and get to know each other . ||| ariko nkaumva ko nzagenda nkaiga nrangiza kuiga , ibya aribyo byose ntinzabura abandi bantu tuzagenda tumenyaan .
i would say that , if i am the only one who survived in rubengera there must be another one who survived from mushubati . ||| yenda niba nrarokotse hano muri rubaengair ndi jyenyine , ntihazabura undi warokokeye i mushubati ,
"@ there can not miss someone who survived in other areas like kibirizi or somewhere else . @" i would say . ||| ntihazabura undi warokokeye iyo za kibirizi ,
"@ even though it would be one person but there is no logic in remaining sat at home . i must study , it is a brilliant idea . @" ||| ntihazabura undi warokokeye ahandi hantu . wenda tuzabonaane n' aho yaba ari umwe umwe ariko nta mpamvu yo kuicara mu rugo gutya kusa . "@ ngomba kuiga ... nibyo . @"
and i would immediately think , if i reach in school ... before we used to reach school and as we would be entering [ it bothered me too ] we used to enter in school and they would call upon the tutsi , we would stand up when we are about three . ||| ariko nkahita ntekereza na none ningera mu ishuri , ko tujyaaga tuinjira mu ishuri ... [ biza kunbera ikibazo ] ... ko tujyaaga tuinjira mu ishuri , bakajya batuhamagara turi abatutsi tukaza turi batanu ,
in the following class we would be ten but now they will call and it will be only me . ||| nkuimuka tukasanga turi icumi . noneho bazajya bahamagara basangae ndi jyenyine ,
and so they will start saying that , "@ we study with only one tusti . @" ||| noneho basubirae n' inyuma bavugae bati @: "@ burya tusigaye tuigana n' umututsi umwe . @"
so it would bother me but i would try to avoid such thoughts because it was the only life i had to lead . ||| nnjyae bikanbera ikibazo . nbiikuramo ariko kuko numvaaga nta bunri buzima ,
i knew my life was school life . ||| numvaaga ko ubuzima bwanjye ari ukuiga ,
i had to complete primary school and pass it well so that i would get a school where i would live always . ||| ngomba kuiga nkarangiza primaire , noneho ... kandi nkazayitsinda , noneho nkajya kuiga mu kigo nzabamo noneho .
and i would stop living in outside families . ||| noneho ntari kuba mu ma famille [ imiryango ] aya yo hanze gutya .
i would go to a school where i would stay and live with people i never knew . ||| nkazajya kuiga mu kigo nzabamo , ahantu nzaba , tuzaba tuhuraiye turi abantu benshi kandi tutaziraanye .
i started aiming at that goal and i felt like it was the best one . ||| nishyiramo iyo ntego numva ko ariyo ngiyo ari yo kweli .
i went to school . ||| nragenda njya ku ishuri .
eh ! ||| eh !
at break time they would make fun of me . ||| bigera saa yine muri recreation [ umwanya wo kukina ] bakamvugiriza induru .
even those we used to talk together , they would avoid me ; they would behave to me as if i was a stranger . ||| nabo tujyaaga tuganira ... bose , nkabona bose barimo baranyitaza ... barimo baranyikanga .
was that in september when the genocide had stopped ? ||| ubwo ni mu kwa cyenda , jenoside yararangiye ?
it was after the genocide . ||| jenoside yararangiye .
but still moving ... unless i was going to school with other students ... that time people were still hiding ; no one would move out yet these ends things had settled without any problem . ||| ariko nabwo kugenda usibye kugenda ngiye ku ishuri , ndi kumwe n' abandi ... icyo abantu benshi bari bakihisha nta uri ukipfa kusohoka ngo ugendae , mu kihae ino ahangaha ho biri birarangiye nta kibazo .
us we were still hiding . ||| twebwe uri ukihisha da .
whenever i would not be able to get people to go with or come with , i would find a way of coming back in the dark at night . ||| n' ubwo iyo ntabonaaga abantu tujyana ngo tubonae n' abo tutahana nshakaaga ukuntu ndi butahae ninjoro hatabona .
you were still living in that family ? ||| ukiba muri iyo famille [ umuryango ] nyine ?
i had never had of them ; not a small thing ... never . not even a thought . ||| nta nubwo nzaumvaaga habae no kaumva ngo iki ... reka da . nta n' agatekerezo .
maybe they had reached but never came to the village . maybe they were all around in town . i never though or had about them . ||| ibyo ari byo byose wenda bari baranahageze ariko yenda mu kituragae ntibahagerae bakaba bari nk' aho ngaho gutyo mu mugi ... nta n' agatekerezo kuko ntinumvaaga ... nta n' ubwo nzaumvaaga .
even those we lived together i can not say that they knew about them . ||| n' abo tubanaaga ntinkubwira ngo @: nabo bari bazizi .
because they used to here that inkotanyi were n't people , that they were animals , which had big ears with tails . ||| kuko ngo baumvaaga ngo ari abantu ... ngo ari ibikoko bifite amatwi ,
they never knew they were people . ||| bifite imirizo ... ntabwo baumvaaga ko ari abantu .
by the way , there is a time they ... when they reached at some place called ku giti kinini ; that is where there is a center in rubengera next to the commune . ||| noneho ... ahubwo hari igihe zaigeze ... zimaze kugera ahongaho baita ku giti kinini , ni ahantu hari aga centre hariya i rubaengair hafi ya commune .
they used to say that they saw the inkotanyi ... that they saw an inkontanyi 's car passing . ||| bavugaaga ngo babonye ngo inkotanyi ... imodoka y' inkotanyi ngo ihise .
therefore , they would say that , "@ we saw them with big ears with ... @" umh , generally i would think they were animals . ||| bati @: "@ tuzibonye zifite amatwi zifite ... @" umh , mbega nkaumva ko ari ibikoko .
i did n't know anything but i would wonder the kind of death i was going to die and i would not understand it . ||| njyewe nta na kimwe nri nzi . nuko nravuga nti @: "@ basi nti noneho ngiye kupfa noneho urumeze rutae ? @"
i never thought that the inkotanyi would come for the rescue of those who servived . ||| nkaumva zirwumva . kuko kaumva ko ari inkotanyi zizaza , zikaza zikatabara nk' abantu basigaye ,
it never crossed my mind . ||| nta kintu na kimwe nbitekerezaagaho .
on the first day i went to school but i would see fellow students avoiding me . ||| ubwo nnjyae ngiye ku ishuri ku munsi wa mbere , nkabona abana barimo baranyishisha ,
during break time , i would see some passing by me and talking about me . ||| muri recreation [ igihe cyo kukina ] nkabona bamwe baranyura aha barimo baranvuga ,
i would try to talk to one but things would not work . ||| ngira uwo nvugaish wapi .
they all looked afraid of talking to me . ||| nkabona bose bafite ubwoba ntibashaka no kunvugaish .
so i would sit alone at aside . ||| noneho nkaicara njyenyine hariya .
the teacher would ask me , "@ why are you sitting alone ? ||| umwarimu yaza akaambaza ati @: "@ mbese ko wicaye wenyine ,
what are you doing ... what are you thinking about ? ||| uri mu biki ... uratekereza iki ?
come and play with other kids . @" ||| tuza , ngwino ukinae n' abandi bana . @"
and i would say , "@ no i do n't want . @" ||| nti @: "@ oya ntabwo nbishaka . @"
sometimes i would go back home at around 10:00 . ||| nhitaaga ntaha ubundi saa yine .
break time would reach and then other students would get into groups then i would remain alone . therefore , after a small time i would go home . ||| ziragera nkabona abandi barimo baravugana utugroupe ... utu groupe [ udutsiko ] nkabona nsigaye njyenyine , nkaicara nk' iminota ingahe ubundi nkahita nfata inzira nkataha .
then during that time there came ... there was a certain lady we were neighbors . she was selling clothes ; she would come these ends of nyabugogo to buy clothes on wholesale and sell them in kibuye . ||| noneho muri icyo kihae haza kuza ... hari umugore turi tuturanye yacuruzaaga imyenda akaza kurangura ino aha ... nyabugogo akajya kuyicuruza ku kibuye .
my aunt lived in muhima and sometimes she would come ... and they knew each other . ||| noneho hari umutante [ masenge ] nawe yarazaaga ... we yabaga hano ku muhaima , bakaba bari baziraanye .
so one time they met from nyabugogo . ||| noneho baza kukubitanair nyabugogo .
that lady who used to buy clothes from nyabugogo knew that my sister survived . ||| noneho uwo mu mama uzaaga kurangura akaba yari aziko uwo murumuna wanjye ariho .
my sister was living in some home where she had gone ... she met some people who were at the stream harvesting sweet potatoes . ||| murumuna wanjye we ahantu yabaga ni ahantu yagiye ... yaragiye ahura n' abantu mu ntuze ... mu ... bari ku mugezi barimo bakura ibijumba ,
that woman was a tutsi ... she took her home and my sister told her all about her . ||| uwo mugorae yari umututsi . aramutwara ... amutwara iwe amutekerereza ibye aramutwara ,
then that lady hid my sister in the house but her husband was not aware . ||| aragenda amubika mu nzu . umugabo atabizi .
until september that is when we met . ||| kurinda mu kwezi kwa cyenda kugera ,
as she got out we immediately saw each other . ||| nibwo tubonaanye . yasohotse tubonaan njyewe .
but her husband never knew about it . ||| ariko umugabo atabizi .
it was a very big house and therefore , she hid her somewhere in the house and warned her elder children that , "@ nobody should ever open this room . @" ||| yari inzu nini aragenda amushyira ahantu , abwira abana bakuru ati @: "@ kiriya cyumba ntimuzigerae mukifungura . @" abari bakuru .
and even her husband would never come to the room ; he used to go and come back deep in the night . ||| n' umugabo we ntiyajyaaga ahagera yaragendaaga akiyizira ninjoro , akaza yiryamair . umwana akakarabairmo ,
he would come going to bed directly . ||| bakamugaburiramo , noneho bigera nijoro akiryamair nk' uko n' abandi ... kuko umugabo yabaga atahari .
whenever she would want to go to the toilets , that woman would send the kids somewhere and obviously the man would n't be around . therefore , she would go to the toilets and then come in quickly . ||| yakenera kusohoka agiye hanze nko kuri toilette [ ku musaraane ] abana batoya nyina akabaohereza ahantu ... akabatuma .
she stayed in the house all the time . ||| akasohoka akagaruka akiberamo .
no other person knew that my sister was in their house except her elder son and daughter plus her . ||| nta wunri muntu usibye we , n' umuhungu we , n' umukobwa we mukuru kusa ,
only the elder children . ||| bari bakuru .
they were the only ones who knew that there was some one in their house . ||| nibo bonyine bari bazi ko uwo muntu arimo .
even the husband did n't know . ||| n' umugabo ntabyo azi .
but the other woman , who used to purchase clothes for sale , knew about it because she was the one who referred my sister to go and look for gatabazi 's wife wherever she was and she was also a tutsi . ||| ariko uwo mukecuru ... uwo mugorae uzaaga kurangura imyenda we akaba yari abizi . kuko ariwe umurangiye aramubwira ngo @: "@ ngendae arebae umugore wa katabazi hari ahantu ari hariya , kandi nawe ni umututsi agendae amubwirae ikibazo cye ,
"@ go and tell her your problems maybe she may give you shelter . @" she recommended my sister . ||| wenda aramujyana bamucumbikirae .
therefore , that is how she came to know about it . ||| abimenya gutyo .
she was the one who sent a message at munyagishari 's where i was living saying that , "@ there is a gahizi 's child in gatabazi 's home in gihari . ||| noneho aza kutuma ahongaho kwa munyagishari aho nri ndi . ati @: "@ nyamara ati @: hari umwana wo kwa kahaizi uba kwa katabazi hariya i kihara .
the one that resembled her father , big in size and dark . ||| ati @: wa wunri usaga na se ubyibushye wirabura .
i wonder her elder sister is maybe she died . @" ||| ati @: mukuru ntinzi ahantu ari , ibyo ari byo byose we umenya yarapfuye . @"
and , by coincidence i was alive . ||| noneho bikubitaan n' uko nnjyae nri mpari .
then i told them that "@ sara is telling lies ... she is lying ... she is lying . @" ||| nrababwira nti @: "@ sara rwose arabeshya ... arabeshya ... arabeshya . @" nuko arabibabwira aravuga ati @: "@ kandi nrabizi neza ko ahari .
but she said , "@ i am very sure she is alive and in fact i will go to visit her tomorrow . ||| ati @: ejo nzajya kumusura , ati @:
and if i see her i will come to confirm to you . @" ||| nindamuka mubonye ... tubonaanye nkamenye neza ko ahari , nyaza kubikubwira . @"
she left and the following morning she came to tell me . ||| aragenda bukeye agaruka kubinbwira ,
"@ do n't worry , she is alive . @" she said to me . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ rwose arahari ntugirae ikibazo . @"
umh , "@ is that possimble ? ||| umh , ibyo se bibaho ?
you should come and take me there . @" i told her . ||| nti uzazae unjyanae yo .
the following day she came back and took me . ||| bukeye aragaruka , araza arantwara ,
we crossed some river called ntaruko . the other side of the river was gihara sector and when we reached there , i saw her . ||| turaambuka hari umugezi tuambukaaga baita ntaruko ukaambuka ujya hakurya mu yinri secteur ya kihara . turagenda tugezeyo nbona nramubonye .
it was like a dream ; i can n't say that we greated each others , neither did we ask each others about what we went through . ||| bibaye ... ni nk' inzozi . ntinkubwira ngo twarasuhuzanyije , nta n' igihe cyo kubazanya amakuru ,
we were simply crying by looking at each others . ||| umwe wese yarebaaga undi akarira , undi yareba undi akarira .
i would look at her and ask myself , "@ is she the one or it is her ghost ? ||| nmukubita amaso ... umh ... , ubundi nkahita ntekereza ‘ ubu se niwe ? cyangwa n' umuzimu we ?
someone who was bitten by dogs ? ||| umuntu imbwa zariye ,
someone i saw landing in the attackers group and being taken by the attackers ? ||| tutandukanye nkabibona njyewe yinjiye mu gitero , nkabona arakomeje nabo barakomeje barajyaniranye ,
someone i heard stories of her death , how can she be alive ? @" ||| nyuma y' aho nkakomeza kaumva amajwi y' ukuntu yapfuye , ubu se yaba ariho mu buhae buryo ? @"
it was unbelievable though we were face to face . it was like a movie that lasts too long ... yet nobody was talking ... we were talking within our thoughts . ||| numva nabyo simbyumva , kandi turimo turebaan gutya . bibaye nka filime yamaze umwanya ariko ... nta muntu n' umwe uvuga ... mu bitekerezo kusa .
it was beyond my imagination and so i got confused . ||| nuko numva biranrenze , numva biranyobeye .
but because she did n't want the head of the family to know about it ( the husband of the lady who saved her ) and the same lady who used to purchase clothes for sale , had already known that our aunties were alive . ||| noneho kuko atashakaaga ko umugabo ahita abimenya , kandi uwo mugorae uzaaga kurangura imyenda we yari yaramaze kumenya neza yuko aba bata ... abatante bariho .
they were two aunts and they were living these ends . ||| abatante babiri babaga ino ahangaha .
therefore , she told them that , "@ keep hiding her , if i get their aunties i will tell them and they will come for them . ||| arababwira ati @: "@ noneho mukomezae mumuhishe abatante be nitumara kubonaan nkababwira ko bariho , bazaza babatwarae .
but continue hiding it from your husband so that you do n't get conflicts together at the last moment . ||| ariko umugabo atazi ko umwana arimo ,
he may even decide to chase her yet she has no where to go . @" ||| mutahita mubipfa , akanamusohora kandi ntaho ari bujyae . @"
then she came and i immediately went home . ||| nibwo yaje rero , nnjyae mpita ntaha ... ubwo umugabo yari aje mpita ntaha ,
the man had come back so i went back in gacaca where i lived . ||| ngaruka ahongaho mu gacaca aho nbaga ,
and , that woman too left . ||| ubwo umugore nawe aragenda .
and when she came to purchase clothes , she met our aunties and then she told them ; "@ do you know that your two kids survived ... ? @" ||| noneho aje kurangura baza kukubitaan . baje kukubitaan n' abo batantae arababwira ati @: "@ muzi ko hari abana banyu ,
but thought it was impossible ; "@ is there anyone who survived in kibuye ... ? @" ||| basigaye babiri ... @" nabo bakaumva n' ibintu bitashoboka "@ ... ku kibuye hasigaye umuntu ... ? @"
to them it sounded unusual . ||| bakaumva ko ari ibintu bitasanzwe .
but she convinced them , "@ it is true at kibuye some people survived . ||| aravuga ati @: "@ ku kibuye nyamara barasigaye .
they never went to the stadium ; they just hid in the neighbor 's homes ... and today they are alive . @" ||| bo ntabwo bagiye muri stade bihishe mu baturagae gutyo ... none bariho . @"
but they never agreed with her . ||| baanga kubiemera bo .
therefore , she told them that they should sometime come with her and see where we lived . ||| arababwira ati @: "@ noneho muzazae njyewe njyae kubaereka ahantu bari . arababwira ati @:
she told them that one lives at gatabazi and another one lives at munyagishari 's home . ||| umwe ari kwa katabazi , undi ari kwa munyagishari . @"
munyagishari is the one we lived together and they already knew him . ||| munyagishari rero ni uwonguwo tubanaaga we bari bamuzi .
after visiting my sister i returned home and went to school . ||| ubwo bukeye nmaze kuva kumureba nragaruka mpita nsubira ku ishuri .
after two days i went to school but i would come home at 10:00 a.m. as usual . ||| hashize nk' iminsi ibiri , nsubiye ku ishuri , na none nongera kuitahair saa yine nka kwa kunri bisanzwe .
however when she told our aunties about it , they immediately boarded and came over . ||| ariko kumbi ubwo yaraje arabibabwira , nabo bahita batega baraza .
they came ; it was my aunt and the husband to my other aunt . ||| baraza uwo mu tantae n' undi mugabo wa tantae nyine umwe baraza ,
they came to gacaca they knew the place . ||| baza aho mu gacaca bari bahazi .
when they reached at home they told them that i had gone to school . ||| bahageze bati @: "@ umwana yagiye kuiga . @"
therefore , they decided to come to school yet i was on my way coming back home , because i was used to going home at break time . ||| noneho baza baje kunreba ku ishuri . nnjyae kwa kunri kuitahair muri recreation ,
there is a way you see something and become stiff ; i was walking home but even though i was walking , i was careless of what was around me . ||| usibye ... hari ukuntu ubona ikintu ukabona ubaye nk' igiti ... ubwo ntaha nigendera mu muhanda ... nbaga nibereye hanze n' ubwo ngendaaga ariko ntinbaga ntekereza ibiri aho .
i would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how i was going to lead it . ||| nitekererezaaga iby' ubuzima bwanjye bushize n' iby' ubuzima ngiyemo ,
it seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part . ||| nkaumva n' ibintu bimeze gutya ... bitateze kuzahura .
therefore , we met as i was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) . ||| kimwe kijya hariya , ikindi kijya hariya . nuko ngiye kubona nbona turakubitanye . nvuye ku ishuri saa yine ,
i used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . because i would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me . ||| ntahaaga saa yine igihe cyose kuko isaha zirageraaga nbona buri umwe wese yibereye mu bye , n' undi yibereye mu bye ,
i would talk to no body . ||| nta muntu n' umwe unyitayeho ... nta n' umwe tuvugana . basi .
so i would feel like life has stopped ... so i would finally go home . ||| nkahita numva ko ubuzima bwanjye buhagaze ... ari uko ..
as i was going home , we met next to the commune . ||| ntashye nibwo tukubitaaniye neza mu nsi ya commune .
they were coming to see me at school . ||| baje kunreba ku ishuri .
it was an extraordinary experience ; it was like similar to the time i saw my little sister after five months of not seeing each other . ||| urabiumva bibaye nk' ibindi bintu bitasanzwe . bibaye nk' uko nbonaanye na murumuna wanjye hari hashize amezi atanu tutabonaan ,
each one thought that the other one died . ||| umwe wese azi ko undi yapfuye .
therefore , i was shocked and stood like a tree . ||| mera nk' igiti nravuga @:
so i ask , "@ aunt , is it you ? are you the one i am seeing or it is somebody else ? @" she replied that was the one . "@ are you aware that doudou is alive ? @" ||| "@ ese tantae ni wowe .... ni wowe nbona cyangwa ntabwo ari wowe ? @" ati @: "@ ni jyewe . @" ... none se uziko doudou ariho ?
i asked her once again . ||| ati @:
she replied me that "@ doudou is alive and i know where she lives . @" ||| "@ doudou ariho , n' aho aba ntahazi . @"
therefore , we never reached at home where i lived , immediately i took her to gihara where doudou ( my sister ) was living . ||| ubwo ntabwo nhise ... ntabwo nigeze nkomeza ngo tugerae n' aho nri ndi , tuhise tutambikaan , mujyana aho hakurya i kihara aho doudou ari [ murumuna wanjye ] .
it was on the 1st of october in 1994 . ||| ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwa cumi , icyenda na kane [ 1 /10 /1994 ] .
generally , right from april life seemed to be a terrible struggle ? ||| mbese kuva mu kwa kane ubuzima busaga n' aho buhagaze .
from april to september life was a terrible struggle . ||| kuva mu kwa kane kugera mu kwa cyenda , ubuzima buri burahagaze .
well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ? ||| tuvugae se nko kuva igihe mwabereye kwa munyagishali , intambara isa n' aho itaururutse bwo mwabanye ubuzima nibura bubaye bwiza ?
when the war siezed ... in july , august the war was siezing ... in fact , in july the war was beginning to sieze . ||| uraumva intambara isa n' aho igabanutse , usibye ko ... ubundi yenda nvuga ko mu kwa karindwi ... ukwa munani intambara yari itangiye kaoroha , mu kwa karindwi kunza yari itangiye kaoroha .
i was living with that family as somebody who was hiding . i was living in gitesi at her daughter 's home . ||| ariko nbaga aho hantu mpaba na none nk' umuntu wihishe [ aho ngaho nbaga i gitesi ku mukobwa we ] .
and due to the way they would treat me , i mean because they hid me i continued believing that they were still hiding me . ||| noneho nkahaba ... kubera ukuntu banfataaga , banfata kubera ko bampishe nkaumva ko nyine ari kwa kunri ko bakimpishe .
i never knew that outside the situation improved . ||| simenye yuko hanze hameze neza .
even the time i left their home for munyagishari 's , i still believe i was going to hide . however , that feeling started disappearing when i started going to school . ||| noneho n' aho mpaviriye ngiye kwa munyagishari nabwo nkaumva ko ari kwa kunri . kikoze bitangiye kugabanuka ubwo nri ntangiye kujya ku ishuri .
i could go at home with out any problem , i could eat , there is nothing i was obliged to do . ||| nratahaaga mu rugo nta kibazo , nkarya ubundi nkaicara aho ngaho nta kinri kintu nbaga nkora .
i wouuld wake up the following morning and again go to school . then i would come home at 10:00 a.m. depending on how i would be abandoned . ||| ejo nkazaongera nkabyuka nkajya ku ishuri nkitahair saa yine , bitewe n' uko nbonaaga ndi jyenyine nta muntu wunri tuvugana .
how could you find your relationship with munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? how was it ? ||| abana bo kwa munyagishali bo mwari muri ... ubonaaga bakufashe kutae nyuma ya jenoside ?
after the genocide , we continued to live with that lady . ||| ubwo nyine intambara imaze kurangira urebye uwo mukobwa niwe ukomeje ... tukomeje kubaan ,
definitely her father was not happy at all because , we survived but all properties were taken from him ; the cows were gone yet he was considering them as a profit . ||| n' ubwo ubonaaga ise arakajwe n' uko turokotse kandi akaba nta kintu kihasigaye , inka ziramushizeho kandi yenda ubona ko nawe yari abifitemo inyungu ,
some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream . ||| hari n' igihe rwose yajyaaga yivumbura akavuga ati @: "@ munsohokaire ahangaha . @"
one could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper . ||| mbese nta jambo ... nta kuvuga ngo yenda ... nta kuvuga ngo yenda ngo mbe nmubwira nk' ikintu runaka , yumvaaga ko ndi uwa hariya wowe na bariya ... mbese ubona ko afite umutima mubi .
and from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him . ||| bitewe n' uko ... uko nbibonaaga ubonaaga abiteraw n' uko ibintu byose biri bishize ... inka zashize ,
the cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most . ||| kandi nawe yakagombye kuba nawe yari afitemo inyungu , nk' ukuntu yenda yari yatureze ... yari yaraturinze muri icyo kihae cyose . ariko uwo mukobwa we tubanye neza nta kibazo ,
she could remember that i need books if it was time for school . ||| niwe umenyaaga . niwe umenyaaga ngo nkeneye ikayi niba ngiye kuiga ...
do you meet often ... is there ... ? ||| ubungubu se mujya mubonaan ... hari ... ?
i have never gone back to her home . ||| iwabo ho ntabwo nri nsubirayo
since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ? ||| kuva jenoside yarangira ntiurabasha kusubirayo ?
no ! ||| oya .
is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ? ||| n' ukutabishaka cyangwa n' ubushobozi bukeya ?
it is not because i do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means . ||| si ukutabishaka kusubirayo , urebye ni ubushobozi bukeya . no kuba ntekereza ngo nongeye kutekereza kusubira ku kibuye ntabwo ari ibintu bijya binzamo . keretse habaye nk' ikintu runaka , nk' impamvu ngiye ... injyanye yo ku buryo mpita ngaruka . ariko ntabwo nri nsubirayo kujya kubasura . si uko nbanzae ... si uko batanfashe neza se yenda nk' uko nbiifuzaaga , ahubwo urebye ni ubushobozi buke .
does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ? ||| ni ukuvuga ko utarasubira rero aho mwari mutuye kuva jenoside yarangira .
since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 . ||| kuva jenoside yarangira tusubiyeyo muri 1995 .
has your property been destroyed ... ? are there only ruins left ? ... has it ... ||| ubu se iwanyu barahasenyae ... hasigaye ari amatongo ubwo se bya ...
yeah ! the doors were still having the same color . you could also see that some of the bricks were from our house . ||| yego neza uko yari iriho n' irangi niyo yafungaishije mu nzu yubatse kandi nayo yubakaishije ya matafari yagiye yegura .
let 's think back a little bit on the period during the genocide . ||| nonese cya kihae muri ge ... tusubiye mu kihae cya jenoside ,
you spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside ... can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ? ||| hari iminsi ubaye mu masaka , ubaye hanze igihe kinini . icyo kihae ubaga ... ... ugereranya wenda ukavuga uti ni nk' iminsi ingana gutya ?
the days that i spent outside ... it 's about a week . ||| nk' iminsi nvuga ngo nbaye hanze ... ntaba mu nzu ?
in fact , if the perpetrators were to come three times in a week to look for me at munyagishari 's place @- for example , if they came on monday , i would n't have to be there on tuesday and wednesday ! ||| urebye nko mu cyumweru niba baje gusaka nko muri iyo nzu kwa munyagishari , niba barazaaga kuhasaka nk' iminsi itatu . uraumva niba baje kuwa mbere ku munsi wa kabiri n' uwa gatatu ntabwo ngombaaga kuhaboneka .
otherwise , they would ... so they would n't get me whenever they would come . ||| kugirango batahita ... baragarukaaga bakaambura .
then , theyy would just come back after two days but the issue of their come back was just about cows though they would pretend that they were looking for someone . ||| noneho bakagaruka nka nyuma y' iminsi ibiri . na none baje kuirebair inka , bazibura ... ariko baje bitwaje umuntu .
everytime i would be aware of their arrival , i would gao and spend some days in the sorghumfield . ||| bakagaruka nkaumva baje , ubwo nkamara iminsi na none ntahari ndi mu masaka .
it is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield . ||| kuko ibyo aribyo byose hari igihe kiumvikana ko umaze igihe kinini cyane wibereye mu masaka .
can you tell me about the time that you were chased from munyagishari 's place ? ||| icyo kihae uri uravuye kwa munyagishali basa n' abakuirukanye noneho ...
i would just go till ... so many times , one would feel like the doors of death were locked up for him @/@ her as he @/@ she would look for dying ... the next thing was just going back home and flee again in case the perpetrators were back again and so on ... that 's how life was like . ||| nragenda nkaumva binaniye , hari aho bigeraaga ukaumva mbese urupfu ntirukushaka ukagenda urushakisha wibunza . ukahita ugenda ukasubira mu rugo na none . naho baza kukushaka bakusohora ukaongera ukasubira hahanri , ukagenda akaba ariho uba .
i mean all the time right a fter being separated from your sister ... was it like one week or ... how many weeks did you spend outside ? ||| ni ukuvuga ngo igihe ... umaze kutandukana na murumuna wawe bwo nribaza ko ari igihe kishobora kuba kigera nko ku byumweru nka bingahe uba urabayemo . nk' ibyumweru bingahe ... ?
we stayed in the sorghumfield from april to july and for me , there was no other hiding place . ||| uraumva tubaye mu masaka kuva mu kwezi kwa kane kugeza mu kwa karindwi . njyewe nvuga ko icyo kihae cyose ,
everytime i was chased from where i was living , my refuge was in the sorghumfield . there was nowhere else i could go ! ||| nta bunri bwihisho . niba nri ndi mu rugo bakansohora , nta hanri njyaaga . nhita njya mu masaka gutyo .
how was your life like before the gebnocide ? ||| none se iyo wibutse nk' ubuzima mu muryango ... iwanyu mu rugo ukuntu mwari mumeze mbere ya jenoside .
tell me a bit about the way your family . ||| unshiramo muri make ubuzima mwari mubayeho ... niba mwari mutunze inka ... ese mwabagaho mutae muri makeya ?
did you have many cows , how was your relationship to your relatives ... ? ||| uko mwasabanaga n' abavandimwe .
ten years ago , i was in the 4th class of primary education and my younger in the third one . ||| muri iyi myaka icumi ishize ubwo turaje nigaaga mu wa kane primaire , murumuna wanjye yiga mu wa gatatu ,
after the war , i went back to school and completed the primary level as long as my younger sister . ||| nraza nraongera ntangira ishuri nraiga , primaire nrayirangiza nta kibazo .
thereafter , i completed secondary school . ||| tubana n' umutante ubu turabana n' iyi saha niwe tukiri kumwe . turaiga primaire turayirangiza ,
today , my younger sister is in senior six . i lived with my auntie by then till now . ||| secondaire nrayirangiza murumuna wanjye ubu ngubu ari muwa gatandatu . tuumvaaga nta kibazo .
of course life is not the same , it is certainly different from the one during the genocide but it not the same as the one before the genocide . ||| yego nyine ubuzima ntabwo bushobora kungana n' ubaw mbere , n' ubwo mu ntiambara hagati , n' ubaw nyuma . ariko bigiye bitandukanye .
are you hopeful about future ? ||| nonese wunva ufite ibyiringiro bihae byo mu kihae kizaza ?
were there times during the genocide where you could feeling like you would better die than ... ||| hari igihe kinini cyane mu kihae cya jenoside ugiye utekereza ... ... wunva wifuza kupfa , wunva wifuza kupfa ...
yeah , very often ! that was the best solution for me . ||| cyane numvaaga aricyo gisubizo .
does life make sense for you today or you wish you would die ... what 's your impression about life ? ||| none rero uyu munsi bwo wunva iyo uba urapfuye ... wunva bitandukanaiye he n' uko uba uriho ? kuba uriho wunva ...
being alive for me is very different from dying . ||| kuba nriho biratandukanye cyane n' uko nba nrapfuye . kuko kuba njyae ndi umuntu ndi ku isi ,
of course i 'm human and i do n't rejuice everyday but neither do i feel bad everyday @-@ those are two facts about which we can n't anything about . ||| ibyo ari byo byose ntabwo mpora nezerewe , kandi na none ntabwo mpora nbabaye . kuko n' ibintu bibiri kandi bigomba kubaho .
on the other hand , when i imagine myself dead , i fell like ... oh ! ||| noneho ntekerezaho kuba nrapfuye burya ikintu cyo kupfa ... urupfu ntako rusa ,
dying is good ! ||| urupfu ni rwiza .
it 's good because you rest . ||| ni rwiza kuko uba uruhutse .
i think that if it happened that i was dead , today i would n't be worryinng about people because i may meet someone in the street and start questioning myself about him . ||| kuko iyo nza kuba nrapfuye , kuba ntekereza kuba nhura n' akantu kakantusha , kuba nhura n' umuntu runaka nkamutekerezaho ukundi kuntu .
when i see that he is not very confortable when we meet , i start thinking that maybe he is the one who killed my people or ... i just become inquisitive about him . ||| yaba ari no muri abo bantu batuiciye , tuhura nkabona yenda ... afite ikibazo . bikatuma mutekerezaho impamvu abaye gutyo . bituma numva ko iyo nba nrapfuye ibi byose ntabwo biri kubaho .
all this makes me belive that if were n't alive , i would n't have all those problems , i would n't think to do this or that according to the situation , i would just rest . ||| nta n' ubwo ntekereza ngo numvae ngo kugirango bigendae gutya , ngombye kugenza gutya , numvae ni ibintu bishyuhije mu mutawe , mbese ni ukuruhuka niko nbifata ,
that 's how i think it is . ||| ni nako nbifata .
the programme that the government has adopted is to emphasize on the fact that people have got to live in a new way . ||| mu bihae turimo hariho ikintu cya leta ... kuko habayeho kushaka ubundi buzima bushya .
what do you think about gacaca and the system of releasing prisonners who have handed themselves over ? ||| nka leta hari ibintu bavuga bya gacaca , ibintu byo kufungura abaemeye icyaha ... byo ubibona kutae ?
can you tell me what you think about unity and reconciliation ? ||| ndetse n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge muri rusangae .
so , in my opinion , releasing someone just because they admit what they did , releasing a hundred ... a hundred people ... i think it 's a way of simplifying things . ||| ubwo rero nkabona ko biriya bintu byo kuvuga ngo basohoye abantu gutya kusa , kuberako baemeye icyaha hano umwe hariya undi , hano batanu , hano ijana ,
i do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be . ||| hano ngo magana angahe ... ngo baemeye icyaha hano ngo barasohotse ,
we should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time . ||| numva ari uburyo bwo koroshya ibibazo nta n' ubwo njya nnabiiumvaish ngo numvae inkurikizi zabyo , numvae n' impamvu babikoze . kuko niba umuntu atekereza ,
some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail . ||| ntabwo ashobora kumara imyaka icumi muri ntuza ... akabona kuibuka yuko ... akabona kuemera ko hari icyaha yakoze mu myaka yose ishize . ese akainjiramo ukwezi kwa mbere ... umwaka urashize , imyaka ibiri ... yari ataratekereza ngo amenye impamvu ari aho ngaho ? ukareba ko harimo abantu bagenda barebair ku banri ,
at the end of it all , we realize that 's how things work . ||| kubera ko ba kanaka bigenze gutya , ntawe bigomba kugenda gutya . kandi koko ukabona niko bimeze .
after genocide , the country had to face the problem of orphans ... what do you think of the way the current government takes care of orphans ? ||| mu bya kurikiraanye na jenoside harimo ikibazo cy' ubupfubyi , wowe iyo ureba nk' abana b' ipfubyi ubona iyi leta ibaitayeho kutae ... ? ubona ibafasha kutae ... ?
do you think it is enough ? ||| ese ubona bikwiriye ?
what do you think of the way you 're treated by the rest of the society ? ||| ubona uburyo bitwabwaho ,
do they pay you a visit ... ? ||| uburyo abandi bantu babasura ... ubona bikwiriye ?
i think they really give their best because right after the genocide , no survivor ever thought they 'd one day go back to school or that they 'd even beneficiate from any medical care . ||| njyewe uko nbibona nbona ntako batari bagize pe ! kuko ubundi umuntu ajya kurokoka cyangwa ajya kusigara muri buriya buryo ,
today , we have the funds of assistance to genocide survivors , fonds d' assistance aux rescapes du genocide ( farg ) in french . ||| ntabwo yatekerezaaga y' uko cyane cyane kubierekeraanye n' ikibazo cy' amashuri . ntabwo yatekerezaaga yuko yaba yakuiga ; ntabwo yatekerezaaga yuko yarwara akavuzaw ;
it helps in paying survivors ' school fees . ||| nk' uko bikwiriye bitewe n' ahantu yenda yaba ari runaka .
survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from . ||| ariko kuri ubungubu , nbona baragerageje , nka kuriya hajeho ikigega farg [ ikigega kitera inkunga abacitse ku icumu rya jenosidde bataishoboye ] kuriya ifasha abana ikaishyura minerval [ amafranga y' ishuri ] ,
i am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness . ||| umuntu akaba afite ikarita yarwara akaba yakwivuriza ahantu aho ariho hose bitewe n' uburwayi bwe . biriya nabyo nrabishima cyane . kuko hari benshi batari kuiga ,
there are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today . ||| iyo kiriya kigega kitaza kubaho . hari benshi bari kurwara bakabura kirengera , iyo ikigega kitaza kubaho . kimwe n' uko hari benshi batabonye n' amafamille [ imiryango ] babamo bibana ,
the government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... i think it 's good . ||| kandi bakabaho neza . bakaiga barwara bakivuza , kandi no mu buzima busanzwe bakaba babapangira nk' ibyo kurya n' iki ... nbona biraho nyine nta kibazo .
you have been an orphan for quite a long time despite the fact that you 're an adult today ... do you have a message to give to other children who survived the genocide the way you did ? ||| nribaza nkawe nk' ukuntu usigaye , wunva abandi bana bagenzi bawe n' ubwo umaze kuba mukuru ariko umaze igihe kinini uri umwana , kandi uri umwana w' imfubyi . wunva uha ubutumwa ki abandi bana mwarokokanye mu kihae cya jenoside ?
in fact , the most important thing ... well , it 's a personal comment but it is a difficult life that requires patience and perseverence . ||| urebye ikintu cy' ingenzi . nk' ubungubu nkanjyae nihereyeho , kuko kuvuga ubuzima bwo kubaho mu bupfubyi , ni ubuzima bugoye cyane .
it is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that . ||| busaba ngo wihangane , busaba ngo ugeragezae kutuza , ugeragezae kukira ibyo ubonye ibyo utabonye nyine ntubirarikirae .
i have had the grace of knowing god and i know he can do anything ! ||| niko bimeze . nkanjyae nongeye akantu k' akarusho njyewe numva muri njyewe ... akantu ko kumenya imaan . njyewe nmenye imaan , numva ko imaan ariyo ishobora byose .
i would therefore tell the survivors that it is god who protected them during the wat , nobody else did ! ||| nkamenya ngo niba imaan yarakurinze , ikakurinda muri buriya buzima bwose , ikakurinda bitari bikwaiye , nta kintu na kimwe ishingaiyeho ,
i would invite them to live a prayerful life because without him , no one would be where they are at today . ||| intambara ikarinda irangira . nta wunri muntu ubona ukuitayeho kugirango ukundae ubae urabayeho , ukabona ni imaan yo yonyine yakurinze . nbona inama ngira bagenzi banjye ,
through prayer we find a certain peace that helps us to accept what happened and we understand that it had to happen that way . ||| ikintu cya mbere ... cya mbere @: ‘ kusenga . ’ kusenga kuko uramutse utekereje ... iyo utekereje ukareba mu buryo bwose , ubona hatabaye imaan yo yonyine yirindiye umuntu n' aho ugeze ngo ubae uhagera ,
and also that god is not unaware of what is happening to us . ||| ubona ari imaan yonyine yakurinze . ubona ko mu kusenga ... ugira ukuihangana . ibyo byose ubona ubasha kubiihanganair . ukaumva ko n' ubwo bibaye niko bigombaaga kugenda .
but it 's only when one undertands the importance of prayer that we can be able to reach such a conclusion . ||| yego . none se nkavuga yenda ngo ... kuba bikubayeho si uko imaan yari iyobewe ko bikubaho . ariko ishobora no kuemera ko bikubaho kugirango irebae ukuihangana kwawe . aho ni mukihae wenda uba umaze kubimenya .
on the other hand , orphans are confronted to various problems , they are n't stable and ... they do not understand that things come and go . ||| noneho mu bunri buryo numva ko n' ubwo hari abana b' imfubyi wenda bitewe n' ibibazo runaka buri wese aba afite , ntabwo ubona bose batuje . baemera uko ibintu bije bigendae ... wenda uko bije abe ariko bigenda .
some of them behave very badly without realizing where the money for the education comes from . ||| ukasanga harimo abitwara ukundi kuntu nabi , ukasanga n' ubwo barimo kuiga ntawe utekereza yenda iyi minerval [ amafranga y' ishuri ] irava he ?
they do not ask themselves how things would be if they were n't the way they are . ||| ese iyo biba bitameze gutya biri kugenda bite ?
it is very clear that some students are n't serious about their school work at all and yet it should be their number 1 priority . ||| ukabona mu kihae cy' ishuri harimo abatabyitaho nk' uko bikwiriye , kandi mu by' ukuri aricyo kintu cya mbere .
my message for them is to be aware that they are orphans and that they should n't so much count on the families with which they live . ||| nabwo nkabona ko ... inama nbagira nkanjyae ni uko mbese bashikama bakamenya ko ari imfubyi . ntarebae famille [ umuryango ] arimo ,
whatever they do , they should n't forget that they are orphans ! ||| ntarebae yenda se ngo ararangije . agomba kumenya igihe cyose ko ari imfubyi . agomba kumenya yuko mu myitwarire y' uburyo bwose agomba kumenya y' uko ari imfu ... mbese ntiiibagirwae , mbese nta kintu cyo kuibagirwa ,
they should n't forget where they are coming from because the moment one recalls where they are coming from , their behaviour gets better . ||| ngo baibagirwae aho baturutse . ngo bagendanae n' aho bari baibagirwae aho baturutse . kandi iyo wibutse aho uturutse bituma n' aho uri ugomba kubigendamo neza , bitewe n' aho uvuye .
this testimony will be watched by many people , maybe even by your grandchildren . ||| ubu butumaw ... ubu buhamya ni ubuhamya buzarebaw n' abantu benshi , cyangwa se nawe n' uzagira abana n' abuzukuru ushobora kuzabibaereka .
i would n't want to let you go without giving you an opportunity to give a message to those who will watch it , something that 's on your heart . ||| nraumva ibyo aribyo byose tutarangiza tutakuhaye umwanya wo kugirango , utangae ubutumwa haba ku bantu bazabubona , cyangwa abandi bantu bazaza nyuma yawe .
this is therefore the opportunity to tell us what is on your heart and what your wishes are . ||| kuko nicyo kikuturukamo . nraumva ibyo aribyo byose ufite uwo mwanya , ushobora kuvuga noneho , ukatanga ubutumwa bw' icyo wifuza
thank you very much ! ||| murakoze .
the message i would like to give as i said from the beginning is a message of love , everyone needs to love their neighbour wherever they are . ||| ubutumwa numva ntanga , cyane ku ruhande rwanjye nk' uko nhereye kare nbivuga . ni uko umuntu wese ; aho ari hose ,
i am convinced that if everyone had shown love for one another , what happened would never have happened . ||| kandi mu buryo bwose abayemo agomba kugira ikintu cy' urukundo . kuko na mbere hose n' ubwo ibintu bigenze gutyo , iyo haza kubamo ikintu cy' urukundo hagati mu bantu , ntabwo ibintu biba biragenze kuriya ,
no father would have killed his own children ! ||| ngo abantu bapfae , ngo umuntu yicwae na mugenzi we . ise w' umwana abe yamuhagarikair , amubwirae ati @:
there was no love at all during genocide . ||| "@ ica kanaka . @" icyo kihae nta rukundo .
everyone is supposed to love their neighbour as they love themselves . ||| ahari umuntu wese yagombye kukunda mugenzi we nk' uko yikunda . yego biragoye ariko nibura umuntu akagerageza . kubera ko niba ukunda mugenzi wawe nk' uko wikunda ,
i know it is not easy but at least we should make some effort ! ||| ntabwo uzatekereza ko azapfa akaba imfubyi hariya , noneho nawe ukahita wishyira mu mwanya we . ukatekereza uti @:
because when you love your neighbour as you love yourself , you will never think of killing him or her or of making him or her into an orphan but you will have compassion for them instead . ||| "@ noneho njyewe arijyae uramutse ubaye hariya bigenda bite ? @" niba utekereza ko mugenzi ashobora kurwara akabura kirwaza , nawe ugomba kuishyira mu mwanya we , ukavuga uti @:
you would want to put yourself in their shoes , you would think of a situation where you get sick and there 's nobody to take care of you ... so all i am asking is that people love their neighbour as themselves . ||| "@ se arijyae urwaye hariya nkabura kirwaza , biba bimeze kutae ? ni ukuvuga ... ikintu nsaba umuntu wese ni urukundo . akaumva akunze mugenzi nk' uko yikunda .
it is very difficult especially for orphans and for those who lost their loved ones ... it is very difficultn for someone who is n't ‘ saved ’ to ... to understand that there 's nothing good in revenging . ||| cyane cyane biragoye nk' abantu bicaiyew , abo bana bose , n' abandi bantu bose nbwira babiumva , ko ... biragoye kaumva ukuntu ubabaye ... cyane cyane iyo hatajemo ikintu cy' akakiza .
it is true that your people were killed but it is over ! ||| wunvae ko ... ... umenye imaan . wunva ko nyine ... niko bigenze , ariko rero nta mpamvu yo kuitura mugenzi wawe inabi yakugiraiye . hagati aho ngaho inama nbagira niba umuntu yaricaiyew ... uricaiyew ,
i am not saying they should forget , i myself can not forget , it is something that will always be part of me . ||| nibyo birabaye , kandi birarangiye . ariko kubitindaho ukakomeza kubitekerezaho ... simvuze yenda ngo babiibagirwae , kuko nnjyae ntinshobora kubiibagirwa .
and when one remembers how it happened , it becomes ... depending on the period in which we are , things are the way they are . ||| ni n' ikintu kitashobora kaumvamo ntibibaho . noneho akaibuka . noneho kuko yibutse ko bigenze kuriya , noneho bikaba ... bitewe n' igihe tugezemo akabona bimeze gutya .
we should n't forget what happened because remembering , looking at where we are at today and being able to that despite everything , there 's some improvement . ||| ntagomba kuibagirwa kiriya kihae yavuyemo , kuko nzajya abiibuka , azajya areba n' igihe tugezemo , noneho akompare [ comparaison / kugereranya ] noneho arebae hagati yabyo ,
because that period was part of another life . ||| avugae ati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose hari ikintu cyakoretse . @" kuko hariya hari ubuzima buri buri ukwabwo .
today , we 're in another life . ||| n' ubungubu hari ubuzima mbese ... bunri .
the life in which we were and today 's life ... we need to think about it but that 's not a reason to cnstantly live in the past without thinking of anything else . ||| mbese ubuzima tuvuyemo n' ubuzima turimo . numva yagombye ikintu cyo kujya atekereza ... akabitekerezaho , ariko bitavuze ngo abibaemo ... abibaemo byo byonyine .
yes , we need to remember , just like it is impossible to forget that we were born and that we shall die one day . ||| agomba kubitekerezaho akabiibuka , kugirango atazaibagirwa . mbese uko umuntu atashobora kuibagirwa ko yavutse , ni nako atagomba kuibagirwa ko azapfa .
but thinking about it ... we need to think about it with the intention to show gratitude to god for what he did , by looking at where you came from and where you are at today , gratitude for the fact that you have reached the time in which we are living today . ||| ariko akabitekerezaho ... kandi ashobora kubitekerezaho akashima imaan ku bw' ibyo yakoze , bitewe n' aho ari , naho yavuye . akaba ageze muri iki kihae turimo .
i believe there 's nothing wrong with thinking about it as long as we are not living in the past . ||| kuko numva ashobora kuibuka , ariko bitavuze ngo azaba muri icyo kihae kusa . akatekereza mbese mu buryo bwo kutekereza ,
we need to think about it in the sense of ... yes , to think abou tit . and also to have love and to be able to forgive . ||| kandi ... mbese akabitekerezaho . akagira ikintu cy' urukundo cyo kaumva anababariye .
personally , i have completely forgiven them ! ||| nkanjyae njyewe nrababariye pe !
i have forgiven them because i know they did it because ... i know they did it ... but maybe as they say it themselves , they were only tools in the hands of someone else or some other power . ||| nrababariye kuko ... numvise ko barabikoze nibyo . ariko nabo sibo wa mukani ... nk' uko bajya banabivuga .
personally , i do not understand how a human being healthy of mind can attack another human being with 2 ears , 1 nose , legs ... just like him or her . ||| njyae nbona , ntakuntu umuntu ... umuntu muzima ... umuntu utekereza , ashobora kuhaguruka akareba mugenzi we ... baremye kimwe ufite amatwi , amaso ,
a human being like him or her ! ||| amazuru , amaguru ... eh ! ni umuntu mugenzi we .
and they take a machete , hack him or her down and see blood shedding ... it is beyond understanding . ||| yarangiza akatinyuka kufata umuhoro akaba yamutema amaraso akameneka abibona , numva ari ibintu birenze ubwenge bw' umuntu atari umuntu ubwe . njyewe ku ruhande rwange nbona ari satani umukoresheje ,
personally , i do n't think that person did it by himself or herself , but they were used by satan to an extent where i have forgiven them all , it does n't matter whether they have asked for forgiveness or not . ||| ku buryo umuntu wese ahari hose yaza kunsaba imbabazi , ataza . numva nramubabariye ku mutaima wanjye , njyae nta kibazo na kimwe nfite k' umuntu runaka .
what happened happened and it is true that i can not forget it . ||| ibyo birabaye nibyo ntinshobora no kubiibagirwa , ariko ... nrabizi ko bibaye . ubwo rero hagati ahongaho ikindi kintu nbabwira yenda ku bakaiga . ni ukuvuga ngo @:
for those who are still in school , i would tell them to seriously study and to prepare themselves a better future . ||| agomba kumenya ko ari kuiga , kandi akiteganyiriza ubuzima bwe buri inberae . kuko hari igihe umwana azamuka yiga bitewe n' ibihe ;
it happens at times that they want to behave in a certain way depending on the town in which they live or which school they go to , but it should n't be the case . ||| n' ahantu se ari ... umujyi runaka akagerageza kuitwara nk' uko abandi bitwara . ariko ntiyitwarae nk' uko we yakagombye kuitwara . kuko burya hari ukuntu umuntu akora ibintu bitewe n' uko ari , ingeso runaka bitewe n' uko we yumva ko nta kibazo .
a child should not forget what is behind maybe just because he or she is lucky enough to live with a well @-@ off family and thus behave as though he or she should n't live in a certain way . ||| ariko nibura ukatekereje ... cyane cyane harimo nk' abana benshi bamara kuigira hejuru bitewe n' ubuzima abayemo , yenda abayeho ubuzima bumeze neza famille yifashije ... ariko akagerageza kwiyibagiza bya binri . noneho akashaka kugenda ... ni nko kukata mbese . akagerageza kubiirengagiza ... mbese na none akashaka kuirengagiza uko yakagombye kubaho .
i guess that is enough . ||| nraumva ibyo ngibyo bihagije .
my name is umulisa marie @-@ claire . ||| jyewe banyita umulisa marie claire ,
before the war we were living in kamonyi district in gitarama province , in a sector called murehe . ||| nkaba ... mbere y' intambara turi tutuye mu karerae ka kamonyi , precture kitaarama , umurenge wa ... wa murehe .
when the war was about to start , i was n't so informed about it but there was multipartism and i would see political parties having conflicts ; mrnd and mdr . ||| intambara ijya kuba , usibye ko jyae ntari nbisobanukiwe cyane , nri nkiri mu ... nri nkiri umwana . habanje ibintu by' amashyaka .
that is what i was aware of . ||| amashyaka akazajya ashyamirana mrnd na mdr cyane nibyo ... nibyo nri nkunze kumenya .
habyarimana died later on died . i remember we had a councillor called iyakaremye emmanuel . ||| nyuma y' amashyaka habyalimana amaze kupfa , nribika yuko turi tufite umu conseiller witwa iyakaremye emmanuel ,
he came at home and asked my dad in which politial party he was . ||| yaje mu rugo abwira papa ngo @: we ari mu rihae shyaka ?
my dad replied that his political party was in his heart and that it was n't necesary to tell it to him . ||| papa aramubwira ngo @: ishyaka rye riri ku mutaima ntabwo ari ngombaw kubimubwira .
a week later , some people from different neighbouring sectors came to our home sector . ||| hashize nk' icyumweru mu ... muri secteur y' iwacu haza aba ... abantu bavuye mu yinri secteur ,
they had come to kill the tutsis , and when they reached home , they took my dad away . ||| baje ngo kuica abantu b' abatutsi . bageze mu rugo papa baramutwara ,
they asked him to give them money . ||| bamaze kumutwara baramubwira ngo nbahae amafranga .
he had 30,000 frw . ||| icyo kihae papa yamuhaye ibihumbi mirongo itatu [ 30.000 frw ] ,
therefore , he gave it to them and came back home . ||| araongera aragarauka .
two days later , it was on a sunday and we had gone to church . ||| hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , icyo kihae hari ku cyumweru , tugiye kusenga ,
when we came back , they came home and called my dad . ||| tuvuye kusenga papa ara ... baraza bageze mu rugo bahamagara papa ,
all of us were in the compound and they told dad that they were going to kill all of us . ||| tuesae tujya ku muharuro baramubwira ngo @: tuesae bagiye kutuica .
they took all the cows that were at home and ate them but they never killed us as they had said . ||| ubwo batwara inka zari ziri mu rugo baragenda barazirya , ariko icyo kihae ntabwo batuishe .
after about a week , the war broke up into the whole district . ||| hashize iminsi nk' i ... hashize icyumweru inta ... ubwo ... noneho intambara iba ibaye ku karerae kose .
i remember they came home one morning . ||| ubwo baraje , bamaze kuza , icyo kihae hari mu gitondo ,
they knocked at the front door . ||| bakomanga ku rugi rwo ku irembo ,
my mother and all the kids who were at home skipped the fence and only dad remained there . ||| ubwo abana turi turi mu rugo tuhise tusimbuka urugo na mama , ariko papa we aguma mu rugo .
there was a millet plantation behind home and we just hid there . ||| turagenda , inyuma y' iwacu hari hari amasaka , turagenda tuyihishamo .
we did not recognized any of the people who came home , we only managed to identify two of them . ||| abo bantu baraje ariko ntabwo tubashije kubamenya bose , tubashije kumenyamo abagabo babiri .
one was called karamage and the other one was called minani . ||| umwe yitwaaga karekezi undi yitwaaga minani .
they came and took dad to a certain center that was around . ||| baraza batwara papa , bamujyana haruguru ‘ ku gacenter ’ kari kahari ,
they made him sit there and beat him . ||| baramwicaza ngo @: baramukubita .
i heard that they did not kill him on that day . ||| ariko ntabwo bahise bamwica .
we spent about two days in the millet plantation . ||| hashize iminsi nk' ibiri tukiri muri ya masaka ,
then they came back at home , but dad was still alive ; they had n't killed him yet . ||| ubwo baragarutse ariko papa yari ikiriho bari bataramwica . ubwo baraza barasambura inzu , bakuramo n' ibintu byose , n' urugo bararutwika .
a day later ... we did n't know where dad was . in the millet plantation where we were , behind home ... we were with mum and the rest of my brothers and sisters . ||| hashize umunsi umwe , ubwongubwo ... papa nyine ntabwo turi tuzi irengero rye , ya masaka turi turimo inyuma y' urugo , turi kumwe na mama n' abana bose ,
we were five children . ||| mu rugo turi abana batanu .
the boys left us . ||| ubwongubwo ab' abahungu bahise batucika baragenda ,
i remained there with mum and my older sister . ||| nsigara ari jyewe na maman na mukuru wanjye .
in the evening we went to a certain hill in our village and hid in a cave . ||| bigejeje nimugoroba turagenda ahantu ku musozi w' iwacu , tugeze ... tuhageze ku musozi tuihisha ahantu mu mwo ... ku mukokwe .
and the following evening we left and mum took us to our nieghbours . ||| ubwongubwo bigejeje nka nimugoroba turagenda , mama aratujyana mu rugo turi tuturanye ,
when we reached there mum asked them to hide me as i was the last born . ||| tuhageze mama arababwira ngo @: jyewe nibampishe [ kuko ari jyewe uri mutoya mu bana b' iwacu ] .
they told my mum that they were not allowed to keep inyenzi . ||| ubwo mama baramubwira ngo @: "@ ntabwo bemerewe ngo kubika inkotanyi . @"
we immediately went back to hid in a millet plantation . ||| ubwo tuhise tusubira nanone inyuma , turagenda , turaongera tujya ahantu mu masaka turihisha .
after about two days ... mum suggested that we go to a church and hide there . ||| ubwo hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , mama aravuga ati @: "@ noneho murekae tugende nanone tujyae ahantu ku kiliziya abe ari mo tujya . @"
when we reached the church ... it was around 10 o'clock .. we entered in the church and spent about three days there . ||| tugeze ku kiliziya ... icyo kihae tugeze ku kiliziya nka saa yine . tuhageze tujya mu kiliziya mo inberae tumaramo iminsi itatu ,
after three days they came to get us and led us towards the river . ||| hashize iminsi itatu baraza batukuramo bagiye kutujyana mu ruzi .
when we reached a certain center , we were stopped and they wanted to remain behind with mum and told us to go back . ||| hashize ... ubwo turagenda tugeze ku gacenter , mama baramugumana , twebwe baratubwira ngo @:
both my sister and i refused to leave our mum behind . ||| nitugende . tuanga kusiga mama , jyewe na mukuru wanjye ,
they started beating us and since we were young kids , we agreed and left mum there . ||| baratukubita . batukubise kubera ko turi abana , turemera mama turamusiga turagenda .
we went to another neighbours ' house . ||| tujya ahantu turi tuturanye na none ku rugo ,
both our families were friends , so my sister and i decided to go there and when we reached , we hid behind their home . ||| urwo rugo kubera ko bari inshuti z' iwacu , jyewe na mukuru wanjye turagenda , tugeze inyuma yaho ,
as we were still hiding , we saw one girl and one boy members of that family and we called them . we thought they would be merciful and hide us in their home . ||| ubwongubwo tuihisha munsi y' urugo , tubona umukobwa wo muri urwo rugo n' umuhungu musaza we , turabahamagara tugirango wenda baratugirair impuhwe batujyanae mu rugo batuhishe .
so we called them and when they came they asked us , "@ how did our people [ the hutu ] leave you ? @" ||| ubwo turabahamagaye , bamaze kuza baratubwira , ngo @: "@ bene wacu babasize muri he ? @"
they immediately took us [ my sister and i ] to some interahamwe called byemayire , who was a terrible killer . ||| ubwo bahise batufata jyewe na mukuru wanjye , batujyana ku nterahamwe yicaaga abantu cyane yitwaaga byemayire ,
they took us there so that byemayire would kill us . ||| batugejejeyo ngo byemayire atuicae ,
fortunately , byemayire was n't around . ||| tusanga byemayire ntawe uhari . baradukomezanyije batujyana ahantu ku ‘ gacentere ’ kari kahari ,
they procceeded and took us to a nearby center , hoping to find there some other cruel interahamwe so that they would kill us . ||| ngo wenda tuhasanga izindi nterahamwe gakushwa , kugirango wenda zibae zatuica . turagenda tuhasanga abagabo babiri , bamaze kutubona ,
when we reached there , two men were hesitant , "@ we can not kill these two kids ; their father was a very good man and he helped us out several times . let them go and be killed elsewhere . @" ||| baratubwira bati @: "@ aba bana ntabwo tubica , papa wabo yari umuntu mwiza yatugirairaga neza , nimubareke bazagwae ahandi . @"
therefore , we left . but the boy called minani and his sister yansoneye followed us saying that they were going to show us to interahamwe in order for them to kill us . ||| turamanuka ... ariko wa muhungu bamwitaga minani , na mushiki we bamwita yansoneye , bo barakomeje baratujyana . baragenda ngo bagiye kutuereka interahamwe ngo zituicae ,
when we reached a place called musenyi , i failed to walk because i was very tired . ||| baragenda batugejeje ahantu baita ku musenyi , jyewe nanirwa kugenda ,
minani then hacked me on the leg and said that i sould hurry . ||| kubera ko nri nrushye . uwo baitaaga minani yarantemye , antema ku kaguru , ngo nihutae .
though i was hacked , i still we continued to walk ; i was n't too weak to stop walking . ||| bamaze kuntema ariko turagenda , ntabwo nhise ncika intege kugirango , wenda ku buryo ntabashije ubugenda , nrakomeje nragenda .
as we were slopping down the hill , still in my sister 's company , they called some people who were down at the river and told them that they had brought them some inkotanyi , to get ready . ||| turagenda tumanuka umusozi jyewe na mukuru wanjye , tugeze haruguru ku musozi bahamagara abo hasi ku ruzi ngo @: "@ tubazaniye inkotanyi , ngo @:
therefore , they continued to slop down with us and when we reached the river , my sister was forced to carry a tree trunk and they made me carry two stones , then they dumped us in the water . ||| nimuitegurae . @" barakomeza baratumanukaan , batugejeje ku ruzi , bafata mukuru wanjye bamuhekaish igiti ,
we spent two days in the water . we found ... i found myself in the sugar cane plants that were around and my sister came out from the other side of the river . the waters threw us in two different areas . ||| bampekesha amabuye abiri , batujugunya mu ruzi . ubwo mu ruzi tumazemo iminsi ibiri , tugiye kubona ... .... jyewe nvamo ngwa mu bisheke ,
that was after two days and i was in the sugar cane plants but i did n't know where my sister was . ||| mukuru wanjye agwa hakurya y' uruzi , ntabwo twagu ... ... ntabwo uruzi rutujugunyaiye ahantu hamwe . ubwo hashize iminsi nk' ibiri jyae nri ndi mu bisheke , ariko mukuru wanjye ntinri nzi aho ari ,
i had last seen her when they were trowing us into the waters . ||| nherukaaga bagiye kututa mu ruzi .
i remained in the sugar cane plantation naked ; i did n't ... i came out of water without any cloth . ||| ubwo ngumaye mu bisheke nambaye ubusa , imyenda yose nri nambaye ntayi ... ntaa ... nvuyemo nta mwenda nkifite .
some of our relatives were in runda ; an old lady who was my mum 's aunt . ||| ubwo kubera ko hari famille turi tufite ahantu baitaaga muri runda , hari umukecuru uri nyirasenge wa mama .
but i did n't know the place very well . ||| ariko nkaba ntari mpazi neza .
they dumped us in the river from a place called iraro and we came out at a certain place called kamuhada , at a brigde that is between kigali and gitarama . ||| ubwo batuta mu ruzi ... batuta mu ruzi , batutereye ahantu baita ku iraro , twiburukiye ahangaha hafi ya kamuhanda , ku kiraro kigabanya kigali na kitaarama .
then when night fell , i went to some hill called kagina . ||| ubwo bumaze kwira nzamutse ahantu baita ku musozi wa kagina , nragenda ari ninjoro ,
it was in the middle of the night , at around 1 o'clock in the morning . ||| nka saa saba z' ijoro .
therefore , i walked and walked . ||| nragenda , ntakomeza nrazamuka ... ... nrazamuka ,
it was almost morning , at around 4 o'clock in the morning that is when i reached to that home . ||| bujya nko kucya nka saa ... nka saa kumi , urwo rugo nirwo na ... niho nhageze .
i went and knocked on their door . ||| nragenda ntakomanga ,
they had n't seen me in a long time . they opened for me and i found my mum already there . and when she saw me , she was filled with sorrow . ||| maze kukomanga kubera yuko nhaherukaaga kera ... barankingurair , mpageze nsanga mama yagezeyo . nrabasuhuza , mama akinbona agahinda karamwica ,
then she asked me , "@ where is your older sister ? @" ||| araambaza ngo @: "@ mukuru wanjye ari he ? @"
i told her that by the time they drowned us , we were together but i do n't know what happened to her later . ||| mubwira yuko bagiye kuturoha mu ruzi turi kumwe , ariko we ntinzi irengero rye .
therefore , my mum and i stayed there and two days later , my older sister also came . ||| ubwo turahaguma jyae na mama hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , ngiye kubona nbona mukuru wanjye nawe araje turamubaza @:
my mum asked her how she came . ||| "@ ese wowe uje utae ? @" aramubwira ngo @:
she told her that she was coming from somewhere across the river , in a place called nyagatovu . ||| "@ avuye ahantu hakurya y' uruzi , ahantu baita i nyagatovu . @"
the three of us remained together . ||| ubwo turagumana uko turi batatu .
actually , the man in that family was not being hunted . ||| ariko umugabo wo muri urwo rugo , we ntabwo yahigawaga kuburyo bamwica ,
he was the one to hide us and his wife was an aunt to mum and she was also among the group of hunted people . ||| niwe uri utuhishe . ariko umudamu we , yari nyirasenge wa mama , nawe mubaicwa yabaga arimo .
since her husband was a hutu , he was not threatened . ||| ariko kuko yari yarashatse umugabo w' umuhutu , we nta kintu bamurebaagaho .
we all continued to hide there ; my mum , my older sister and i. later ... it was in ... it was still in april in the middle of the war . ||| turakomeza turahaihisha turi batatu , jyewe na mama na mukuru wanjye . hashize icyo kihae hari mu kwaa ... intambara mbese yari igeze hagati , ariko bikiri mu kwa kane .
then in may , the man [ husband to her mum 's aunt ] said , "@ i do not want to be accused of being inkotanyi . ||| bigejeje mu kwa gatanu , uwo mugabo aravuga ngo @: ntabwo agiye kuzazira inkotanyi ,
all of you go . @" ||| ngo @: tuesae tugende ,
he told his wife if she believed she had to continue hiding us , then she should leave with us . ||| ngo niba uwo mukecuru , uwo turi dufitanye relation [ isano ] ngo niba yumva ko yakomeza akatuhisha , ngo nawe tujyane .
i stayed there without knowing where the others who were with me had gone . ||| ntahaguma ariko ntinkamenye aho abo turi kumwe bagiye ,
the war went on and at some point they began shooting . ||| intambara irakomeza , irakomeza , bigejejemo hagati nko mu kwa gatandatu intambara y' amasasu iraza . ngera ahongaho muri runda ,
the inkotanyi came to runda while i was there . during the time of shootings , we all fled together . ||| tugeze muri runda , ubwo inkotanyi nyine zaigeze muri runda igihe amasasu yabaga , ubwo turahunga , tuhunga tuesae .
i thought of staying in the house alone and thought it would be hard . ||| nreba kusigara mu nzu jyenyine biranshobera .
we again crossed over to a certain place ... runda was next to taba and taba was my home village . ||| turaongera na none tuambuka ahantu kuko runda yari iteranye na taba . kandi taba niho yari iwacu .
we passed there and went further . ||| turahanyura turagenda ,
we reached a place called kanyinya , where we found a roadblock . ||| ngeze ahantu baita i kanyinya tuhunga tuhasanga bariyeri [ barriere ] .
at the roadlock they would stop people and look into the palms of kids who were not yet able to get identity cards . ||| tuhasanze bariyeri barahagarika abantu , noneho bakagenda batureba mu biganza , abana batagiraaga ibyangombwa . bagenda batureba mu biganza ,
when they looked into mine , they asked me , "@ where do you come from ? @" ||| banrebye mu kiganza baraambaza ngo iwacu ni hehe ?
i lied to them and gave them wrong names of my parents . then they let me go . ||| nrababeshya nbabwira amazina atari ay' ababyeyi banjye baranreka .
we continued our journey and reached nyabikenke and bulinga . we went through all those areas . ||| turakomeza turagenda , tugera ahantu za nyabikenke , tugera ahantu za bulinga ,
when we reached gisenyi , we turned back as it seemed like the war had calmed down . ||| hose turahazunguruka , tugeze ku gisenyi turaongera turagaruka , ubwo intambara yari imeze nk' ihosheje .
we went back to ... to the place where i was during war . ||| turaongera turagaruka tujya ... nyine nsubira aho intambara yabaye ndi ,
since i was alone , i went back to ruda . ||| kuko nta wunri muntu turi turi kumwe . nsubira ahongaho muri runda , maze kusubira muri runda ,
the war had stopped then . ||| ubwo intambara yari irangiye .
i found when the old lady was still alive but the old man had died . ||| ubwo tusanga wa mukecuru aracyariho , ariko wa musaza yarapfuye .
we went to a camp in ruyenzi and camped there . after some few days ... i thought that maybe someone from home may come to that camp , but no one came . ||| turagenda tujya ahantu ku ruyenzi mu nkambi , turahakaambika . hashira iminsi mikeya , nkajya ntegereza yuko nibura hari umuntu w' iwacu uza ,
i just stayed there with those people . ||| nramubura ngumana n' abongabo .
in august 1994 ... i remember we had gone to church , when i came back , i found my sister there . ||| mu kwezi kwa munani muri 1994 , icyo kihae nri ndi ... turi tugiye mu misa , tuje tusa ... nsanga mukuru wanjye yaje ,
it was like a big miracle to me . ||| mubonye nsanga ni nk' ibitangaza bikomeye .
before greeting her , i first asked her ; "@ are you still alive ? @" ||| mbere yo kumusuhuza nramubajije @: "@ ese uri muzima ? @"
she said , "@ i am alive . @" ||| aranbwira @: "@ ndi muzima . @"
then i asked her , "@ you did n't die ? ||| "@ ntabwo upfuye ?
or am i just talking to a ghost . @" ||| cyangwa ni umuzimu wawe ndi kusuhuza ? @"
she said , "@ no , it is me , i am still alive . @" ||| aranbwira @: "@ oya ni jyewe ndi muzima . @"
"@ where were you living ? @" ||| "@ ese ubaga he ? @"
i asked her . ||| aranbwira ngo @:
then she told me that she ... she went to musambira , where we had family members and continued to hide . ||| yari ... yageze nyine ahongaho i musambair , ahongaho habaaga amafamilles [ imiryango ] yacu ,
later she went to zaire [ congo ] and came back . ||| arakomeza yihishaanw nabo aragenda agera zairae , araongera aragaruka .
therefore , we waited to see if mum or other people from home would come but none turned up . ||| tutegereza yuko rero mama yaza , cyangwa tutegereza ko n' abandi bose bo mu rugo baza , turategereza turaheba .
we neither know how people from home died nor where they died except dad who was killed at a certain center where they had taken him . ||| abantu b' iwacu ntabwo tuzi urupfu bapfuye , nta nubwo tuzi ahantu babiciye . kaereka papa wenyine niwe biciye ahantu ku ‘ gacenter ’ , aho bamujyanye ,
that is where they killed him . ||| niho bamutsinze .
then the war stopped . ||| ubwo intambara irangiye ,
from august 1994 to january 1995 i continued to live there where i was when the war stopped . ||| jyewe mu minsii ... kuva mu kwa munani , icyenda na kane [ 1994 ] kugeza mu kwa mbere , icyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] niho ... nrakomeje nba ahongaho ,
my sister and i continued to live there together . ||| aho narokokeye . njyewe na mukuru wanjye uwonguwo ,
they somehow wanted to make us their slaves ... the war begun when i was in primary four . ||| turakomezanya . noneho basa nk' aho ... bashaka kutugira abakoroni [ kudukoroniza ] , intambara yabaye niga quatrieme primaire [ mu mwaka wa kane w' amashuri abanza ] ,
then they stopped me from going back to school . ||| baanga ko nsubira kuiga .
though my sister was n't so old , she was slightly wiser than me . ||| noneho kubera ko mukuru wanjye we ... nawe ntabwo yari mukuru cyane , ariko we yari anrushije ubwenge . arareba ati @: "@ ese ubu ,
then she asked , "@ how shall we live this kind of life ? ||| ubu buzima tuzabugumamo kutae ? @" banzae y' uko ujya kuiga , kandi nnjyae banzae y' uko nsubira kuiga . @" bo ikintu bashakaaga ,
they can n't allow you to go to school ; neither did they allow me ... all they wanted us for was to collect grass for their cows , to dig , to fetch water , generally to do all the domestic work . ||| bashakaaga ngo @: tujyae tuhair ibyatsi by' inka zabo , tuhingae , tubavomaire ,
that was what they expected from us and to them that was the reason why they were taking of us . ||| mbese tukorae akazi ko mu rugo , aricyo mbese tubamarair , noneho nabo babonae ko ari cyo baturerair .
my sister left me there . ||| mukuru wanjye aragenda ansiga ahongaho ,
the burgomaster of our home area was a genocide servivor too . ||| turi tufite umu bourgmestre w' iwacu , nawe yari yaracitse ku icumu .
therefore , my sister went to him and told him what was going on . ||| aragenda arabimubwira ukuntu ibintu bimeze ,
then he asked her , "@ what can i do for you ? ||| aramubwira ati @: "@ ese nkukorerae iki ? @"
you are still young ; you can not live alone in a house . ||| muri abana ntabwo mushobora kujya mu nzu ukwanyu ; ese mwajya mu nzu mukatungaw n' iki ?
and even if you did , what would you survive on ? ||| mwabaho mutae ?
you have no one left in your family that could maybe protect you in your life . @" ||| nta na famille mwasigaranye , ngo nibuze iba proteger [ ibarindae ] mu buzima bwanyu ?
then my sister told him , "@ instead of continuing to live the way we are living , we 'd better live in a house alone . we do n't care if it means dying . @" ||| mukuru wanjye aramubwira ati @: "@ aho kugirango tugumae mu buzima turimo , tuba mu nzu yacu tushaka tukanapfiramo . @"
by then there were interahamwe 's houses , which were empty ; the interahamwe had fled . ||| ubwo hari hari inzu z' interahamwe , interahamwe zari zirahunze .
he gave us a house . ||| atuha inzu , amaze kutuha inzu ,
then we started living in it . ||| turagenda tuyibamo .
that was in 1995 , i went back to school but my sister was confused about what to do . ||| ubwo yari muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] , nnjyae nsubira kuiga . mukuru wanjye we ,
we both went to school at the same time for as hort time . ||| areba kusubira kuiga biramushobera , kubera ko ntabwo yari kuiga ngo nnjyae nigae .
later on in 1996 , the burgomaster got her a job as a taxe collector . ||| ubwo hashize iminsi mike , muri mirongo cyenda na ... na gatandatu [ 1996 ] , mukuru wanjye , bourgmestre w' iwacu amuha akazi k' ubu percepteur .
so , when she started working , i was able to continue school . ||| aragenda abona akazi , noneho nnjyae nbona ubushobozi bwo kukomeza kuiga .
in year 1997 , i started secondary school and my sister continued working until the year 2000 . ||| muri mirongo cyenda na karindwi [ 1997 ] , nibwo ntangiye secondaire , njya muri secondaire , mukuru wanjye arakomeza arakora .
i was in secondary four when our mayor was changed . ||| arakora bigejeje muri 2000 , nri ndi muri quatrieme secondaire [ muwa kane w' amashuri yisumbuye ] ubwo mayor [ umuyobozi w' akarere , uhoze ari ‘ bourgmestre ’ ] wacu avaho .
they brought another one who was not aware of our life conditions . ||| haza undi . noneho haje undi utatuzi , utazi ubuzima bwacu uko bumeze ,
they stopped all employees who did not have diplomas and my sister was among them . ||| baba obliges [ biba ngombaw ] yuko abantu batafite diplome [ impamyabushobozi ] bava ku kazi . mukuru wanjye ava ku kazi .
i was in secondary four when she left work . ||| ndi quatrieme [ mu mwaka wa kane ] . avuye ku kazi ,
fortunately , farg was founded . ||| noneho ubwongubwo kubera ko na farg [ ikigega kitera inkunga abacitse ku icumu rya jenoside ] yari imaze kuza ,
therefore they would pay for my school fees but as far as domestic needs were concerned , we got a lot of problems . ||| farg [ ikigega ] ikazajya indihair , ariko mu kibazo cyo mu rugo ubuzima buratugora .
we were not living in kigali then . ||| ariko icyo kihae ntabwo tubaga mu mugi wa kigali ,
we were living in gitarama at the farm . ||| tubaga i kitaarama ku isambu .
our farm was well treated since my sister was working ; she would employ people to work on it and we would live on its harvest . ||| ibwo iyo sambu , kubera ko mukuru wanjye akikora , ntabwo sambu ntiiigeze yangirika , yashyiraagamo abantu bakayikora ,
at first when she had just left work , havests from the farm continued to feed us . ||| ibivuyemo bikatutunga . akimara kuhagarara ku kazi , ubwo ibintu biri biri mu isambu nyine birakomeje biratutunga . noneho hashize iminsi ,
after some time , there was a new policy that was put forward ; everyone had to give everything that did not belong to him or her . ||| ngo haza itegeko rivuga ko umuntu wese ,
therefore , we were asked to live the other house . ||| azasubiza iby' abandi . ya nzu bayitukuramo .
when they took us out of that house , life became hard . ||| bamaze kuyitukuramo , ubuzima buratukomeraan .
it was as though life had stopped . ||| ubwongubwo niho tuhise tuumva isi ihagaze ,
but my sister tried to contact farg and then farg considered our problem . ||| ariko mukuru wanjye agerageza kuegera farg [ ikigega ... ] . yegereye farg , ubwo farg yumva yuko ikibazo cyacu kikomeye ,
and they would give us 20,000 frw per month . ||| ikazajya ituha inkunga ya buri kwezi 20,000 frw @/@ mois [ ibihumbi makumyabiri ku kwezi ] .
then in the year 2001 , which is when we used to get the funding of farg ... my sister too ... i was in secondary five . ||| ubwongubwo muri 2001 , aribwo nyine tubonaaga n' ayo mafranga ya farg , mukuru wanjye nawe ... ubwo nri ngeze muri cinquieme secondaire .
my sister realised that her life was also getting worse because she never had any documents [ diplomas or certificates ] . ||| abona ko [ mukuru wanjye ] ubuzima ... ubuzima bwe nawe , bumaze ku , buzapondekara [ buzaangirika ] , kubera ko nta kintu yari yigejejeho .
the war began when she was in secondary two . ||| kubera ko we intambara yabaye yiga deuxieme secondaire [ umwaka wa kabiri w' amshuri yisumbuye ] .
then she told me , "@ you have reached in senior five and you can see that farg is helping us ; they provide us with school funds , transport and other school expenses . ||| ubwo aravuga ati @: "@ ugeze cinquieme secondaire [ mu wa gatanu wisumbuye ] , kandi urabona ko farg iduprotega [ iturwanaho ] ikatuha ticket n' ibikoresho ,
it is a high time i also went back to school . @" immediately she started looking for a school and started studying as soon as she got one . ||| none nnjyae ngiye kureba uburyo njya kuiga . ubwo nawe yahise ajya kushaka ishuri , nawe aragenda araiga .
farg continued to help us until 2002 when they [ farg ] gave us a house in the kimironko residences , which were constructed for children who live on their own [ orphans ] . ||| araiga farg [ ikigega ] irakomeza iratufasha , imaze kutufasha bigejeje muri 2002 , ubwo farg [ ikigega ] ituha inzu mu midugudu y' abana bibana hariya kimironko .
we started living in that house . ||| imaze kutuha inzu tuyijyamo ,
later farg was decentralised and they stopped helping people . ||| farg iba decentralise [ yegerezaw abaturage ] , kufasha abantu iba irabihagaritse . imaze kubihagarika ,
when they did ... i had finished my studies before they stopped helping us . ||| ubwo jyewe nri nrangije kuiga ... imaze kubihagarika ubwo njyewe nri nrangije kuiga ... mbere yo kugirango nyine ihagarikae kutufasha , ubwo ngewe nri nrangije kuiga . ejo bunri ,
then i got a temporary job in ibuka . i worked and the money was helpful . my sister was actually able to get some of the school material she needed . ||| nbona ikiraka muri ibuka , nrakikora , ubwo kiratutunga , na mukuru wanjye nawe abona ibikoresho byo kugirango ajyae ku ishuri .
then the job stopped and life stopped too . ||| ikiraka kirahagarara , kimaze kuhagarara ubuzima nabwo burahagarara .
now i can not tell you hoe exactly life is , all i can say is life is really hard on us . ||| ubwo ubuzima rero , ntinzi ... ntinkubwira ngo ubuzima bwacu bumeze gutya ,
when one has a problem , he or she tries to bear with it because there is no one to solve the problem for you . ||| ubuzima bwacu burakomeye . wenda niba ugize ikibazo , ugerageza kukiihanganair , kuko nta wunri ukiereka .
today my older sister is in senior five . ||| ubu uwo mukuru wanjye nawe ageze nawe cinquieme secondaire [ muwa gatanu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] .
i was lucky to succeed and get a diploma . ||| ariko ngize imaan nnjyae nrangije nbona diplome ,
however life is currently very hard . ||| ariko ubuzima bwacu kuri ubungubu ni ubuzima bugoraanye .
well , i can not say that we are desperate ; we always try to be serene and look for a living . ||| wenda ntinvuga ngo umuntu araiheba , ngerageza kwicalma [ kutuza ] . kugirango wenda ubonae imibereho ,
sometimes we meet good samaritans who have pity on us or remember us and say , "@ i will help these kids in such and such a way . @" ||| ni uko uba ubonye nk' umuntu akakugirair impuhwe , cyangwa se akakuibuka . akavuga ati @: "@ uyu mwana ibyo aribyo byose reka mufashe muri ubu buryo . @"
and when you do n't get such people , life still goes on though in such a misarable way . ||| iyo utamubonye nabwo , ubwo nyine urakomeza bwa buzima bubi bukakomeza bukakugendaho .
it was river nyabarongo . ||| ni uruzi rwa nyabarongo ,
we were drowned my sister and i. we did not come out together . ||| ariko baraturohaanye jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ariko ntabwo twiburukiye hamwe .
i came out from this side of kamuhanda and she came out from across the river in a place called nyagatovu . ||| jyewe niburukiye hano kamuhanda , niburuka ino aha . we yiburukair hakurya y' uruzi hirya . aho yiburukaiye ni ahantu baita i nyagatovu ,
that is where she came out . ||| niho yiburukaiye .
did she tell you how she crossed the river in order to go back to where you had come from ... i mean where you all saw each other again ? ||| ese yaba yarakubwiye uburyo yambutse , agaruka aho mwari muturutse ... aho mwahuriye nyine kugirango muongerae mubonaane ?
yes she told me . ||| yee ,
she walked up to the road that goes to shyorongi and then continued up to the brigde that is between runda and taba . ||| yarakomeje atambika hano ku muhanda w' i shyorongi , araza araongera agera hano ku kiraro kigabanya runda na taba ,
then she went to the house of the old lady whom we were related ; she was my mum 's aunt . ||| aza kuri uwo mukecuru turi dufitanye ... wo mu ma famille [ wo mu muryango ] uri nyirasenge wa mama .
you talked about some interahamwe who were prisoned , like minani , yansoneye and others . ||| utubwiye abantu b' interahamwe bari bafunze , nka ba minani , yansoneye n' abandi .
do you remember ... or do you know what happened to them ? ||| nonese uba wibuka ... cyangwa uba uzi amaherezo yabo ?
because , i believe it is minani who cut your leg ... ||| kuko minani we ngirango yanakutemye ku kaguru .
umh ! ||| umh !
after the war , we met the so called minani ... well , when we came back , we went to see our farm in the village . ||| intambara ikirangira , uwo minani twaraa ... nyine tukiza tugiye kureba ku isambu ukuntu hameze ,
we found minani there . ||| tusanga minani arahari .
when he saw me , he was filled with fear . ||| akinbona we ubwoba buramuriye , araambaza ,
then he said to me , "@ i know i betrayed you , i hacked you . ||| ati @: "@ ese muri wowe nrabizi nrakuhemukaiye , nrakutemye .
and while doing so , i did not want you to live anymore . ||| mu kukutema numvaaga ntakeneye yuko ubaho .
what can i do to make up for what i did to you ? @" ||| none uraumva nkukorera iki ? @"
i just told him , "@ there are laws that will punish you for the fact that you never wanted to see me alive again . @" ||| nramubwiye nti @: ku buzima buangae utarashakaaga yuko nbaho , hari amategeko azakuhana .
we went to report him at the district and he was arrested . ||| tugiye kumurega ku karerae , baramufata baramufunga ,
he later on died in jail . ||| ariko yaguye mu munyururu .
his sister too was arrested and she is still in prison . ||| we na mushiki we bose barabafashe , mushiki we aracyari mu munyururu ,
she is in gitarama prison . ||| we afungaiye i kitaarama ,
but minani died in prison . ||| ariko minani we yarapfuye yaguye mu munyururu .
what about the other interahamwe ... you never know they may be the ones who killed your parents or your other relatives . ||| izindi nterahamwe , zo hari n' ubwo usanga ari nazo zakuiciye ababyeyi , cyangwa abandi bavandimwe ,
do you know anything about them ? ||| zo ibyabo biba biragenze kutae ?
in the group of attackers who first attacked our home , the person we managed to identify was karekezi . ||| kubera ko mu gitero kije iwacu bwa mbere , umuntu tubashije kumenyamo cyane ni karekezi .
he is the one who took our father away . ||| ubwo niwe ugiye ajyana papa ,
and since our father left , he has never come back . ||| kandi papa kuva yagenda ntabwo yagarutse .
but i do n't know if he is the one who killed him or his companions because they were very many . ||| niba ariwe wamwishe , niba atari we kubera ko bari abantu benshi , ntabwo nbizi .
but he is the only one i knew in the whole group of attackers . he is called karekezi . he is the only one whose name i knew . ||| ariko kusa ni uko uwonguwo ari we nmenye mo , uwo baitaaga karekezi niwe nmenye mo kusa , amazina .
undefined ||| yaba akiriho se cyangwa ... ?
i do n't know about that . ||| ntabwo nbizi ibyongibyo ,
i do n't know if he actually admits that he killed those people . ||| niba abongabo nabo ... niba abongabo nabo abaemera yuko yabaishe .
but when you try asking him , he says , "@ i killed a lot of people and i can not tell the exact number , all i know is that i killed so many people . @" ||| ariko we iyo umubajije aravuga ati @: "@ nishe abantu benshi . abo nishe ntinzi umubare wabo , kusa nzi ko nishe abantu benshi . @"
did he come to apologise to you ? ||| none se yaba yaraje kubasaba imbabazi ?
no he 's never come . ||| oya , ntabwo yaje .
well , considering that , what do you think of the gacaca court ? ||| none se tukaomoje kuri ibyo , wowe utekereza iki kuri gacaca ?
what i think about gacaca court ... people who killed had a goal in doing so . ||| njyewe kuri gacaca ukuntu nyitekerezaho , abantu baishe , baishe babifitiye umugambi . umuntu rero njyewe aje inberae yanjye ,
therefore , when someone comes to me asking for forgiveness because he killed people , my people ... they killed intentionally with all their hearts ... therefore , the law should punish them according their crimes . ||| aje kunsaba imbabazi kubera ko yishe , yaranyiciye . yishe abishaka kandi abikuye ku mutaima , ni uko ubutegetsi bumuhana bukurikije categorie [ urwego arimo ] y' ukuica kwe .
there is something that is often talked about , something concerning unity and reconciliation . ||| hari ibintu bimwe biku ... hari ikintu kikunze kuvugaw cyane kijyanye n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge .
to somebody like you who was hurt to that extent and who is still suffering the consequences of their deeds even today . ||| ese wowe nk' umuntu ukiriwe nabi bingana gutya , na n' ubu ukaba ukibayeho mu ngaruka zibyo bintu bibaye .
do you find it possible ... or what is your point of view ? ||| ubona bishoboka cyangwaa ... wowe ubibona kutae ?
personally , as someone who lost everyone and is now living miserably , i believe those who killed should be strongly punished in a way that would affect them . ||| njyewe ku ruharae rwanjye , kubera nk' uko nbuze abantu nkaba nsigaye iheruheru . njyewe umuntu unyiciye , ni uko yahabwa igihano nawe kimutoucha [ kimukoraho ] ,
so that they also feel how wrong what they did is . ||| nawe akaumva yuko nawe yagize nabi .
because i can not say that ... that they should kill them too . ||| kuko ntinvuga wenda ngo ... ngo nibamwice ,
it 's not my place to say so , it is the role of the law , and i do n't have that right . ||| si njyewe ubivuga yabibwiraw n' amategeko .
but personally i would suggest they kill them . ||| njyewe nta burengazira nbona , ariko jyewe ku bwanjye bamwica .
but as far as the law is concerned , they should be given punishments according to the crimes they committed . ||| ariko ku burengazira bw' amategeko , bamuha igihano kijyanye n' icyaha yakoze .
well , when a person experiences some things the way you did and then lives the way you are living due to his or her past , he or she gains some life experience . ||| nonese ... eeh , ibyo aribyo byose iyo umuntu yanyuze mu bintu nk' ibyo unyuzemo , akaba abaho mu buzima nk' ubwo uriho , kubera nk' ibyo unyuzemo ,
therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ? ||| aba afite umwihariko we . wowe nko kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu wunva ari ikintu ... bivuze iki ?
could you explain about it ? ||| wunva ubisobanura kutae ... ?
as a person who ... someone like me who got several problems . ||| nk' umuntu ... nk' umuntu nkanjyae uhuye n' ikibazo ,
the way i understand the genocide ... there is a time you think about all the things you went through and try to compare it with the life you are leading now ; then you come to realise that there is no difference between your past and your present . ||| ukuntu numva jenoside . hari ukuntu utekereza nk' ubuzima ugiye unyuramo , ukagereranya n' ubwo uriho ubu , ukabona ntaho uvuye ,
and when thing are like that , you just try to ignore it all . ||| nta n' aho ugiye . iyo ubonye bimeze gutyo , wiha amahoro .
because if you can not find a way to ignore it , you might end up on the streets , crazy . ||| kuko utaihaye amahoro , washiduka ugiye no mu muhanda usaze , kandi noneho ukanezeza babanri bakugiraiye nabi .
this would only contribute to making happy your enemies . but when you try to be still and not let even a single person know what you are thinking about . you just have to calm down and think about the future . ||| ariko iyo wihaye amahoro nta n' umenya icyo utekereza , kusa urabiihorera ukatuza , ukategereza ubundi buzima buri inberae ,
we only know the past ; we do n't know the future . ||| ubu twe tuzi ibyashize ariko ntabwo tuzi ibiri inberae .
we can only wait for the future , if it happens to be good , fine ; if not too bad . ||| utegeza nyine ikiri inberae niba ari kiza se , cyangwa se niba ari kibi ,
in life it is important to wait for what 's ahead of us . ||| nyine mu buzima ukategereza ibindi biri inberae yawe .
there is something i would like us to talk about more specifically . ||| hari ikintu numva tuvugaho cyane cyane ku buryo bw' umwihariko .
you see you are a person who experienced tough times and you have seen a lot of things . ||| urabona wowe uri umuntu unyuze mu buzima bukomeye , kandi uciye mu ibintu byinshi .
however , all was as a result of the loos of your parents due to the war . ||| nonese ibyo aribyo byose ibyo uciyemo wabitewe no kubura ababyeyi n' ibyabayeho , ariko hari ubundi buzima ubayeho n' ubwo wenda uri umwana bwa mbere y' intambara .
do you remember how things were before the war ? can u tell us about it ? ||| uba wibuka , cyangwa utubwira uti @: "@ jyewe numva mbere y' intambara nkurikije uko iwacu turi tumeze ,
how were you living ? ||| biri bimeze gutya ?
would you please tell us about your life at home before the war ? ||| utucira muri make ubuzima bw' iwanyu mbere y' intambara ?
before the war , we were five children and i was the last @-@ born . ||| twebwe mbere y' intambara , twebwe turi abana batanu . muri abo bana batanu ni jyewe uri uwanyuma .
we never used to have problems at home because both mum and dad were working . ||| kandi nta kibazo mu rugo tugiraaga , kubera ko ari mama , ari na papa bose barakoraaga .
for sure , we never had any problems . ||| nta kibazo tugiraaga pe !
sometimes there would be problems out there but it would n't mean anything to us because there used to be people to look after us . ||| wenda n' iyo no hanze habaaga n' ibibazo , twebwe nta kintu bibaga bitubwiye . kubera ko turi tufite abaturebair .
but after the war ... my sister and i ... yet we were the youngest ; all our elders were gone . ||| ariko intambara yararangiye , kubera ko jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ni ntawe turi abanyuma , abari batukuraiye bose baragiye .
even though the war stopped , not any family member was left . ||| intambara rero irangiye ... intambara irangiye , nibuze nta na famille [ umuryango ] nimawe igaragara , yaba yarasigaye ,
maybe we could be telling them about our problems . ||| ku buryo tuyibwira ikibazo .
those who survived only are those who can neither support themselves . ||| famille [ umuryango ] na yitwa ngo yarasigaye , ni za familles [ ya miryango ] nazo ziriho zitabashije .
therefore , if we compare this life with life before the war , there is a very big difference . ||| ubwo rero kugirango ubuzima uri urimo mbere , ubu comparer [ ubugereranyae ] n' ubw' ubungubu ,
because nowadays i may be having a problem but i can n't find anyone to tell it about . ||| ubona harimo difference [ butandukanye ] . kuko ubungubu nshobora kugira ikibazo , ntingirae uwo nkibwira .
for example , i can spend two days without eating , yet before the war , i had never spent even a single day or an hour ... every time i would feel like eating , i would eat . ||| mbese ubu nshobora kumara n' iminsi ibiri ntari nrya , ariko mbere y' intambara nta n' umunsi ... nta n' isa ... igihe cyose numvaaga nkeneye kurya nraryaaga .
but now i can even spend three days and remain silent . ||| ariko ubungubu nshobora no kumara n' iminsi itatu , kandi nkaceceka .
because there is no one i can share my problem with . ||| kubera ko nba nbuze uwo ntura ikibazo .
life after the war is very complicated . mathematically , i would say it is not even a quarter of the life i was leading before the war . ||| ubuzima bwa nyuma y' intambara , ni complique [ buragoye ] cyane . nta n' icya kane , cya mbere y' intambara .
i noticed that the most special person in your life after the war is your sister . ||| undi muntu numva ukomeye cyane muri iki kihae nyuma y' intambara , cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe , ni mukuru wawe .
what can you tell us about your sister ; how old is she and what are her plans ? ||| nonese utubwira iki kuri mukuru wawe , angana iki ? ubona afite imigambi imeze kutae ?
although she is not too young , my sister is also young ; she was born in 1981 . ||| ubundi mukuru wanjye nawe , ni umwana ... si umwana cyane yavutse muri 1981 .
but her life is also horrible . ||| ariko ubuzima bwe nawe ni hatari .
at this time she should have been able to do something with herself . ||| kuko aho yari ageze , yari kuba ari umuntu wenda nawe ugize icyo yimarair .
but because she did not have anyone to push her so that she studies on time and complete her studies , her life seems to have declined instead . ||| ariko kubera ko yabuze umuntu umusunika ngo yigirae igihe , amashuri ye ayarangizae . ubuzima bwe bubaye nkubusubira inyuma .
when she realised that it was just the two of us who survived and yet she was the oldest , she had no other alternative but to leave school so that i would go to school . ||| kubera ko we yabonye ko ansigaraanye kandi ndi umwana kuri we , abura ikintu yankorera , ava mu ishuri , kugirango wenda nbonae uko nkuiga .
she went back to school after farg was founded ; that is after farg had agreed to help us monthly . ||| we yasubiye ku ishuri ari uko farg [ ikigega ] ije . kandi asubira ku ishuri ari uko farg [ ikigega ] yemeye kuzajya itufasha buri kwezi .
but before farg came , she had sacrificed herself so that i also get to some grade . ||| ibyo byose bitari biba farg [ ikigega ] itaraza , we yemeye kunvunikira , kugirango mbe njya ejuru .
up to now , she has n't completed her studies . ||| kugeza na n' ubu ntabwo amashuri ye arayarangiza ,
normally at her age , she is not supposed to be in secondary school but that is where she is now ; she is in senior five at the moment . ||| kandi intera ye ntabwo imwemereye kuba yaba akaiga secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] ,
and whenever she comes back home [ from boarding school ] , she finds several problems . ||| ariko ubu ari muri cinquieme secondaire [ muwa gatanu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] . kandi n' iyo ageze mu rugo , asanga ibibazo ari byinshi ,
and me who remained behind , she finds there is nothing i improved because i have no job , no one to protect me , so that i also can help her . ||| wenda nkanjyae yaba yarasize ... uba urasigaye inyuma , nta kintu mumaraiye . ndi gutya nnjyae , nta kazi ngira nta ki ... nta n' undi muntu wunri ngira umproteja [ unrwanaho ] wenda ngo nnjyae ngirae ikintu nba nmumarair .
she comes from school and goes back into the miserable life that she left behind . ||| ava ku ishuri nabwo , akaza akasubira muri bwa buzima bubi , yari arimo mbere .
is there any message you could give genocide orphans ? ||| nta butumaw uha nk' imfubyi za jenoside ?
especially those that take care of themselves or even to those that are looked after . ||| cyane cyane ari imfubyi zirair , ari n' imfubyi zirairw .
those young kids should have a way they should behave ... ||| kuko ... cyane cyane abana , abakiri batoya . kuko biragaragara ko bagombye kugira uburyo bakuitwara .
the piece of advice i would give them is , "@ never long for luxuries because they can turn out to be so dangerous . @" ||| njyewe nk' inama nbaha , ni uko ubuzima bwose banyuzemo , n' ubwo bakirimo ubu , bashobora kubwitwaramo neza .
if they can appreciate who they are , be it those who are in families or those who are looking after themselves ... it is possible to live in a family and yet live in torture . ||| ikintu cyose babonye , n' icyo batabonye bakaumva ko kibanyuze .
if you are not too patient to live with them , is when people start saying you are a spoiled child . ||| ntibagirae irari .
and after misbehaving , she or he may suffer the consequences such sicknesses . ||| kuko bagize irari bibavairmo n' ibindi bibi . ariko banyuzwe n' uko bari , yaba bari muma familles [ mu miryango ] cyangwa se baba abirera ... burya hariho n' ukuntu uba muri famille [ mu muryango ] aho kugirango ubaeho neza , ahubwo ya famille [ wa muryango ] ikagutesa .
therefore , all i can advise them is to look at everything before them positively ; be it good or bad . ||| iyo utaihanganye rero ngo ubanae nabo , nibwo ujya kaumva ukaumva ngo umwana kanaka yararutse . ukasanga muri kwa kuraruka kwe akuyemo consequences [ ingaruka ] z' indwara , icyo namukonseya [ inama nmugira ] ho ni uko ikintu cyose kiba kiza ,
it will all contribute in building a better future . ||| kiba kibi inberae ye ashobora kukifata nk' ikiza . kugirango mu buzima bwe buri inberae , ubuzima bwe buzashoborae gufonctiona [ kugenda ] neza .
you know this tape is going to be watched by many people . ||| eeh , urabona iyi cassette izarebaw n' abantu benshi ,
your own kids or even grandchildren might one day watch it because it is going to be well kept . ||| izarebaw n' abana bawe n' abuzukuru kuko ni ikintu kizabikwa . nonese nta zinri ... mu kirunri ho bazaita impanuro .
do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ? ||| inama cyangwa se ubutumwa utanga kuri iyi cassette yawe ?
anything you may need to talk about to rwandans at large or survivors in general . ||| icyo ushaka kuvuga icyo aricyo cyose ku banyarwanda bose , ku bacitse ku icumu muri rusangae .
you can say anything ... ||| ushobora kugira icyo uvuga .
the advice i can give to the genocide survivors ... let 's talk about the genocide perpetrators ... well , we try our best to talk to them but however much you may try to talk to them , their hearts seems no to be at ease [ ubnormal ] . ||| jyewe ikintu ngira nk' inama abantu bacitse ku icumu , ni uko tuvugae nk' abantu bakoze jenoside , bakayikorera nk' umuntu . yego ugerageza uburyo bwose bubaho kugirango muvuganae ,
there is no way one can kill your parents , kill you entire family and you remain like a tree [ indifferent ] , and then expect to talk to him or her nicely . ||| ariko niyo mwavuga , muvugana nawe umutima wawe utari normal [ utasanzwe ] . kuko nta untu umuntu yaba yarakuiciye ababyeyi , ngo akuicirae famille [ umuryango ] usigarae umeze nk' igiti ,
well you talk to him or her but your heart feels like a stone . ||| wa muntu uzamuvugaishe neza . uramuvugaish ariko umutima wawe uba wunva ari ibuye .
the advice i would give the genocide survivors is ... they should n't always carry that burden . ||| yego ... ... njyewe inama ngira nk' umuntu ucitse ku icumu , ni uko atakomeza ngo yikorerae umutwaro ,
they should n't let themselves be stressed by the killers . ||| akomezae avunikae hejuru y' abantu bamwiciye ,
instead they should try and ignore those feelings and kind of renew their hearts , i mean they should have a heart of stone . ||| ahubwo yagerageza ibyo bintu akabiikuramo , akaongera umutima we ukaba mushyashya . umutima w' ibuye nyine , wunva yuko abantu bamugiraiye nabi ,
they should try to ignore what happened to them . ||| akagerageza kuwikuramo ,
in fact they should try to talk to those who hurt them and listen to their opinion . ||| ndetse akagerageza akanabegera nawe , akaumva igitekerezo kibavamo .
i believe when someone hurts you and do not react with anger and you talk to them instead , the person will never be at peace , they will always fear you . ||| kuko burya iyo umuntu yakugiraiye nabi akabona utamufitiye uburakari , ahubwo akabona umwegera ugerageza kumuvugaish , nawe ntabwo yishima , ahubwo ubwoba niho bumwica .
that 's my advice . ||| njyae niyo nama ngira abacitse ku icumu .
what about children ? ||| nk' abana bato ?
well , concerning children , i can not ... the advice i can give them is , though there was a war , the future will make life new . ||| abana bato bo , ntabwo ... njyewe inama ngira nk' abana batoya nbaumvaish yuko , intambara n' ubwo yabaye , ariko inberae hari ubundi buzima bushyashya .
because if you tell them the history of the war , or tell them those bad stories , they may grow up without enjoying anything in life . ||| kuko nk' umutwe w' umwana umushyizemo ngo intambara yarabaye , ukagenda umushyiramo ibintu bibi , we yakura nta n' ikiza azi . yakura yumva ko mu mutawe we ,
they may mature up with a belief that what will happen in the future will be the continuation of what happened in the past . ||| inberae ye , inyumae ye , ibyamubayeho bizaba prolonge [ bizakomeza gutyo ] . ariko nmugira inama y' uko ibintu byose bibaye ,
therefore , i would reassure them that what happened will end . ||| bizagira iherezo ,
the future will be very good , unlike what they went through in the past . ||| inberae ye hari ubundi buzima bwiza butameze nk' ubwo yanyuzemo .
that is the advice i would give children . ||| ni iyo ngira abana batoya
considering the problem of foreign countries that deny that there was genocide in rwanda , do n't you have any message to give them ? ||| ukurikije noneho n' ikibazo cy' ukuntu amahanga uzi yaba yaritwaye ku bibaye mu rwanda ... kuri jenoside yabaye mu rwanda , yo wunva nta kintu uyabwira ?
foreign countries ? ||| amahanga ?
the problem is foreign countries believe that there was n't genocide in rwanda . ||| ni uko akenshi amahanga yumva yuko nta jenoside yabaye mu rwanda .
unless i get ... a leader from a particular country that denies that there was genocide in rwanda . ||| kaereka ahari nbonye ... nk' umuyobozi w' igihugu runaka utajya wemera ko hari jenoside yabaye mu rwanda .
then i would convince him or her that genocide did take place in rwanda . ||| nkamwumvisha uburyo jenoside yabaye mu rwanda ,
and if necessary , i would take him or her to those places where they exhumed and reburried those innocent people who died . ||| biba ngombaw nkamwereka n' ahantu hagiye hagwa inzirakarengane , bashyinguwe ,
i would make sure he or she gets to see those remains of people and show him or her all those who were handicaped due to the genocide until when he or she ... understands that genocide actually took place in rwanda . ||| ayo magufwa yabo akagerageza kuyabona . ndetse umuntu akajya amwereka n' abantu bamugaye ku buryo bwa jenoside . akagera aho ... ubwo yumva ko jenoside yabayeho mu rwanda .
because most countries can not imagine how someone can hold a machete and hack his or her equal . ||| kuko amahanga menshi , ntabwo ajya yiumvaish uburyo umuntu yafashe umuhoro akatema undi .
what do you plan for your future ? ||| nonese wowe wunva mu buzima bwawe buri inberae uteganya iki ?
what is your plan for the future ? ||| ufite iyihe gahunda mu buzima bwawe ?
what i plan for life , though i experienced a bad life in the past , i still have hope that things will change . ||| njyewe ubuzima bwanjye uko nbuteganya , nubwo nbayeho nabi mu buzima bushize , ariko njya ngira ikaizerae yuko uko biri atari ko bizahora .
i believe that all this that brings me down , problems ... living wthout someone to confide in ... yes i know i will die without ever getting someone to tell my problems but remember , we only remember our problems when we get into hardships . ||| numva ko hari igihe ibingibi nrimo binyahaza , ibibazo iki ... kutagira uwo nbwira ... yego n' ubundi nzarinda npfa ntawe nbonye nbwira ikibazo , ariko burya umuntu yibuka ikibazo cyane iyo ahuye n' ubuzima bubi .
therefore , if one tries to get ride of hardships , slowly by slowly the problems will also reduce and finally one will forget about them . ||| ugerageje rero ukabona ubuzima bubi ubuvuyemo n' ibibazo rero hari igihe bigenda bigabanuka nabyo ukabiibagirwa . yego ntibigenda burundu ,
i know you can never completely forget but the burden is lighter . ||| ariko hari ikintu kivungukaho , kubyo uba urahuye nabyo .
and i believe my future will be very nice . ||| kandi njyae mu kaizerae cyanjye nfite nziko avenir [ ejo hazaza ] yanjye izaba nziza .
do you have any additional messageto add to your testimony ? ||| nta kinri kintu ukaongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe ?
my name is olivier ruyenzi , son of venuste karasira and of speciose mukakarangwa . ||| jyewe nitwa ruyenzi olivier , mwene karasair venuste , na mukakarangaw speciose .
i was born in 1984 . ||| nvutse muri 1984 .
after habyarimana 's death is when ... two days later is when we went to eto school . ||| habyarimana amaze kupfa , nibwo ... hashize iminsi ibiri tugiye muri eto .
we found the unamir soldiers there . ||| tugezeyo tuhasanze minuar [ ingabo z' umuryango w' abibumbye ] ... icyo kihae niho yari iri .
we went there at around 1 p.m. when we got there , our houseboy went back home and when he got back , he told us our house had already been burnt . ||| noneho tugezeyo ... ubwo mu kugenda tugiye mu ma saa saba z' amanywa . mu kugenda tugezeyo , turi tufite umukozi agaruka mu rugo ; aje nibwo yatubwiye ko bamaze kuhatwika mu rugo .
we continued living at eto , many of the people from kicukiro , the neighbourhood where we lived . ||| ubwo tukomeje kuba muri eto , abenshi muri ino quartier ya kicukiro ... aho tubaga nyine .
people came to eto hoping that they 'd survive . ||| nibwo baje muri eto ahongaho bari baizeye ko bashobora kurokoka ,
a few days later , on april 11th , 1994 is when the unamir soldiers made an announcement from the un saying that they needed to leave . ||| noneho ubwo hashize iminsi ... le 11 mata [ 11 /04 /1994 ] nibwo minuar [ ingabo z' umuryango w' abibumbye ] yafashe ... bavuga itangazo rivuye muri onu rivuga yuko bagomba kutaha .
they left with all the white people and the catholic nuns who were working in a convent that was there . ||| icyo kihae batahanye abazungu n' ababikira bakoraaga ahongaho kigo cy' ababikira ,
but before they left , they told us that they were leaving ; so we were aware if that fact . ||| baraambuka baragenda . ariko mbere y' uko bagenda barabitubwira bati @: "@ bagiye kugenda . @" turabimenya .
some tried looking for ways to leave with them but it did n't work out . ||| noneho ubwo bamwe batangira kushakisha ukuntu bajyana nabo biranga .
the interahamwes were around the fence of don bosco high school at eto , surrounding it . ||| interahamwe ubwo zari ziri kuri cloture hirya no hino ku kigo cya de bosco ... kuri eto . maze bamaze kugenda , nibwo bahise bainjira muri eto ,
they got in as soon as the unamir left and started killing . a group tried escaping towards amahoro stadium but you understand that some were killed at eto . ||| bamwe batangira kubica , igikundi kimwe kiragenda kishaka kujya stade amahoro , mu nzira tugeze ... ubwo bapfairiye muri eto biraumvikana ,
as we were heading towards amahoro stadium , some were killed on the way , in the kicukiro neighbourhood ... when we got to ‘ sonatubes ’ , there were some gps [ the presidential guard ] and a few interahamwes , they gathered us all in one place and got us to sit down . ||| abandi bagenda basa nk' abagiye kuri stade amahoro . tugeze muri za quartier za kicukiro hepfo ... tugeze kuri ‘ sonatubes ’ [ ahantu ku kicukiro hitairiyew uruganda ] bagendaaga bica bamwe mu nzira gutyo ... tugeze kuri ‘ sonatubes ’ tujya hamwe , hari abajepe n' interahamwe nkeya tujya ... batwicaza hasi .
we heard that the inkotanyis were seeing us there at ‘ sonatubes ’ but did n't have any means of getting to us . ||| kubyo numvise bari bamaze kuvuga ko inkotanyi zirimo kutureba ahongaho turi turi kuri sonatubes . ariko nta bunri buryo bari bafite bwo kutugeraho . tumaze kugera ahongaho bareba icyo batukorera barakibura .
as we were there , they could n't figure out what to do with us and that 's when they told us to continue walking towards nyanza . ||| ubwo bahita batubwira bati @: "@ ni ukukomeza umuhanda tukajya i nyanza . @"
we left , some soldiers were walking ahead of us and some behind us and we were in the middle . ||| turagenda inberae hajya abasirikare tujya hagati n' abandi i nyuma , a cote impande zombi a gauche a droite [ iburyo n' ibumoso ] hari hari interahamwe .
we walked straight towards nyanza , those who were tired died on the way . ||| tukomeza tout droit [ inberae yacu ] umuhanda ujya i nyanza abananiwe bapfa , gutyo gutyo .
if somebody recognized you and did n't want you to escape him , he 'd take you with him ... and so on . ||| uhuye n' umuntu akasanga akuzi niba atashaka ko umucika ubwo arakusigaraan ibintu nk' ibyo .
we found a roadblock with interahamwes at nyanza and they decided that 's where they should put us , given that it had been decided that kigali city should be kept clean and that they should stop killing people on the streets . ||| noneho tugeze i nyanza tuhasanga bariyeri , hari hari interahamwe , baravuga bati @: "@ nta hanri tubashyira . @"
it was dark and it was raining ; they got us to sit down and started throwing grenades at us , people were falling all over . ||| kubera ko bari bavuze ko bagomba kukora isuku mu mujyi wa kigali , nta kuicira ku mihanda . ariko ubwo ngubwo bahita batubwira ... buri bumaze no kwira harimo no kugwa imvura , batwishaza hasi ,
a fragment hit my head and i felt very weak . ||| abasirikare bajya hejuru , batangira kutera grenade abantu barahaihitaan bagwa hasi ahongaho grenade imwe [ eclat ] infata mu mutawe uraumva ko nsaga nk' aho nshitse intege .
when they got a shortage of grenades , they started shooting until bullets got finished as well . ||| noneho abandi grenade zirashira , bararasa birashira nabyo ;
they then told the interahamwes who were there to get in there and look for the people who were still breathing ... ||| noneho babwira interahamwe zari ziri aho ngo bainjirae batangirae kureba abakihumeka noneho ubwo mu kugenda ...
where did the grenade hit you ? ||| grenade bayikuteye hehe ?
on the head [ he shows above the ear . ] ||| mu mutawe [ yerekana hejuru y' ugutwi ]
they started throwing grenades ... i mean , after the grenades and bullets got finished , the interahamwes started killing those who were still breathing . ||| noneho ubwo batangiye kutera ... nako grenade zishize n' amasasu , interahamwe ziraza zitangira kuica bamwe bari bakihumeka .
by then , i was no longer with my parents , brothers and sisters . ||| ariko ubwongubwo uraumva ababyeyi banjye , barumuna na bashiki banjye , turi tusa nk' aho tutandukanye .
but i was still with mother then . ||| ariko njyewe nri ndi kumwe na mama icyo kihae .
i was still very young and she kept urging me to remain silent . ||| baje ubwo jyewe nri ndi n' umwana cyane , ariko rero akaza anbwira ngo nsheceke ibintu nk' ibyo ... kuko nri nrimo kumusakuriza .
an interahamwe came and realized she was still breathing . ||| arimo kunbwira ngo nsheceke , interahamwe ihita iza , yumva ko akirimo akuka .
he hit her on the back with a hammer and she was pregnant ! she was in a lot of pain but she did n't die right away . ||| ihita imukubita inyundo nyinshi mu mugongo , kandi yari atwite ntabwo yahise apfa ariko yarababaye mbese .
another one came and hot me with the side of a machete but it was n't very painful compared to the pain caused by the fragment of grenades . ||| ubwo nnjyae imwe isa nk' aho inkubita ikibatira cy' umuhoro , ariko ntacyo ... umuhoro ntabwo uri ... kuri eclat ntacyo njyewe numvaaga icyo kihae .
the following day ... all this happened at night and i can not recall exactly what happened next but i was told that dad had n't been injured ! ||| bukeye hari mu ijoro icyo kihae ... ibyakurikiyeho simbyibuka , ariko rero ngo icyo kihae papa ntacyo yari yabaye .
so he looked for us and took us not far from rebero where the inkotanyis were . ||| aratufata ... aratushakisha areba aho turi turi , aratufata atujyana atugeza hafi y' irebero ;
the inkotanyis found us the next day . ||| inkotanyi zari ziri ... bucyeye inkotanyi zahise zitugeraho .
others came ... we left for cnd in a daihatsu full of casualties . ||| noneho nibwo abandi baje ... mu kugenda tujya cnd tugiye muri daihatsu , harimo abantu benshi bakomeretse .
they kept on shooting at it as it was surrounded by inkotanyis . ||| ariko rero bagenda basa nk' abarasa iyo daihatsu kuko turi tugiye tukikijwe n' inkotanyi hirya no hino .
when we got there , the casualties were taken inside where some doctors took care of them . ||| tugeze aho ku gishushu [ cnd ] abakomeretse cyane bajya muri cnd mo inberae hari abaganga babaitaho ,
more people came to seek refuge there , the ones who had not been injured brought themselves . ||| hamaze iminsi igera nko kuri itatu ubwo n' abandi bahise baza barimo batunda bazana n' abatakomeretse baza ahongaho ,
many bombs were being thrown there . ||| kuko ahongaho barimo kuhatera amabombe menshi cyane .
three days later , at around 6 o'clock in the evening , they decided we should ... the non @-@ injured had started walking towards byumba at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon . ||| noneho tuguma ahongaho 3jours [ iminsi itatu ] ishize nimugoroba nka saa kumi n' ebyiri baravuga bati ... kuva saa cyenda nibwo abatari bakomeretse bahise batangira kujya i byumba ,
the roads were safe , the non @-@ injured went by foot and the casualties were driven there . ||| bagenda n' amaguru . ubwo umuhanda uri muzima , abatakomeretse bagenda n' amaguru , abakomeretse bagenda n' imodoka .
by the time we were leaving , i did n't know where dad was . he 'd been shot at the hand . ||| muri uko kugenda papa bakaba bari bamurashe ukuboko , we ntabwo turi turi ... nta n' ubwo nri nzi n' aho ari ,
i only was with mother . ||| sauf [ uretse ] njyewe na mama nitwae turi turi kumwe .
we did n't know in what conditions my younger brothers and sisters were at that time . ||| noneho abandi barumuna banjye na bashiki banjye ntituri tuzi uburyo bariho icyo kihae .
when we got to rebero ... that 's when we met with dad at the byumba hospital , near the catholic church . ||| noneho tugeze ku irebero ... nibwo tuhise tuhura na papa mu bitaro by' ibyumba , hafi ya eglise catholique [ kiliziya katurika ] nibwo tuhise tumubona . turamubona turamubaza tuti @:
neither did he know where my sisters were which is very understandable . ||| "@ se bashiki banjye bari he ? @" ntabyo yari azi icyo kihae biraumvikana .
then ... but soon after we got there , we saw one of my sisters who was 2 years old then . ||| noneho ... ariko tukihagera tuhise tubona undi mushiki wanjye muto uri ufite imyaka ibiri ,
she had been hit with a club on the head and she was with some of our nieghbours . ||| icyo kihae we yari muto . nibwo we tusanze icyo kihae bari baramukubise inyundo mu mutawe noneho arangije tusanga yari kumwe n' abaturanyi .
there was a military camp nearby and the soldiers used to bring us food at the hospital . ||| hashize iminsi kuko hari hari i camp y' abasirikare ahongaho i byumba , nibo batugemuriraaga aho mu bitaro .
mother was in a very bad shape as she was pregnant and dad 's hand was almost being cut off . ||| mama kuko yari atwite , yari ameze nabi biraumvikana , papa biba ngombaw ko bamubaga kuko akaboko kari kagiye kucika kandi ... hari abaganga b' abazungu .
there were some white doctors and he told them he did n't want it to be cut off . he could speak english as he had gone to school . ||| kuko yari yarize azi icyongereza akabenforma [ abamenyaish ] ababwira yuko we atashaka ko bamuca ukuboko .
but there was nothing else they could do and they ended up cutting it off . they were treating people very fast as there were so many casualties . ||| ariko kuko nta kunri biri kugenda barakuca . kandi bavuraaga mu buryo bwihuse bashaka kuvura abantu benshi .
so when we found out that his right hand had been cut off and we did n't know where all my siblings were , we started seeing how hard life was becoming ... a few days later came some white people , we were with other kids from our neighbourhood and they wanted to take us to italy . ||| barakuca ukuboko kw' iburyo , noneho tusanga barangije kukuca . icyo kihae nibwo tuhise tubona y' uko busa nk' aho ubuzima bugiye kukomera noneho , abandi bana tutazi aho bari n' iki .... hashize iminsi haza abazungu turi turi kumwe n' abandi bana tuva muri quartier zimawe bashaka kuzajyana muri italie .
since those kids were the most injured , they took them first . ||| kubera ko icyo kihae abo bana bari bakomeretse kurusha abandi barabajyana .
a few days later ... as dad was getting better , we thought of going to uganda as giving birth in those conditions was going to be too hard for mom . ||| hashize iminsi ... tumaze iminsi noneho twebwe papa atangiye kaoroherwa , kubyarair aho ngaho biri bikomeye tushaka uburyo tujya muri ouganda .
we left for uganda and when we got there , some relatives of ours who lived there welcomed us . ||| turabubonye ubwo buryo , turagenda tugezeyo turi tufite famille yo turagenda tugezeyo baratuakira .
a baby boy was born a few days later . ||| hashize iminsi barabyara umwana w' umuhungu ;
the war had ended by then , dad went back to rwanda to check how things were and he came back and told us the house had been destroyed . ||| ubwo intambara yari imaze kusa nk' irangira we abanza kujya mu rwanda kureba uko situation ... agezeyo aragaruka aratubwira ati @: "@ nta kunri inzu barayishenye . @"
we had some neighbours with whom we shared everything who had been killed but their house was still there . ||| ubwo turi tufite inzu y' abaturanyi bari babaishe , ariko rero turi ... tusa nk' aho tusangiye byose .
him and i came back to rwanda but mother , the newly born baby and the child who had been hit by a club remained behind . ||| tuva ahongaho tuhita tuza tuva ouganda tuza mu rwanda , njyewe nawe twenyine . mama n' umwana ... n' uwo mwana wunri bari barakubise inyundo w' umukobwa muto barasigaraan , barahasigara .
they later on joined us there and we went back to living a normal life although they were still shooting here and there . ||| tugezeyo nabo turabahamagara ngo bazazae , baje tuhita tubonaan . icyo kihae nibwo tuhise tuba mu buzima ubwo ngubwo busanzwe . muri ubwo buzima buri busa nk' aho bukomeye barasaan ,
after sometime , we moved back to our own house . ||| hashize igihe tuhita tujya mu nzu noneho yacu .
we were living near the kicukiro health centre and we knew the nurses there . ||| hashize iminsi kuko turi tusanzwe tuziraanye n' aba infirmiere [ abaforomo kazi ] bo kuri centre de sante yo ku kicukiro ,
they introduced to us some italian doctor . ||| haza umuzungu w' umunya italie , ufite nationalite y' abataliyani turamenyaan .
him and another doctor called paul got for us visas and dad and i went to italy for treatment . ||| mu kumenyaan ahita amenyaan n' undi mu docteur witwa paul anshakira visa njya muri italie kukomeza kuivuza , kuko ntabwo nri meze neza . njyana na papa icyo kihae nrivuza ,
they operated my head and we came back . ||| mu kugaruka ... ngiyeyo nrivuza barambaaga mu mutawe nyine nragaruka . we ... tuza kubona undi mwana w' umukobwa wunri turi tutandukanye unkurikira ,
he ... we came to find my younger sister called diane , she was fine and had only been injured on the head , she has a scar on the forehead . ||| witwa diane , tusanga ni muzima usibye igikomere cyo mu mutawe afite mu kahanga . arangije umwe turiyenforma [ informer @:
we kept looking round and asking about my older sister and we found out that she 'd been killed . ||| tushakisha amakuru ] tugirango tushakishae information [ amakuru ] kuri mushiki wanjye mukuru , tuza kumenya ko yapfuye .
she had gone to visit my godmother during the holidays and they all were killed apart from the elder child in my godmother 's family . ||| mu kumenya ko yapfuye aho yari yagiye kusura marraine wanjye muri vacance , kuko icyo kihae hari muri vacance bose barapfuye , hasigara undi uri mukuru kuri we , wo kwa marraine aho yari yagiye kusura .
so they 'd been killed and when we found out , we organized ourselves and made some sort of a souvenir ... a way of commemorating their death . ||| bose barabica nyine ahasigaye tumenye ko yapfuye turiyoruganiza [ organizer @:
we ... my parents also inquired about the rest of our relatives and found out that only my dad was still alive and his younger brother who lived in uganda and his sister who lived in butare . ||| turisuganya ] tukora akantu kasa na souvenir [ uburyo bwo kumwibuka ] ko kumwibukiraho kuko ... y' urwo rupfu rwe n' ibiki ... ababyeyi ... turiyenforma [ tushakisha amakuru ] kugirango turebae mu muryango abari bashobora kuba bakiriho , tusanga ni papa nyine mu muryango wo kwa papa . na murumuna we ubaga ouganda , na mushiki we wunri ubaga i butare .
how many were they before ? ||| bari bangahe ?
they were five and 3 of them remained . ||| bari batanu , hasigara batatu .
in mother 's family , no one survived . ||| noneho kuri mama we nta n' umwe usigaye ,
not even one ! ||| habae n' umwe .
no one of her relatives survived ... so life went on ... ||| mubo bafite icyo bapfaan nibwo tuhise tumenya ko nta wunri usigaye tuhita tutangira kuba mu buzima busanzwe .
the flag used to go up every morning and everyone would stend still until it reaches up and then go about their activities . ||| kuzamura idarapo mu gitondo , mukahagarara mukategereza ko barizamura , mukabona kugenda kukora activites [ imirimo ] zanyu . noneho ariko icyo kihae niho yagiraaga ubuzima busaga nk' aho bumugora ,
at that time , it was n't easy for her working in such an atmosphere , they 'd first put up the flag before she could get inside the school courtyard . ||| kuko yavaaga ku ishuri kugirango yinjirae mu rugo bikamugora kuko babanzaaga kuzamura idarapo , kandi bakamucira mu maso ibintu nk' ibyo .
they 'd even spit on her face and such things ... there 's a time they attacked us at home , they said they were searching for a gun , affirming we had one but they could n't find one . ||| rimwe bwo bigeze no kututera bainjira badusaka bazi ko tufite imbunda , ariko barayibura . n' uko kutwika inzu ntabwo batuizeraaga mbese . baumvaaga ko hari ,
they thought there was ... before they imprisonned the ‘ spies ’ , dad 's younger brother who used to come home was suspected to be an inkotanyi ... he passed away . ||| hari ... mbere y' uko bafunga ibyitso hari murumuna wa papa ujyaaga ukunda kuhaza , bazi ko avuye mu nkotanyi , usibye ko yapfuye . bakagirango ni inkotanyi ,
they thought he was an inkotanyi and they used to think we were in contact with him . ||| bazi ko tufite contact [ uburyo tuvugana ] .
they 'd even come to cnd ... they used to send people to come and check if we had any contact with him but they never found out ... but in reality , we were in contact with him ... they were very suspicious about us and that 's why they 'd always burn our things . ||| usibye ko no muri cnd bazamo bo .... hari igihe hazaaga abantu bakabona ko mbese bahora bagenzura bakora enquete [ baperereza ] ngo barebae ko turi tufite contact [ uburyo tuvugana ] mu by' ukuri yari ihari . ariko bo basa nk' aho batuikeka cyane niyo mpamvu bakunze kutwika ibintu byacu .
how was it at the time of multiparty system ? ||| mbere igihe cy' amashyaka bwo ubonaaga bimeze bite ?
before the multiparty system ... i mean after , when the cdr , mrnd , mdr power propaganda started ... it started mostly when the inkotanyis came to cnd ... ||| mbere y' amashyaka ... nako nyuma batangiye kuzamura cdr , mrnd , mdr pawa ibintu nk' ibyo ... noneho cyane cyane bitangiye baje [ inkotanyi ] muri cnd ...
how was it ? ||| icyo kihae bigenze kutae ?
they first attacked the house , they come and search for things , they 'd come about twice a weeks ... that 's when we started fearing ... they were ... they 'd get everyone to sit down in the sitting room ... they 'd come , search around and go back , having found nothing . ||| batangiye kutera mu nzu , baza gusaka buri munsi , mu cyumweru bakaza nka kabiri . nibwo tutangiye kugira ubwoba . kandi ubona ukuntu bameze ubona ko ... babanzaaga kubicaza muri salon gutya ... bakaza bagasaka bakabona nta kintu kihari bakaongera bakagenda .
how were they when they 'd come to you ? ... what did they used to say ? ||| iyo bazaaga ubonaaga bameze batae ... bavugaaga iki ?
they used to come in a group , saying that tutsis were n't trustworthy . ||| babaga ari groupe bavuga ngo abo batutsi ntabwo bizewe ,
they were suspecting us to be hiding people or maybe to be in contact with the soldiers who were at cnd . ||| kuko baumvaaga y' uko mbese bakekaaga y' uko tufite abantu tuhishe niba tutabahishe tufite contact [ uburyo tuvugana ] yo muri cnd .
you told me your mom was hit by grenades ' fragments ... does she suffer any consequences today ? ||| wigeze kunbwira ko mama wawe hari eclat za grenade zamufashe , nta ngaruka bijya bimugiraho ?
abari bari mu kigero cyo ubu turimo nibo babaga babasigaranye akenshi . most of people knew each other then . ||| abenshi ni abantu babaga baziraanye .
i can not recall their names but they looked familiar although we did n't know everyone 's name ... they were people who lived in the same neighbourhood as us and so we knew each other . ||| amazina yo ntinkubwira ngo n' aba kuko ntabwo nbaibuka . amasura ubaga uyazi ariko amazina ... kuko ni abantu bo muri quartier [ mu ako kacae ] mwabaga muziraanye .
we even used to play football together despite the fact that they were older than us . the ones who had our age today were the ones to ... ||| baba bakuruta kandi turi abana tukina umupira abana ku bana abasore kuri twebwe ... abari bari mu kigero cyo ubu turimo nibo babaga babasigaraanye akenshi .
how many choldren were you in your family before ? ||| ubundi iwanyu mwari abana bangahe ?
six children . ||| abana batandatu .
six children . ||| muesae muriho ntawapfuye ?
only florence who was my older sister . ||| usibye uwo upfuye florence uri mukuru kuri jyewe w' umukobwa niwe upfuye .
do you know how they were killed ? ||| uzi uburyo yapfuye ?
she is the one who died ... she had gone to visit her godmother in gikongoro where she was killed with the children of the latter . ||| uwo niwe upfuye ... yari yaragiye kusura marraine [ nyina umubyaye muri batisimu ] we ku gikongoro , noneho niho yapfairiye hamwe n' abana be , hasigara umwana umwe , mu bana ba marraine we .
what do your parents do today ? ||| ubusae ababyeyi bawe bakora iki ?
as it was happening ... how can i explain it ? ... as a child , i used to think that 's just how things were . ||| mbere bibaho nbonaaga ari ibintu ... kubyexplika [ kubisobanura ] ... nkiri umwana nyine nbonaaga ari uko bimeze kusa .
i am not saying that they used to just kill people but as time went , we saw things getting worse ; you could pass by somewhere and witness somebody being taken away to be killed in the open . ||| ntinumvaaga ko hari umuntu bashobora kufata bakamwica .
so it was ... it was beyond what one could handle , you 'd reach a point where you 'd become insensible to what was going on . ||| usibye ko mu kugenda tubonaaga ko noneho ibintu bigenda bikomera . kuko ucaaga nk' ahantu ukabona baramusigaraanye baramwishe , ureba vis a vis [ imbonankubone ] noneho ukasanga ... birengaaga umutima ,
i t was so much that it was as though one had stopped being human . ||| noneho umuntu akamera nk' igiti . kuvuga bikakunanira noneho ukamera nk' aho utakiri umuntu .
how did your wounds come to heal ? ||| ibikomere byanyu bije kukira kutae ?
we were treated in byumba but they did n't heal right away as they were infected . ||| tubivuraije i byumba , ariko ntabwo bihise bikira kuko hazaagamo infection .
but after some ... when i was in ... the war started when i was in primary ii and when i was in primary iv is when those italians took me to italy twice for a check up . ||| ariko hashize ntangiye ... intambara yabaye niga deuxieme [ muwa kabiri ] ,
the first time i went , i was operated and then when i went back they did a check up . ||| ariko ntangiye quatrieme [ uwa kane ] nibwo abo bazungu twanye muri italie deux fois [ inshuro ebyiri ] bakora controle [ igenzura ] bwa mbere turagiye barambaaga nsa n' uwakize tusubirayo kukora controle [ igenzura ] nibwo bisa nk' aho bikize .
a bone near the brain had been affected by a fragment and they removed it and said it would get back into place as i was still growing up . ||| icyo kihae ariko igufa hafi y' ubwonko ryari rirafashwae na eclat ya grenade barivanamo ... bahita barivanamo baravuga bati @: "@ ubwo nkiri umwana bishobora kusubiraan neza . @"
we agreed that i 'll go back there after 5 years if necessary so they can implant an artificial bone . ||| noneho hashize iminsi ngarutse nyuma y' imyaka itanu n' uko turi tubaye tufite contrat [ amasezerano ] nshobora kusubirayo bibaye ngombaw baitaba ngombaw ... cyangwa biba ngombaw bakashyiramo plastique .
who are those white people ? ||| abo bazungu ni bantu ki ?
what were they here for exactly ? ||| bazaaga mu ruhae rwego ?
they are doctors who had come here to help out . ||| bo bazaaga ... ni aba docteur ubundi bazaaga baje kufasha ... umwe ni umupadiri ,
one of them is a priest and the rest are doctors who had come to visit the kicukiro health centre and to see what had happened in rwanda and know more details about it . ||| abandi ni abadocteur bazaaga baje kureba centre de sante ya kicukiro . baje kusura aho ngaho nyine , no kureba ibyabaye mu rwanda bakabimenya ku buryo bw' invaho .
how was byumba ? ||| ubuzima bw' i byumba buri bumeze kutae ?
life in byumba was like ... it was like starting in a new life . ||| ubuzima bw' i byumba busaga nk' aho ... ni nk' uko turi tutangiye ubuzima bushyashya .
apart from the pain , from seeing some people crying , others dying due to the wounds . ||| usibye kubabara , kubona abantu bamwe barira , abandi bakapfair mu bitaro kubera ibikomere ,
it was a new life after the shootings , bombings , screaming ... it was like going back to a normal life . ||| ubundi busaga nk' aho tutangiye ubundi buzima butaumva amasasu , butaumva iki ... induru ... buri ubuzima busa nk' aho tugiye kutangira ubuzima busanzwe .
how do you compare it to life before genocide ? ||| wabutugereranyiriza utae n' ubuzima bwa mbere ya jenoside ?
he fled with other people but we do n't know who they were , we even tried finding out who they were but we never found out . ||| kusa ngo yahungaanye n' abandi abo banri ntitushoboye kubamenya tutanga n' amatangazo atandukanye , ariko ntabwo tushoboye kubamenya .
even the godmother 's daughter who survived does n't know exactly what happened ... she just remembers them leaving , each one in their own direction , she was behind and she never saw them again ... ||| n' uwo usigaye kwa marraine we umukobwa we ... nawe ntabwo yamenye uko bigenze . we yatubwiye kusa ko babonye bagiye , aca aha n' undi aca aha we niwe uri usigaye inyuma bose baragenda , niho bahise bapfair .
do you find it easy living with the people who betrayed you , how do you handle such a thing ? ||| wowe wunva bitakugoye kubaan n' abantu uzi ko bakuhemukaiye , ubwo buzima wunva bumeze kutae ?
living such a life is of course affecting us in a way but we need to endure life and accept reconciliation as they say . ||| kuri ubwo buzima nyine kububamo ubabona , bifite aho bitusha [ toucher @: bikukoraho ] umuntu ariko rero umuntu agomba kuihanganair ubuzima , akaemera reconciliation kwa kunri babivuga .
but ... life goes on despite the scars that are obvious to everyone . ||| ariko rero ... mbese ubuzima urabukomeza n' ubwo uba ufite cicatrice [ inkovu ] ureba nabo babona ,
they also see them and it certainly affects them as much as it affects us . ||| mbese bifite aho bibatusha [ ubuyo bibakoraho ] ntawe bifite aho bidutusha [ uko bitukoraho ] nyine .
do you think unity will be possible ? ||| iyo reba ubona kuiyunga bizashoboka ?
it will be difficult to see it happen but it will come with time . ||| bizaba difficile [ biraruhije ] kugirango bibaeho ,
as people will get to give out their testimony or get to tell what happened to them in public , they 'll feel released . ||| ariko kuiyunga byo bizaba au fur et a mesure [ buhoro buhoro ] y' uko abantu bagomba ... umuntu agenda atanga temoignage akaumva aruhutse mu mutaima , cyangwa avuze ibyabaga bimukomereye inberae y' abantu .
i believe we will one day reach unity . ||| nbona kuiyunga bizagera aho bikagerawho .
how do you think unity could be built ? ||| none se ubwo buiyungae wowe ubona bukorwa butae ?
the advantage of unity ... meaning that he 's the one to make the first step . ||| akamaro k' ubwiyunge n' ukuvuga ko iyo wiyunze n' ukuvuga ko ... we niwe uza bwa mbere .
you consider his attitude , the way he usually behaves ... he should be the one to make the first step . ||| ukareba umutima abizanaanye , niba uri usanzwe umubona , ubundi niwe utera intambwe ya mbere yo kuiyunga .
he most probably will be thinking that you 're still holding grudges towards him . ||| we aba akubona nk' aho ukimufiteho inzika .
when you 're still bitter towards him ... he comes to you and tells you in details everything he did and says how sorry he is about it all . ||| igihe ukimufiteho inzika ... igihe ukifite inzika rero , we iyo ateye intambwe araza akakubwira ati @: nkoze iki akakubwira historique y' ibyo yaba yarakoze ,
he is sorry about it because there is no way it would leave him indifferent and if he were n't , then he would n't come to you . ||| noneho akakubwira ati @: "@ biranbabaje . @" biramubabaje kuko nta kuntu bimushimaish , kandi niba bikimushimaishije ntabwo yahita abikubwira .
from the heart , you 're then able to tell him that it is okay and even though it will n't resurrect them , at least he 's shown you that he 's become human as opposed to before when he was inhuman ; then you ... you can be united without a problem . ||| ariko ku mutaima wawe ushobora kumubwira uti ca va n' ubwo wenda batazuka ariko unyeretse ko ushobora kuba urabaye umuntu , ubundi mbere uri igikoko noneho ukahita ... nta kibazo noneho mukaiyunga .
but unity will not automatically come , it will be built with time as you talk and keep seeing each other ||| ariko ubwiyunge ntabwo buhita buba icyo kihae uko mugenda muganira habaho contact [ kushyikirana ] nibwo ubona ko mwiyunze koko , niko nvuga .
how do you feel about the future ? ||| ubona utae ejo hazaza ?
suspicion will go with time . ||| urwikekwe ruzagenda rushair gahoro gahoro .
but there are some things you simply can not erase from the heart , some people do n't believe we should live in unity , they can not erase it from their hearts but it will come slowly . ||| ariko hari ibyo utahanagura mu mutaima kuko nk' uwo hari abadashobora kuhita wunva ko bagomba kuiyunga , harimo abadashobora kuhita babihanagura mu mutaima , ukaumva rero au fur et a mesure bigenda biza gahoro gahoro .
it 's been ten years since genocide happened in rwanda ... what changes do you see ? ||| hashize imyaka icumu mu rwanda habaye jenoside ... wowe ubona ari iki kihindutse ... ?
the way things were in 1995 is not the way they were in 2000 . ||| uraumva yuko icyenda na gatanu yari [ 1995 ] imeze , siko deux mille [ 2000 @: ibihumbi bibiri ] imeze .
everything was still very fresh on people 's minds in 1995 ... you 'd see somebody and immediately suspect him or her of being something else ... but as the years go by and things happen , as life changes , the way we think also changes as we learn new things . ||| ni ukuvuga y' uko icyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] bwo umutwe uri ukishyushye ibiki byose ... ureba n' umuntu ukaba ukahita umwikangamo ikindi kintu . ariko uko imyaka igenda ishira , n' ubuzima bugenda bubaho , niko bisa nk' aho bihindura mu buzima ibyo utekereza ;
maybe at first i had a problem wih going back to school , i kept remembering wherever i 'd be , while sleeping , walking or sitting on my own and that was a big issue . ||| ibyo wiga . kuko wenda kuiga bwa mbere birangoraaga kuko ubonaaga ukuntu ibintu bimeze , nkahora nbiibuka nryamye cyangwa nrimo kugenda ahandi hantu . cyangwa nicaye jyenyine ukasanga ibintu biragenda bigoraan .
but today , we talk about it for example in aerg . ||| ariko ubungubu turabiganira ,
survivors exchange ideas and share each other 's experience and it removes a certain weight and one feels lighter . ||| tukasabana numva nko mu muryango wa aerg [ ishyirahamwe ry' abanyeshuri bacitse ku icumu rya jenoside ] ni urugero . abarescape [ abacitse ku icumu ] muraganira mu bitekerezo , nabo bakakubwira ibindi mukavuga uko mwabayeho muesae .
you start living with others in harmony . ||| ukasanga iyo mubivuga bifite icyo bigabanuraho mu buzima bwanyu . ukaumva utangiye kuba muri societe [ mu bantu ] , ukabaho neza .
how do you see rwanda 's future ? ||| ubona u rwanda rugana he mu kihae kizaza ?
we have the vision 2020 but again ... ||| birashoboka y' uko tufite vision 2020 [ icyerekezo 2020 ] ariko rero ...
what kind of a country do you think the future generations will be living in ? ||| ubona abana bazaba mu rwanda mu kihae kizaza , bazaba mu gihugu kimeze kitae ... ?
before i even talk about that , i 'd like to say that today 's rwanda is very different from the way it used to be . ||| mbere y' uko nvuga ngo abana bazaba mu rwanda rumeze rutae ... u rwanda ukundi rumeze ubungubu na mbere urabona harimo difference .
before , only one part of the rwandan population could express themselves freely , while another one could n't . ||| nka mbere hari igice cy' abanyarwanda kigomba kuvuga , n' ikindi kitagomba kuvuga .
but today it seems more open to both sides as long as there are no divisional ideas into it . ||| ariko ubungubu bisa nk' aho bibaye mixte [ uruvangae ] muesae mushobora kuvuga nta kibazo . usibye utagomba kushyiramo amacakubiri .
before , there was so much division , people 's ethnic groups were written on identity cards but today it 's stopped . ||| mbere hari amacakubiri ukaba utavuga ikintu , mu ndangamuntu harimo ubwoko none ntibukirimo . noneho ariko ubu avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' u rwanda uko nyibona , bitewe b' ibyo birangiye bikaba bigenda isa nk' aho bicika ,
about the way i see rwanda 's future , when i look at the things that used to be and that are no longer there , i believe things can only get better . ||| nbona y' uko bizagera aho bikatera inberae . nk' abana noneho bazatukomokaho , bazabona archive kuko basoma ibitabo bavugae bati @: "@ biri bimeze gutya ,
our children will go through the country 's archives and find out how things used to be and they will want to understand why things were that way . ||| ese kuki biri bimeze gutya . @" bakabona amakasete , bakavuga bati @: "@ biri biragenze gutya ,
they will also see how things have improved and maybe say that then , things were on level 0 and will maybe be estimating them at +15 or +20 . ||| ariko noneho ubungubu turabona ubuzima busa nk' aho bubaye bwiza kurushaho . @" noneho bavuga bati @: "@ difference [ itandukaniro ] biri muri zero ... none bigeze kuri +15 , cyangwa +20 gutyo .
do you believe there 'll be development ? ||| wowe rero ubona hazabaho iterambere ?
i am a student and i can go forward through my studies or in the area in which i 'd like to pursue my education . ||| mu buzima bwanjye nnjyae ndi umunyeshuri nshobora kutera inberae mu byo niga , cyangwa domaine yanjye nshaka kugeraho .
i study computers . ||| niga gestion informatique ,
i have just finished secondary school and i am going on with my studies . ||| nrangije secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] ni ukukomeza amashuri .
a job is something you have to look for , it does n't just come to you . ||| noneho rero emploi [ akazi ] urayishakisha ntabwo ikuizanira .
then life will be good , no one wants to live a bad life . ||| noneho ubuzima bukazaba bwiza , ntawe ushaka kubaho ubuzima butari bwiza .
many people will watch this testimony , probably among them will be your future children . ||| ubu buhamya buzarebaw n' abantu benshi barimo n' abana bawe ,
what message would you like to give to those who will watch it ? ||| ni iyihe message [ ubutumwa ] uha abazabureba ?
the message i 'd like to give them is to look for the message that 's in it when they watch it . ||| message nbaha ni uko nibayibona bazareba message irimo . iyo message niyo nshaka kubabwira yuko ... nkababwira yuko bagomba kubitekerezaho ,
that 's the message i 'd like to give them ... i 'd to encourage them to think it through so it never happens again , to keep it in their hearts so that the same thing does n't happen again or we find ourselves in the same situation all over again . ||| ntibizaongerae kubaho . kuko niyo mpamvu tuyitanga , ntibizabaeho . kandi babizirikanae mu mitima yabo ,
i 'd encourage people to think through the different things they 'll see on different recordings . ||| igihe bazaba babireba , kugirango ubuzima butazaba vice versa [ gatebe gatoki ] cyangwa butazahinduka ngo busubirae aho buri buri . nraumva bagomba kutekereza kubyo babonye kuri cassette zitandukanye bazaba babona .
how would you describe rwanda ? ||| ubundi usobanura utae u rwanda ?
rwanda is a country inhabited by people called rwandans . ||| u rwanda ni igihugu kituwe n' abaturage baitwa abanyarwanda .
people who have had different lives ... their problem is that there are tribes among them and some of them started killing each other , it 's been acknowledged that genocide occurred . ||| ariko rero babayeho mu buryo butandukanye bagira ... bagize ikibazo cy' uko habayeho ubwoko hazaba kuba ikibazo cy' uko bamwe bashaka kuicana , jenoside .
genocide happened against the tutsi tribe just like there was genocide against the jews . ||| jenoside ikaba yaremewe ko yabayeho . ni ukumenya ko habayeho jenoside ,
the tutsis in rwanda were genocided . ||| noneho jenoside yo ku bwoko bumwe bw' abatutsi , nk' uko habayeho jenoside y' abayisiraheri , habaho na jenoside y' abatutsi batuye mu gihugu cy' u rwanda .
but now it is coming to an end as rwandans are reconciling . ||| ariko bikaba bisa nk' aho birimo kugenda bishira bitewe n' uko abanyarwanda bagenda habaho reconciliation [ ubwiyunge ] .
what do you call genocide ? what proves that it happened according to you ? ||| wowe ni iki wita jenoside , ni iki kigaragaza ko yabayeho ?
genocide ... genocide happened ... because one does n't want the other one from a different tribe to be alive ... from the tutsi tribe , he or she does n't want him to be there , he or she does n't consider him or her as a fully @-@ fledged human being . ||| jenoside ... jenoside yabayeho . kubera ko umuntu atashaka ko mugenzi w' ubwoko runaka ... w' ubwoko bw' ubututsi , atamushakira y' uko yabaho .
his or her only wish is that the other person would get out of his or her sight and this happens through killing the other person , as that would make it possible never to see him or her again in his or her entire life . ||| akaumva we atari umuntu . we uko abiumva noneho ikifuzo cye cya mbere ari uko yamuva i ruhande , kumuva iruhande n' ukuvuga y' uko ashaka kumwica . ku buryo atamubona mu buzima bwe .
anything you 'd like to add to your testimony ? ||| ntacyo ukaongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe ?
i 'd like to add that i believe unity will be attained in rwanda in this generation . ||| nkaongeraho yuko ubwiyunge bushobora kugerawho mu rwanda rw' iki kihae turimo .
my name is ruhurambuga marcel . ||| nitwa ruhurambuga marcel ,
i was born in a place formerly called mukingi commune , but now known as ntenyo district in gitarama district . ||| nvuka ahahoze ari commune mukingi , ubungubu ni akarere ka ntenyo muri province ya kitaarama ,
we were eight brothers and sisters in my family . ||| nvukana n' abana barindwi , ubwo njyaho nkaba uwa munani .
during the genocide four died , which means four others remained ; two sisters and two brothers died . and there are two two sisters and two brothers who survived in the whole family . ||| muri genocide hapfuye bane hasigara abandi bane . hapfuye abakobwa babiri hasigara bahungu babiri hapfa abandi abahungu bibiri hasigara abandi bahungu babiri .
the first born was a girl ; she was then married . ||| umukobwa niwe uri imfura , we yari yarashatse ,
then the second and the third born were boys , i was the fifth born . ||| hagakurikiraho umuhungu , hagakurikiraho undi muhungu , jyae nkaza ndi uwa gatanu .
our first born was called mukayiranga rose and the second born was called burabyo gabriel ; he died in the genocide . ||| uw' imfura yitwaaga mukayiranga rose , umukurikiye yitwaaga burabyo gabriel , yarapfuye muri genocide ,
the third born was called rudahunga michael ; he also died , then mukakimenyi marceline who died also . ||| hakurikiyeho rutahunga michel yarapfuye , hagakurikiraho uwitwaga muka ... [ ijwi ntiriumvikana ] hagakurikiraho uwitwaga mukakimenyi marceline yarapfuye .
my father 's names were hategekimana gakuba . ||| papa ni hetegekimana kakuba .
in brief , the genocide in the gitarama area did not start in the last days . ||| muri make , kubuzima muri genocide , cyane cyane muri kariya karerae ko hagati ka kitaarama , ntabwo bibaye mu matariki ya nyuma ,
because i remember how habyarimana 's plane was crashed on the sixth at night , and we got the news in the morning of 7th . ||| kubera ko ari hagati nraibuka ko indege ya habyarimana yamanutse ku itariki indwi , mu ijoro ry' italiki ya gatandatu , tubimenya ku italiki ya karindwi .
our district was neighbouring that of kabagali , previousily known as masango . ||| akarere kacu , kuko kaegereye aka kabagali aho baitaaga muri masango ,
many people used to pass by coming from kibuye heading to kabgayi . sometimes they would pass by home and we would give them food . ||| ahajya hahita abantu benshi baturutse ku kibuye bahunga bajya i kabgayi ndetse bakanyura n' iwacu bamwe tukabafungurair , ariko twebwe genocide ,
the massive killings in our region started on 21st of april . ||| kutema bitangiye ku italiki ya makumyabiri n' imwe z' ukwezi kwa kane .
that was when the killings started and many people were fleeing from kibuye . ||| nibwo batangiye kutema ndetse muri iyo minsi iyo abantu bavaaga ku kibuye bahunga ,
i remember some people used to go for patrols and some of them used to ask my elder bothers to join them in the tour of duty . ||| hari abantu ... bya bintu byo kurara amarondo abantu bamwe bazaaga bakatwara bakuru banjye bati @: "@ muzae tujyae kurara amarondo bakagenda bakayarara ,
therefore , they would join them and make rounds . ||| ariko nyuma baje kuigishwa n' abakonseye ,
later on , the people who used to call my brothers for patrols were mislead by the counsellors and the bergomaster who was called nsabimana basile and they stopped making patrols and started burning people 's homes instead . ||| n' uwahoze ari burugumesitiri wacu yitwaaga nsabimana basile babivamo batangira kutwika .
about my family , we lived in rutagara sector in bamagayo cell . ||| ngiye nko ku muryango w' iwacu , tutuye muri segiteri yitwa rutagara ,
we were the only tutsis who lived in that cell ... my father was the only tutsi who lived there . ||| serile yitwa bamagayo iyo serile tuteyemo ngirango hafi ya yose nitwae turi tuhatuye ... papa niwe mututsi uri uhatuye wenyine .
he was the only one who remained there in 1959 ; all his brothers fled but he remained there because he was studying . ||| kuko ngirango no muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda ari nawe uhasigaye wenyine , abandi bari bavindimwe bari barahunze , arahasigara kuko yarigaga we ,
and then when he completed his studies he married and ended up the only tutsi living in the area [ where we were born ] . ||| arashaka , aba ari nawe uhatura wenyine , nta wunri mututsi uri uri hangaho muri ako karerae , muri iyo serile tuvukamo .
the genocide started but our neighbours confused us ; during the 1959 war , when my dad came from school , he found when all his brothers had fled . ||| genocide yaje kuza rero , ahantu bije kubera urujijo kuri twebwe , abantu tuturanye . nk' uko muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda papa yaje kuva ku ishuli ,
grandpapa was already dead ; that is what we have been told as their story . ||| yaraje nta mukuru we yasanze , sogokuru yari yarapfuye mu mateka niko babitubwiraaga ,
it was their hutu neighbours who came and took him up ; they looked after him , built him a house , gave him back their cows and and when he reached time to marry , they got him a wife . ||| abo baturanyi b' abahutu kandi nibo baje baramwakira , baramwubakira inka barazimusubiza ,
in other words , they were like his parents or his only relatives . ||| baramushakira ,
they were the closest people he had . ||| baramushyingira mbese ari nkabo bavandimwe afite .
he always used to invite them on all special occasions . ||| uraumva ko ari nabo yagombaaga kwitabaza muri ibyo birori bye ,
after they married , they had eight children , still in the same cell . ||| aratubyara turi abana umunani , yatubyaraiye muri iyo serile ,
we neither had an uncle nor an aunt in that area . ||| nta wunri mu ... data wacu tugiraaga aho , nta masenge tugiraaga aho ngaho ,
the closest relatives we had were in gitarama towards the town called karama in shyogwe . ||| abandi bavandimwe tugiraaga aho hafi bari za kitaarama ahagana mu mugi aho baita i karama i shyogwe .
others lived in kibungo where they resided after surviving the 1959 war . ||| abandi babaga za kibungo ba batutsi baciraiye yo muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda .
therefore , when genocide started in 1994 , thing happened the usual way . ||| genocide rero ibaye muri mirongo cyenda na kane ,
be it the hens we owned , be it the cattle , be it the rabbits , all our livestocks were taken by the neighburs as they normally did whenever there was a war . ||| bibaye nka kwa kunri . ari inkoko turi tutunze , ari inka , ari urukwavu ,
they gathered everything and said to us , "@ do n't worry , nothing will happen to you . @" ||| byose . abo baturagae bose baraje nka kwa kunri , baradukorakoranya bati @: "@ muhumurae nta kintu muzaba baratuigabanya batushyira mu ngo ,
they divided our livestock between themselves ; some took two cows , others took three , others took goats and we saw them take everything with our own eyes . ||| ari utwara inka ebyiri , ari utwara eshatu , ari utwara ihene imwe ,
some took hens ... they just took anything they came across . ||| byose tubonaaga ahantu bigiye ari utwara inkono , ari utwara icyo ari cyo cyose .
they moved us with the intention of hidding us but they were n't sincere . ||| baratuhisha biitwa ko batuhishe ariko muby' ukuri ntago bari batuhishe .
tutsis would come from kibuye fleeing towards kabgayi and we would see them living but we stayed in our neighbours ' homes . ||| abatutsi baturukaaga za kibuye bakajya za kabgayi baragendaaga tubireba , tuguma mu ngo z' abo baturanyi .
things continued like that until around the first dates of may . ||| birakomeza , birakomeza , birakomeza nraibuka ko mu mataliki ya mbere z' ukwezi kwa gatanu ,
i remember a certain boy who was our neighbour but who had joined habyarimana 's army , he had been shot on the elbow . ||| niho haje kuza umusore w' umusirikare turi tuturanye wo kwa habyarimana , bari barashe mu nkokora witwaga shyaka ,
his name was shyaka the son of nsengiyumva innocent . and then he came and said , "@ you have n't yet killed nicolas ? @" ||| mwene nsengiyumva innocent araza ati @: "@ na n' ubu ntabwo murica nikora ? @"
[ nicolas was my father 's name ] they all went crazy , i think they killed him in the beginning of may . ||| ari we data . barasara ! ngirango bamwishe mu mataliki ya mbere z' ukwa gatanu rwose ,
i do n't remember the day neither the date but he was the first to be killed . ||| ntinibuka itariki n' umunsi ,
they got him but they first took all of us . ||| niwe babanje kuica papa . baramufashe ,
by the way , i think i am mistaken ; that boy shyaka found when my father had already been killed . ||| ubaw mbere na mbere baratushoreraan ... ariko uwo musore witwa shyaka yaje data yarapfuye , niba ntibeshye yaje data yarapfuye .
then he said , "@ how could you kill nicolas and live his children ? @" ||| ahubwo yaje data yarapfuye aravuga ati @: "@ nigute mwakwica nikora mukasiga abana be ? @"
he went on to say , "@ it 's impossible . @" ||| ati @: "@ ntibishoboka ibyo ngibyo . @"
in the beginning of may , they took all of us with dad , saying that they were taking us to the district , at mukingi commune . ||| muri ayo matariki ya mbere z' ukwa gatanu . data baramufashe ntawe n' umuryango we wose baratushorera bavuga ngo batujyanye ku karerae , ngo kuri komine yitwaaga mukingi .
at the commune they would put people in the buses and take them to kabgayi , i do n't know what used to take place there at kabgayi because i never went there . ||| kuko barahageraaga bakabapakira amabisi bakajyana i kabgayi , i kabgayi naho ibyahaberaga simbizi ntinhabaye .
they took my dad and mum and my young brother who was called serubibi guido and my sister mukakimenyi marcelline . ||| data baramufashe . baramushorera ari kumwe na mama na karumuna kanjye kaitwa serubibi guido , na mushiki wanjye witwaga mukakimenyi marceline .
they took them saying that they were taking them to the district 's offices . ||| barabashorera bavuga ngo babajyanye ku karerae .
somewhere on the way , they put my mum aside . ||| bageze mu nzira mama baramufata bamushyira ku ruhande ,
one of the militias made my young brother escape through the millet plantation that was around because he was aware of what was going to be done to those people . ||| ka karumuna kanjye hari umuntu ukafashe akajugunya mu masaka kuko bari bazi igikorwa bagiye kukora ,
later his companions looked for my brother , a certain man who was nicknamed nangwahafi samuel , his real name was ntezimana samuel , looked for my brother asking , "@ where did guido go ? ||| nyuma baje no kukashaka umugabo witwa nangwahafi samuel arko iryo ni irihimbano ubundi yitwa ntezimana samuel , aranakashaka aravuga ati @: "@ guido agiye he ,
where is he ? @" ||| guido agiye he ? @"
but they never found him . ||| baramubura .
when we were exhuming and re @-@ burying his remains from that bush , i realized that they stoned him to death , because we found stones on top of his head and his skeleton was tied up with ropes . ||| ahantu baje kumutaba nje kubibona nyuma , tujya kumutaburura amagufa ye tusanze baramugeretseho amabuye baramuzirika .
the following day at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon , i was attacked in my hide out at munyawera 's home . ||| bucyeye bw' aho nko mu ma saa cyenda , nnjyae baje kunvumbura ahantu mu rugo rw' uwitwa munyawera ,
there lived a man called katabandama eugene in the neighborhood but he did not know i was hiding around there . ||| hatuye umuhungu witwaga katabandama eugene . nta nubwo bari baziko nihishe aho hantu . imbeho yaranyishe hanze ,
it was very cold ; i went and climbed their fence very slowly before they woke up . ||| nraza gahoro batarabyuka nurira urugo ,
i went into an ‘ umuvure ’ [ a traditional thing used for making banana wine with the shape of a boat ] and entered in the cow 's manger in which i found kept manure and used it to cover myself . ||| njya munsi ya mangeoire y' inka [ hariya inka zirair ] ninjiramo mu kintu kimeze nk' ikivurae niyorosa ibintu by' ibifumbire .
maybe someone saw me . ||| niba ari umuntu unbonye akanranga simbizi .
i do n't know what happened ; i just saw people searching in that house and later came to find me . ||| baraje basaka urwo rugo , baza no kuinjiramo baranbona .
i remember i was wearing a yellow dress ; so they took me out of the manger . ||| icyo kihae nri niambitse n' igikanzu cy' umuhondo baransohora .
it was shyaka and a female interahamwe called mukakare , shyaka 's brother called aphrodis munyanziza plus many others whose names i did n't know . ||| yari uwo muhungu witwa shyaka , hari interahamwe y' umugore yitwa mukakarera , hari mukuru wa shyaka witwa aphrodis munyanziza n' abandi benshi cyane ntabashije kumenya .
they made me stand out of the manger and took my clothes off . ||| barahanvana bashyira ku muharuro , banyicaza ahongaho imyenda baranyambura ,
however , they left me with my trousers and a shirt . my mother was also around but like in the previous instances , she was not harmed . ||| ya kanzu barayinyambura kikoze i pantalo nri nambaye barayinrekera . n' umupira na mukecuru wanjye yari ahari .
she was just left to live in misery and trauma for loosing all her family . ||| noneho mukecuru baramureka , mukecuru baramureka bati @: "@ wowe uzaicwae n' agahinda . @" baranshorera ,
they took me ; whipping my legs all the way and took me to a place called kabuga where i was subjected to the worst torture you can ever imagine . ||| bagenda bankubita amaguru , bantwara ahantu hakurya y' iwacu , ahantu baita mu kabuga . ngezeyo batangira kunkorera torture yose ibaho ;
they beat me up , spat in my face , and forced me to move on my knees and elbows . ||| ari ukubita , ari unshira mu maso , ari ungendaish ibyo baitaaga amashanya kushinga amavi ukagendaish inkokora ,
in brief , they did everything they wished with me . ||| mbese ibintu byose baumva baifuza barabinkorera .
shyaka asked me where my brother gabriel was and in response , i asked him if he did n't know where he had put him the previous night . ||| ndetse uwitwa shyaka we araambaza ati @: "@ ariko mukuru wawe gabriel arihehe ? @" nramubwira nti @: ese aho uraye umushyize ntuhazi ?
"@ listen to the way tutsi are arrogant . @" ||| ati @: "@ umva uko abatutsi babaye . @"
he said then he kicked me on the chest . he laid me on the ground and hit me hard on the back . he grabbed me and hit every part of my body . ||| antikura umugeri mu katuza . anrambika hasi , ikintu kaitwa umugongo arakikubita kweri . arakubita bene ahangaha aho baita mu kanyamunzu .
i sat there and after a short while , a boy called joseph the son of murengerantwari came . ||| nicara ahongaho , mu mwanya muto haza kuza umuhungu witwa joseph mwene murengerantwari ,
it was his father murengerantwari , who was hiding my cousin 's wife . my cousin was called bihezande he was also killed . ||| ise uwo witwa murengerantwari yari ahishe umugore wa mukuru wanjye kwa data wacu witwaga bihezande yarapfuye .
then those perpetrators ordered joseph to go and pick up the sorcerer that was hiding in their home . he went there and brought a lady with him . ||| bati @: "@ genda utusohoraire umurozikazi uri murugo iwanyu . @" aragenda aramwisoherera ku mugaragaro aramuzana batwicaza aho ngaho ,
we were made to sit there and they hit us ... and around 7:00 p.m. they tied our arms on our backs . ||| baraduhondaguraa ... hageze nko mu kihae cyo ma saa moya z' umugoroba , nibwo baje kutufata baratuboha .
they used a piece of cloth that she would wrap on her head to tie her . ||| we bamubohesheje igitambaro yari afite mu mutawe ,
as for me , they used the t @-@ shirt i was wearing and passed it on the chest and tied my arms behind . ||| njyae ... [ mpereza iyo shati yawe gatoya ] baranfata , bafata umupira nri nambaye , bawucaish mu katuza gutya babohair amaboko inyuma .
they took us to mr. silas ' ruined home and made us sit there near the septic tank , where people fleeing from kibuye were thrown after being hacked . [ the same people i mentioned before . ] ||| baratushorera batujyana ku itongo ry' umuntu witwa silas uri utuye hafi ahongaho , batwicaza hejuru y' umwobo w' umusarane ukoreshwaaga bawunagagamo n' abandi abantu b' abanyakibuye nbabwiraaga bahungaaga .
those that they would ambush were taken there . ||| abo batangirairaga mu nzira niho bajyaaga kubaroha muri ako kacae abo bafashe bakajya kubaroha ahongaho .
i was the first one to be caught . ||| ninjye babanje kufata bwa mbere ,
i thought they were going to kill me . ||| njyae nbonaaga ko bagiye kutuica nta kinri kintu bagiye kutukoresha ,
i was made to sit on top of the pit with my legs hanging over it ; i was tied up . ||| nraicaye hejuru y' umwobo noherezayo amaguru . nohereje yo amaguru nraicara urabona ko bari banboshye ikintu baje kukora ,
however no one wanted to kill me , i had been in the same school with most of the perpetrators . ||| baje gusiganira kunyica . bakajya bahamagara umuntu ngo anyicae abenshi bari abanyeshuri tuiganye ,
therefore , whoever they would tell to kill me would go back because i would look straight in his eyes . ||| nakebuka gutya nmureba umwana akagenda . nakebuka gutya nmureba umwana akagenda .
then another group of interahamwe came , shyaka and alex [ i do n't know his other name ] were among them . all i know about alex is that he was a son to muneza yohana [ john ] . ||| haza kuza interahamwe yazanye n' uwo musirikare witwa shyaka yitwa alex ntinzi irinri zina rye ry' ikinyarwanda nzi ko ise yitwa muneza yohani ,
then alex asked , "@ look at that cretin as tall as rwigemera ! ||| ati @: "@ iryo shyano rireshya na rwigemera , ati @:
i will show you what i will do with him . @" ||| henga nzae nbaerekae uko nrigenza . @"
it was late in the evening and it was dark ; one could n't see clearly . ||| hari hamaze kuba mukajorojoro , hatagaragara neza ,
then he got a hammer wanting to hit me on the head , somehow i moved the head and he hit on the neck . ||| afata inyundo azi ko agiye kuyinkubita mu mutawe ,
he hit me three times and i do n't know how i got into the pit . ||| ntinzi ni imaan yatumye mpengeka umusaya ataikura hano ku gikanu inshuro eshatu . nkubeshye nkubwira ngo ngeze mu mwobo ryari .
i do n't know if it is someone who pushed me there , or if i went in by myself . ||| niba ari uwansunitse , niba arijyae wijyanyemo simbizi . n' igihe nmazemo ntinkizi .
i only remember the moment when i gained conscious and found myself lying on my stomach in faeces @/ excrements . ||| kusa ikintu nibuka , nagaruye ubwenge nsanga nrambaraye nubitse inda mu musaraane urimo amabyi ,
it was a latrine that had already been used . ||| bari barawukoresheje .
but the piece of cloth , which they had used to tie me , had loosened and my arms were like this ... i noticed that they had thrown bricks on me . ||| ariko wa mupira uko bakawunyambitse uri uhambutse amaboko amaze gutya .
fortunately , the bricks fell on the side ; they did not hit me . ||| noneho nsanga banazae ibitafari hejuru yanjye ariko bitanguyeho biguye ku mpande yawo .
i do n't know what they did to my sister @-@ in @-@ law , whom we were together , up there . ||| ikindi nzanzamutse wa mugorae wa mukuru wanjye ibyo basigaye bamukorera hejuru iyo simbizi ibyo ari byo byose baramuviyoye [ kufata ku ngufu ] uko bigenda kose ,
but i guess they raped her and then she was dumped into the pit upside down while she was still tied up . ||| bamunazemo bamucuritse ,
all her bones at this level [ he shows ] were broken ; her pelvic bones were crashed . ||| akiboshye . aya magufa ,
she was agonizing intensly in excrements . ||| izi za os iliaques zose bazimenaguye umugore arimo ahiritira mu mabyi .
i tried to come out of the latrine by stepping on the bricks . i tried to take her out of it too and removed the piece of cloth that was tied on her . ||| nrazamutse mpagarara kuri ya matafari . umudamu nramuzamura igitambaro nrakihambura , maze kukihambura ,
i tried to make her stand but she could n't because these bones [ he shows ] were crashed . ||| ariko nmuhagarika nkabona ntahagarara kubera iyi ntuza barayi ... amafuni bari bakubise ahangaha amagufa bayamenaguye .
she was screaming a lot ! ||| akataka cyanee !
i imagined ; "@ someone screaming like this yet naked , no joints , the knee bones are crashed , nothing ... @" all her bones were crashed . ||| nrareba nti umuntu urimo kutaka gutya , nkoze hano nu ... yambaye ubusa ahantu hose , nsanga wapi . nta rugingo ruzima afite ari mu mavi ,
i left her because i could see she had no life yet i was also dying myself . ||| ari hano hose bamenaguye . nramurekura , kuko nbonaaga nta bunri buzima afite ,
then i started fighting to get out of the pit . ||| nnjyae ubwanjye ntariho noneho nrwana no kuzamuka .
it was a circular shaped pit and when i was almost reaching the top i slipped and fell back into the pit . ||| uri umusarane ukoze nka cercle [ uruziga ] nrambuye amaguru gutya nrawuheza , nkajya nshinga inkokora nkazamuka nshinga inkokora nkazamuka , ngeze hejuru bya bienda byose uko nri nkibiambaye usibye icyo gikanzu bankuyemo n' umukandara n' inkweto , nta ... nta kinri bigeze banyambura .
i again tried to come out ; i stepped on the bricks that they had thrown in the pit and in the bricks , there was a stick pointing up . ||| nraongera ntahanuka nikubitamo kuko haranyerairaga uraumva umusarane bakoresheje . nraongera nrazamuka kukunri ngize amahirwe muri ya matafari hagati hari hashinzemo igiti kihagaze , nsa nukizamuka nkisega .
therefore , i got support from that stick and came out . ||| ngeze hejuru hari agati kamwe k' umutambiko nrakafata nohereza amaguru mu kiraire , aba ariyo abanza kujya i musozi nrikurura nvamo .
there was another stick that was hanging across the pit , i held it and finally got a way out of the pit . ||| ariko ubwo bwa kabiri ngwa nkagezemo kubera ibyo bienda biri byajandamye nbikuramo ,
but when i fell back in the latrine for the second time , it was because all my clothes were wet . ||| ikabutura n' umupira .
therefore , i removed everything and remained only in my underwear . ||| byose mpikuramo nsigaraan aga sous @vetement niko nzamukaanye .
did you fall back into it twice ? ||| uguyemo kabiri ?
yes , i feel into it twice . ||| yee , naguyemo kabiri .
when i got on top , i was in dilemma , wondering where i should go . ||| ngeze hejuru rero nrareba biranshobera , nibaza ahantu ngiye mu by' ukuri , nibaza ahantu ndi buerekezae ,
i started thinking about the way i could go back and save the woman that i had left inside the latrine . ||| biranshobera .
i thought of whom i could ask for help to save the lady . however , i could n't think of anybody who could respond positively to my request for help . ||| nibaza wa wunri nsizemo hasi , nubwo bamuhondaguye ibyo aribyo byose umuntu yamukuyamo nibaza umuntu njya kutakira ,
while still thinking , i heard the same group of people who had dumped us in the latrine coming back . ||| wapi ! mu kihae nkitekereza gutyo ,
they were coming from a center called kabuga , in kanjevuba area area . ||| numva ikiriri cya ba bantu bamaze kututamo baragarutse bavuye ku kandi ga centre ko hepfo uvuye aho ... aho baita mu kabuga , ahantu baita mu kajevuba hasi .
they came up the hill and all of them were drunk . ||| bazamutse bavuye kunywa inzoga ,
they were saying , "@ the people we dumped in the latrine must have died . @" they proceeded . the lady was still agonizing . ||| bavuga bati @: "@ babantu tumaze kunaagamo [ wa mugorae yari agihirita ] bati @: ‘ ubungubu bapfuye barangije ,
then they said , "@ we should suppress that pit after throwing about twenty more tutsis . @" ||| ‘ bati @: ‘ tuzawusiba tumaze kunaagamo abandi hejuru yabo nka makumyabiri .
the pit latrine was about eight meters deep . ||| ’ @" kuko uwo mwobo uri ufite metero nk' umunani .
if i consider the height of the pit , i would fall back into it after climbing up approximately half of it . ||| ngerageje igihe nzamutse kugirango njyae kugera hejuru nicyo gipimo nfatamo cya metero .
looking at the way i 'd fall into it , i 'd say it was about 6 to 8 meters long . ||| ngera hagati rero nka nyerair nkikubitamo , nkaumva ibyo aribyo byose intera nvuyemo nri ndi hejuru n' uko nikubisemo hasi , nkagereranya nkavuga nti @:
the same perpetrators approached the pit with torches and lamps . ||| ibyo ari byo byose zishobora kuba ari nka metero nk' esheshatu cyangwa umunani .
when i heard them , i hid myself in silas ' abandoned home . ||| noneho ba bantu baraza , bazana amasitimu numvise ko aribo nihisha muri rya tongo rya wa mugabo witwa silas . nikingamo ,
they lit their torches into the pit and said , "@ they have surely died . @" and then they went back to their homes . i watched them going to their homes but i can n't tell what time it was by then . ||| bararunguruka bati @: "@ ubu barangije kupfa birangiye . @" baragenda , ndabakurikira ... ndabakurikira bose bagenda bajya mu ngo zabo ;
however , it was around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. , about the time you hear small creatures murmuring . ||| ntinzi isaha icyo kihae ariko hari ... ni cya kihae mu ijoro haba harimo utuntu tujwigiraa ... nko mu ... ma saa munani saa saba z' ijoro gutyo ,
the time when everything is asleep , the time when even frogs can not croak . ||| igihe nta kantu kakivuga n' ibikeri bicecetse .
that lady took me to her father 's place but i spent there a few days and then i thought of joining ndongozi 's family ; the other friends of mine whom we went to the same school . ||| hanyuma aza kunyimura uwo mugorae anjyana kwa se . nragenda kwa se naho mpamara iminsi mikeya . noneho ngira cya gitekerezo cyo kaongera kujya kwa wa mugabo ufite abahungu tuiganye , ndongozi .
by then my injury was getting better and the swelling was reducing . ||| nraongera nyura muri ya nzira ariko noneho hahanri hari hatangiye kujya habyimbuka haje no gushwanyuka havamo igisebe , hatangiye kubyimbuka gakeya .
therefore i crossed the river and went there . ||| ndagendaa ... nraambuka njyayo .
but instead of going to mr. ndongozi 's home , i went to his young brother 's home . ||| ariko aho kugirango njyae kwa wa mugabo aho hari abahungu tuiganye ,
he was called ndanga aloys and he was my dad 's friend ; him and my father had given each other cows . [ in the rwandan culture , giving a cow to a person is a symbol of friendship and solidarity ] . ||| njya kwa murumuna we witwaga nranga aloys yari inshuti ya papa bahanye inka . ntahagera nti @:
however , i doubted if they would accept to hide me or if they would kill me . ||| ibyo ari byo byose uyu nawe ni umwe nawe niba banyica , niba banyakira simbizi . njyayo . icyo nzicyo n' uko ba ... bankinguraiye neza ,
fortunately they welcomed me in their home and i stayed there until ... it was towards the end of may . i stayed there and left the place when the whole family was preparing to flee . ||| baranyakira , ntahaba , mpamara ... ubwo biri bigeze nko mu kwezi kwa gatanu mu mpera zakwo . ntahaba nhavuye bajya kuhunga .
when the inkotanyi captured kabgayi ; that was on the 2nd of june in 1994 . they all fled . then they asked me , "@ we are preparing to flee , should we live you in the house ? @" ||| inkotanyi zimaze kubohoza i kabgayi zahabohoje ku itariki ebyiri z' ukwa gatandatu [ 02 @06 @1994 ] barahunga bati @: "@ ese ko tugiye kugenda turakusiga mu nzu ? @"
i told them it was okay . ||| nravuga nti @:
"@ since you are living i will wait for darkness to fall then i will also go . @" that is what i told them . in the evening , on that particular day i left that house for kamonyo pascal 's home . ||| ntacyo ubwo mugiye kugenda reka bwirae nraongera nigenderae . ntahava ku mugoroba waho nsubira kwa wa mugabo pascal kamonyo aho hari mushiki wanjye ,
my sister was hiding at his place and i was sure that my brothers guido and michael were still alive . ||| kuko na mukuru wanjye witwa rutahunga michel nri nzi ko akiriho n' ako karumuna kanjye . nraambuka ngo njyae kubaza uwo mushiki wanjye amakuru yabo ,
before they left , the people who had given me shelter told me , "@ your fellows inkotanyi captured kabgayi and ruhango . ||| kuko n' ubwo bari bagiye kuhunga baranbwiraaga bati @: " bene wanyu rero inkotanyi bene wanyu bafashe kabgayi , na ruhango barahafite , muzagendae muhunga mujyayo . @"
they advised me to go towards the areas the inkotanyi had already captured . they warned me of all the places where i may find the interahamwe and told me not to reach those places . ||| bakajya banshushanyiriza banbwira bati @: "@ aha n' aha hari interahamwe , aha hari interahamwe , aha hari interahamwe ,
after getting those important information , i decided to pass by and see my sister and brothers so that we should go all together . ||| ntiuzahanyurae . @" nravuga nti @: ubwo maze kumenya izi nkuru reka nsubiraeyo njyae kureba mushiki wanjye noneho mubwirae tugende nfatae na michel tuesae tugende . mushiki wanjye nragenda musanga aho yari ari ,
i found her and we spent the whole day together . ||| turahairirwaan umunsi wose ,
then around midday , habyarimana 's soldiers came from gafunzo to that home where we were and asked the old man , " we have heard that you keep cockroaches in your house . @" ||| kumanywa y' aho hari abasirikare b' interamwe bo kwa habyarimana , bazamutse aho baita muri gafunzo baraza babaza uwo musaza ngo @: "@ ‘ ariko muzae , ko tuumvise ubitse inyenzi ?

he replied them . we were terrified . ||| ’ @"@ ubwoba buratuica .
i thought this time my end had come ! ||| nravuga nti @:
the old man was talking through the window as we were just behind the door . if they had tried to open the door or break it , they would have seen us . ||| ni urupfu rwanjye noneho karabaye . muzehe ahagaze mu idirishya turi inberae y' u muryango baramutse bafunguye gato cyangwa bakarukubita batugeraho .
"@ we shall come back to verify . @" they said while living . ||| baravuga bati @: "@ reka tugende tuzagaruka kuirebair . @"
when they left we got out and hid in a nearby plantation . ||| bamaze kugenda turenga urugo tuihisha muri tripsacum yari iri aho ,
i was waiting for the nightfall to tell my sister the information i got from the family where i was hiding concerning areas occupied by the inkotanyi . ||| ariko tutegereje ko bwira mubwira gahunda , y' ukuntu banrangiye ahantu inkotanyi ziri , turi bugendae maze kubonaan nuwo mukuru wanjye rutahunga michel ,
then in the evening we went back to mr. pascal to get some food . ||| tukagenda . burira , bumaze kwira turaza baratugaburira turarya , nravuga nti @:
we ate and after eating , we started looking for my brother but he was nowhere to be found . ||| ni ukugenda rero ; turamushakisha mukuru wanjye turamubura . turamushakisha turamubura ;
we asked the old man to help us and get him for us but still he could n't see him . ||| turatuma uwo mugabo turamubura .
i told my sister , "@ you saw what took place during the day , we have to leave with our younger sister . @" she was about five years old then . ||| nti turi bubabwirae ko tugiye mu nkotanyi , ubwo ka gashiki kanjye gato ka bucura kari kafite nk' imya ... kari kafite imyaka itanu icyo kihae ,
she was also living in the same home . ||| nibo bakafite .
but the old man refused to let us take her . ||| turavuga tuti tukajyanae ,
he said , "@ this is a very young girl , you can not handle her . ||| aravuga ati @: "@ ‘ ese ubwo ako kana murakatwara , mukajyanae he ? ’ ati @:

but the young sister who was about 5 years old remained at pascal 's place . ||| michel nba ari uwacu tuzahurairyo .
she had been inside the house throughout , she never used to go out ; when we reached a certain place called kigarama , she got very sick . ||| tufata inzira turagiye . mushiki wanjye yabaga mu nzu ntiiigeze asohoka , turagendaaa ... tuza kugera ahantu anrembairho , ahantu hitwa mu kigarama .
i took her to a nearby home whose owner was called ntakiyimana . ||| mujyana ku rugo rw' umuntu witwa ntakaiimaan .
what was she suffering from ? ||| yafashwae ni iki ?
she suddenely shivered . i do n't know if it was malaria or something else . ||| yahinze umushyitsi kusa ntinzi niba ari malariya ntabwo nbizi .
we spent two nights in that home . ||| mujyana aho tura harara nk' iminsi ibiri ,
he was a good man and he even brought malaria tablets and some painkillers and gave them to my sister . ||| uwo mugabo aratuakira neza nawe , aragenda amugurair utunini twa chloroquine , n' utundi ni iby' umutwe n' ibiki aramuha , tuhamaze iminsi ibiri nravuga nti tukomezae tugende .
after that , he directed us where to find the rpf members . ||| turagenda nraibuka ko ahantu inkotanyi zari ziri hari ahantu baita mu ngo z' abana . wa mugabo nawe akomeza adushushanyiriza inzira ahantu turi bunyurae ,
then we asked him if he knew where our brother could be hiding ; i thought he was hiding around that area since we could n't find him on the other side . ||| aratubwira tuti ariko utubabariye ukaperereza niba ko mukuru wanjye baishe ari ahantu aha n' aha , tukeka ko ari muri ako kacae , k' aho hantu turi tutuye ,
then he told us that , the boy we were talking about had been killed . ||| uka mutushakira ukamutugerezaho iyo gahunda .
i tried to argue that he could n't be dead because i had seen him the previous day . ||| aranbwira ati @: "@ rero shahu mukuru wawe bamwishe , " tuti reka da ntibishoboka ntabwo bashobora kuba bamwishe . ati @:
but the man described him for us and assured us that they killed him the day before and his body was thrown in the same latrine where i was once thrown . we were very sad . ||| "@ bamwishe nyamara ati @: si wa muhungu w' iwanyu w' igikara gutya , aramudushushanyiriza .
then we left but that man also helped us by giving us proper directions to where the inkotanyi were . ||| naho uwo munsi turi tuhagurutse tugenda bari bamwishe koko .
my brother was also dumped in the pit upside down . ||| baramufashe hahanri bari banazaemo , nawe niho bamujyanye .
we noticed it later after the genocide , when we were exhuming his remains ; i identified his bones from the pair of trousers he was wearing during the genocide , and his legs were facing up . ||| baje kumunagamo bamucuritse nawe kuko nyuma ya genocide tugiye kutaburura amagufwa nsanga amaguru ye ari hejuru , nbibawiyew n' ipantaro yari yambaye ubwo amagufwa ye tuyakuramo .
we spent two days in ntakiyimana 's house then we left . ||| mushiki wanjye turakomeza turagenda tumaze iminsi ibiri amaze kudushushanyiriza turagenda .
we met the inkotanyi at kazinganyoni near byimana . ||| inkotanyi tuzisanze ahantu baita mu kazinganyoni hafi yo mu biimaan .
when we reached their roadblock , my sister got so scared , she thought the roadblock belonged to habyarimana 's soldiers . ||| tugera ahantu kuri bariyeri yazo , aranbwira ati @: "@ aba abantu , ahantu nbonye hari bariyeri ,
but i convinced her that according to the directions we had been given , habyarimana 's soldiers were not here . ||| aho ntabwo baba bari abasirikari bo kwa habyarimana bahari ? @"@ nramubwira nti @: hoya abasirikari bo kwa habyarimana babitushushanyairije ni ahangaha .
then we proceeded and reached the roadblock . ||| hanyuma turakomeza turegair , turegair turegair tuyigeraho .
i can not tell where soldiers came from , they suddenly appeared and surrounded us . ||| tuyigezeho abasirikari ntinzi ahantu bari bari , tugiye kubona tubona batukozeho uruziga .
they asked us , "@ who are you and where are you going ? @" ||| baratubaza bati @: "@ yemwe muri abahe , muragenzaw n' iki ? @"
we introduced ourselves and they started conversing with us . we told them all our experience and they really felt pity for us . ||| baratufata baratuganiriza , turabatekerereza inkuru , uko bigenze , tutangira kubaan nabo gutyo .
since then we lived with them and they took us to byimana where we joined other people . ||| baratufata batujyana mu biimaan tuhasanga abandi bantu mu by' ukuri numvaaga ari ... njyewe na mushiki wanjye , ari twe turiho twenyine . na mukecuru ntabwo turi tuzi ko akiriho ,
frankly speaking , i never expected to find any other family member alive apart from my sister and i. even my mother ; though the killers used to live her to suffer the misery of loosing all her family members , i still thought they would kill her one day . ||| kuko nubwo bamurekaaga ngo azaicwae n' agahinda , ariko turavugaaga tuti @: bazamwica nta kabuza . noneho ,
after sometime our mother joined us at byimana , our other sisters had been killed . ||| tuba aho mu biimaan , turarokokaanye njyae na mushiki wanjye uko turi babiri , nyuma mukecuru yaje kuza ari wenyine , twa twana tubiri tw' utukobwa batuishe .
one of my sisters was hiding at mr. rutwaza whose son rusizana betrayed my brother michel . ||| kuko uwo mugabo witwa rusizana ariwe utanze mukuru wanjye bakamwica , kwa se witwaga rutwaza niho ako gashiki kanjye kankurikiraga kari kari . bamaze ... atumaho kuri uwo mugabo ngo amwohereze umwana , yari yihishe k' umugabo witwa ngoboka ahantu baita mu kigarama ,
the same rusizana is the one who asked his father to send him a girl he was hiding in his house . ||| baramumwima . ka kandi gato wa mugabo we yari yarakanabyeho ati @:
our last born remained at pascal 's house and pascal had promised never to leave the girl , "@ i will always flee with her . @" ||| "@ njyewe nzamuhungaan uyu ni uwanjye .
later he was attacked but we had already left for byimana . we had joined the inkotanyi way before . ||| nyuma baje kutera uwo mugabo , ubwo twe turi mu biimaan turageze mu nkotanyi kera .
when we reached byimana [ my sister and i ] with the inkotanyi , mum went to get the rest of the kids [ mukakimenyi marcelline and ingabire clemence . ||| ubwo tugeze mu biimaan nyine na mushiki wanjye turi mu nkotanyi , nibwo mukecuru wanjye yaje kuaka ba bana , uwitwa mukakimenyi marcelline , ni inkabirae clemence barabamwima .
] but they refused to give them to her ... and the interahamwe attacked pascal kamonyo who had stayed with our young sister . they beat pascal very badly . ||| ariko ka gashiki , kanjye ahantu tukasize kwa pascal kamonyo , baje kumutera . bamuteye baramuhondagura noneho akana kabonye ukuntu bakubita uwo mugabo karahunga .
and when my sister realized the way they were beating the man , she ran away . ||| kahunze kahungira muri rwa rugo mukuru we arimo . wa mushiki wanjye nbabwiraaga upfuye . kahungiyemo noneho ah ! baba bagize amahirwe babafata bombi .
she went to hide in the home where my elder sister was also hiding . ||| mama akababwira ati @: "@ mumpe abana banjye . @" bati @: "@ reka da . @"
it became very easy for the killers ; they found them and killed both of them at the same time . ||| ati @: "@ mumpe abana banjye ,
my mother continued to ask the killers for her children but all they did was laugh at her . ||| " bati @: "@ reka da . @" finalement mama nawe yaje kutusanga aho ngaho mu biimaan abana babamwimye .
none of us know how they died but what we learnt later is that they took them to karambo towards mutara and this is where all the children were killed , after killing them , they threw them in river kiryango . ||| baje kubahungaan , ntituzi urupfu babaishe , kikoze bageze ahantu hitwa mu karambo wambuka ujya ahantu baita i mutara ,
the same river where my father was drowned . ||| utwana ngo niho batuiciye batujugunya muri uwo mugezi witwa kiryango uwo banazaemo papa .
that is how they died . ||| tuba tupfuye gutyo .
now my other young brother is still alive and he is a student in the 5th year of secondary school . he is called serubibi guido . ||| ka karumuna kanjye ubungubu kaiga muri cinquieme secondaire kaitwa serubibi guido .
after they had invaded mr kamonyo 's home , our young sister ran away and went to the home where my older sister was hiding . ||| bamaze kutera uwo mugabo aho yari ari kwa pascal kamonyo nyine , ako kana karahunga kajya kuba aho mukuru wanjye yari ari ... nako aho mushiki wanjye yari ari ,
but remember i told you that my sister was hiding in rutwaza 's home yet his sons are the ones who killed my brother . they took him from his hide out in their home and hacked him to death . ||| ariko wibuke ko nkubwiye ko uwo mushiki wanjye yari ari muri urwo rugo kwa rutwaza , ariho abahungu be baishe mukuru wanjye kandi bamukuye mu rugo iwabo .
my mother pleaded with them to give back her our sisters but they refused and fled with them as they retreated from rpf soldiers . ||| ubwo maman yaje kubabaaka baramubaima barabagumana bajya kuhunga bo , bahunga inkotanyi biraumvikana , bahungaanye n' utwo twana .
when they came back we were told that our two sisters had been killed but we do n't know how they were killed . ||| tuje kugaruka batubwira ko babaishe urupfu babaishe ntawe ntituruzi . babiciye aho ngaho babata mu mazi .
what happened for your neighbours to betray you ? because according to what you told us , they seemed to be like relatives . ||| nbwira ukuntu abaturanyi banyu . ibyo ari byo byose ukuntu ubavugaaga uvugaaga ko ari bo muryango .
how did they change ? ||| babahindutse kutae ?
you see ... even though we had lived together like relatives , it happened that way because we had no alternative . there were no other people to live with . ||| ukuntu baje kutuhinduka , urebye yego bari umuryango , ariko n' umuryango nyine umuntu abamo kubera kubura uko ugira nta ... nta muryango urimo .
otherwise we had somehow noticed that they [ hutus ] were malicious earlier . ||| hari umugani bajya baca mu kinyarwanda bavuga ngo ... ngo @:
there is a saying in kinyarwanda , which says "@ you can never treat a leopard that has frightened you once before as a wild cat @" meaning that , once you are born with a weakness , you can never change . ||| "@ buryaiyagukanze ntijya iba inturo . @"
we lived with them because we had no other choice . ||| tubanaaga nabo kubura uko kuko nta wunri muntu tugomba kubaan nawe ,
but one could tell that they [ hutus ] are bad . ||| ariko birakaraga ko ari abagome .
when the time for fleeing came ; it was too late to find somewhere to hide . ||| kusa bigejeje igihe cyo kuhunga , tugeze icyo kihae cyo kuhunga uraumva ko n' amatariki yari yarangiye nta hantu ugombaaga kujya ,
but they assured us how they would hide us and our properties ... they later said , "@ we must kill you ! @" ||| bo batwizeza ko bazatuhisha bakatuhishaan n' ibyacu byose nta kintu tuzaba . nyuma barya inka , bagira kutae ... baravuga bati @: "@ ni razima tugomba kubica . @"
but even before , one could tell from the look on their faces that they were capable of killing us but we had no alternative and nowhere to flee to . ||| ariko n' igitekerezo ubarebye no mu maso ukuntu bari bameze , igitekerezo cyo kuica ubonaaga ko nta kunri kuntu usibye ko uburaaga ahantu uhungira . ariko bo bakabura urwaho .
however , they had n't been able to kill us because of the custom i told you . ||| bakabura ingufu zo kubikora kubera ya histoire nkubwiye ,
[ my father exchanging cows with them . ||| bakabura urwako rwo kubikora ,
] their sons who were young and strong supported and encouraged them to kill us . most of their sons had tasted fresh blood ; they lived in kigali and some of them were soldiers . ||| ariko abahungu babo bakiri bato banyoye amaraso , babaye za kigali , abandi babaye mu gisirikare babatiza umurindi .
therefore , they went ahead and killed us also . ||| noneho nibwo batangiye kutuica .
does it mean that you had already understood that they would kill you ? ||| noneho wowe ubona biri bibarimo kubica kuva kera ?
yes , they had the desire to kill us before . ||| yee !
they used to have some skirmishes with my father in the past ; it was clear that they envied my father for having a big land . ||| ubona biri bibarimo . urebye ni n' amahari bakundaaga kugiraan wenda bakavuga bati @: "@ nicolas afite isambu nini , " kandi ntibibaze ko hari abandi bantu bavukanaaga ,
but they were forgetting that my dad was n't born alone ; though he then lived there on his own , he had brothers who had fled . ||| kuba ayirimo wenyine si ukuvuga ko nta banri bavukanaaga barahunze .
they would come and take part of our land without permission ; like the family i told you who were almost like our relatives , they had taken a portion of our land ! ||| ukasanga rero kenshi n' uwo muturanyi wacu bakuburanaho bakakurengera kuko nko muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , nubwo ngubwo tuvuga ko ariwo muryango data yari afite , ariko ntibibujije ko hariho bamwe baje ,
several others had built on our land ; behind our home there was a family on our land , on both sides of our home there was another family , still on our land . ||| nko mukacae k' isambu tuvugae tukaba tutuye ahangaha hakaza umuntu akahita abohoza mo aho hagati akahatura . inberae y' umuryango ni mu kwacu , inyuma y' aho atuye ni mu kwacu , hepfo y' aho atuye n' aho nimukwacu ariko akatura ahongaho .
someone would just come and build on our land but there was nothing we could do because the government was not fair to the tutsis . ||| uraumva ibyo aribyo umuntu uje kutura ahongaho , byose nta kunri ubigenza kuko ntawakurengeraga , nta butegetsi buriho bushobora kurengeraaga . ariko uraumva ntabwo muba mumeraanye neza bene uwo muntu .
therefore , we would just live together but it did n't mean that we were happy with each other . ||| mubana kuko mugomba kubaan . ariko ntabwo muba mumeraanye neza .
in 1994 in gitarama there was a political party called mdr , how was your life then ? ||| muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] uraumva ko i kitaarama hariho nka mdr , mwari mubayeho mutae ?
well during the time of multi @-@ partyism in gitarama , mdr was the mother party to all the others . ||| urebye ibintu by' amashyaka byo i kitaarama kuko mdr niryo vuko ryayo rwose .
it was the youth that got very involved . ||| ariko ibintu by' amashyaka ubonaaga cyane cyane nk' urubyiruko bakunda kubijyamo .
for us , i can say we were neutral because you could n't join mdr and you could n't also show , which political party you supported . ||| ariko nkatawe nvuga ko turi neutre nta ... bon ... nta hantu ubonaaga tusa nk' aho tubogamiye turi hagati nk' ururimi . ntiushoboraaga kujya muri mdr ntibishoboka . ntiushoboraaga kugaragaza yuko uri mu ishyaka runaka ,
we would just keep silent but the rest were so involved . people would rise flags for their parties ; like mdr , psd but especially mdr would be present . ||| ukariumaho gutyo ariko abandi babaga bayarimo ; abashinze n' amadarapo ya mdr abari muri za psd , cyane cyane mdr yabaga ihari .
we would just pretend to be absent ; that is what i would call it . ||| ariko twebwe tubaga uri aho wikarumye nta ... ntahantu ubogamiye niko nvuga .
would n't they force you to join those parties ? ||| ntabwo bajyaaga babatoteza kubera iyo ntuza ?
such things happened but we would take it lightly ; for example , stealing or cutting people 's banana plantations . ||| ibyo byo birahabaaga kuiba ukabona ari ibisanzwe kuza kutema ibitoki no kugira kutae .
but serious torture like beating a person and others ... well there used to be some moral torture like scaring people , nocking on the doors at night . ||| ariko ubikizi bwa nabi bushobora kuba bakubita abantu ,
those are the things that they would do . but to us , it meant nothing . ||| babatortura ku bunri bu ... kaereka nka torture morale kusa kubentimida [ kubatera ubwoba ] hakaba bibinri baita kuhondagura ku nzugi nicyo kintu bakoraaga kusa ariko ibyo tukaumva nta kintu na kimwe bitubwiye .
is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] ? ||| hari ikibazo kinri kierekana ko biri biturutse ku bwoko bwanyu ?
no , there was n't any other problem . ||| oya ,
however , even what was done to us was due to out ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] it was the hutus who were doing that and we were the only tutsis who lived there . ||| ibyo byo biragaragaraaga ari ku bwoko biraumvikana . nta banri bagombaaga kubikora , kandi ibisobanutse iby' iwacu byo nitwae turi tutuye aho ngaho kusa ,
all our neighbours were hutus . definitely one could tell they were the ones to do all those acts ! ||| ku mpande ari bo batuye ari abo bahutu kusa nta banri . uraumva ko abagombaaga kubikora ari abo ngabo nyine .
you told me that you come from gitarama . ||| unbwiye ko usanzwe uri umunyagitarama ,
were you born there ? ||| uri kavukire kaho ?
yes , but while we lived in mwendo , our home origin was in karama . ||| yee , usibye ko aho turi tutuye , ku ivuko n' aho baita ... ni ahantu baita i karama usa n' ugana i kitaarama ,
our grandfather had shifted to mwendo and we lived on his land . ||| ariko aho baita i mwendo niho sogokuru yari yaraimukaiye , ariko yari isambu ya sogokuru yose .
he had a very large land . ||| kuvuga ko yari nini ,
the reason i am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone . ||| n' uko ariwe uri uyirimo wenyine ariko bari bafite abavandimwe !
he had few relatives and therefore seemed to own a big land . he was living there with a few of his relatives . ||| ariko kubera ko ariwe uyisigayemo wenyine bigaragaraaga ko ariyo nini kubera iyo mpamvu nta banri bavandimwe bahari .
you earlier talked about people who were fleeing from kibuye towards kabgayi . ||| hari ikintu uhoze uvuga , uvuga ku banyakibuye bajyaaga bahungira ahongaho , bahungiraaga iyo za kabgayi .
would you please elaborate more about that ? ||| sa nk' ubisobanuraho gake .
the population fled kibuye because their houses had earlier been burnt . ||| abanyakibuye bazaaga bavuye ku kibuye kuko urebye bo banatwikiye kare ,
they were chased from kibuye . they used to pass through our home area while fleeing . we used to help them , as we knew we were related to some extent . ||| barabairukana , bajyaaga baza bavuye ku kibuye bakanyura iyo nzira y' iwacu tukababona twebwe tukabakira kuko bari bene wacu ,
we would give them food and all we could to help them . then they would proceed to kabgayi . ||| tukabagaburira tukagira kutae ... bakakomeza bajya i kabgayi .
most of them would n't reach their destination because our neighbours had set roadblocks . ||| abenshi ntibanageraagayo kuko abo basore b' iwacu ubundi bashingaaga amabariyeri mu nzira bakabafata ,
they would kill them ; ladies would be raped and sometimes made sex slaves . ||| abakobwa bakabaviyora bamwe bakabagira abagore babo ,
in fact the killings had started and most people would not go beyond that roadblock ; they would be murdered and dumped into a deep pit that was in this area . ||| ndetse muri iyo minsi bari batangiye kutema nta n' uwarengaga aho ngaho bose baramufataaga bakamutemagura bakajya kumujugunya ahongaho muri urwo rwobo .
very few would reach kabgayi . ||| i kabgayi hageraagayo bake cyane .
for example , there were many corpses in the pit where i had been dumped by the time we exhumed them . ||| ku buryo nko muri uwo musaraane bantayemo ,
all the corpses were reburied together because we could n't tell their places of origin . perhaps they were from kibuye or areas around kabagari . ||| harimo abantu benshi twataburuyemo baragenda kushyinguraw muri rusangae tutazi ahantu ... ari abo banyakibuye nyine bagiye batemagura n' abaturuka ku mpera z' akarere baita aka kabakari .
most people were killed on the way , our neighbours killed them . and we know them [ the killers ] . ||| ariko benshi babiciraaga mu nzira kandi baicwaaga n' abo bantu b' iwacu bose turabazi .
q ... ||| ijwi ntiriumvikana !
in that pit ... while they were throwing us in the pit , the perpetrators would say they would cover it after adding more 20 people . ||| muri uwo mwobo ? ubwo batunagagamo bavugaaga ko bazawusiba bamaze kaongeraho abandi nka makumyabiri .
well i do n't know the exact number but i would think they were over thirty . ||| ibyo aribyo byose uraumva ntinzi umubare exact [ nyawo ] ariko uraumva ko bari barenze ... nk' abantu nka mirongo itatu bari barimo .
how many people were in pit the time you exhumed them ? ||| mutaburura se mwasanzemo bangahe ?
while exhuming ... we first found my older brother on top , then we found our sister in law . ||| tutaburura ,
we found them before digging deep into it . so , we went to rebury them . ||| tutaburura turebye tusanzemo ... mbere uwo mukuru wanjye we yari ari hejuru n' uwo mugorae wa data wacu tuje kubataburura tubakuramo ntitugeramo hasi turabahamba .
i think they were about eighteen . ||| tutaburura rero havuyemo nk' abantu bageze kuri ... kuri cumi n' umunani .
there were more people in the next pit but i do n't know the exact number of people who were there . ||| abandi bari mu cyobo cyo hepfo , cyo ntinzi umubare wacyo urimo .
there was a certain man who was dumped into that second pit , he was called sematetu and his wife cemented the pit . we just left it that way as we did n't wanted to break the cement . ||| kuko ho haguyemo umugabo witwaga sematetu umugore we yaraje arahakaotair na sima tuanga gushwanyura sima turahaihorera . tuharekera gutyo .
how many pits were there ? ||| ibyobo biri bingahe ?
two pits . ||| ibyobo biri bibiri
what was the distance between the two pits ? ||| hagati yabyo hari harimo nka distance ingana iki ?
about 300 meters . ||| harimo nka distance ya 300 m [ metero magana atatu ] .
people in your area would kill some people and leave others . what was determing their choice ? ||| ubona utae ko abantu bo muri quartier y' iwanyu ... baricaaga abandi bakabasiga , wunva ari iki kibateraaga umutima wo kuica bamwe bakasiga abandi ?
actually those who killed us were our neighbours and we knew them . ||| yee ! kuko abatuicaaga bo ni abantu b' abaturanyi uba ubazi ,
not only the killers , but also those who looted our properties . ||| usibye no kutuica n' aho inka yagiye , n' aho iki cyose ubaga ukizi uvuga uti @: iki kitwaye na kanaka na kanaka ;
for example , i know who killed my elder brother . ||| na mukuru wanjye nkuvuga nti @: yishwe n' akanaka na kanaka .
where does your mother reside now ? ||| ubu mama wawe atuye he ?
now she is living in ... at first we lived in byimana centre . ||| ubu mama atuye , tubanje kutura mu biimaan mu gacentre ntabwo tukituye hahanri turi turi ,
we no longer live there ; we shifted to a place called imbare next to shyogwe opposite to kabgayi in avega estate . ||| ariko ubu tuimukaiye ahantu baita inbarae hakuno y' i shyogwe hateganyae na kabgayi mu mudugudu wa avega uhari ubu niho turi .
she lives with my sister who lost her husband during the genocide . ||| abana na wa mushiki wanjye upfakaye muri genocide .
what does she do ? ||| akora iki ?
nothing , she is illiterate . ||| ntacyo , yahoze a ... ntabwo yize ,
before she was working in an orphanage looking after orphans but the orphanage closed and now she is just at home helping mum in the farm . ||| yahoze afite akazi ko mu mfubyi ko kurair imfubyi , ariko ikigo cy' imfubyi baje kukihagarika ; ubu araho n' umuhinzi hamwe na mama .
how old were your parents then ? ||| ababyeyi bawe bari bageze nko mu myaka ingahe ugereranyaije ?
my father was born in 1935 that means that by then he was about 59 years old . ||| papa yavutse muri mirongo itatu na gatanu [ 1935 ] icyo kihae ashobora kuba yari afite imyaka ingahe ,
while mum was born in 1944 . ||| ukarikiraiye ? mirongo itanu n' icyenda . mama yavutse muri mirongo ine na kane [ 1944 ] .
in which year were you born ? ||| wowe uvutse ryari ?
he was about 21 years old . ||| yari afite nk' imyaka ... nka myakumyabiri n' umwe ,
i guess he was born in 1974 . ||| yaravutse irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] ngira ngo uwo muhungu .
maybe he was 20 years during the genocide since he was born in 1974 . ||| ubwo muri genocide ntiyari afite makumyabiri n' umwe ? makumyabiri ni irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] .
q ... ||| ijwi ntiriumvikana !
we were neighbours . the distance between our homes was about 500 meters . ||| kuko iwacu n' iwabo aho batuye harimo nka cinq cents metres [ 500 m ] turaturanye mu by' ukuri ,
presently his father is under custody because he was involved in my older brother 's murder . ||| niwe tuhana imbibi . ubu na se arafunze , kuko muri urwo rupfu rwa mukuru wanjye ise yari arimo ,
he was participated in the murder of my brother , shyaka , his older brother called aphrodis munyanziza , their younger brother called mukaka damascene and several others . ||| uwo muhungu shyaka yari arimo , mukuru we aphrodis munyanziza yari arimo harimo karumuna ke kaitwaaga bukaaka damascene yari arimo n' abandi n' abandi benshi . ariko famille yose y' uwo mugabo n' uwo musirikari ... y' aho uwo musirikari avuka bose bari bahari ,
all that man 's family and the soldier were there while my brother was being killed ; they all participated in his death . ||| bagize uruhare mu kuica uwo mukuru wanjye .
the time you were led to the pit , what was on your mind ? ||| igihe bakujyanaaga ku cyobo . sa n' utubwira igitekerezo ugize ,
tell us a bit of your experience . ||| utubwirae experience yawe .
when they took me to the latrine hole , i thought my life was over . ||| njyae kusa igihe bajyanye ku mwobo nbonaaga ko nta kunri nnjyae ngiye kupfa ;
i had just seen and heard what they had done to my brother . ||| ibyo baraye bakoreye mukuru wanjye nrabiumvaaga , kandi nrabibonaaga , uraumva ko nta ... nta bunri buzima .
when i was on top of the hole , i was curious about what heaven looked like , that 's all i could think of . ||| ndetse ngeze hejuru y' umwobo , icyo nziko cyo ntekereje ko ... nkaumva nfite amatsiko yo kujya mw' ijuru nta kinri nrinfite icyo kihae ,
i was wondering what took them so long to kill me . ||| ahubwo numva barantindaiye kunyica .
when he snatched a hammer , i thought he was going to smash my head and finish with me . ||| afashe inyundo nrinzi ko agiye kuyinkubita mu mutawe ugashwanyuka bikarangira ,
fortunately , i guess it was by gods will ; he hit my neck instead of my head and that is how i survived . ||| icyakoze ngize amahirwe ni ya mana izarokora umuntu nyine ayikubita ku gakanu , nza kurokoka gutyo .
when you gained conscious did you manage to ... ||| ubyutse ubashije ku ... ?
when i gained conscious and moved from the hole , i started thinking of where to go . ||| nbyutse niho nje kugira ikibazo , nvuye mu musaraane . ntekereje ahantu ndi buganae ,
i looked in the north and in the south and found no direction . i wished i had died ! ||| nreba amajyepfo nreba amajyaruguru , nbona wapi ntakigenda birutaw no kupfa .
i thought in case they came across me , they would do worse things than what they had done to me . i thought they would first amputate me or cut my ears or fingers off . ||| kuko nravugaaga ngo nibaramuka banbonye , nyuma yuko bankoreye ibingibi , noneho ibyo bari bunkorerae birarenze . bari ku ... bari kuca urutoki bari kuca ugutwi ,
fortunately , they never caught me again . otherwise , it would have been like dying twice . ||| ntinzi ikintu bari kunkorera nuko ngize amahirwe nyine nibambone .
that is waht i can call it . ||| ariko ikintu kiri kinteye ubwoba nravugaaga nti @: birutaw nuko npfa kurusha uko bagaruka bwa kabiri ntinzi uko nbiita ni ukupfa kupfa kabiri ntinzi !
you were so afraid that they would get you for the second time but you still followed them . ||| wunvaaga usa nk' aho utinye ko bagaruka ariko urangije ubagenda inyuma .
why were you following them ? ||| ni iki kitumye ubwo ubagenda inyuma ?
i can not tell . maybe it was by god 's mercy . ||| ntinzi njyewe ubanza ari umugisha w' imaan kusa .
they really helped us yet we were n't friends . ||| kuko abo bantu batugiraiye neza , ni abantu mu byukuri tutakundaaga kugenderana ,
for example , that man i was talking about , pascal ... he was my sister 's godfather . ||| nk' uwo mugabo nkubwiraaga nti @: wenda yari yarabyaye mushiki wanjye muri batisimu , umugore w' ... uwo mugabo pascal .
however , we were not so close to his family . we never expected him to help us the way he did . ||| ariko mu by' ukuri ntabwo ari umuntu tusabanaaga bihaambaye , ku buryo ibintu yakoze ,
surprisingly those who were supposed to help us , i mean our neighbours , those who seemed to be our relatives . ||| n' abo banri bose tugiye tuhungiraho biratangaje . abakwaiye kubikora ni abongabo turi tuturanye ko mu by' ukuri ubonaaga aribo dufitanye ... abo tukwiraanye kugiraan ubumwe bari hafi .
they surely changed ! ||| ariko abongabo ukuntu baje kuhinduka vraiment ,
i would say they had always had a cruel nature , they were killers at heart and they had been pretending throughout . maybe they had been sensitized to kill for ages but they had n't got courage to put it into practice . ||| ngira ngo nbigereranya n' uko ari wa mutaima w' umuntu w' ubwicanyi , basanzwe bafite mu by' ukuri bakashaka kubyorosaho , ariko mu by' ukuri bafite wa mutaima .
once such a person gets someone to motivate him to killing , he hurries up into the action . ||| cyane ari ibintu biigishijwe imyaka n' imyaka , arabifite ariko akabura imbaraga zo kubikora . iyo ariko une fois abonye ikimutera inkunga akahita ahaguruka .
the strangest thing is that the people we never expected to help us are the ones who did and those we thought would be the first ones to kill us were the ones to save us . ||| ariko na babanri rero utakekaaga , ko bashobora ku kugirair akamaro kurenza babanri ,
i think it just depends on someone 's nature or personality . if not so , then it is by god 's power . ||| ukabona nibo bakakugiraiye ngirango simbizi bishobora kuba biteraw na kamere y' umuntu cyangwa se za nbaraga z' imaan ,
i can not tell why they behaved like that . ||| ntinzi icyatumye bahinduka gutyo .
then after the genocide you were fatherless ... ||| nyuma ya genocide rero wiretrouva [ wisanga ] uri umwana utagira papa ...
after the genocide , i was left with my older sister ; our first @-@ born . and then i found my younger sister and brother . ||| nyuma ya genocide ubwo , nje kusanga ndi kumwe n' uwo mushiki wanjye mukuru w' imfura , n' uwo wa kabiri ,
since i am currently the oldest son in the family , i took upon myself all the family responsibilities yet i can not even fulfill their needs . ||| na karumuna kanjye ka nkurukira bwa kabiri . urebye mu by' ukuri ni nkanjyae muhungu mukuru ubwo uri usigaye . nfashe nka responsabilite ya famille mu by' ukuri nta ... nta n' iyo nshobora kauzuza .
as a result , i ended up growing up prematurely . ||| kusa ikintu kije kunbaho ni uko nkuze imburagihe .
now i am considered as an old man at home ; i am the one who makes the decisions in the family . at my early age , i feel denied my freedom . ||| ubu nragaragara nk' aho ndi umuntu mukuru muri famille , ndi umuntu ugomba kutekereza , icyo famille igo ... uko iri nkaumva ko ari jyae igomba kureba .
i do n't find time to enjoy life like i should have at my age ; things like playing around with fellow teenagers or do other fun things . ||| cyane cyane nkatawe bakiri bato bikatubangamiraho ko tutagira umwanya wo kwisanzura nk' uko ubuto bwawe ukwaiye kubwisanzuramo ,
instead i spend my entire time worrying about things that actually seem impossible to me , problems of which solutions are not easy to find . ||| nk' uko ukwaiye kukina nk' abandi basore n' ibiki ... ahubwo umwanya wawe ukawutwara mu bitekerezo kenshi bikuvuna , kandi unareba ntubibonerae n' igisubizo . unakishaka hafi ahongaho ukabona nacyo , basi .
so , to you fis that an advantange or it is a disadvantage of the genocide ? ||| none se ubona iyongiyo ari avantage cyangwa ni ingaruka mbi ya genocide ?
they are genocide disadvantages because whenever i think about it ... for example when i am in class ; sometimes i am absent @-@ minded , busy thinking about my problems while others are concentrating . ||| n' ingaruka mbi ya genocide kuko iyo nbitekereje , nk' iyo ndi mu ishuri hariho igihe nicara , nkaba nrimo nbitekereza , abandi barimo baraiga .
but if my older brother had survived , i would have relaxed a bit because he would be busy with family issues , as i also get busy with my studies . ||| ariko ibyongibyo iyo uwo mukuru wanjye aza kubaho simba nbitekereza , nba nvuga nti @: ibyo biri occupe niwe bireba , njyae icyo nreba ni ukuiga .
not to mention if it was my father who had survived or any other older person in the family . ||| data we ntinbaye nbireba . cyangwa se undi wunri w' umu membre de famille , banri bari bakuru ,
i know everything is as a result of the genocide . ||| ntinbaye nbireba ahubwo ni ngaruka za genocide .
i would have been able to use my time in class effectively rather than thinking about family problems while others are studying . ||| kuko uwo mwanya ntaye mw' ishuri abandi baba barimo barakurikira ngombye kuba nywufatamo ayo masomo ntinrangarae ,
but now i am failing to concentrate in class and in the end i will fail in school . at the same time , i can not find a solution to my problems ; i can not meet my family 's needs . ||| binciyeho ibyo kuiga birananiye za responsabilites nrimo kureba ntinzaujuje , nta ni igisubizo cyazo nzabona muri iyo minsi , n' ubwonko bwanjye burananirwa .
eeh ! ||| eeh !
those are the consequences of the genocide that are affecting me . ||| ni ingaruka mbi za genocide ziba zigaruka ku muntu .
do n't you get desperate at times ? ||| ntabwo zituma wiheba ?
i feel desperate but only for the time when i am thinking about my problems . but when i meet friends i forget about it . ||| niheba muri iyo minota , nrimo kubitekereza , ariko iyo mpuye n' urundi rungano birashira .
and then the feeling comes back during the holidays when i am at home seeing the situation in which my family is living . ||| kusa nongera kubitekereza ndi muri vacance nreba situation familiale ukuntu imeze ,
i get so desperate because i see everything yet i can not improve anything . ||| niho niheba kurenza . kuko uba ubana nabyo buri munsi kandi nta na kimwe uri bukemure niho niheba kabisa .
does it disturb you to the extent of spending sleepless nights or getting headaches ? ||| biraguhungabanya ... bishobora kutuma wenda urara amajoro cyangwa usa nk' aho uwutaye [ umutwe ] mo gakeya ?
do you ever miss your childhood ? ||| bon , nrabikumbura cyane ko ntabwo nigae ... uraumva ko genocide yabaye nfite imyaka cumi n' itandatu . imyaka cumi n' itandatu umuntu aba ageze mu kihae , cyo kuidagadura cyo kubyina , cyo kureba imipira mbese ibintu by' imyidagaduro urabizi ibintu bishimaish abasore . ariko kubera situation nri nrimo ntabwo nigeze nbona umwanya wo kubikoresha n' ubu ahondi ntinshobora kubibonera umwanya ntinnabikora , kuko noneho ubu numva ari stade nrenze . ari ukusubira inyuma ahubwo nba nangiza ibintu byinshi , nta n' umwanya nbibonera . umuntu arawukumbura ariko nta kunri kuntu ubigenza , uravuga uti @: tu nrabirenze ngomba kuba umugabo uko bigenda kose . niba bizagaruka umuntu nyuma simbizi ( araseka ) .
what would you want to be in the future or what is your goal or wish in life ? ||| wowe ubundi mu buzima bwawe ni iki ushaka kugeraho ni iki wifuza ?
what i wish , i do n't if i should call it a wish . ||| njyewe ikintu nifuza ahanini , ntinzi niba nkiita icyifuzo , ntinzi .
let me say first what makes me happy . ||| njyae reka mpere wenda ku bintu binshimaish nk' uko wa mukani mugenzi yavugaaga . ikintu kinshimaish kibaho ,
mostly it is to know that i have done something to help a genocide survivor . ||| ni uko numva ngize icyo marair umu rescape [ uwacitse ku icumu ] .
it may be giving advice or helping with something . ||| yaba ari nama nmugiraiye , yaba ara kantu nmufashije niyo kaba ara kantu kadafatika , ariko nkaumva ko ari njyae ukitekerereje nkagira icyo mufashaish nicyo kintu cyinshimisha . ikintu rero numva nifuza ,
however simple it may be , i am happy when i am the one who thought of helping and i actually did it ... i think i wish that all genocide survivors especially the young ones should be given the advantage of a scholarship because the old women who survived do not have much hope to live . ||| ni uko aba rescape cyane cyane abantu bakiri batoya , kuko bariya bakecuru bacu basigaye , bo imibereho yabo nta esperance de vie bakifite . nta kaizerae cy' ubuzima ubona bakifitemo .
they are desperate and sometimes miserable but for us who are still young we can go to school , we can exchange ideas with different people . ||| ariko nkatawe bakiri bato , tubasha no kugenda tukajya mw' ishuri tukareba n' ama experience hirya no hino , ukaganira n' abandi bantu batandukanye , nraumva tukomeje tukagira iyo avantage yo kuiga ,
also the government should continue financing farg so that those who were still kids when the genocide took place can continue their studies up to higher levels like we did . ||| cyane ko na leta itufasha kiriya kigega . numva ko tuzabaho neza mu minsi itaha . ikintu nifuza rero , turamutse tugize imibereho myiza ari wa mwana ,
maybe it 's difficult for us to adapt to this new life as we have the responsibility to take care of our young brothers and sisters . ||| genocide yabaye ar' uruhinja ubungubu akaba afite imyaka icyenda akaiga akarangiza akagera kuri stade yo kugera muri universite nk' aho turi . twebwe wenda bizatugora kwiyadapta mu buzima , wenda tuzaba tumaze kufata umurongo turarangije tureba na barumuna bacu . noneho bya bibazo na ... ntekerezaaga njyenyine ,
that 's when we can come together as genocide survivors and help each other in an association such as aerg where one gets advice , which helps me to fulfill my responsibilities of taking good care of my brothers and sisters . ||| nzaba nrabonye abandi bavandimwe baba rescape , tuigana tuibumbiye hamwe mu muryango ya aerg , nbasha kugisha inama , noneho nkabasha kauzuza na za responsabilites za ba bana bakiri batoya .
that 's what i wish for . i wish survivors would get a good life after their studies . ||| icyo nicyo numva nifuza ni ubuzima bwiza aba rescapes tuzagira nyuma yo kuiga ,
after achieving that unity , then we would organize ourselves and plan to do something together ; that is if we have the necessary material [ financial support ] . ||| nyuma yo kushyira hamwe , hanyuma tumara kuba stable tumara kuba ntinzi uko nbiita mu kinyarwanda . tukabasha kutekereza noneho tukashyira ibitekerezo byacu ku murongo ariko tufite na moyen materiel .
what do you wish to do for your family ? ||| nka famille yawe ushaka kuzayimarair iki , icyo ubakorera ?
what i can do for my family ? ||| ikintu ngeza kuri famille cyo si nkizi kuko ,
i am not sure , with the life i am leading now i can n't promise anything . ||| aho ndi ahangaha n' ubuzima nrimo , ntinzi ko hari cyo napanga ko nzabageza kuri ikingiki . numva gahunda napanga ari uko , nnjyae nfashe ubundi buzima ngeze mu ntera ,
i hope to first finish school then look for a job and that 's when i will be able to help . ||| ubwo ni ukuvuga nrangije ishuri nkabona akazi , nibwo napanga ikintu nzabagezaho . naho ubungubu nbipanze ngo nzabageza kuri iki n' iki ,
otherwise if i start promising now , it might stress me or depress me yet i will n't loose anything if i wait until i finish my studies , start working and then help my family . ||| kuba ari ukuivunair ubwonko ubusa , ndetse bikajya bihora binrwanairmo ... ukasanga binteye no kuba nsara . kandi nacyo ndibubikoreho numva ko nramutse nrangije , nkagira imibereho myiza nibwo napanga ikintu nzamarair famille yanjye .
what would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? what would you want them to know ? ||| utazi genocide ushobora kuvuga ko ari iki atazi cyangwa ikintu atamenye ni iki ?
when comparing the past to the present , what changes have you experienced in your personal life ? ||| iyo urebye igihe kishize ukareba n' ubu , n' izihe changement zabaye zishobora ku ... cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe wowe ?
maybe reconciliation will be possible among our descendants if we will tell them the truth and show them the right path . ||| wenda kubazadukomokaho ku buzukuru bacu n' abo tuzabyara ,
however , reconciliation is impossible amongst us in this generation . ||| ishobora kuzahaba reconciliation . kuko tuzabaigisha tubabwirae ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ariko ugerageza kubakuramo ko ibyo bintu bitazaba . ariko twebwe ,
i can give an example ; someone can assure you that he pleaded guilty and accepted what he did . ||| ntinzi ko reconciliation ishobora kuba . ntatanga nk' urugero @: umuntu araza akavuga ngo nrireze nemera icyaha .
but when you follow up the way he pleads guilty , you can hear him say things like @: so and so was killed by some attackers on such and such date , but i never participated in his murder . ||| ariko burya iyo ukurikiraanye , uburyo yirega akaemera icyaha , aravuga ati @: "@ kanaka yarapfuye ,
they always plead guilty but never accept their personal role . ||| agwa mu gitero iki n' iki , kw' itariki iyi n' iyi n' iyi , " ariko nta ruharae rwe mu byukuri agaragaza avuga ati @: "@ njyae nkoze ibi n' ibi n' ibi abiishinja mu by' ukuri ,
when someone is like that , it shows that he or she is more concerned about politics but do not really want to show his or her role . ||| buri kihae abivuga abiikuraho . iyo abiikuyeho rero , uraumva ko nta hantu biba bimufasheho usanga ari politique aba agendairho kusa ariko usanga nta nkaimawe biba bimufasheho . yanagera no hanze rero ,
then if such a person came to me asking for forgiveness , it would be impossible for me to forgive him or her . ||| kuvuga ngo araza kukusaba imbabazi ntibishoboka .
they treat us like a ... i think reconciliation in our generation is very difficult . ||| aba akureba nk' ... iri ahongaho ; ntinzi ko reconciliation , muri iyi generation yacu , iragoye kugira ngo izageraweho kabisa .
what can you tell people who do n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ? ||| utaemera genocide umubwira ngo iki , nka bariya bantu bayihakana ?
people who do n't agree that there was genocide in rwanda ? ||| bayihakana ? utaemera genocide muri bariya bantu bayihakana ,
it depends on the context in which they deny it ; some people pretend not to know what happened , while others really do n't know what happened . ||| ntinzi biteraw n' uburyo ayihakana niba ari ukwigiza nkana cyangwa se atayemera by' ukuri . ariko umuntu utayemera , njyae mbere yo kugira ngirae ikintu mubwira ,
but to those who intentionally deny the genocide , all i can do for them is to take him to places like ntarama , bisesero , nyamata and other places such as gikongoro , which have genocide memorial sites . ||| nmujyana nk' ahantu za ntiarama , nkamujyana mu bisesero ku kibuye nkamujyana nyamata , n' ahantu hari inzibutso za gikongoro . nkamwereka ayo magufwa ,
and then after i would ask them only a single question @: "@ what do you think was the cause of their death ? was it a thunder that killed these people and brought them here ? ||| noneho nkamubaza nk' ikibazo kimwe nti @: aya magufwa ureba ahangaha ; ni inkuba yaje ikubita abantu ,
were they strong winds ? ||| ikabaandarika ahangaha ? baishwe n' umuyaga se ?
were they floods ? or did they commit suicide ? @" ||| ni umwuzure se ? abantu baraiishe ?
then i would wait to hear their answer . ||| ni ibintu bibaye ku manywa y' ihangu , ukaumva ikintu akusubiza .
they would n't get any answer especially when they are rwandans . ||| ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ... nraumva atabona igisubizo akusubiza ahongaho cyane cyane nk' umunyarwanda . ntiyabona igisubizo akusubiza .
but if it is a foreigner , i guess he would be surprised and just keep quiet . ||| nk' umunyamahanga ibyo aribyo byose nabo ni abantu , yareba akumiraw kusa .
to someone who is still young , what do genocide memorial sites mean ? ||| nk' umuntu ukiri mutoya , inzibutso zimubwiye iki ?
memorial sites are very good . ||| inzibutso ni nziza cyane kuko ni urugero rumwe tushingaiyeho ,
because they are basics for our history . they will help us never forget what took place in rwanda . you have just asked me the question " what can you tell a person who does n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ? @" ||| rwo kutazaibagirwa ibintu bibaye mu rwanda . unbajije ikibazo mu kanya uti @: "@ nk' umuntu utaemera genocide wamubwir' iki ? @"@
i guess you heard that the answer was based on the memorial sites ; i told you that i would take such people to the memorial sites and ask them if those people committed suicide or if the bones are for decoration . ||| nkubwira ko nmujyana kuri izi nzibutso nkamubaza niba aya magufa yari ... abo bantu baraiishe , cyangwa se ari umutako uri ahongaho .
these memorial sites will be there for years and years . ||| ariko urwo rwubitso ruri ahongaho no mu myaka n' imyaka , ruzaba rukihari . ni ibintu tuzajya tuigisha abana bacu , ni ibintu tuzakorera visite ari abantu baiga amateka ari abantu bagize kutae ?
our children will see them ; historians all over the world can come for their research and see what happened . ||| ukazagenda ukareba ukavuga uti @: imyaka n' iyingiyi no mu kihae kizaza , uru ni urugero rumwe ku bantu bahakana genocide , ubaereka ko genocide yabaye mu rwanda .
therefore , memorial sites to me as part of the young generation , especially as a genocide survivor , are there to remind us and make us never forget what happened . ||| urwibutso rero numva icyo runbwiye ni ukutibagirwa n' umunsi na gato genocide . kuri njyewe nk' urubyiruko ariko ku bw' umwihariko nk' umuntu w' umurescape , ni ukutibagirwa , buri kihae .
it seems like you are fighting against forgetting about the genocide . ||| usa nk' aho urwanya ko genocide izibagiraan .
what would "@ forgetting @" mean to you ? ||| ariko se kuibagirwa kuri wowe bivuze iki ?
why are you really against forgetting ? ||| kuki ubirwanya cyane ?
listen ... what it means to me , when you forget things especially bad things that happened to you , it means that what happened meant nothing to you . if you can forget your father 's death , your mother 's death , and your relative 's death , deaths that caused agony to the whole country [ rwanda ] , and rub out all your beloved ones from your brain yet you were left alone in this world , without anyone to talk to or to run to , to me that would be an unforgivable sin . ||| kuibagirwa ikintu bishatse kuvuga , ni ukuvuga iyo wibagiwe ikintu , cyane cyane ikintu kibi cya @kubayeho , ni ukuvuga ko nta gaciro ukihaye . niba nibagiwe npfushije data , npfushije bakuru banjye , npfushije abavandimwe npfusha ... , u rwanda rucura imiborogo abantu barapfa barashira . wibagiwe ibyo bintu ukabihanagura kandi ureba noneho usigaye wenyine , ntugira hepfo ntugira ruguru . ntinzi ukuntu ... nkita cya cyaha baita sakirirego rwose .
what can you tell those who do n't know rwanda ? ||| nbwira . utazi u rwanda urumubwira utae ?
whenever i pass there , i change a bit and behave differently . i feel strange . it is as though i loose my humanity . ||| iyo mpageze ... ntinzi ! mpita mpinduka ku buryo muri uwo mwanya simba nkiri umuntu ,
however , i do n't have a cruel heart , the heart to kill . ||| kusa ni uko ya kamere yo kuicana ntayo iba ikurimo ,
i do n't feel like talking to anyone . ||| ariko nba numva nta n' umuntu wa nvugaish .
i just say a prayer , no matter how short it is , i just say one word of thanksgiving to the lord . ||| kusa iyo mpageze simba nvuga usibye ikintu nkora nkahasengera kusa . nkavuga isengesho niyo riba ari ijambo rimwe kusa ryo kushimira imaan . nicyo kintu nkora iyo mpageze ,
but in case i see someone related to the militias at that time , i become aggressive . ||| iyo mpatekereje . ariko hagati aho nk' iyo nbonye nk' abantu , bene wabo w' abicanyi bari ahongaho , abana babo mpita nnjyae numva nzanye ubugome .
sometimes i think of doing something horrible but because it is n't my nature i just get over it . ||| kusa nta kinri kintu ukora ukabiikuramo , ukaumva nawe utekereje kugira nabi .
whenever i reach there , i remember all the bad things that happened to me and then i feel like doing some horrible acts but i just ignore that feeling because i naturally do n't have that nature . ||| mbese hantera kutekereza kuri bya bibi bya nbayeho , nkaba na ... ngira nabi nnjyae ariko kubera ko ya kamere ntayo nfite ,
i can never do that ... ||| ntabyo nshobora kukora .
and what do you think about the other lady ; your cousin 's wife ? ||| naho iyo utekereje kuri ... uriya mugorae wa mukuru wawe ?
i normally do n't talk about that issue . in all the testimonies that i gave out , i never talked about her because i always get shocked when i remember her . ||| uriya we ntinjya nkunda no kubivuga kuko na ... na za temoignage ngiye ntanga ahantu henshi , ntabwo nkunze kuvuga amateka ye . kuko numva bi ... biranshoka [ birampungabanya ] cyane .
i always believe that i could have done something for her but i failed to it . ||| numva muri njyewe hari ngombye kuba nramukoreye ariko bikananira .
the way i left the pit is the way i would have got her out . ||| uko numvise nvuyemo numvaaga nmuvanamo ,
then maybe she would have been treated or something else would have been done ... but that is not what i did . ||| akaba yavuraw akagira katae ... ariko ntibishobokaaga .
there was n't anybody to help me ; maybe if i had got someone , i would have asked him to help me save the lady . ||| nta n' umuntu wunri nshoboraaga kwitabaza byiibuze ngo mubwirae nti @:
most of the time , i dream about her and my young sister ; i always see their images . ||| bigenze gutya , tugende dusove [ tutabarae ] uriya muntu . icyo kihae buri kihae rero nko mu ndoto zanjye akenshi image [ ishusho ] ye ihora inzamo cyane cyane na ka gashiki kanjye gatoya ,
even my two young sisters whom we do n't know how they were killed . ||| iyo ntekereje abo bashiki banjye batoya tutazi urupfu rwabo .
i always remember them . ||| nibo bahora bangarukamo buri kihae .
last time when we were exhuming my brother 's remaining , we almost lost his bones among other bones [ mixed with my sister in law 's bones ] but i separated them immediately . ||| kuburyo n' ejo bunri nshyingura mukuru wanjye , amagufa ye yashatse kuyobera mu yanri [ uwo mugorae wo kwa data wacu ] mpita nyakuramo ,
now we reburied them separately but next to one another . ||| ubu ngubu aho tubashyinguye nbashyinguye nbaegeranyaije . biibuze n' iyo ngiye nkatera indabo kuri iyo hejuru y' imva ye ,
at least now when i plant flowers on their graves , i feel better . ||| numva hari ikintu bimpinduyeho .
is this your first time to give a testimony ? ||| ni bwo bwa mbere utanga temoignage ?
it is not my first time . ||| ntabwo ari ubaw mbere .
besides telling it to my friends , i have given a testimony twice before . ||| ngirango nyatuye , ntayibwira abantu ku buryo tuganira nka mugenzi wanjye nk' uyunguyu cyangwa abandi , ni ubaw kabiri .
the first time it was at byimana where we were exhuming remainings of people . ||| ubaw mbere nyitanze turi turimo ... hari ahantu mu biimaan tucukuye amagufa ;
many people were killed in that area and now we constructed a memorial site there on the behalf of the district . ||| ahantu baroshye abantu benshi cyane aho tukoze urwibutso rwo mu karerae kose .
i gave out my testimony the day we reburied them . ||| uwo munsi tujya kubahamba nibwo ntanze temoignage ,
this is the second time . ||| ubu n' ubaw kabiri nongeye kuyitanga .
the first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ? ||| ubaw mbere uyitanga nta kintu kibi wumvise ?
how do you feel now as you talk about it ? ||| nk' ubungubu iyo ubivuze wunva umeze utae ?
maybe a fellow survivor ; it is the only person we share the same problems but i can not tell it to any other person . and it can only happen when we talk and find ourselves with common challenges . ||| kaereka umurescape wenyine niwe tubisangira kabisa , ntawunri muntu nshobora kubibwira .
for example the members of aerg ; we sit with them and talk like friends . ||| nawe tuganiriye tukakahuza urugwiro cyane cyane nk' abantu bo muri aerg , nibo tuicara nk' ahantu hamwe tutangira kukaganira , cyane nk' umuntu w' inshuti .
freddy can testify this . ||| nka freddy uriya yanabikubwira tukimara kubonaan , iyo mwicaye mu kaganira , uravuga wisanzuye kabisa ukabona uri muri famille .
the first time we met ... we talked and we were free as though we were from the same family . ||| ariko ku wunri muntu simfe n' uwakoze ... itsembabwoko ,
but telling it to other people or to those who committed the genocide seems too hard for me . ||| n' undi numva tudahuje imyumvire biragoye kugirango njyae kubimubwira kabisa .
what message can you give to the foreigners or rwandans of today or in the future ? ||| abanyamahanga cyangwa n' abanyarwanda , baba abubu cyangwa abo mu kihae kizaza . ni iyihe message [ ubutumwa ] ushobora kaubaha ?
the message i can give them ... i would like to give a message to especially rwandans who do n't know rwanda . ||| message nbaha ,
because telling a rwandan about genocide is not very difficult . ||| usibye ko iyo message yanjye akenshi numva nyiha abantu cyane cyane b' abanyamahanga batazi u rwanda , kuko umunyarwanda we kumubwira genocide ,
although they ignore it [ genocide ] , they know about it . ||| ntinumva ko uvunika cyane ubimubwira n' aho yabiirengagiza ibyo ari byo byose arabizi .
but foreigners especially white people take things lightly . ||| ariko nk' umunyamahanga message nmuha uzi yuko akenshi nk' abazungu bakunda kufata ibintu a la legele [ kubyoroshya ] ntibabifatae uko bigomba kuba .
they do n't consider this the way they are . but in actual sense , they shy away from the truth . ||| nyamara mu by' ukuri bafite ... bahishe ukuri ... barabibonaaga , bari bafite amacamera .
because they had cameras and some of them participated in the genocide . for example the belgians and those un soldiers of unamir together with others , they had all the information . ||| harimo n' ababigizemo uruhare nk' ababiligi n' abandi na bariya basirikare ba nations unies ( un ) ni minoir harya ? bafite information [ amakuru ] zose .
all i can tell them is ; when we say this , it is not a form of enjoying life . ||| ikintu nbabwira ni uko iyo tuvuga ibi ntabwo ari imyidagaduro tuba turimo .
when we say this ... consider the time i have spent here ! ||| iyo tuvuga ibi ,
i am a student , i am surposed to be in class now with other students . i had to spend my time here instead of learning extra chapters in class ! ||| reba umwanya ntaye aha nkaha . nraiga ngombye kuba ndi mu ishuri kimwe n' abandi , ariko nigomwe uyu mwanya kuza kuvuga ibingibi ngombye kuba maze kufata chapitre runaka nzisoma .
i know it is very important to give out my testimony so that the whole world especially the foreigners would see it . ||| ariko numva ko ari ikintu kingombaw ngomba kuza nkatanga nka temoignage izabona abantu ku isi hose abantu benshi , cyane cyane abanyamahanga .
i think the genocide that took place in rwanda should be given its value . ||| ikintu nbona rero ni uko genocide yabaye mu rwanda bagomba kuyiha agaciro .
although there is nothing they can do to help us as rwandans , they should just believe that there was genocide in rwanda and give it its value . ||| n' ubwo ntacyo batumarair nk' abanyarwanda , ariko bakamenya ngo genocide yarabaye , bakayiha agaciro igomba kugira .
when we spend days talking about the genocide , we do n't say it for sale . ||| iyo tuirirwa tubivuga ntabwo tubivuga kugira ngo tubicuruzae .
president paul kagame once talked about it . he said ; " those who say that we sell genocide , i wish they tell me how much is a kilogram or a litter of blood . @" ||| kagame yigeze kubivuga ati @: "@ nk' abavuga ko tucuruza genocide uwamubaza ko ikiro ... litiro y' amaraso igura angahe ? @"
to you , what 's the importance of remembering and giving value to genocide ? what would you wish to be remembered forever ? ||| ku bwawe kuibuka no kaubaha genocide wunva ari akahae kamaro bifite ? ni iki cyane cyane utashaka ko bakuibagirwa ?
what i wish to be remembered is the massive innocent people that were killed . ||| icyo ntashaka ko bakuibagirwa n' iyo nbaga y' abanyarwanda yapfuye izira akarengaane .
now they would be helping the counntry and our country would develop like other countries . ||| bagombye kuba ubu bakorera igihugu , igihugu cyacu kikatera inberae kimwe n' ibindi byose . kuyibagirwa rero numva ari amakosa akomeye cyane .
therefore , forgeting the genocide is a big mistake . once you forget the genocide it seems like you do n't value human rights . ||| kandi iyo uyibagiwe , uba ufashe na bibinri tuvuga by' uburenganzira bw' ikiramwamuntu ntacyo biba bimaze .
because you can never obey human rights yet you do n't accept so and so as a human being . ||| kuko uzubahiriza uburenganzira se kutae bw' umuntu , utanemera ko ari umuntu .
therefore , considering genocide means considering people as human beings and not animals . and respecting people as human beings . ||| kutayibagirwa rero ni ukudafata abantu nk' inyamaswa . ukabaha agaciro bafite nk' abantu . eh ,
that is all i can say . ||| ni icyo kintu numva nvuga .
do you want to add on anything ? ||| hari icyo ushaka kaongeraho ?
we still have twenty @-@ six minutes extra . ||| nrabona hasigaye iminota makumyabiri n' itandatu .
the additional information i have is for those who do n't know this country , a testimony to people who do n't acknowledge that there was genocide in rwanda . ||| ikindi nkaongeraho , wenda turenze ibyo ngibyo byo kaubaha temoignage abantu batazi iki gihugu , kuha temoignage abantu bahakana genocide .
what i can add on , i would first go back to the case of the survivors especially the youth because the old ones are too miserable to listen to this . ||| jyae nkaongeraho nkigarukair kuri cadre y' abarescape , cyane cyane nbwira urubyiruko , kuko abakecuru abasaza barokotse bacu , bo kugira ngo uzanamubwirae ibingibi ,
but young people especially the survivors i would give them my testimony saying that , "@ they should never despair . @" ||| baraihebye ku buryo burenze . kikoze abantu bakiri batoya , cyane cyane b' aba rescapes , nbaha temoignage ngira nti @:
we can not change the past . ||| ntibakihebae . ibyabaye birabaye simbivuga nka kwa kunri ,
i am not saying that we forget and reconciliate . ||| ngo @: " tubiibagirwae , ngo tuiyungae . @"
but we should not be taken up by out past . ||| ariko ntabwo tushobora kuheraanw n' ibyabaye .
but it does n't mean that we should forget the genocide , instead we should always think about it because it makes us strong . ||| bitavuze ko tugomba kuibagirwa genocide . ahubwo genocide tuka @yitekerezaho , ikaduh' ingufu .
remembering gives us power to fight against any other thing that would ever cause another genocide in rwanda . ||| kutaibagirwa bikaduh' ingufu yo kurwanya ikintu cyose kizatuma genocide yongera kuba mu gihugu cyacu .
we are the ones to give genocide its value . ||| kuba genocide ... kuibuka genocide agaciro bigomba kugira , nitwae tuzabikaha .
if we do n't value it , no one else will . ||| ntitutabikaha nta n' undi uzabikaha ,
if we do n't give out these testimonies , no one else will give them out . if we do n't fight for the construction of memorial sites , no one will ever stand up for their constuction . ||| tutatanze izi temoignages nta wunri uzaza kuyitanga . tutabirwanaiye ngo inzibutso runaka zaubakawe , nta wunri uzabirwanair .
it is our task to stand up for our rights . ||| nitwae tugomba kurwanair uburenganzira bwacu ,
we should get our freedom of living . ||| kandi tuharanira kubaho .
to live again . ||| kaongera kubaho .
this is the testimony i can give to the youth survivors . ||| niyo temoignage numva nha cyane cyane les jeunes rescapes [ urubyiruko rucitse ku icumu ] .
thanks . ||| asante .
tell us your age ... ||| tubwirae imyaka ufite .
my age ... ? ||| imyaka ?
i was born in 1954 . ||| nvutse muri mirongo itanu na kane [ 1954 ] .
well about the history of 1954 , i was still young , i was about four years old . i think i can only remember few things like when my family and i were migrating . ||| ubwo amateka ya mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] nri mutoya . ariko nri nfite ngo nk' imyaka ine ngirango , nraumva bikeya nkibiibukaho bike .
but what i remember is the war that took place in the 1961 ... 1963 in the range of that time . ||| kuko nibuka iwacu tuhunga . ibyo nvugaho cyane nzi , ni ibyo muri za mirongo itandatu na rimwe ... na gatatu ... gutyo .
even then we migrated while they were seizing and eating our cattle , burning our houses and still it was the hutus killing the tutsis . ||| nabwo turahunze , barya inka z' iwacu , ubwo icyo kihae ni abahutu bicaaga abatutsi , banabatwikira barya n' inka zabo .
they demolished the tutsi 's houses . ||| ibindi rero na none nzi ,
then other things that i remember well are the events of 1973 because then i was a wench . ||| cyane ho nri mukuru nzi ubwenge , nri inkumi , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] . muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] ,
still it was the hutu killing the tutsi . ||| na none ni abahutu bicaaga abatutsi .
they demolished tutsi 's houses and killed them . ||| barabasenyair barabica ,
some tutsis fled . ||| bamwe barahunga ,
that time we fled to kamonyi church in gitarama [ in kamonyi district ] . ||| icyo kihae tunahungiye muri kiliziya yo ku kamonyi , i kitaarama , mu karerae ka kamonyi . ubwo turahunga ,
then they [ hutus ] said that the war should stop . ||| baratusenyair turaongera ... baravuga bati @: "@ intambara ni ihoshae ,
therefore , we went back to our stumbles and reconstructed the houses . ||| turaongera tusubira mu matongo , turaubaka turasaan . @"
then we stayed there ... that was in 1973 . ||| ubwo tuba aho , muri mirongo irindwi ubwo na gatatu .
the situation never improved , the hutus continued to mistreat the tutsis . ||| birakomeza ntibiba byiza . na none abahutu bakomeza gusarika abatutsi . bigera muri za mirongo inani ... inani n' umunani [ 1980 @-@ 1988 ] ,
untill that period between 1980 and 1988 when tutsis were menaced so much by the hutus in areas like bugesera and kibirira . ||| nibwo hirya no hino bagendaaga nka za bugesair ; za kibirira ; bakomeza kugenda mbese abahutu bakomeza kutoteza abatutsi . ariko bigeze muri mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] ,
generally , the hutus continued to torture the tutsis . ||| inkotanyi ziteye , na none abatutsi baraicwa . baratotezaw , barafungwa mu byitso ,
then in 1990 when the ikontanyi [ rpf army ] invaded the country , tutsis were subjected to serious torture ; they were killed , imprisoned accused of being traitors , others were killed , houses were burnt in all those areas of kibirira , bugesera and in the bagogwe in ruhengeri . ||| abandi baraicwa baratwika . za kibirira aho , za bugesair , hariya mu bagogwe ,
this continued up to 1994 when habyarima 's airplane crashed on its way from tanzania . ||| mu ruhengeri . birakomeza bigeze muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] noneho , aribwo habyarimana indege ye yahanukaaga avuye tanzaniya ,
then they started killing the tutsis with all their effort saying that tutsis were responsible for habyarima 's death . "@ therefore , they [ tutsis ] have to pay for it , " they said . ||| bahise bica abatutsi barabatsemba . kuko bavugaaga ngo @: "@ abatutsi nibo baishe habyarimana , ngo none ni babiturae babicae . @"
with the help of soldiers together with the interahamwe who had been given enough training in bugesera and mutara , they were trained posible methods of killing people . ||| bafatanya n' abasirikare bariho icyo kihae , bafatanya n' interahamwe zatozawaga ... zari zaratojwe kera , baba ... bamwe babatorezaga mu bugesair , abandi mu mutara ,
then tutsis died , they were killed ... these were the tutsis being killed . ||| baratojwe ibintu byo kuica kusa . ubwo hapfaaga abatutsi , baraicwa ni abatutsi baicwaaga .
and it was one clan killing the other . ||| ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi .
it was a clan killing the other clan , it was n't like , ‘ a person had a grage with a fellow , ’ it was a certain clan that had been trained to kill the other clan . ||| ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi , ntabwo ari ukuvuga ngo ni runaka unganye na runaka nk' abaturanyi , ni ubwoko kusa butaotaijew ,
therefore , one clan died . ||| haicwa ubwoko bumwe .
and , they really killed them ; they killed them so painfuly with a lot of torture . ||| barabica pe ! babica urugaraguro . babica nabi @:
some were drowned in rivers and lakes ; others were thrown in latrines or pits . ||| abo bata mu nzuzi ; abo bata mu misarane ; abo bata mu myobo ;
until when the inkotanyi liberated this country and ceased the war and the killings . ||| kugeza igihe inkotanyi zifataiye iki gihugu bahosha iyo ntiambara ... bahosha ubwo bwicanyi .
and later they set up a law of arresting those who perticipated in the killings . ||| ubwicanyi bamaze kubuhosha , bashyiraho ko , abakoze ubwo bwicanyi babafata ... bafataw bakafungwa .
they were arrested ... those ones that we would see , we would report them . ||| barabafunga turabavuga abantu baishe ... baishe tureba ,
but our primary desire is to see people being purnished accordingly . ||| ariko ikintu cya mbere na mbere umuntu yifuza , yifuza ko habaho kuhana by' intangarugero , umuntu wishe undi .
a killer ... the culture of not punishing should be abolished completely . because during habyarimana 's regime no body would be punished over killing someone . a hutu would not be punished for killing a tutsi . ||| umuco wo kutahana ukaranduka . kuko icyo kihae ku bwa habyarimana , ntabwo umuntu yicaaga undi ngo abihanairwe . nta muhutu wicaga umututsi ngo abihanairwe .
neither would he be imprisoned . ||| yemwe no kufungwa ntiyafungwaaga .
it was an earlier planned program and they all knew all about it . ||| kuko yari gahunda yateguwe kera , bari bayizi .
all they did , they were prepared for it [ genocide ] , it was not a sudden event . ||| n' ibyo bakoze , bakoze ibyo bari basanganywe , si ibyo bigiyeho .
the most important thing is to set up a culture of punishing those who harassed others ... those who killed others . ||| ikintu cya mbere nbona kiza rero , ni umuco wo kuhana .
they should be punished accordingly and in public for others to see and learn a lesson . ||| bakahana uwibasiye undi bakahana umuntu wishe undi by' intangarugero , kandi kumugaragaro . n' abandi bakaboneraho .
and another important thing is ; this history of the killings of the innocent tutsis , who died for no reason , should never perish . ||| ikindi rero kiza ni uko aya mateka , y' ubu bwicanyi bw' abatutsi baishwe bahoraw ubusa ... b' inzirakarengane . numva ko bigomba ... nako sijye jyenyine , ni tuesae .
not only my testimony but also everyone 's . it [ history ] should never be forgotten . ||| bitasibangana , bitakwaiye kwibagirana ,
we should always remember it . ||| tukwaiye kuhora tubiibuka ,
it must be written in books so that our grand children will be able to read and know what happened . ||| kandi bikaandikaw no mu bitabo . n' abana ... ab' abana bacu bazabyara bakazakura bazi ... bakavuka ba ... ibyo bitabo bihari babisoma , bamenya icyabaye , bitibagiranye .
they should know the cause , who killed who ... they should know that the hutus killed the tutsis that time . ||| bakamenya icyabiteye icyo kihae , bakamenya abantu bicaaga abandi , bakamenya ko abahutu baishe abatutsi icyo kihae .
but they should punish those people accordingly so that the culture of not punishing stops . ||| ariko bakahana ba bantu , by' intangarugero .
that way , the habit of killing one another will stop . ||| ku buryo umuco wo kuica ... wo kuicana ucika .
even that one who had a thought of killing would stop because he or she knows she would be purnished for it . ||| n' utekereza kuica , akabitinya kubera ko azi ko yabihanairw .
i would like to ask you some few questions in order for us to fully understand what happened . ||| numvaaga hari utubazo dukeya numva nkubaza , kugirango tukomezae tusobanukirwae n' ibyabaye .
you told us that in 1959 you already existed but you were still young . ||| utubwiye ko muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] uri uriho , ariko uri ukiri mutoya .
but you can tell us the little you remember about the way they attacked how it was in your area , how you fled or what happened to you . ||| ariko ... utusobanurair niba hari utwo wibuka muri makeya @: uko bateraaga , uko iwanyu biri bimeze ,
just tell us in breif what happened during that time . ||| uko se mbese mwahunze . cyangwa se uko bigenze kutae ... utunyurairmo muri makeya uko bigenze icyo kihae ?
we fled . ||| umh , turahunze .
i remember that in 1963 i was very young . ||| nrabiibuka nri mutoya muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] .
we fled after they attacked our home and burnt our houses . ||| turahunze bateye iwacu baratwika ,
we fled to a certain hill , which was a bushy . ||| tuhungira nko ku musozi wo hakurya , hari ishyamba .
we had a lot of cattle ; therefore we migrated with them . ||| kubera ko hari inka nyinshi tuhungaan n' inka .
however they demolished our houses though . ||| ariko baratusenyair .
what was the name of that hill where you were living before migrating ? ||| mwavuye ku musozi mwari mutuyeho witwa ... ?
eh ... we were living on a hill called ikibanda . ||| eh , ahongaho turi tutuye ku musozi witwa ... hitwa ikaibanda ,
we left that place and went to some place beyond kinazi . ||| tujya ahandi hantu hirya y' ikinazi ,
there was a forest called nyabusunzu . that time many tutsis gathered there because most of their houses were burnt at the same time . ||| ahantu hari ishyamba baitaaga inyabusunzu . icyo kihae abatutsi benshi barahakoranaiye , kuko bagiye kutwika batwikira rimwe .
they met there with their cows and their children . ||| n' inka zabo n' abana .
some people [ tutsi ] went to bugesera and others went to sainte @- famille church . ||| bamwe bahita bagenda bajya iyo za bugesair abandi baza banaza hano za sainte @-@ famille hariya .
in the past , people had been running to church on several occasions unlike in 1994 when people ran there and died from there . ||| burya kiliziya nta kihae abantu batayihungiyemo . uretse muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , nibwo bayihungiyemo banayirawmo .
even that time same thing happened and continued like that ; they attacked and killed , hit tutsis with club , some people died , and others fled to exile . ||| ubwo icyo kihae nabwo birabaye bikomeza bityo ; batera abantu bakarya inka , abandi bakica bakakubita amahiri ... abantu baranapfuye , abandi bajya mu mahanga .
there was no other reason why people [ tutsis ] went to exile ; they were fleeing from the hutus , who were menacing them with in the country . ||| ariko bariya bagiye mu mahanga , ntabwo bagiye bagiye ku bunri buryo , ni ku buryo bwo kuhunga abahutu bari babamenesheje mu gihugu .
there is no time when a hutu stopped torturing a tutsi ever since 1959 up to 1994 . ||| nta kihae umuhutu atatoteje umututsi . kuva muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] kugeza ejo bunri muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] ,
it was always the hutu killing the tutsi . ||| ni abahutu bicaaga abatutsi .
do you know by names , anyone who was killed ? for example you can tell us that ; so and so , their houses were demolished and later they were killed ... ||| hari abo uzi baishwe , uba uzi amazina wenda ukavuga uti kanaka yaratwikaiyew baramwica ...
in our family ... ? ||| eh iwacu ?
are you talking about the time in 1959 ? ||| ... icyo kihae muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ?
yes between 1959 and 1963 , within that range ... ||| itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] .... itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] kugeza aho .
yes , some old men died . ||| eh , hari abasaza ... hari abasaza , barapfuye abo basaza ,
though some went to exile and died there ; my brother died from tanzania . ||| ariko abandi bagiye mu mahanga banagwayo . harimo na musaza wanjye uguye muri tanzaniya .
he migrated to tanzania when he was already married with children . he lived there untill when he died . ||| yagiye yubatse yitwaaga kamonyo . eh , yari abyaye , yagiye tanzaniya abayo ni naho yapfairiye .
and later , his wife and children came back ; they were three children and one of them was killed during the genocide from a place called mumena . ||| ariko nyuma abana be n' umugore baje kuza , yari afite abana batatu . abana be umwe yanagu ... banamwiciye hano ku mumena muri jenoside .
several people died ; they were killed . ||| bagiye bapfa benshi barapfuye , barabaishe barapfa .
and since it was long time ago , somethings are hard to recall them well . ||| ni uko aba ari na kera umuntu ahari aba atabiibuka cyane . yee ,
but people died a lot . ||| ariko barapfuye .
when you ran to that hill , did you return home ? ||| ubwo mujya kuri uwo musozi mwagarutse mu rugo ?
well in 1973 , it was kayibanda still on power . ||| eeh , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] rero , ubwo hari hakiriho kayibanda .
habyarimana was chief commander . i remember it was on the 28th feb 1973 , when they attacked our home village . ||| habyarimana yari umusirikare mukuru . noneho nrabiibuka hari muri mirongo irindaw na gatatu mu kwezi kwa kabiri , kuri makumyabiri n' umunani [ 28 /02 / 1973 ] , nibwo bitangiye iwacu .
they burnt and killed many people . ||| barasenya ; baratwika ; bica abantu benshi .
that time they killed so many people . i had a brother @-@ in @-@ law whose shop was destroyed . ||| barabaishe benshi cyanee icyo kihae ... hari ni ... hari muramu wanjye icyo kihae iduka rye bararisenyae ,
he escaped through a bush . ||| bacikair mw' ishyamba ,
they tried to look for him but they never got him . ||| baramushaka baramubura ,
but his shop was already distroyed . ||| ariko bamusenyeye .
that time we fled and came to kigali in biryogo . ||| ubwongubwo turanaje turahunga tuza hano i kigali , hariya mu biryogo .
we spent there less that a month 's time . ||| tuhageze tuhamaze ... nta mezi abiri ... nta kwezi kushize .
then they made a patrol of capturing all the tutsis and take them to bugesera in maranyundo . ||| bakora umukwabu wo kutujyana i bugesair , i maranyundo .
i guess you have ever heard about it ... i am among the people who were imprisoned in maranyundo . ||| ngirango ahari ujya wunva babivuga . nnjyae nfungaiyew i maranyundo .
even that time they made a patrol but it was just for getting the tutsis . ||| icyo kihae bakoze umukwabu baratutwara , ariko nabwo ari mu buryo bwo kushaka abatutsi ,
we realised it when we were in bugesera . ||| kuko turangije kubibona tugeze i bugesair .
they came and transported us to bugesera in maranyundo in the bush . ||| baraje ubwo baratutunze batujyana i bugesair , i maranyundo mu ishyamba , batujyanye mu bikamyo ,
they used trucks , min buses , and those big cars that transport beers from gisenyi [ from bralirwa ] . ||| mu mabisi na ziriya modokari ... nka biriya bikamyo binini binjyaaga kuzana amayoga za gisenyi , icyo kihae barazifashe , baradutunda .
therefore they gathered us there in t he muhima prison . by then it was a police . it used to be called commissariat . ||| batushyiraaga hariya kuri gereza ya muhaima bahitaaga komisaliya [ commissariat ] , hari kuri komisaliya icyo kihae .
while still there ... meanwhile , you reached at some point and got married ... ? ||| tukiri ahongaho ... nyuma ariko uje kugezaho urashaka ... ?
yes , that was in 1973 . i got married in 1974 . ||| yee , nyuma nrashatse hari muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] icyo kihae ... nshatse muri mirongo irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] .
so you had a chance of getting children ? ||| noneho ugize amahirwe yo kugira abana ?
yes , but one died and the father . ||| yee , ariko umwe yarapfuye , na se .
would you tell us briefly what happened in the period of party @-@ struggles , was your family tortured ? ||| noneho mu kihae cy' amashyaka se utunyurairmo uko bigenze k' umwihariko w' iwanyu uko ... niba birabagezeho kubatoteza ...
during habyarimana 's party @-@ struggles ... ? ||| igihe cy' amashyaka ayangaya ya habyarimana ?
there was cdr , mrnd there was also another party , which was suppressed or discriminated against , because they considered it to be a tutsi 's party . ||| hari cdr ,
this party was called pl . ||| hari mrnd ,
but the strongest and powerful parties in the country were cdr and mrnd . ||| hari ... na ... harimo n' irinri shyaka ritotezawaga naryo kuko ryari iry' abatutsi ... bavugaaga ko ari iry' abatutsi nka plariko rero amashyaka yari akazae cyane yari anakomeye mu gihugu ni cdr na mrnd .
we were oppressed and tortured very much . ||| twaratotejwe cyane ,
after bucyana death , we were attacked and my husband was beaten . ||| twaratotejwe iwacu mu rugo , bucyaan yapfuye baratuteye . baratuteye umugabo wanjye baramukubita ,
they left knowing that he was died . ||| bagenda bazi ko yapfuye .
they robbed us ... by then we were living over there , near kabuga 's building . ||| baratusahura , yemwe turi tutuye hariya haruguru yo kwa kabuga barahatumenaish . tukajya tugenda turaraguzwa nk' i ... nk' abatagira iyo bajya .
but we were thrown out of our house and we started sleeping around like we did have where we belonged . ||| ubwo bihereye aho baratutoteza aho tutuye bakatutoteza ,
that was the beging of those tortures ; just from those parties . ||| kubera ariya mashyaka .
for example whenever cdr would strike , people would be beaten ... i am telling you , people would die . ||| iyo cdr yabaga yakoze imyigaragambyo , abantu bakapfa bakakubitaw , yemwe bakanabica .
they used to have grenades . ||| bari bafite n' amagrenade ,
therefore , they would throw grenades to places like shops where several tutsis would attend or drink beers . ||| barebaaga ahantu nka nk' aka boutike kanywairagamo abatutsi ,
for example there was a certain man , who lived in muhima and owned a boutique . ||| hari umugabo uri uri hariya ku muhaima baitaaga kamanda , yari afite boutique .
therefore , people were obliged to drink from kamanda 's boutique because if they went to cdr 's bars they would not get out still alive . ||| boutique ya kamanda rero yakundaaga kunywebwamo n' abantu kuko bo biri ngombaw kugira ngo abe ariho banywair , iyo unywairaga muri ako kabari ka cdr ntiuhavaaga utakubaiswe .
even if it were women like us , we would be so careful to buy something like sugar from there . ||| ntawe b' abagore iyo ujyaaga kuguramo isukari ,
because if you accidentaly stepped on somebody you would be beaten . ||| muri boutique usitara ku muntu gato ukakubitaw .
even kamanda was one of the people who were being menaced . infact he was killed just of recent . ||| ubwo rero uraumva ko uwo mugabo kamanda nawe baramutoteje baranamwishe ejo bunri .
he was a young man not very mature ; he was n't even married . ||| ntiyari n' umugabo , yari umuntu w' umusore yari ataranashaka .
generally they menaced people ... there is no single day when they stopped menacing people ; it is a long story . ||| ubwo baratoteza nta kihae batatoteje , ni birebire .
therefore , kamanda 's shop was crached with a grunade by the cdr members . ||| ubwo cdr nk' ahongaho kwa kamanda bahakubise grenade .
whenever they would strike , they would kill people ; they would burn places with grunades . ||| iyo babaga bakoze imyigaragambyo @: bicaaga abantu ;
never the less they would ambush people on roads . they would stub people with bayonets . ||| kufata amagrenade bakatera ... biti ihi se , bakategair mu mayira ; bakakutera ibyuma ;
cdr was habyarimana 's political party , it was simillar to parmehutu of the past . ||| baaka ... ubwo cdr yari ishyaka ryo kwa ... rya habyarimana , nairyo shyaka naryo ryari rimeze nka parmet hutu uko yari imeze mbere . yari iye . amashyaka nabwo icyo kihae ... iryo shyaka naryo ryari rimeze nka parmehutu uko yari imeze mbere .
and finally they came to your home ... ? ||| ubwo baza iwanyu ... ?
therefore , i took off throught the gakingiro road with my children . ||| ubwo nkomeje ntya , nrazamuka nyura iyo mu gakinjiro , nshoreye abana .
i had a sister @-@ in @-@ law , she was at home with the kids ; the first time they attacked us , she jumped over and hid slightly below our home . ||| hari muramukazi wanjye yari ari iwacu ubwo n' abana , nawe igitero kituteye yarasimbutse ajya ahantu munsi yacu ,
and , a certain lady who was living there hid her under her bed . ||| umudamu waho amushyira munsi y' igitanda .
i continued and passed via the police station . ||| nrazamuka nyura iyo kuri burigade ,
because , there at manumental ... there was a horrible roadblock that nobody would escape . ||| kuko kuri manumetal uzamutse hariya ... kunyura hariya munsi ya manumetal hari bariyeri mbi cyane , nta muntu unayisimbukaagaho .
therefore i said to myself , "@ i rather pass via the police and if there are policemen , they better shot me rather than being hacked . @" ||| ubwo nravuga nti @: "@ reka nyurae kuri burigade , niba abajandarume bahari banrasa banrase ... banrase batanyishe ... batantemye . @"
therefore , i proceeded and the policemen saw the kids . ||| ubwo ntakomeza nrazamuka abajandarume barareba abana . noneho babaza abana nri nshoreye ,
then they ased them , "@ you kids , where are you going ... ? i was carrying another baby at my back . ||| ngo @: "@ yemwe ba ... @" bati ... nri mpetse n' umwana . ngo @: "@ murajyahe ba sha ,
so , they again asked , "@ are you inyenzi ! @" ||| ngo @: ubwo nti muri inyenzi ? @"
but the kids denied that , they were n't inyenzi though the policemen were seeing them . ||| abana baravuga ngo hoya ntabwo turi inyenzi kubera ko yabarebaaga .
then they asked again , "@ is that your mother ? @" ||| ni uko , noneho aravuga ngo @: "@ ese uwo ni mama wanyu ? nti @:
[ they were reffering to me ] i said , "@ yes , i am their mother . @" he mockingly laughed and said ; "@ go and die from other people 's hands . @" ||| yego . araseka ati @: "@ ngaho nimugendae nimugera iyo mujya nuko ! @"
we continued together with the children approaching the market . ||| nragenda nracyashoreye ba baba nkata gutya munsi y' isoko , interahamwe z' insoresore zifite n' inkota ... z' utwana nako turi utwana .
then we met young interahamwe militia who had knives ; the oldest was about 14 years . ||| ko ubonaaga se agakuru nka ... umukuru muri bo yari afite nk' imyaka nka cumi n' ine ... ubwo ari we musore urimo . ubwo baba barantangiraiye . bati @: "@ dore we ... bati @:
they asked me ; " who are you ? @" ||| niko wa mugorae we ... @" nti @: ye . bati @: "@ uri iki ? @"
i replied , "@ i am a human being . @" ||| nti ndi @: umuntu .
"@ listen to the tutsi arrogance ! ||| ngo @: "@ agasuzuguro kabo .
do you think we can not see that you are a human being ? @" one of them retorted ! ||| ngo ubu se ntabwo tubibona ko uri umuntu ... uri umuki ?
"@ we are asking if you are a tutsi or a hutu ? @" ||| uri umuhutu uri umututsi ? @" nti @:
he explained . ||| "@ simbizi ibyo mushaka muvugae ibyo .
then i told them that , "@ i did n't know ! ||| nti @:
whatever you want call me that . and , do what you think is fine with you . @" ||| ibyo mushaka namwe mufatae ibyo . @"
one of the young militia showed me his knife , which was stained with blood . ||| umwana umwe anyereka inkota yari iriho amaraso .
and then he asked me , "@ do you see this ... ? ||| ngo @: "@ ubu ikingiki urakireba ,
what is it ? @" ||| ngo n' iki ? @"
i replied him that , "@ it is a knife . @" ||| nti @: "@ ni inkota . @" ati @:
"@ do n't you see the blood stained on it ? @" ||| "@ nta maraso ureba ho ? @"@
he asked once again . ||| nti @:
then i told him that i was seeing it . ||| nrayareba ho . @"
he went on and asked me , "@ do you see a cross ? @" ||| ngo @: "@ urareba hariya hepfo ? @"@
"@ yes i do . @" ||| nti @:
i replied . ||| "@ ntahareba . @"
"@ do you see others who are lying t here ? @" ||| "@ ... ntabwo ureba abandi baharyamye ? @"@
"@ yes i do @" i relpied . ||| nti @: "@ yego . @" ngo @:
"@ i am going to take you there right now . @" ||| "@ ubu ntakujyanayo none aha . @"
he assured me . ||| nti @:
then i told him that , "@ do as you wish . @" ||| "@ ubikorae uko ubiumva . @"
meanwhile , whenever you would be in such people 's hands , there was nothing much to do . ||| kuko hagati aho , iyo ubaga ubagezemo ... iyo ubaga ubagezemo , nta kinri ugombaaga kukora .
you would just become so desperate and fear would disappear . even those who died , they died strong with no more fear . ||| nta n' ubwoba ubaga ukifite . burya ntabwo ... n' uwapfuye nta bwoba yari afite .
you would simply be sure that you were in the hell 's hands . ||| yari yarangije ... birangiye wunva ko uyo ugeze mu rupfu .
no one would come for your rescure or listen to your sorrows . one would just say a simple prayer , "@ god , take my life as you wish . @" ||| ntawe utabaza ngo akutabarae , ntawe uganyira ... uravugaaga uti @: "@ imaan inyakirae uko ishaka . @" nuko .
suddenly a certain policeman who used to come to our home appeared . ||| ubwo bigeze aho hahinguka umujandarume umwe ujyaaga aza iwacu .
then i begged him , "@ nkyesha ! they are going to kill me with my children ... @" "@ who are those ... ? @" ||| nramubwira nti @: "@ nyeshya ko bagiye kunyicana n' abana . @" ati @: "@ ni bande ? @"
he asked . ||| mu kihae akibaza ngo @:
and , as he was asking , the first boy disappeared and another one followed , in no time we were left only two of us . ||| ni bande , umwe aba aciye aha , undi aciye aha , undi aciye aha .
it was that policeman , who took me to nyarugege commune and we stayed there . ||| tusigara twenyine . niwe unjyanye angeza kuri komine ... nyarugengae . kuri komine nyarugengae turahaba ,
however , the next get to the commune was , seized by the soldiers [ the presidential guard unit ] . ||| turahabaa ... tusanga icyo gipangu cy' iruhande rwa komine nyarugengae cyabohojwe n' abajepe [ gp @:
they retreated to nyarugenge after the inkotanyi had chased them from kimihurura where they had suffered defeat in the battle with rpf soldiers . ||| umutwe uri ushinzwe kurinda perezida ] bamaze kuhunga kimihurura inkotanyi zihageze , zirahabairukanye .
when we reached there , we found when they had siezed that gate and the house was full of their wives and children . ||| tusanga barakibohoje harimo abagore babo n' abana babo .
i remember we were many people , who had got to seek refuge there . ||| turi ... icyo kihae turi abantu benshi bahahungiye , abavuye za kivugiza ,
some were coming from those ends of kivugiza , cyahafi , muhima ... we were very many about one hundred and eighty [ 180 people ] they refused to allow us in saying that , we should go and join those nyenzi [ cockroaches ] . ||| abavuye za ... aho hose za cyahafi za muhaima . turi benshi cyane turi abantu bageze ku ijana na mirongo inani . nuko ubwo baanga ko tuhajya bati @: "@ ntitugiye kuterana na ziriya nyenzi . @"
in a group of interahamwe who came to kill us , there was a taxi driver called kadahwema , a notorious killer from gisenyi . ||| hari , hari interahamwe yitwa katahwema ni umunyagisenyi we yari interahamwe iteye ubwoba , yari n' umutagisimani mbere .
who wore a military uniform and was armed with a gun . ||| katahwema nrabiibuka yari yambaye tenue [ imyenda ya gisirikare ] kuva hasi kugera hejuru . yarabaye nk' umusirikare . yaraje ahakura abantu ... ahakura abantu benshi cyane ... cyane ntazi n' umubare ahari . nuko katahwema yari afite imbunda ;
they killed many people mostly men and the rest of us were taken to gakinjiro where we were put on a line and started killing men . ||| yari afite icyuma ; yari yaravuye mu ... hano kwa bikinri mu ntuza ... zari za nterahamwe zo kwa bikinri . yari umunyagisenyi yari uwo iwabo . nuko ,
after all the men were killed , our turn came . ||| hariya turi turi hari abantu benshi , haguye abantu benshi ... yemwe nnjyae icyo kihae hari baraje baratutwara , ariko bamaze kuica abantu benshi cyane . abantu baitwa abagabo benshi bari bamaze kupfa n' abagore bapfuye benshi cyane .
but before they had killed any of us ( woman ) one of the interahamwe milicious from butaro said ; "@ as you are going to finish them all , who shall escort our parent habyarimana after on the day of his burial ? ||| ntawe baza kututwara baratumanukaan hepfo mu gakinjiro hepfo . bica abagabo turi kumwe , turi ku murongo . bica abagabo turi kumwe ,
i order now , do n't kill those ladies . ||| bamaze kubica bageze ku bagorae , interahamwe imwe iravuga ngo iwabo ni muri butaro . aravuga ngo @:
take them back . @" ||| "@ eh ! ko nreba n' abangaba mugiye kubica , ngo umubyeyi wacu ni tumushyingura tuzamworosa iki ? ngo @:
that was how we left that pit hole with several other people we were together . ||| nravuze ngo nimurekae abo bagorae ... ngo nimubasubizeyo . @" ni uko tuvuye kuri uwo mwobo , n' abandi bagenzi bajyae turi kumwe .
therefore , we stayed there waiting for our fate to come ; each day one would think it was the last da . ||| ubwo tuba ahongaho turahanambair ,
believing that if you survive at night , you would die at noon . ||| mbese buri munsi ubaga uzi ko uri bupfae . uzi ko n' utapfa ninjoro upfa ku manywa . kugeza igihe inkotanyi zizaiye ,
we lived in such dilema till when the rpf soldiers invaded and liberated us . they took us in saint andre [ secondary school ] and that was the end of war . ||| zirahabohoza nizo zatubohoje , zituryana saint andre . nuko tura ... intambara rero ubwo iba irashize , baba barahosheje ibyo kutuica ,
they stopped those killing but the perticipants should be purnished accordingly .... as an exemplary . ||| kugeza na n' ubu turiho . ariko rero ubundi umuntu wishe , ukoze biriya ... ariya mahano yo kuica , bari bakwaiye kujya bahanaw by' intangarugero ... by' intangarugero .
and secondly , the genocide history should be maintained and we should never forget . ||| kandi ikindi aya mateka ya jenoside ... y' itsembabwoko ntazarekae kubaho , kandi ntituzarekae kuibuka .
let all the coming generations ever in life learn that "@ there was genocide in rwanda . @" they should read it from books , hear from the tales of witnesses who will be present by then , but never let the history die . ||| n' umwana n' umwuzukuruza n' ubuvivi buzaza , azazae azi ko icyo kintu kibayeho . ari ibitabo abisomae ;
because we must keep remembering our beloved ones who died and remember what happened . ||| ari ukiriho ubizi amusobanuraire uko bigenze . ariko bye kucika , kuko tugomba kuhora tuibuka abacu , tukaibuka n' ibyabaye .
this is a story that i was told by the people who survived from chk hospital . that there were several injuries in chk that were injured like him . ||| baramupfuka , nnjyae nbibwiraw n' abantu bacikaiye ku icumu hariya muri chk . babajyanayo hari inkomerae nyinshi nk' izo ,
that they used to only cover them without applying any medicine . ||| bakapfuka kusa ariko ntibavurae ... ntibashyiraeho umuti .
later there came another notorious killer called kamashini , who took them away . ||| ngo baza na none kutwaraw n' undi ngo witwa kamashini ,
he was the one responsible for all killings that took place at chk hospital . ||| niwe ukoraaga muri chk . ubwo niwe wicaga abantu bo muri chk ,
so he took them to kigali military camp , where they were chopped with bayonettes and their eyes were scooped out before thier death . that is part of what i heard . ||| ngo abajyana muri camp kigali . muri camp kigali rero niho babiciye , ngo babajombagura ibyuma , babanoboramo amaso .
my husband is among those who died from chk and he was exhumed and reburied in rebero . ||| nabyo nrabimenye . ariko ubwo muri yari ari muri bariya bakoze muri chk babahambye hariya ku irebero . nuko ,
that is what happened . ||| ni uko bigenze .
and about my died child ; my baby died and it was buried in gakingiro . ||| umwana wanjye we yarapfuye ahambye hariya mu gakinjiro ,
it was still young fed on breast milk . ||| yari mutoya kubera ko yari ku ibere ,
therefore , it died of hunger due to stavation . ||| yazize inzara ... kubura ikimutunga we yarapfuye .
that is all . ||| icyo kusa .
what about others in your family ? ||| ntawunri wawewa ... ?
another person of whom i remember , they were not living in kigali . but i remember my niece who lived in cyahafi . they were dumped in a latrine . ||| uwunri wanjye amateka yabo numva , ntabwo ntabwo bari i kigali . ariko hari n' undi mukobwa wa mukuru wanjye nawe uri mu cyahafi , nabo babataye muri wc [ umusarane ] ,
their bodies were exhumed by ibuka and taken to gisozi memorial site for reburial . ||| ibuka niyo yabataburuyemo igihe baongera kutaburura na none abantu gutyo , babajyana ku gisozi .
their remains are in their final resting @-@ place at gisozi together with others . ||| nabo bari ku gisozi ,
it is my niece and her husband and their two children . ||| ni we n' umugabo we , n' umugabo wabo , n' abana babo babiri .
they were dumped in their own latrine . ||| icyo kihae babashyize muri wc [ umusarane ] yabo . yee ,
other people ... ||| abandi rero ...
do n't you remember how they were killed ? ||| ntabwo wibuka mbese uko babaishe ,
were they hacked to death or ... ? ||| niba bari babatemaguye se cyangwa ...
yes of course they are there . ||| yee ,
they were hacked and others were chopped with knives . in fact , the one who was the chief of interahamwe in their home area was arrested . unless he admit his crimes and get released . ||| barabatemaguye babateraguye ibyuma , ndetse n' interahamwe nkuru yabo ... bari baturanye , iracyafunze kaereka niba yaraemeye icyaha akaba azavamo ,
or maybe he is already released ... in cyahafi ... [ she gulped ] i do n't often go there . ||| cyangwa se wenda yanavuyemo . mu cyahafi se ... [ arimyoza ] ntinkunda kujyayo .
do you have some of your family members that you managed to exhume and reburry officially ? ||| haba se ha hari abo mu muryango wawe ushoboye kushyingura ?
no . ||| oya kaereka abongabo kusa .
except my husband who i knew where he was buried and went there . ||| kaereka umugabo wanjye ugiye hariya nkaba nri nbizi ko ariho yari ari , niwe bashyinguye mu rwe ... mu kihae bwa mbere .
i also had a sister who lived in gitarama , in musambira district . it was her husband who organised for her reburial ceremony . ||| n' abongabo bo mu cyahafi . eh , ariko hari na mukuru wanjye ubaga hariya i kitaarama , i musambair umugabo we niwe umushyinguye ... we yaramushyinguye iruhande rw' itongo rye .
others were in butare but they have n't been exhumed becausedf no one knows exactly where they were dumped after being killed . ||| ariko abandi bari i butare , ntabwo babashyinguye kuko ntabwo bazi ... ntibazi aho baguye mbese . ntabwo bazi aho ari ho .
however we know they were killed in nyamure . in nyamure district there was a big number of people who died there . i realised that when i attended a burial ceremony there . ||| bari hariya i nyamure ... bari i nyamure ... mu karerae ka nyamure .
however i can n't tell if my people 's remains were among those we buried that day . ||| haguye abantu benshi cyane nigeze kujya kushyingura yo . ntinkubwira niba bari muri urwo ruhande ,
i can n't even guess if they were in another side . ||| niba bari mu rundi ,
i do n't know . ||| ntabwo nbizi .
you told us that the inkontanyi helped you ... they took you to saint andre but can you tell us how you left that place and your life experience in sait andre ... ? ||| utubwiye uti ... ugeza aho inkotanyi zabagejeje muri saint andre ; ese nyuma y' aho bigenze bite ? kugeza ubungubu ubayeho utae ? mwavuye muri saint andre ...
no , i would be lying if i said yes . ||| oya ntabo . abenshi ... abahari bo mu muryango wanjye , ni abagira ihungabana kusa mbese ryo kutekereza ibya jenoside . no kuba birabaye bareba ,
but still there are some who have been traumatized and one of my nieces who is handicapped by bullets and has an amputated arm ; she was shot and she watched her arm born jumping out of her body through the muscles . ||| cyokora hari n' ufite ubumuga , umukobwa wa mukuru wanjye umwe barashe gutya , baraongera bamurasa n' isasu aha rihushura igufwa , rinyura mu nyama riragenda .
so she was also terribly affected by the genocide ||| ubwo ni ikibazo nawe arakifite cya jenoside . n' ihungabana ubona ararifite ntabwo ... si neza cyane .
do you live with her ? ||| murabana ?
no , she lives in nyamirambo at her father 's place . ||| oya aba i nyamirambo aba kwa se .
her father too survived . ||| ubwo se nawe yararokotse ... se yararokotse .
after the genocide when the inkotanyi liberated the country , there were several government bodies that came up , whicha emphasis much on unity and reconciliation policies . ||| ikindi hano nkubaza , nyine nyuma y' itsembabwoko ... eh , inkotanyi zikifata igihugu hagiyeho inzego inzego za leta ; bashakaaga kugirango abanyarwanda baongerae basubiraane ,
form your personal point of view , do you thing it will work out for the hutus who perticipated in the genocide to reconciliate with the tutsi survivors ? ||| mbese habaeho ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . wowe iyo ureba ubumwe n' ubwiyunge hagati y' abahutu baishe abatutsi , wunva bishoboka ?
by the way , the issue of unity and reconciliation is not easy . ||| ariko rero ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ,
those ideas of unity and reconciliation are more like ... sincerely , reconciling with some one who killed your people , is next to imposible ; where would one gain that spirit in order to reconcile ? ||| nabyo ntibyoroshye . ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge usanga ari ibintu ... nk' umuntu ukorewe biriya bintu kuiyunga n' umuntu wa ukuiciye ,
i wonder what would have happened , for such people to reconcile . i can n't even imagine the beginning of all the act of reconciliation . ||| ntinzi ahantu bituruka mbese kugirango muiyungae . numva ntinzi ... ubwo ntinzi uko biba bimeze . ntinzi intangiriro rwose yabyo uko biza .
a person can reconciliate with one whom they talk . ||| ese ko umuntu yiyunga n' uwo bavugana ;
let 's say ; one can tell the other that , "@ please i am sorry ! ||| ukaiyunga n' umuntu umubwira uti @:
i insulted you . forgive me . @" ||| "@ nbabarira nkututse . @"
but i can n't imagine someone who killed more than twenty people of your family members , standing infront someone asking him or her to reconcile . how possible would that be ? ||| ese umuntu ukuiciye akakuicira abantu makumyabiri , azaza akubwira ngo tuiyungae koko ... gutya bishobokae ?
it is a problem maybe there is a way they are planning to do it , which i can n't imagine . ||| ko ari ikibazo ! simbizi ntinzi ko ... wenda ntinzi uko bizateguraw , ariko simbizi .
so , do you thing that the commission in charge of unty and reconciliation will reach its goals easily ? ||| ubona iriya commission ibaishijew se izagera ku nshingano zayo ... byo byoroshye ?
you are talking about that commission of unity and reconciliation ... ? ||| iriya commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ? iriya commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge rero ,
that commission ... maybe it will succeed , who knows ? ||| wenda ahari izabigeraho simbizi , ariko se njyae nbona atari vuba .
though it will require them a lot of time . it seems too impossible to achieve their goals in a short time . ||| nbona bitazashoboka vuba . ntabwo bizashoboka vuba , kuko n' uwakwiciye afite umujinya .
because , it is astonishing how those who perticipated in the genocide [ interahamwe malicious ] still have strong hatred and whenever they see you , they try to show you that they still hate you . ||| ukanabibona akanabikwereka .
so , how do you expect reconciliation to take place since he or she , who did those things has more grievance than the one he or she hurt ? ||| ubwo se uwo muzaiyunga mutae ? ko akurusha umujinya ariwe ukuhemukaiye .
there are other organisations concerned with the rwandan genocide , which are non @-@ governmental . ||| hari urwego rurebaan na jenoside nyine yabaye mu rwanda ,
plus several other commissions around the contry like that of unity and reconciliation . ||| uretse inzego za leta hariho n' andi ma commission menshi nk' ayo y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ... ariko mu rwego rw' ubucamanza harimo , eh ... imanza bazaca muri iyi minsi ,
and there are also judicially commissions called gacaca . i guess , are in operation . ||| ndetse zanatangiye imanza baita iza gacaca ,
what can you say about them ? ||| zo uba uzivugaho iki ?
do think they are going to help in purnishing those who perticipated in the genocide ? ||| hari icyo zizacyemura mu rwego rwo kuhana kuhana abazize ... abakoze itsembabwoko .
in order for our country to experience development in the future , all rwandans should put their hands together and try to build their nation . ||| igihugu cyacu aho kigana kugirango kigira iterambere , numva nk' abanyarwanda bose bashyira hamwe . bakaubaka igihugu .
but this shall be achieved only if they try to eliminate the habit of not purnishing . ||| ariko bizateraw n' iki ? no kuca umuco wo kutahana . niba utekereza kukora ikintu runaka kitari kiza ,
whoever that has plans of doing bad deeds especialy killings because it was one of the deeds that led into distruction of our nation . ||| cyo ... cyo ... cyane icyo ubwicanyi nicyo kishenye n' iki gihugu ,
should be punished in public where everybody will be seeing in order to frighten those who have the same plans . ||| ahanawe hariya ku mugaragaro . ahanawe biboneka ,
because they will know that , if they do the same thing , they will be treated in the same way . ||| n' undi ubitekereza agirae ubwoba . avugae ati @:
therefore , if they stop that habit [ not punishing ] the country will be built and will become pleasing . ||| "@ nimbikora nrabizira . @" icyo kihae hagati aho ni bicika igihugu kuzaubakaw , kibae kiza . rero kugira ngo igihugu cyacu ki ... kizabae kiza ,
therefore , in order for our contry to be pleasing , the young ones will have to continue in the line of development ; they will have to finish their studies and improve our contry . ||| abakiri batoya bazakomezae mu majyambere , baigae , bagirae icyo baungura igihugu ;
first of all , they have to know that the killers still have the intentions of killing . ||| ni uko mbere na mbere nibabanze baumvaishe ba bantu bafite umutima mubi wo kuica abantu , n' uyu munsi bakiwufite ... kandi barawufite !
therefore , they have to first sencitize them and teach them that , they have to live with others peacefully without killing . ||| babanzae babaumvaishe ko bagomba kubaan n' abandi neza , hatarimo ubwicanyi .
fir example those people in gikongoro whom they sentenced to death . ||| nka bariya bantu bo ku gikongoro nk' uko bavuze ko babakataiye urwo kupfa ,
i hope they will shut them in open . and i believe that , if they do it in public , i guess in gikongoro there will be no more killings . ||| kandi bazabarasa kumugaragaro , ibyo ... buriya nibakora biriya ntabwo ku gikongoro ... nraizera ko bitakaongera . nibaramuka babikoze koko ku mugaragaro bahamagaye abantu bose , ntabwo bikaongera .
because no one can see his fellow being shot on a tree and then he goes a head with his wrong plans that would take him to the same tree . ||| kuko ntawabona bamushyize ku giti hariya , noneho yumvae ko akwaiye kubikora , ngo bamushyirae ku giti .
therefore , eliminating the habit of ont punishing is the best . if they do so , our country will develop . ||| ibyo rero ni ukuca ... ni ukurandura umuco utahana nyine nibyo byiza . ibyo baramutse babikoze igihugu cyacu kitera inberae . kuko n' abahungabana ,
because those are one of the things that distablise genocide survivors . because when we had about what took place in gikongoro , we were all afraid . ||| no mu bihungabanya abantu babonye jenoside ... bahuye nayo bataotaijew , na biriya byo ku gikongoro bijemo . kuko twarahungabanye tuesae tutanahaegereye .
we thought the same thing would happen to us ... ||| tuhise tuumva ko ntawe tuesae ariko tugomba kumera .
another thing i would like to ask you ; this is your personal testimony as a mature person . ||| ikindi nkubaza , urabona ubu ni ubuhamya bwawe , nk' umuntu tuvuga mukuru .
and your own children plus your grandchildren will see this testimony because it will be kept in the appropriate place for the future . ||| bukaba kandi buzarebaw n' abana bawe , ndetse n' abo bazabyara kuko buzabikwa mu ahabigenewe ku buryo buzamara igihe .
therefore , according to your life experience ... the hard times you experienced , definitely there must have been a way you found yourself out of it . ||| tuifuzaaga y' uko ukurikije ibihe unyuzemo ; ukurikije ubuzima bukomeye ugiye unyuramo uri mu itotezaw . hari uko ugiye ubyigobotora ;
maybe sometimes your parents would tell you to do this or that in order to defeat some tough situations . ||| hari n' ubwo ababyeyi bawe bakubwiraaga bati @: "@ ntacyo ... kora gutya kugirango twigobotore mu buzima bubi . @"
in brief , please tell us the advice you would give to the young children . ||| ndagirango utubwirae muri make impanuro uha abana @:
especially your children and those that will generate from them ; they will be your grand children . ||| ari abawe ; n' abaza ... n' abazaba abana babo , nka nyirakuru .
in general what is your advice to the children of this nation ? what should they do in order to become responsible people in the future ? ||| ndetse n' abandi bana b' igihugu . icyo bakora nk' impanuro wowe ubwawe ubaha kugirango babae abantu , bazashoborae no kugira ubuzima bwiza .
the advice i can give to young children ... first of all they should learn how to love . ||| impanuro nha rero abana bakiri batoya , icya mbere ni ukugira urukundo .
the first thing id to love . ||| icya mbere ni ukugira urukundo ;
sencondly they should put much effort in education because there will be no bright future for them if they do n't go to school . ||| ikindi bakihatira kuiga , kuko nta buzima bwiza bazagira batize .
they should study and love each other . ||| bakaiga bakagira urukundo ;
they should avoid hatred among them in all their lifetime on earth . ||| ikintu cyo kungana bakakirandura mw' isi ikibaho .
because where there is love , nothing misses . ||| nihaza urukundo nta n' ikizabura na kimwe .
therefore , the youngones should love each other . i guess even those kids who became interahamwe ; it was due to their elders . ||| abana bato nibakundana ... kandi n' ubundi buriya , kugirango n' abo bana batoya bajyae kuba interahamwe babitewe n' abakuru . nibagair urukundo ,
but if the children experiences love , and be taught about love rather than hate . ||| bakaigishwa urukundo ,
and avoid seeing their fellows and say , "@ look at that tutsi . @" ||| ntibaishwe ibyo kuanga ... ngo @: "@ uriya mututsi . @"
like they used to learn in the past . in the past . ||| nk' uko n' ubundi babibaigishije .
tutsi children used to believe that they were ment to be menaced . ||| n' umwana w' umututsi akakura azi ko ari umututsi utotezaw ,
like during the genocide , some children would tell the killers that , "@ please forgive me , i will never be a tutsi again . @" ||| nko muri jenoside hari nk' u ... nk' abana ... ubwiraaga umuntu ati @: "@ unbabariye ko ntazaongera kuba umututsi . @"
just imagine , those were very young children but they already knew that they were menaced because they were tutsis . ||| ibaze w' uruhinja ! ni uko yari azi ko bamutoteza kubera ko ari umututsi .
therefore , hatred should be up rooted and they should only keep in mind that there are only rwandans . ||| bakarandura rero umuco wo kungana . kusa bakamenya ko umunyarwanda ari umunyarwanda .
and , every human being has a right to live . ||| bakamenya ko umuntu ari umuntu agomba kubaho ,
no one should be killed . ||| atagomba kuicwa .
that is the most important thing for the young ones . ||| ubwo nicyo kintu kizagirair rero abakiri batoya akamaro .
if they love each other , one would be knowing that , "@ i have to study for my own life . @" ||| nibakundana umuntu akamenya ati @: "@ njyewe ngomba kuiigair amashuli , nkikorera nkazageza ahangaha , " undi ati @:
and the other one would say , "@ i want to do this and that . @" ||| "@ ngomba kukora iki . @"
if he or she is good at business , then he or she should run business . ||| nimba ari ubucuruzi ashoboye , ati @:
if one is good at cultivatng , then she or he should mean business and cultivate . but forgeting that habit of having second thoughts about his or her fellows . ||| "@ reka nikurikirire ncuruzae ; " niba ari n' uhinga , amenye ko agomba kuhinga . ariko nyuma atagiye muri wa muco wo kuanga umuntu ngo uriya ni uyu .
that is my advice for children . ||| niyo mpanuro nha abana batoya .
hope that is the advice to the children in general . now can you give any piece of advice to the children who were affected by the genocide ? what advice can you offer them about how to improve on them selves ? ||| ubwo ngirango nink' impanuro y' abana batoya b' abanyarwanda muri rusangae . ariko nifuzaaga ko kubw' umwihariko ku bana bakiriwe itsembabwoko , ko hari icyo uba ... ubabwira mu rwego rwo kuiyubaka .
in the flame of development ... children who experienced genocide were left in misery without parents . ||| mu rwego rwo kuiyubaka , abana bakorewe itsembabwoko basigaye iheruheru , batagira ababyeyi ;
they were left homeless , they should be strong and patience and , mind about their education . ||| batagira umuryango . bakwaiye kuihangana . bakikurikirair kuiga .
i know there is no good life , their heads had frozen . because , when a child has no parents , life seem to be meaningless . ||| yego nta buzima burimo bwiza , kuko mu mutawe wabo hara ... haratobamye . iyo umwana atafite umubyeyi burya nta ... nta kiza aba afite .
therefore they should be strong because there is no alternative . ||| ariko nibihangane kuko nta kunri tubigenza .
if they come across their fellows with the same problems , they should befriend one another and talk about their problems . ||| yihanganae nbona uwo wahuje ikibazo bakundanae baganirae , nbona umubyeyi nkanjyae uhuye n' icyo kibazo ,
if it is a parent , she will tell them that , "@ my children come we chat a bit . @" ||| amwegere amubwirae . niba ... wenda umubyeyi aramubwira ati @: "@ ihanganae mwana wanjye uzae kuza tuganirae . @"
ever , when you meet with people you experienced the same problem ; you fell relieved just because you found someone to tell about your problems , someone who understands it . ||| iteka ryose iyo muhuye mwarahuje icyo kibazo , hari n' aho bikuruhura kubera kubona uwo uwibwira , mubivuganaho unabizi .
that is what i can advise them . children who faced that problem should love and know each other . ||| yee , ni icyo nbabwira rero ... abana be ... ese bahuye n' ibyo bibazo ... icyo nbabwira ni uko bakundana nabo ubwabo ,
if they meet challeges , they should learn how to adress those problems to the older people who were once in the same situation . ||| baaka ... bakamenyaan , ibibazo bakamenya kuegera wa mukecuru cyangwa wa musaza uhuye n' ibyo bibazo .
because grown @-@ ups know how to comfort children . you can tell a child that , "@ be strong there is no alternative . @" ||| akababwira iyo uri umuntu mukuru uhumuriza umwana , ukamubwira uti @: "@ ihanganae nta kunri bimeze . @" yaba ari no hafi yawe ,
and if you are neighbours , then you try to visit each other . ||| ukagerageza no kumusura , nawe akakusura .
that helps the children to know that there are some other people who faced the same problems like they did . ||| akamenya ko hari umuntu usigaye bahuje icyo kibazo .
that is the piece of adice that you have passed to the children . ||| ubundi nk' impanuro uhaga abana , by' umwihariko abacitse ku icumu bahuye n' icyo kibazo .
what about those who perticipated in the genocide ? ||| ariko noneho ... ntacyo ubwira noneho abakoze itsembabwoko ?
what message can you give them ? ||| ni ubuhe butumaw ubaha ?
the perpetrators ? ||| abakoze itsembabwoko ? [ arimyoza ] yewe !
i wonder what to tell them ; i can not tell them that , "@ never do it again . @" because if they had a chance they would repeat it today . ||| abakoze itsembabwoko ... ibyo se ... ubwo ... buriya rero bariya bantu ... kubabwira se ubwo nbabwira ... umva simbabwira ngo @:
most of them do n't even agree that they perticipated in the genocide . ||| "@ ntibazaongerae . @"
they deny it yet you witnessed them doing those deeds . ||| kuko ku giti cyabo bashobora no kaongera uyu munsi . bariya rero , abenshi ntibanemera ko babikoze , kandi arabihakana kandi wowe yarabikoze ureba .
therefore , which kinds of advice can one give such a person ? ||| ubu se nmuha mpanuro ki ?
instead they should repent for their sins in they feel it down inside their hearts ... if their hearts haunts them . ||| ahubwo bihanae nabo niba baumva ku mutaima ... niba baumva ku mutaima ... umutima uba ... ubibabwira ... ubacira urubanza .
they should try to say the truth and ask for forgiveness as they say . they should repent before god because even those they killed were god 's creatures . ||| ageragezae kugirango wenda yigirae hari asabae n' imbabazi da ! niba asabae n' imaan imbabazi . kuko na bariya baishwe ni ibiremwa by' imaan yiremeye .
therefore they should repent before god because if they do so , they will be able to ask me to forgive them . ||| nibasabe imbabazi mbere yo kunsaba imbabazi . kuko nibemera bakaibuka imaan , bakayisaba imbabazi ,
and i will be sure that if we met somewhere , they would never hurt me . ||| nnjyae nibambona ntacyo bazantwara .
i just do n't know the kind of advice i should give to such people . ||| bariya rero kaubaha impanuro [ arimyoza ] numva ntazi ibyo aribyo .
normally when someone ever faced such scandles , always there is an event or something from his or her past , which he or she remembers and wishes to see again in order to gain peace of mind . ||| ubundi iyo umuntu yahuye n' amahano nk' aya , aba afite ikintu yibuka cya kera . we yumva ko kigarutse kimuha amahoro .
for example ; in your marriage life , there were some words that your husband used to say to you and those words made you feel so good . ||| tuvugae hari ubwo ubanaaga n' umugabo wawe amagambo yakundaaga kukubwira akakunyura ;
it maybe your children ... the one who died ... or your neighbours . ||| abana bawe ... n' uwo upfuye ,
personally , what do you remember that gives a lot of sorrows more than other things yet it was as a result of the genocide ? ||| abaturanyi bawe ... muri wowe wunva wibuka iki kikutera agahinda kurusha ibindi ? akaba ari nk' ingaruka y' itsembabwoko .
personally , when i get a lot of problems , let us say ; i have children who go to school , then you see them missing books , pens or a uniform ... for example , primary school children we pay their fees . ||| ku giti cyanjye ... nk' iyo ngize ibibazo cyane nk' ubu umuntu ... abana baiga , nk' ubu abana baiga ukabona habuze ... ukabona habuze ikaye ukabona habuze ikaramu , ukabona umwana arakubwiye uniforme , ukabona abaiga primaire bo turabaiishyurair .
and then you see your child coming back home that the teacher has chased them because you never sent him money . ||| ukabona ati @: "@ mwarimu aranyirukanye ngo nta gahimbazamuswi utuha ... umpaye , " yee ,
i remember ... that is when i remember , when life becomes hard . ||| aho uraibuka ... aho nrabiibuka . nrabiibuka .
some times i get worried , "@ what will they eat tomorrow ? what will take before going to school ? ||| iyo imibereho ... hari igihe nshobora kubona nti ... nta ... noneho ejo ntibazarya , ejo ntibazabaho , ejo bazajya kuiga bariye iki ?
or what will they have for dinner ? @" ||| cyangwa se barararair iki ?
then i say , "@ if they had a father , would n't have been this worried . @" ||| aho nibuka ko iyo baba bafite se ,
well i am not alone , it happens to every parent who faced that problem of genocide . ||| nba ntabiibaza . ibyo kandi nta n' ubwo biri kuri jyae njyenyine n' ukuntu ... umubyeyi wese ... ibyo arabigira . uwahuye n' icyo kibazo wese .
in order to avoid those feelings though you faced those problems . ||| wunva se , kugira ngo ugeragezae kubiikuramo , kugira ngo ugeragezae ku ... n' ubwo uhuye n' ubwo buzima bikakubabaza ,
how do you fight againest those feelings ? what do you do personally ? the reason why i ask you such questions is , there are some people who may learn from you after they have seen your testimony . ||| ugerageza kubiikuramo utae kuri wowe n' iki ukora ? ibingibi impamvu nbikubaza , ni uko harimo na ... n' uwabona ubuhamya bwawe ,
the way you stand in tough situations may be a leason to her of him . ||| ati @: "@ nzaiganae uriya mukecuru , ukuntu agenda yikura mu makuba . bikaba nk' urugero kuri we . @"
this is what you do to avoid such feelings ; you think about the orphans around you ... in that house , there are about four or five orphans who are living togeher . ||| dore rero iyo ujya kubiikuramo , uratekereza uti @: "@ hariya hari imfubyi ... muri iriya nzu habamo impfubyi zibana enye cyangwa eshanu .
it means that , the oldest of all acts as a parent to the rest and she or he is taken to be in charge of the whole home . ||| ni ukuvuga ngo harimo umukuru umwe ubaye umubyeyi wabo ;
then you reflect their example to your life and say , "@ how come those orphans survive ? @" ||| witwa nyir' urugo . ukiha urugero uti @: "@ se bariya bana ntibari aho . @"
and again , you think about your fellow survivors and ask yourself , "@ how are they surviving ? @" ||| ukaongera ukareba na none n' undi mugenzi wawe . ukavuga uti @: "@ ese buriya ,
by considering other people 's lives , it will help you . we live together in the same residence for the survivors , but it is useful for us because we are neighbbouring each other yet we have the same problems . ||| nibabarirae se njyenyine ? @" ni naho kibera kiza ... ninaho bibera byiza . kubona tubana mu midugudu burya ... iyo uri kumwe mu midugudu n' umuntu muhuje ikibazo hari ibikaubaka burya .
therefore , you refer to your fellows and ask yourself , "@ how come they are still strong ? ||| birakaubaka kuko uhita wibaza ko icyo kibazo atari wowe kireba wenyine . ukavuga uti @: "@ ese ko abandi bihangana ,
let me try and be strong too . @" ||| reka nnjyae nihanganae . @"
that is all that can help someone . ||| ni icyo kibikukuramo nta kinri .
but , if you are lonely you may spend your entire life in problems . ||| ariko uri wenyine uhae ... ahubwo uhera hasi uhora uri mu bibazoo ... iyo bikugonze uragenda ukaiegerair n' abandi mukaseka .
otherwise , when you are challeged by problems , you join others and laugh , share a drink and dedicate the rest to god . ||| kandi wenda hakaba n' igihe musanga murabihuje , naho ubundi mukisekair mukisengera mukabiha imaan . yee ,
that is what helps us most of the time . ||| nicyo kitufasha rero kenshi .
do n't you have something to add on the testimony you have given us ? ||| nta kinri wunva ukaongera ku ... ku buhamya utuhaye ?
what message can you leave for the people who will see this testimony in the future ... ? ||| nk' ubutumwa utanga ku bantu bazareba ubu buhamya .
it may be a message of comfort to any one of your wish ... it may be a testimony ? ||| cyangwa se ku ... ubutumwa bwo kuihanganaish se , cyangwa se ... uwo ariwe wese ushaka kuha ubutumwa , cyangwa ubuhamya .
the message i can give to all those who faced the genocide is to be strong . ||| ubuhamya nvuga , n' uko tugomba kuihangana tuesae abahuye na jenoside . kuko turanihanganye ibyo ari byo byose ,
though all the time we have been strong . ||| turanihanganye .
ten years is a big thing ! ||| imyaka icumi ni myinshi . turi aho ,
yet no one has ever run mad or looking funy . ||| turimo tugenda n' amaguru . ukabona umuntu ntasaze , ukabona ntasebyae , ukabona uri aho imyaka irashize ,
therefore , we have to keep it up and remain strong . ||| ni ukukomeza tukihangana .
because as years go by and as far as our children are growing and going to school , our problems will go on reducing . ||| ni ukukomeza tukihangana kuko uko imyaka ishira , uko abana bacu bakura uko baiga , niko imyaka iri inberae tu ... ibibazo bizagenda bigabanuka .
ten years have passed and in few days to come there will be an occasion of commemorating for the ten years that have passed after the genocide , which took place in rwanda . ||| ubu ... hari icyo imyaka icumi ishize , ejo bunri hazabaho kuibuka ku nshuro ya cumi jenoside ibaye mu rwanda .
all other nations admmitted that there was genocide in rwanda . ||| bibaye amahanga yose yaraemeye ko jenoside yabaye mu rwanda .
does it have any meaning to you , hearing that other countries agree that there was genocide in rwanda ? ||| wowe hari icyo bikubwiye kaumva ko amahanga yumvise ko jenoside yabaye mu rwanda .
i was very happy . ||| biranshimaishije cyane .
because some of the things that used to hurt us ... for example there are some foreigners who used to come here in avega . ||| kuberako hari ikintu kitubabazaaga . hari nk' a ... nk' abantu b' abanyamahanga bazaaga ,
and they would ask permission to meet us because they realy wanted to see those people who were victimised by the genocide . ||| akenshi babazaanaga hariya tutuye ... abantu bakaza nko muri avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba jenoside ] kusaba ... kusaba ko bagera hariya iwacu . kureba ngo abo bantu bahuye na jenoside , hari na ... na bariya b' abayahudi baraje , baje iwacu .
the jews also came to see us ; among those who came , there was a lady ... i do n't remember other people who came with her but some time ago , they also experienced genocide like we did . ||| harimo n' umudage , yee . ntinibuka n' abandi baje . barahaje nabo bahuye n' ikibazo kisa nk' icyacu .
one of them told us that , "@ my grandparents are victims of the holocaust . ||| ariko hari uwaje aratubwira ati @: "@ njyae ndi umwuzukuru w' abantu bakorewe jenoside . ati @:
according to what we saw and heard , we thought that in rwanda we would find when people had gone crazy . we thouhght that , it would be very hard to get close to you . ||| nri nzi ko mu rwanda tubibonye n' uko tubiumvise , ati turi tuzi ko tusanga tu ... mwasaze ... muri abasazi , nta n' umuntu unabageramo .
but surprisingly you look good ! ||| ati @: none rwose ... ati @: nrabona murasa neza ,
you are still able to wear a smile ! @" ||| muraseka . ati @: muraseka ! @"
and for sure , she was astonished . ||| ukabona aratangaye .
however , there was another person who came and told us that , "@ we do n't agree that what happened here was genocide . ||| hari n' undi rero utubwiye ati @:
according to what we heard that happened here , we do n't believe it was genocide . @" therefore , that denial of the genocide would terribly hurt us because we would n't imagine why they would denay genocide yet it happened ! ||| "@ ntabwo twebwe tuemeraaga jenoside ... ko ibyo uko tuumvaaga ibyabaye mu rwanda ntitubiemeraaga . @" kutabiemera rero kwabo bikatubabaza .
so what amases us is the fact that all nations agreed and realised that genocide happened in rwanda . ||| ntituumva igituma batabiemera kandi birabaye .
it is so amasing . ||| none rero ikintu kidu ... kishimaishije rwose ikintu kinshimaishije ni uko amahanga yose yarangije kuemera ko ... no kubibona ,
and among the things that keep me strong , is commomerating the genocide all the time . ||| ko bibaye koko . ibyo bintu birashimaishije cyane . kuhora iteka tubiibuka . nabyo mu binyubaka biranyubaka .
have you finished ? ||| urarangije ?
so they started beating him yet he was already lame as a result of previous beatings . ||| ubwo nyine baherako baramukubita , nawe yari ikimuga bari baramukubise muri icyo kihae .
people used to tell us about those days but for us it was just history , we never thought of something like the genocide we saw would ever happen . ||| ariko icyo kihae a ... batubwiraaga ibyo tuumvaaga ari nka histoire [ amateka ] , ntabwo utekerezaaga ko habaho jenoside nk' iyo tubonye .
probably in the same way our children will be taking it as history . ||| tukaumva ari ibintu bya histoire [ amateka ] mbese nk' uko wenda nk' abana tuzabyara wenda bazaza baumva ko ari histoire [ amateka ] .
later life went on as it used to be . ||| nyuma yaho ubwo nyine ubuzima buragiye bukomeza .
we grew up until the 1990s ... in 1992 in bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the hutu were burning the tutsi 's properties . ||| bukomeza uko bisanzwe turakura , bigeze muri za mirongo yenda [ 1990 ] na ... mirongo cyenda na kabiri [ 1992 ] , nanohe i bugesair hatangira kuza umwuka mubi . tukajya tuumva bavuga ngo abahutu bari kutwikira abatutsi ,
by then we resided in ntarama , which was out of [ ntarama ] town . ||| twe kuko turi tutuye ahantu i ntiarama ... ahantu hafi y' i ntiarama atari mu mujyi neza .
so it started from the side of ngenda and gashora because many hutus resided in those areas . ||| noneho biheraaga za ngenda za gashora kuko niho hari hari abahutu benshi ,
the area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration . ||| urebye twebwe ahantu turi tutuye ni nko ku rusisiro ; ugereranyaije ni nk' umudugudu mbega .
it was a place where they used to take all the tutsis who had migrated . they used to construct houses close to each other ; the tutsi , neighbouring each other in that area , inhabited almost all houses . ||| n' ahantu bazanaaga abatutsi baaka ... babaga baravuye mukacae kamwe bakaza bakaubaka ahantu hamwe gutyo . ku buryo nta rugo urengaaga atari urw' umututsi .
the killings had not yet started in our neighbourhood . ||| ubwo rero hagati aho ntabwo bagombaaga ... biri bitarakomera cyane ku buryo bahamenair ,
instead , they started from the side of mayange and musenyi . areas that had many hutus ‘ abamere ’ residing there . some of the hutus living there were locals and some had there . ||| bakahera izo za mayange za musenyi , kuko niho hari abahutu benshi , b' abimukira n' abamerae gutyo . nuko ,
we were lucky they would just stop in nyamata and did not reach our village . ||| cyokoze iby' amahirwe wenda ... bikagarukair i nyamata ntibigerae iwacu . ariko tukabiumva ,
but we were well informed on what was going on and the people in the attacked areas would flee from their homes to our home village . ||| abaho bakahunga , bakahungira aho hakurya iwacu . ubwo birarangira , ubuzima burakomeza bisanzwe ariko bitari neza ,
life went though it was so tough , we always used to hear rumours of hutu burning tutsi properties . ||| ukaumva umwuka mubi nyine , wunva bavuga ngo @: "@ abahutu batwikiye abatutsi , abahutu batwikiye abatutsi . @"
in short , we grew up knowing that there is no sympathy between the hutu and tutsi . ||| muri make mu kubiiruka kwacu tukura , ntabwo tuigeze tuumva ko umuhutu hari umwuka mwiza agiraan n' umututsi . tukuze tuumva umuhutu ari umwanzi w' umututsi mbega .
we grew up knowing that hutus are enemies of tutsis . in fact , our parents used to tell us , "@ dear children , hutu are bad people . ||| surtout [ cyane cyane ] ko n' ababyeyi bacu batubwiraaga bati @: "@ bana bacu , abahutu ni babi , kuba turiho dutya tufite imibereho nk' iyi .
look at the kind of life we are living and yet we used to be rich . ||| ubu turi tukize ,
we used to own cattle and so many other things but now we are poor , we do not own anything . this is not the life we were meant to live . ||| tufite inka n' iki ... none ubu turaakae ... ntabwo tukize cyane ariko ... n' iki ... ariko uko tukabayeho ntabwo ariko turi kuba tumeze .
we are like this just because of the hutu . @" ||| bati imibereho mubona tufite tuyiteraw n' abahutu . @" ubwo nyine ntawe tukura tuumva tumeze gutyo , ariko tukaumva ko bishize bitagaruka .
we did n't have any hope of living with the hutu in community ; i do n't know why maybe it was due to what every government that was in power subjected us to . ||| ubundi bwo rero iyo niyo mibereho mu bwana bwacu n' ababyeyi bacu . ariko ... mbese kusa tubiirutse tuumva ko n' ubundi nta kaizerae tufite cyo kuzabanaho n' aba ... n' abahutu . no kubera ko na leta uko yajyaagaho ari ko yagendaaga ibatoteza ... itutoteza ,
we could hardly believe it would one day come to an end . ||| tukibaza amaherezo .
we always used to wonder how it would all and end and the final answer came in 1994 . ||| hanyuma noneho finale iza kuba muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] .
we were at home on the 7th of april 1994 . at night we heard that the president 's helicopter had crashed . ||| ubwo turi turi mu rugo ku italiki zirindwi [ 7041994 ] , ijoro ryaho tugiye kaumva tuumva ngi indege ya habyarimana yahanutse .
my brother came in screaming , "@ we are all dead . i heard that habyarimana is dead . @" ||| musaza wanjye araza aratubwira ngo noneho karabaye turashize ati ngo habyarimana yapfuye .
i was still very young ; i was n't mature enough to understand issues concerning the war . ||| twebwe ... kubera ko njyewe nri nkiri n' umwana cya ... ntinri umwana cyane , ariko ntinri na mukuru ku buryo nri kusobanukirwa n' iby' intambara . nravuga nti @: apu ,
i carelessly said , " oh , if he is dead then we are finally going to get some peace . @" ||| nti @: ahubwo ubwo yapfuye nti @: tugiye kuruhuka .
he replied to me , "@ those are your wishes . ||| ati @: "@ yewe ati @: wowe urivugair ibyawe , ati @:
all i can assure you is we are going to die . @" ||| vuga ngo tugiye kupfa ! @"
we kind of joked about it . the following day came but we did n't have any problems until the night fell . ||| nuko ubwo tusa nk' aho tubigira urwenya . ubwo burakeye ariko uwo munsi bawije nta kibazo twebwe tugize ,
the next day we started hearing terrible rumours of houses being burnt here and there . ||| ku bukurikiye bawho nibwo tugiye kaumva hirya no hino bavuga ngo imyuka mibi , ngo abantu barimo kubatwikira .
i think it was four days after the death of habyarimana that the tutsis living in nyamata started fleeing ; you would hear people saying , "@ listen ! ||| hashize nk' iminsi nk' ine ... hashize nk' iminsi ine prezida habyarimana apfuye . nibwo abatutsi b' i nyamata batangiye kugenda baza ... bava iyo bagenda mbese bashakisha bahunga . ukajya kaumva ukaumva umuntu umwe aravuze ati @:
things are getting worse here ! we have met people fleeing their homes . @" ||| "@ mucecekae ibintu bikomeye ngo hano hirya tuhuye n' abantu bahunga . @" uti se bimeze kutae ? ati @:
i wondered why but i heard some people saying that because of the plane crash and habyarimana 's death , there is no way there could be peace in the country . ||| "@ nyine kubera iriya nregae ya habyarimana ya ... habyarimana yapfuye , ati @: nyine ubu nta mahoro nta ki ... nuko ...
people were confused ; they were moving up and down . ||| ubwo rero ,
they would accuse each other to be cowards . ||| ukasanga abaturage ni urujya ... bamwe bakavuga bati @: "@ reka da , bati @: ubwo ni ubwoba bwanyu . @"
some would go to nyamata while others were coming to ntarama . ||| ubwo bamwe bakabahitaho bakajya i nyamata , abandi bakaongera bakabahitaho bakagaruka nyine aho ngaho i ntiarama ,
and things went on like that for a while . ||| gutyo gutyo .
in nyamata , things were getting worse as days went by . the nyamata church witnessed horrible shootings and killings . ||| abageze i nyamata rero ubwo barabatwi ... hashira i ... uko bukeye nyine akaba ariko ibintu bigenda bikomera bikomera . nibwo mu kiriziya i nyamata bahatwika ... baraharasa ,
the survivors ran back to where they had come from . ||| abashoboye kurokoka ,
all the people [ tutsi ] in nyamata and other areashad been killed . ||| baraongera barakimiraan bagaruka iyo bagiye ... iyo bavuye . ubwo rero nibwo iwacu naho ... ubwo mbega ubwo uraumva ko bamaze kuica i nyamata hose barangije ,
therefore , they started attacking the remaining areas . ||| bagendaaga baza basatira nyine n' ahasigaye .
so , they reached home ; i mean my parents ' home . ||| ubwo baba bageze iwacu ... iwacu mu rugo iwacu mbega aho nvukaaga kwa papa na mama .
by then several people had reached at home because ; we lived well somewhere like ... as one could be living over there ... it is a place called kayenzi ; when you are crossing towards nyamata . ||| hari hamaze ... niho hari ... hari hamaze kuhungira abantu benshi kubera ko ... mbese uko turi tutuye , ni nk' aha no haku ... ni nk' uko tuba tutuye hano ... hano hakurya mbega ari ahantu hitwa i kayenzi , wambuka ujya i nyamata .
by then they had n't attacked us ; they could just pass by crossing over to nyamata . ||| ubwo twebwe bari bataraza mbega bahitaaga banbukiraan n' i nyamata , bakajyanirana gutyo .
so they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there . ||| noneho rero baravuga bati @: "@ hariya hakurya turabona hakiri hazima reka tupfae kuhahungira . @"
they decided to try there . ||| uraumva aho hakurya hari hatuye ba mama wacu ,
my uncles and aunts with other neighbours were living across the valley so they came and scattered themselves in the neighbouring houses . ||| ba oncle , n' iki ... n' abandi baturagae mbese b' abaturanyi . baraza mbese bikabagabanya muri izo ngo zo hafi yo mu ... y' iwacu mu rugo , n' ahandi hake turi tuturanye .
they would spend one or two days then things would worsen again . ||| nuko , bakahamara nk' amajoro abiri , bukacya bikaongera bikakomera ,
one day , i do n't remember which day but it had been two weeks since we were in that situation and the interahamwe [ perpetrators ] had finished all people in nyamata . ||| noneho ku munsi wa kangahe ... hashize nk' ibyumweru bibiri ahari ari uko bimeze . ubwo interahamwe ziba zamaze abantu b' i nyamata bose zamaze kubica ,
they had killed people in kayumba forest and killed everyone who was in church . ||| zaishe muri rya shyamba ry' i kayumba zaishe mu kiriziya ,
they had killed everywhere else and the next place was my home village . ||| bose mbese barabona ko bamaze kubagerereza , babona ko hasigaye abo baturagae mbese bari muri iyo ntuza ... muri ako kacae k' iwacu .
i remember some people saying , "@ the attackers have come through the coffee plantation @"@ , which was slightly below our home . ||| ubwo nrabiibuka nibwo bavugaaga ngo igitero kiturutse mu ikawa ... ikawa zari hepfo yo mu rugo mbese . noneho njyae nkavuga nti @:
so i was wondering , i could n't imagine things such as killings , i though they were impossible . ||| ariko se ... kubera ko numvaaga ibintu by' intambara mbese ... ibintu nk' ibyo bitashoboka .
people were screaming , "@ they have come . @" ||| ubwo abaturage bakahita bavuga ngo ngizo ziraje .
and then they took off to the ntarama church through the forest . ||| ubwo bakairukanka bakazamuka bakajya i ntiarama ku kiriziya .
those who were still able to defend themselves with bows and spears fought them . ||| bagera mu ishyamba ba ... mbese ubwo abaturage baho ... abaakae ... abari bakihari bari bakibasha ku ... kuirwanaho bafite imiheto ; amacumu ;
at times they were able to defeat the interahamwe and they would get a rest and go back home . ||| bakagerageza kuzairukankaan bakabasha kuzihashya , bakabona akahaengae . ubwo bakahita baguruka bakisuganya mu rugo .
the interahamwe realized that they were not going to defeat the resistors with no guns . ||| gutyo , bigeze aho ngaho baravuga bati ... ziravuga ziti @: "@ bariya bantu ntabwo tushobora kubashobora tutagiye kushaka imbunda .
they said there were certainly ‘ inyenzi ’ among them [ the resistors ] . ||| bati @: harimo n' inyenzi ntibishoboka . @" nuko ... ubwo noneho kukunri abaturage birwanaagaho bairukanka ,
while fleeing , the resistors used to try and fight back the interahamwe but they started loosing courage as they were seeing about ten , twenty of them being killed , they started scattering . ||| ubona batangiye kucika intege , kubera ukuntu bagendaaga bakabicamo icumi , bakabicamo makumyabiri , noneho batangira kucika intege batangira kukwira imishwaro ,
the strong guys fled towards gitarama and kabwayi , there remained very few and helpless people . ||| ab' imbaraga batangira kuhungira za kitaarama , za kabgayi . haba hasigaye ingeraire batafite n' imbaraga .
my brother was among those who managed to run . ||| nuko , ubwongubwo hari musaza wanjye mutoya wankuriki ... hari musaza wanjye tukurikiraanaga , nawe yabashaaga kuirukanka muri abongabo ,
he came home and told us [ that is when we were still alive ] , "@ now things are really bad . ||| aza mu rugo mbese turi tukihari tutarabasha kuhunga . n' iwacu mbega bakihari . aratubwira ati @: "@ noneho ati @:
we are defeated . ||| bikomeye . ati @: ubu nyine turagiye ,
we can not defend ourselves anymore and they have killed most of us . @" ||| ati @: bibinri byo kuirwanaho bitunaniye ,
he told us , "@ they have killed so and so and so and so , who were the strongest men amongst us . @" he went on and said , " everyone should now find his own way . @" ||| ati @: kanaka ... kanaka bamwishe niwe uturwanaagaho n' iki ... ati @: ubu nyine ntawe ni ukwirwariza ati @:
he said so while preparing to live . ||| ubwo tu ... @" tuti @:
then , i asked him , "@ where are you going now ? @" ||| ese mugiye hehe ? ati @:
he replied , "@ we are going to look for a safer place where to take refuge . @" ||| "@ tugiye kureba iyo tuba nyine ... tuhungira , turebae aho ubuzima buruta ubundi . @" tuti @:
i again asked , "@ will you not be killed there ? @" ||| ese aho mugiye ho ntabwo muhagwa ? ati @: "@ reka sha ,
he said he did n't know . ||| ati @:
he went on and said " bye for now . if i happen to die ... and if i survive we shall meet again . @" ||| mbega ati @: ni uko bimeze , murabeho niba nkize tuzabonaan niba npfuye kandi ni ibyo .
that was the last words we heard from him . ||| nuko . iryo niryo jambo rye nyuma rye tuheruka .
so he walked away and left us . ||| ubwo aba aragiye ,
things had started getting worse on our side . ||| ubwo noneho ibintu biba birakomeye ,
we used to be comforted by the fact that they would fight them back but they had now left us all . ||| tufashwaaga nuko nyine tubonaaga bagenda bakabasha kubasubizayo bakaongera bakagaruka , tukaumva tufite akahaengae . ubwo nyine aho biri bigeze ahongaho mu matariki cumi n' angahe ... umuntu wese yari asigaye yirwariza , yirwanaho .
at around the 10th or so everyone was minding his or her own life the day when all people went out of their homes , a group of attackers came from the coffee plantation that was in the valley below our home and everybody was gone . ||| nuko . ku munsi unyuma rero kugira abantu bavae mu ngo bose bose noneho , igitero kiraje kituruka munsi y' ikawa iwacu ,
i was the only one left there . ||| abandi bose nyine bari banagiye ari njyewe nsigaye nravuga nti @: reka sha , nti njyewe ntabwo mpunga nti @:
thinking i could not die , i decided to stay there . ||| nraguma ahangaha . nuko . ubwo mama ahita avuga , ati @:
and then my mum called me and told me that we were not going to die there alone that we should leave . ||| "@ reka da , ati mu ... ati @: ngwino tugende ati @: twe ... nti tugiye kugwa aha twenyine . @"
however , some elderly men and women who were not capable of fleeing decided to stay and be killed there . ||| ariko hakaba hari abandi bakecuru bari bari mu rugo n' abasaza n' iki ... batari bafite imbaraga zo kuhunga . bahita bavuga bati @: "@ twebwe ntaho tujya batuicirae ahangaha . @"
we left running and reached a small forest that was slightly below our home . then we heard the perpetrators in our cattle we had left home . ||| ubwo tuba turazamutse turairukanse . tukairukanka tugeze ruguru , hari agashyamba kari haruguru yo mu rugo tuhita tuumva za nterahamwe ziraye mu nka zari mu rugo ,
they hacked them and the people we left home . ||| zirazitemye ,
i heard them hacking them [ the elderly people they had left home ] . ||| n' abantu bari mu rugo bose bababatemagura tuumva ... numva .
we hid in a bush near home because they were already coming near us . ||| tuihishe hafi y' agahuru kubera ko tubonaaga n' ubundi badusatiriye .
first they hacked the men and meanwhile , we run to the sector 's offices at the ntarama church . ||| ubwo bahugira mu kutema abongabo tuba turirukatse , tugiye kuri secteur ... ku kiriziya cy' i ntiarama .
but even as we were running , we heard some of them behind us saying , "@ they passed here . ||| ariko ku buryo tuumvaaga baturi inyuma n' ubu ... bamwe bari baturi inyuma bavuga ngo @: "@ ngaba sha ngo @: baciye ahangaha sha , ngo @:
there they are . @" ||| baciye ahangaha . @" nuko ,
and others entered the bush to search for us but luckily they found properties such as suitcases , bags and many others that people had hidden there . ||| ubwo bamwe birara mu bihuru bajya kushaka , bahita bagwa ku bintu abantu bari aho ... abaturage bari bari aho bahishe @: amavarisi , ibikapu ,
we heard them telling each other , "@ hey ! ||| bari bahishe mu bihuru kugirango bajyae babihungaan . noneho ukaumva interahamwe imwe ibwiye indi , ngo @: "@ we ,
i discovered some treasures here . @" ||| ngo nvumbuye iramba we , ngo nvumbuye iramba ahangaha . @" nuko ,
so as they were concentrating on what they found we found a way to the sector in ntarama at the church and that 's how we managed to survive that day . ||| bahugira kuri iyo myenda nyine tuba turahunze uwo munsi tuba tuwukize gutyo . turazamuka tujya kuri secteur i ntuza ... i ntiarama ku kiliziya .
in fact , that was the day the war in nyamata toughened because all the survivors fled to the schools . ||| mbese iyo tariki nibwo abantu be ... mbega urebye nibwo intambara yakazae i nyamata , kuko abantu bose bari babashije kurokoka ,
that is the day they killed my mum and dad and all the people who had hid home . ||| uwo munsi nibwo bagiye ku mashuri . nuko , ubwo icyo kihae bica mama na papa , n' abandi bose ... mbese abantu bose bari bahungiye mu rugo .
they killed around 20 people . ||| bahaiciye nk' abantu nka makumyabiri .
we preceded to the sector . when we reached at the sector ... at the school ... sorry , at ntarama church . ||| ubwo twebwe tuba turagiye tujya kuri secteur , tugeze kuru secteur , ku mashuri ... oya ku kiliziya cy' i ntiarama .
while we were at the school after 3 days , came a certain group of attackers called ‘ simusiga ’ [ meaning i can not leave him [ the tutsi ] behind ] . ||| nuko , tugeze ku mashuri , hashize nk' iminsi itatu , haza igitero kiitwa ‘ simusiga ’ .
it was on the 15th of april 1994 . the group of attackers came in many buses . ||| cyo ku itariki cumi n' eshanu ahari z' ukwa kane [ 15 @04 @1994 ] . ubwo kije kirimo amabisi ishyano ryose .
sometimes they used to come and when they were pushed back , they would go back saying that the inyenzi were in the swamp and that they had guns . ||| ubundi barazaaga noneho ... babona babashubijeyo bakajya kutabaza , bakavuga ngo @: "@ hariya mu rufunzo ngo @: harimo inyenzi zifite imbunda . @"
actually two of habyarimana 's soldiers [ the presidential guard ] had come to kill us and two of the resistors took their guns and used them to defend themselves . ||| kumbi ni abantu hari umugabo umwe ... nk' abagabo babiri bari baraishe abajepe [ abasirikare barindaaga prezida ] bazaaga kubarasa , bahita babambura imbunda . noneho za mbunda bakazikoresha bitabara .
whenever the interahamwe came towards the swamp they would hear the guns and then they would say there are inyenzi in the swamps . ||| interahamwe zaza mu rufunzo bakazirasa ... bakaumva intuza ... imbunda . zikahita zigenda zairukanka , noneho zikavuga ngo @: "@ hariya mu rufunzo ngo harimo inyenzi . @"
so they went and called for the buses . ||| bamaze kuvuga ko harimo inyenzi rero nibwo bagendaaga bahuruza ya mabisi .
you remember the attack of nyanza ? ||| uraibuka igitero cy' inyanza ;
the buses , which came are the one that came to kill in bugesera . ||| umunsi bica inyanza . amabisi yahaje niyo yari aje kuica i bugesair .
that was the day i was hacked . ||| uwo munsi nibwo nnjyae bantemye .
when those buses reached nyanza , they found that they [ the other interahamwe ] were killing people . ||| ubwo baraza , amabisi araza ageze i nyanza , ahita asanga bari kuica abantu nyine baravuga ... arahagarara barabanza barabica barabica , barangije barababwira ngo ,
therefore they said , " keep on finishing the ones ; we are going to reinforce the bugesera people . ||| ngo @: "@ musigarae muhorahoza abongabo , ngo @: ntawe tugiye kutera renfort [ kufasha ] abanyabugesera [ abagiye i bugesair ] .
the buses came straight to the school building where we were hiding , they really killed many people only few were left . ||| ubwo sasa amabisi yahise aza direct [ ako kanya ] ku mashuri ahantu turi turi , akora akazi koko . arica ye ! hasigara ngeraire .
but for us who were near the swamp , that is where they found us . ||| ubwo twebwe turi twi ... ariko ntabwo yatusanze ku mashuri icyo kihae , izo nterahamwe ntabwo zatusanze ku mashuri . zatusanze nyine hafi yo ku rufunzo ,
some old people committed suicide saying that they survived the machetes of 1959 and that the machetes of 1994 could not kill them . ||| abaturage bamwe ... ubwo abasaza bamwe batashoboraaga kugira ... baraiahuye bavuga bati @: "@ twebwe tukize imihoro yo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , ntabwo tugiye kuicwa n' iyo muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] ,
they dived into the water and were taken away . ||| bakahita binaga mu ruzi bakagenda .
people who committed suicide were more than those who were hacked . ||| haiahuye nk' abantu barenga abo ... abenshi kuruta abo batemye .
others said , "@ let us die like men . ||| noneho ubwo abandi bati @: "@ reka da , bati @: reka tupfae kigabo ,
committing suicide is a sin @"@ . ||| nta kuiahura , kuiahura ni icyaha .
one would say , "@ lets me go and hide . @" ||| ukavuga uti @: "@ reka njyae kuihisha . @"
that day i went and hid in the bush that was near the swamp . ||| uwo munsi nibwo nihishe mu gihu ... ahantu mu gihuru kiri hafi y' urufunzo ,
i ran into the bush and immediately the interahamwe ran after me . ||| mpita ngenda nirukankair mo ,
that day it had not rained . ||| interahamwe zihita ziza ku manywa ... icyo kihae ariko bwo nta n' imvura yari yaguye ,
at around mid @-@ day , when the sun was shining bright , the interahamwe came and killed many people . ||| biri nka saa sita ... gutyo saa sita zauzuye . hari izuba ryinshi cyane ariko ... ubona ry' akayagirizo mbega . nuko , icyo kihae ubwo interahamwe ziraza ... zihita ziza ,
even my cousin who was slightly older than me . ||| zaishe abantu ... nibwo zaishe abantu benshi cyane , n' umwana wa mukuru wanjye ariko ntabwo turi tuihishaanye ,
but we were not hiding together ; i do n't know where she was hiding just near by , we also lost her . ||| ntinzi ahantu yari yihishe hafi ahongaho , nawe turamubura .
i found out that they hacked me ; i did not know when i was hacked . ||| ngiye kubona ... nka saa nkahae , numva bantemye ntinzi n' igihe bantemeye . nuko ,
but i guess i was hacked at around 4 o'clock or ehh ... at around mid @-@ day . ||| numva bantemye nka saa kumii ... zatashye , ariko nzi ubwenge nyine ntaramenya ubwenge , ariko mu ma saa kumi cyangwa ... yee mu ma saa sita nibwo bantemye .
that is when they hacked me . ||| nuko ,
then i touched myself and saw blood . ||| ngiye gushiduka nikoraho numva nfite amaraso . umh !
in my heart , i was wondering if it was possible that they had cut me and i was still alive . ||| nkajya nivugaish mu mutaima . nti ariko se birashoboka ko bantema nkaba nkiri muzima ? kubera ko tugenda ,
i always used to imagine how they would one day bring a machete and hack me . ||| ncaaga ku bantu batemye nkahita ntekereza ukuntu umuhoro uza ... ukuntu umuntu aza bakamutema , yarangiza akagira ... mbese nkahita nimajina [ ntekereza ] ukuntu umuhoro uza uka nyikubitaho ,
i did not know how i would react . ||| niba nba meze kutae simbizi .
they hacked me on the exact day i had thought about it . ||| kandi ... ariko uwo munsi nbitekerezaaga nibwo bahise bantema .
i was n't sure i should hide in a sorghum plantation . ||| nkairukanka njya kusesair mu masaka , nkaumva biranze . nkaongera nkairukanka . nnjya kusesair mu gi ... nti @:
i just kept on running . ||| oya , nti @: baranbona . nkaongera nkairukanka .
at some point , i penetrated another bush where the perpetrators found me and started to hack me . ||| nuko uko nkaje kusesair mu gihuru rero , nibwo interahamwe zahise ziza nyine zirantemagura .
i finally left that bush at around 6.00 o'clock in the evening when the perpetrators were gone and the villagers going home . ||| mu kuvamo re ... bigejeje ... uko nvuyemo rero @: byagajeje nyine nka saa kumi n' ebyirii ... interahamwe zagiye abaturage bari kugira ... kutaha ,
maybe it was when fresh air [ the wind ] blew on me that i gained back my consciousness and heard people moving around . ||| nnjyae wenda aka ... ubwo akayaga niba karankubise nkakarura ubwenge simbizi . numva abandi barimo kugendagenda ,
unknowingly , i started calling . ||| noneho nda ... ntaye ubwenge n' iki ... mpita nvuza induru ntahamagara . mpamagaye niba baragize ngo n' interahamwe turi kumwe ,
but maybe those people thought that i was with perpetrators . instead of coming close to see , they ran away . ||| noneho n' abandi nabo aho kugira ngo baze barebae , bakiruka . ntinzi umuntu umwe uhaciye aravuga ,
and a certain person came and said , "@ oh no , mudahogora has been hacked look at how she is hurt ! @" ||| ngo @: "@ yewe we ! ngo mudahogora bamutemye disi , ngo reba ukuntu yabaye .
at that time people were running for his or her own life . ||| noneho aho kugira ngo undi ... icyo kihae abaturage nabo babaga basigaye , babaga bameze nk' abahahamutse nyine buri wese yi ... aramair amagara ye .
when people would see you in such condition ... you can imagine what i was looking like , considering the way you see me now with these scars . ||| baravuga bati @: se ... bakubona nyine , ubaye utyo urabona ko bari bantemaguye ahangaha hose [ mu musaya ] n' iki ... mbese nawe urabiibaza ukuntu biba bimeze . nta muntu babonaaga ahari nk' uwapfuye .
i looked like a dead body with blood all over in the face . ||| n' amaraso ahantu hose ... mu maso hose nuzuye amaraso n' iki ... bati ... bati @:
others would say , " she is taking her last breath she has no life in her . @" ||| "@ buriya ahubwo arimo arasamba , nta buzima . @"
i was with my sister 's child who was 3 years old and we had hid together in the bush . ||| nuko , hari akana ka mukuru wanjye turi turi kumwe gato , kafite nk' imyaka ... kari kafite nk' imyaka itatu , turi tugerageje kuihishaan mu gihuru .
when i opened my eyes , i saw the child seated besides me . ||| nyine ubwo ... nhise nkaanura gutya nbona kanyicaye iruhande .
but he was not hurt at all . ||| ariko ko nta kintu bari bakatwaye ,
actually they did nothing to him although he later on died . i was the only one who had remained with him but i could n't help him to get something to eat . ||| ariko ko kapfuye nyuma kubera ko ninjye uri usigaye njyenyine nkasigaraanye nta kintu nshobora ku kamarair ,
he developed anemia and died ; he was sitting with eyes wide open just besides me . ||| kaza kugira anemie [ kubura amaraso ] karapfa . ka ... ka ... nuko nbona kaicaye gutyo karakanuye ,
i watched him for a while , wondering what would happen to him . ||| noneho kahita ... uwo mugo ... nkavuga nti @:
by chance , a merciful woman who lived in that area came and put him on her back and carried him away . ||| njyewe rwose se ko nshimye nubwo ndiha ... nk' aka kana se ko karaguma ... ntinzi umugira neza w' umudamu ugize uje kukabona ahita arakafata arakaheka arakajyana .
i stayed there alone ; everyone had gone . ||| nuko njyewe nsigara ahongaho . nrangije nraicara nravuga nti ese @: abantu bose bagiye nsigaye ahongaho njyenyine nravuga ,
no one could bother to carry me out of there . ||| nti @: nta muntu uri bwihe peine [ uri bwigore ] yo kunterura ngo ajyanae , reka da ! ariko chance [ amahirwe ] ngize nravuga nti @:
i tried both legs and found that i had some little strength left in them but they were injured . ||| reka numvae ko bantemye amaguru . ngize ukuguru gutya numva ni kuzima ;
i knew when the wounds are still fresh ; it was possible to move around . ||| ngize n' ukundi numva ni kuzima . nravuga nti @: ‘ apu ’ . burya iyo umuntu ... iyo ukifite ibikomere bikishyushye mbega ,
the only risk was that i could suddenly fall due to over bleeding . ||| aho ugera hose uhagera . ahubwo ushobora kuitura hasi nyuma amaraso amaze kukushiramo , ariko ugiye . nkandagi ... ngiye numva birakunze .
so i tried walking and it worked . you can guess that by then , the pain had not started yet so i started running following them . ||| mbese uraumva ko ibisebe biri bikiri bishya imisonga iba itaratangira . nba ntakuruye nrirutse , nnjyae ndabakurikiye .
i was avoiding to be left in the bush alone , so i took off . ||| nravuga nti @: reka da ! nti @: ntibagiye kumporahoreza muri iki gihuru njyenyine .
the people i was meeting were wondering how far i would be able to run . ||| nba nrirutse nragiye abo tuhuye bose bakavuga bati @: "@ ye baba we bati @: uyu muntu ubu aragera hehe ? @"
everybody run , i was left behind . ||| ubwo nragiye bose bagiye , nsigara ... nsigaye inyuma , nravuga nti @: ni hahanri ,
i remembered that when the interahamwe came back and found you still alive , they had to finish you . i survived that day . ||| zintemair ahagaragara ntasigaye ahangaha . kubera ko iyo bakutemaaga ntupfae , bakagaruka bakasanga ukihumeka , basubizaagamo .
i pulled my self up to the school buildings but all my brothers had fled to gitarama . ||| ni razima [ ni ngombaw ] nyine . ubwo nba nragiye ndasodotsee ... nanone nbasa ... ngize imaan nbona ... ku mashuri ntahageze . ariko ubwo basaza banjye bose bo bari bara ... baigendeye barahunze baragiye i kitaarama ,
i was left with my older sister , the second born in our family . ||| nsigaraanye n' uwo mukuru wanjye umwe ,
the rest had been killed ... my third brother as well . ||| mukuru wanjye ukurikiraaga musaza wanjye mukuru , niwe turi tusigaraanye wenyine . abandi bose nabo bari barabaishe . na musaza wanjye wunri wa kane ... oya wa gatatu .
so at the school there were still some survivors . ||| nuko , ubwo nragiye ndansindagiye ngeze ku mashuri , hari hakiri ... ubwo hari hakiri abantu bakeya babashije kurokoka ,
they had seen how intense the war had become and they said that we should start sleeping in the swamp because in the school we would be found out and killed . ||| ariko ubwo noneho uwo munsi bahise babona ko intambara noneho ikazae . baravuga bati @: "@ aha hantu naho ni ukuhava tukajya turara ku rufunzo , bati @:
the often used to come to the school and break down the pots we were using for cooking and take the mattresses and everything . ||| naho ku mashuri bazahatutsindair . @" kubera ko ubwo ngubwo barazaaga bababura inkono mwasize mutetse zose bakafata bakamenagura zose mukasanga pe ! na matera zose bazitwaye n' iki ...
when we reached there , there is a certain uncle of mine who said , "@ look how injured she is , we can n't live her alone here . ||| noneho ubwo tuhageze , umu oncle umwe nri nfite kusa w' umusaza , ahita avuga ati @: "@ uyu muntu bagize gutya rero ,
because once they find her here they will simply finish her up in torture . ||| abantu bagiye kuva hano ku mashuri , ntabwo tumusiga aha wenyine . n' ubundi bazaza baka muhaubura bakamuhwanya bakamwica urubozo .
so let 's take her . @" we used to have some hutu neighbours whose houses were in the centre in a place called bisigara . ||| reka tumujyanae tumu ... hari ukuntu , hari abahutu bakeya turi tuturanye , bari batuye bari bagendaaga batura hagati y' amazu ahantu hitwaaga mu bisigara .
when the war became tough , those people went to help their fellow hutu and left their houses covered with banana leaves on the doors . ||| ubwo rero intambara yarateye , bahita bagenda bajya kufasha bene wabo . inzu zabo bahita ba ... basiga bazimatseho amakoma .
so that when perpetrators came they would not destroy those houses . ||| kuko iyo basangaaga ... bene wabo babaga baturutse ahandi bakasanga urukoma ku nzu , bahitaaga baumva ko ari inzu ya mwene wabo , ntihagirae icyo bayitwara . ubwo aravuga ati @:
then my uncle said that they should carry me to one house of their houses [ belonging to the hutu ] where there was a banana leaf on the door , no one would enter there . ||| "@ reka tumujyanae tumushyirae mu nzu yo kwa kanaka , ati @: nibasanga hari ho urukoma , ntawe uzatinyuka kuinjiramo .
he said god would take care of the rest . ||| ati @: ubwo nyine imaan wenda izaba igira icyo ikora .
that is how it happened ; they took me there and the rest of the people in the school had all left and went to hide in those houses that were still remaining [ the houses with banana leaves ] . ||| koko niko bigenze . baragiye banshyira muri iyo nzu , ariko nyine ubwo ku mashuri abaturage bari barahavuye , baragiye n' ubundi bagenda banyanyagira muri ayo mazu yabashije kusigara ,
they used to sleep in those houses , although they were very scared that they might come and kill them . ||| ariho barara ninjoro . ariko nabwo bakarara bafite ubwoba , bavuga bati @: "@ ziraza zituicae . @"
anyway i do not know the kind of god that worked wonders in him ; he never hurt me . ||| icyakora imaan yamukoreyemo nta kintu ... ntiiigeze ankoraho , ahubwo ntinzi ahantu yagiye anzanira umutobe .
instead he went and brought me some juice . i could not hold anything . ||| anzanira umutobe , ngiye ... nrangije ... ntinbashaaga kufata ntaki ... n' iyo bazanaaga nk' ikintu nk' iki ,
so , he held it for me and i swallowed big sips ; i had spent weeks without eating anything . ||| aranfatair gutya , ndagotomeraa ... nri maze nk' ibyumweru nka bingahe nta n' ikintu ngira .
later he told me that he is going to get me some drugs . ||| arangije aravuga ati @: "@ nragiye ... nragiye ngiye ku kushakira umuti . @" nti @: sawa .
three days after he left the rpf [ inkotanyi ] troops came . ||| ahubwo yaragiye hasiga ... nta minsi itatu yashize , inkotanyi zihita ziza . zihita ziza ,
i only saw him on that day , the people who inhabited that area too . ||| ubwo abandi baragiye ... hashize umunsi umwe ... uwo munsi yaje . ntabwo baongeye kuhagaruka abo baturagae . nravuga umh ,
then i started wondering if maybe the people who used hide in that house saw the interahamwe entering the house . ||| ese bamenye ko uyu mupagasi yaje muri yi nzu ra ?
in fact , when the inkotanyi troops came , they first passed into the swamp and told them to cross over to nyamata . ||| kumbi ubwo interahamwe za ... inkotanyi zaje zirakataa zaica ku rufunzo , ziragenda zirabafata zirababwira ngo bahitae baambuka banjye i nyamata . ubwo rero comme ca ,
that was the reason why they never came back to those houses . ||| bituma batagaruka mu ntuza ... mu mago ,
they immediately went where they were told to go . ||| bahita bagendair aho ngaho . noneho baravuga bati @:
as they were living , they told the inkotanyi that they were some of their people who are terribly injured but still alive . ||| "@ ariko rero ibyo ari byo byose n' ubwo tugiye , bati @: hari abantu bacu b' inkomerae batemaguye , bati @:
they told them we were hiding in those houses . ||| kandi batarashiramo umwuka ,
then the inkotanyi said , "@ no , that is none of your business , it 's our work . ||| bakiri mu mago . @" bati @: "@ oya ,
just do what we are asking you to do . @" ||| bati ibyo ntibibareba ni ibyacu . mwebwe mugendae , mukorae ibyo tubabwiye . @"
therefore , that is how they left ; i could n't see them anywhere that night . ||| nuko , ubwo bahita bagenda gutyo , burira ntinbabona ,
then i said to myself , "@ all people have died . i am the only one remaining . @" ||| nravuga nti @: noneho abantu basae bapfuye bashize nti ubu ninjye usigaye .
so the next morning the wife of the gardener came to me and said , "@ do you know what happened ? all the interahamwe are gone and the inkotanyi have come . @" ||| nuko , bukeye hahita haza umugore wa wa mupagasi . ahita anbwira , ati @:
i said , "@ do n't say that ! ||| "@ umenye se ibyabaye ? @" nti ni iki se ? ati @: "@ nyine ati @:
everybody has died and you are saying that the interahamwe are gone . @" ||| ubu interahamwe zose zagiye , ati @: inkotanyi zaje . @"@ nti @:
then she explained to me , "@ no , they did not die . ||| ceceka wibivuga se maye . nti @: zaje se , nti @:
they just took them . @" ||| ahubwo nti abantu barapfuye barashize . ati @: "@ reka da ! ati @:
then she asked me if she should carry me to the roadside ... because there were other injured people , who were actually more injured than me [ on the road ] . ||| zahise ziza anbwira ukuntu bigenze . nuko ati @: "@ noneho wowe ihanganae ngunsindagize , umanukae ujyae ku muhanda ,
she said , "@ you should join others and not remain behind alone . @" i accepted and she walked me to the road . ||| kubera ko ku muhanda gutya hari abandi bantu b' inkomerae cyane kuruta njyewe . ati ubasangae mujyae hamwe ati @: we kuguma ahangaha wenyine . nuko nraihangana aransindagiza turagenda ,
i spent the night there but they did not come that night . ||| turaharara aho ngaho , ubwo iryo joro ntizaza ,
however , they came the following morning at around 10.00 o'clock . ||| bukeye nko mu ma saa ine . tugiye kubona tubona ziraje .
then they asked , "@ is anybody in here ? @" ||| nuko ziravuga ngo @: "@ hano harimo abantu ? @"
that lady replied , "@ yes . @" ||| uwo mugorae avuga ngo @: "@ yego . @"
when they saw us they were very shocked at how injured we were . @" ||| nuko ubwo ngubwo baratubwira , ngo @: ni ukunguku ngo mwabaye ?
she ran away because her husband 's relatives wanted to kill her . ||| ... ntuza ahunze nyine bene wabo b' uwo mugabo kubera ko bashaka kumwica .
then all the hutus had ran away towards kibungo ... kibungo sector ; i do n't know if you know it or hear about it . ||| ubwo , abahutu bari barahunze bagiye za kibungo , secteur kibungo urayizi , ntinzi niba uyizi cyangwa uyumva .
therefore , that is when she came and asked me if i was aware of what had happened . ||| ahita aza nyine nibwo yanbwiraaga ati @: "@ umenye ibyabaye ? @"
meanwhile , i thought everybody had died and that i was the only survivor . ||| ariko hagati ahongaho njyewe ubwo nri nzi ko abantu bose bashize ari njyewe usigaye .
she asked me , "@ why are you still here ? @" ||| nuko arabwira ati @: ko uri hano ati @: "@ uracyari hano ? @" nti @:
"@ what do you expect me to do ? @"@ ||| nonese uragira ngo bigendae bite ?
, i replied then she told me that the inkotanyi took up the rest to nyamata . ||| ati abandi bose ati @: inkotanyi zabajyanye i nyamata ,
"@ nobody is remaining in this sector . ||| ati @: nta muntu n' umwe usigaye ku murengae .
even the interahamwe are running way . @" ||| n' interahamwe zirimo kuhunga . nti @:
she assured me . ||| nonese njyewe urabona nkuigezayo ? ati @:
then i told her that i was not able to join them . she suggested to help me walk up to the road . ||| "@ hepfo hariya ku muhanda hari izindi nkomerae bagiye batoragura mu rufunzo , ati @: zihari , ati @:
"@ the inkotanyi will never see you if you remain here @"@ , she said . ||| ukuihangana nkagusindagiza . ati @: kuko uhari ntabwo inkotanyi zizamenya ko ... we kuguma hano ntan' ubwo zizamenya ko uhari , ni bibi . @"
it was in the evening beginning to get dark ; it was some minutes passed six p.m. then she said , "@ i guess they will n't come at this time because it is late , but they may come in the morning . ||| ubwo hari nimugoroba butangiye kwira . nka saa kumi n' ebyiri n' ibindi . ati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose ubu ntabwo zikije ,
make sure they find you there . @" ||| birangiye , ati @:
then she helped me walk up to a certain house . ||| ariko ibyo aribyo byose buriya mu gitondo ziraza , ati @: zihakusangae . @"@ ubwo nraihangana ndasindagira ,
in that house i found several other kids , who were in the worst condition compared to me ; some were dying , others did n't have legs and could n't move . others had started rotting from there . ||| turamanuka tugera aho ngaho kuri iyo nzu , tusanga koko harimo abandi bana benshi batemaguye . ari abari kuhorota ; abo batemye amaguru batashobora no kuikura n' aho bari ;
in brief , when i reached there , i seemed to be the strongest around . ||| abandi baboreye aho ; mbese muri make mpageze nbona ninjye muzima uhari .
yet i too was already desperate that my arms had started rotting ; they were weak , i could n't lift an arm to any angle . ||| kandi uraumva ko nnjyae nri nramaze kuiheba amaboko yose yaraboze , ntashobora no kukaterura .
it took us about ... about four hours to get there . ||| kuvaho ... kuhava kuhagera ntinzi ibirometero ... ariko tugenze nk' amasaha angahe ... nka saa ... nko mu ma saa ine ,
then we heard people walking around , asking if there could be anybody inside the house . ||| tuumva abantu bari kugenda hanze , babaza bati @: "@ ese ahangaha harimo abantu n' iki ... ? @" noneho ,
they hit the door and came in . ||| bahita bakubita urugi , bahita bavuga bati @:
they first saw me because i was the only one who was in better conditions than the others because my legs had not been hacked . ||| "@ hano harimo abantu bakihumeka . @" bahita bainjira , bahasanga umukobwa w' inkumi ugaragara ... kubera ko njyewe ntabwo bari barantemye amaguru ,
others were horribly injured . some were hacked around the neck , on the legs , on the head and the arms as well . ||| abandi bose bari baryamye bari barabatemye ibikanu ,
two of them were dying due to weeks of hunger and thirst , since those dead bodies lying around . ||| imitwe ... harimo nka bangahe ... hari nka babiri barimo kusamba mbega . kubera n' inzara n' ibisebe n' inyota ibintu nkibyo ... ubwo uraumva ko hari hashize nk' icyumweru ababashaaga kubazanira n' utuzi baragiye , ari nk' intumbi ziryamye aho kusa .
then he asked if there was anybody who could try and join others . ||| ubwo yahise atubaza niba hari uwunva yabasha kuigenza ngo mbese asangae abandi ,
but later he realized that no one was able to walk . ||| ariko nawe arabibona ko nta n' umwe ushobora kugenda .
then he asked me if i could try and walk but i said , "@ no i can n't @"@ . ||| ambaza njyewe niba nbasha kugenda nkijyana nkagera i nyamata . nramubwira ngo ntabwo nbishobora .
and then he sent that lady to nyamata to bring some people and stretchers to carry us . ||| ahita yohereza wa mugorae ngo @: "@ wowe genda ujyae ku ... i nyamata aho abandi bari , ababwirae noneho bahitae baza ... bazana ingobyi baze kutwara bano bantu .
but when she left , she did not come back . she was afraid of her husband ; he was a hutu and a perpetrator . ||| umudamu ahita ... ahubwo yaragiye ... ahubwo comme ca ntabwo yagarutse we yishakira ... mbese yari afite n' ubwoba kubera ko umugabo yari n' umuhutu yari interahamwe , yari afite ubwoba ,
actually she was praying she would find a way to join her people , she did not have anywhere to pass . ||| avuga ati @: "@ icyampa imaan nkabona ikingeza muri bene wacu . @" kuko yari yabuze aho aca .
we stayed together for a while then in july people started going back to their homes , i was asking myself what i would do next . ||| ni uko mpita ngenda , njya aho ngaho iwabo , kubera ko ni nabo banangaburiraaga n' iki ... ni uko hashize nk' igihe ... hashize nk' amezi abiri ... ubwo kangahe ra ? hari nko mukwa karindwi .
i really needed to know news from my brother but found from people that he had joined the army because he was told that i was dead . ||| amahoro asa nk' atangiye kugaruka , nkavuga nti @: ese ubu ... nkatekereza ubuzima nzabamo , nkaumva ntabwo nbuzi .
but my aunt was also living there , my older sister used to live with her . ||| nbariraije ibya wa musaza wanjye , baranbwira ngo @: "@ ngo baramubwiye ngo urapfuye , ngo ahita yigira mu gisirikare . @"
she died before the war , and we all went to rwampara to mourn her . ||| ariko ino ahangaha i kigali hakaba hari mama wacu ... ubwo intambara ijya kuba , hari umu grande soeur kwa tantae [ mukuru wanjye kwa mama wacu ] uri umaze iminsi apfuye . turi turiyo mu kiriyo hariya mu rwampara . umunsi katunba apfa turi tuje kumuhamba .
the whole family came to bury katumba , i was with my brother , but he went back and i stayed there . ||| ubwo famille yanjye yose niho mbese niho yari iri , nzana na musaza wanjye tuje kumuhamba , ariko we arataha njyae ntahasigara ,
i went on tuesday and the president died on wednesday . ||| ngenda ku wa kabiri , presida apfa ku wa gatatu .
i had just spent one night then the war started . ||| ubwo rero ... nje ... intambara yabaye nri nraye mpavuye .
the whole family was there , waiting to end the mourning ... so i decide to come to kigali to see if there could be any survivor i can see since in bugesera there was none . ||| ubwo nkaba nri nsizeyo famille yose mbese ariho bari bari bategereje kurangiza ikiriyo . hari hariyo umutante wanjye tubanaaga i kibungo , n' abandi ba grande soeurs [ bakuru banjye ] bo kwa mama wacu . mpita nvuga nti noneho reka npfae kugira ... nti reka ngarukae i kigali nrebae hari uwaba yarahasigaye ,
there was one man who had come from bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at rwampara , i found that one of my aunts was still there . ||| i bugesair ho nrabona ntabahari . ni uko . hari umugabo uri utuye ... turi tuturanye ahita ampa ‘ lifuti ’ turazana .
that is when i started gaining some hope since at least i was getting someone to stay with . ||| tugeze hariya rwampara , nsanga uwo mu tantae wanjye arahari , numva noneho nibwo agatima katangiye kugaruka , numva ko wenda nbonye undi muntu tuzabana .
we stayed together until she died in the year 2000 . ||| ni uko , turabana gutyo kugeza ejo ... mu w' ibihumbi bibiri [ 2000 ] nibwo nawe yapfuye .
we lived together until that time and a few of my cousins were also there . i was able to find some people who had survived . ||| ariko uraumva ko turabanye ... na babyara nabo bari bahari mu ntiambara , nbona hari bake bagiye basigara .
my life went on like that . ||| ni uko nbona ubuzima bwanjye bukomeza gutyo ,
i think that is all about my life during genocide . ||| n' uko bigenze . ibyo muri genocide bigarukaiye aho ngaho .
can you continue telling us even the life after the genocide and who did you live with ? ||| wakomereza na nyuma ya genocide uko ubayeho n' uko mwabanye ...
after the war i did not continue to study . ||| nyuma y' intambara ubwo ngeze aho ... ntabwo nkomeje kuiga kubera ko hagiye habaho kujya mu ntuza ... mu bitaro ibisebe birakomeje birangaruka .
i spent most of my time at the hospital treating this hand as it was still paining me . ||| kandi noneho nta n' ubwo nri nigeze nvuraw , nza kujya mu ... nkomeje nirukanka mubyo kuivuza mbega , igihe kinini nbayeho ,
dr nyaruhirira was on an attachment in south africa . ||| nbayeho ndi kuivuza . ntabaye mu bitaro mbese nta myaka ingahe ishize ntivuza kano kaboko . haza kuza umu docteur uturutse muri afrique du sud , ntuza uriya nyaruhirira yari ari muri stage ,
he came back and he is the one who treated me and i got well . ||| niwe unvuye birakira .
later on , i tried to run after the organization ‘ kanyarwanda ’ , they were the ones who had taken me there and i was operated ; they changed the position of my arm bone it was not shaped like this . ||| baravuga ngo ... ngerageza kuirukankair muri kanyarwanda nibo bahajyanyeyo barakabaga akaboko igufa bararitransforma [ bararihindura ] ribasha kumera gutya , ubu ntabwo ari ukunguku kari kameze . ubundi kari kameze gutya ... igufwa bari bararitemye bararicoca .
then later on , those children had no one to look after them , so that is why i did not go back to school . ||| ni uko , nragaije rero mara mu bitaro igihe kinini , nyuma yabwo nbona ... nibwo nkomezaaga kujya ... abo bana nta wunri muntu wabarebereraga ni njyewe uri ubafite , niyemeza kugumana nabo ntinbasha kusubira kuiga .
q ... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana .
meanwhile , i got a job at "@ acrg mpore @" [ it is an association ] . i was earning some little money , it was enough for me to feed those children . ||| ubwo hagati ahongaho nje kubona akazi kuri acrg mpore [ ishyirahamwe ] nkabasha kukorera amafaranga makeya aringaniye nkabatunga ,
afterwards their uncle who came from abroad took them . ||| usibye baje ... bije no kugeraho haza umu oncle wabo ubaga hanze arabajyana .
then i gave birth to my own child , she is now two years old . ||| nyuma y' aho ariko nnjyae nje kubyara uwange ubu nramufite yujuje imyaka ibiri .
you have told us how you lived before the war , how you were treated in the society due to your ethnic or things like that ... what do you think is the difference between @: life before the war [ genocide ] and life after the war ? ||| umaze kutubwira ukuntu ubayeho nyuma y' intambara uburyo bakufataaga muri ‘ societe ’ kubera ibintu by' amoko n' iki ... , ubona itandukanirizo rya mbere y' intambara [ jenocide ] na nyuma y' intambara ari irihae ?
there is a difference . because before the war people were scared . ||| itandukanyirizo ryo rirahari kubera ko mbere y' intambara umuntu ubaga wikandagira ,
wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation . ||| n' aho wicaye ubaga wunva bavuga ibintu by' amoko n' ibiki ... ariko ubu wenda ubona nta bintu by' amoko bihari ,
maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing . ||| n' ubwo uba wica ... uvuga uti ... ikibazo ari icya bariya barimo kufungura .
but in general , there is a big difference . ||| ariko ubundi ubusanzwe ubona hari itandukanirizo .
life nowadays is not the same as that before the war . ||| ubu nta ... ntabwo ari kimwe na mbere y' intambara .
do you try to live with all types of people or do you feel closer to certain people ? do believe you can live with all people or there are only a certain type of people you can live with . ||| ugerageza kubaan ... mu bantu mubana ... ugerageza kubaan n' abantu bose , cyangwa ugira umwihariko ? wunva abantu bose mwabana cyangwa hari umwihariko w' abantu mwabana ;
i mean people you can discuss the issues related to the genocide . ||| nravuga abo ushobora kubwira ibibazo byawe wihariye ,
can you discuss genocide issues with anybody ? ||| wunva ibibazo by' itsembabwoko abantu bose mwabiganira kimwe ?
of course not . ||| oya nawe ,
sincerely , you can not discuss genocide problems ... that problem ... a problem you share with someone else , you can not talk about it with someone you do n't share it . ||| quand meme [ ibyo aribyo byose ] biraumvikana ntabwo ibibazo by' itsembabwoko ... ntabwo ikibazo ... ikibazo uhuraiyeho n' undi ntabwo ushobora kukibwira uwo mutakihuraiyeho ! hari uwo ushobora kaumva wishyikiraho ,
there are those you fell free with because you have the same problems , but ... for example @: the way i tell it to a survivor who was here in rwanda is not the same as the way i tell it to a person who came from exile . ||| muhuje . tuvugae exemple [ urugero ] nk' umuntu mwarokokanye uri mu rwanda , ntabwo ushobora kumubwira ikibazo cyawe nk' uko ukibwira uwavuye hanze .
i can tell my story to a survivor because i know we have something in common . ||| ushobora kukimubwira kuko wunva muhuje mbese .
it is like talking to someone you do n't share the same language , it is never the same as talking to that one you have it in common ... this is just an example . ||| uzarebae nk' umuntu muvuga ururimi rumwe mbese muhuje ururimi ntabwo mwabivuga kimwe nk' uwo mutaruhuje . ni urugero .
what do you think about the families of those who murdered your family ? do they try to show you any ... i am asking you this because i would like us to talk about unity and reconciliation . ||| wenda wowe imiryango y' abantu ... imiryango y' abantu bakuiciye ubona igerageza kugerageza kugira ngo ubonae ... wihangane wenda kugirango mu kanya tuze kugaruka ku kintu cy' ubumwe n' uubwiyunge .
is there any way you collaborate with the families of those who killed your people , to the extent where you can talk with them ? ||| ubona hari ahantu amahuriro n' imiryango y' abantu bakuiciye , ku buryo hari ikintu ushobora kubabwira ?
i simply consider it as an impossible issue . ||| nkiumva ... nkiumva nta kintu kitashoboka .
how can one reconcile with a person who ... well , since there is no alternative , if he comes to you and ask for forgiveness you may forgive him . ||| ese ukuiyunga n' umuntu ... icyokora baje ... kubera ko umuntu nta n' icyo uba uri bumutwarae , atinyutse akaza akakusaba imbabazi , umubabarira .
it is the same as those who say that , in gacaca courts people admit their crimes and then are forgiven . ||| ariko rero uraumva nk' ibi bavuga mbese uba ubona arinko ... nka kwa kubura uko ugira n' ubundi . urabona nka bariya bavuga ngo @: "@ muri gacaca ngo birega ibyaha ngo baga ... @" nyine ni kwaku ... buriya se uribaza ko babiemera ari uko bibavuye ku mutaima ?
but do you think they say it from the bottom of their hearts or is it so they may be forgiven ? that is why for me unity and reconciliation is impossible . ||| cyangwa ni uko uba wunva bavuga bati @: "@ nitubyemera turafungurwa . @" niyo mpamvu rero nta ... ku mutaima wanjye ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge numva ubwange baita ...
there is a new government policy of asking the survivors to go round in the prisons and sensitize the killers to admit what they did and report themselves . ||| hari ibintu leta yashyizeho wenda byo ku ... byo kubwira abantu barokotse ngo bajyae bazenguruka mu magereza bajyae kukangurair bariya bantu bakoze ibyaha kuirega .
do you support that idea ? ||| ibyo bintu urabishyigikiye ?
never , i can not handle it ! i can not manage to do that ; i am a 100 % against it . ||| oya njyae sina ... nta n' ubwo nnabishobora njyewe ntinkishyigikiye , ntinnabishobora kubikora .
let 's go back a bit before the genocide . ||| tusubiye inyuma gatoya ku buzima bwa mbere ya jenoside ,
some people we met told us that there was an ethnic problem in schools , everywhere ; did you face the same problems ? ||| hari abantu tugiye tuganira tubabwira yuko haba mu mashuri ; habaaga hari bianze bikunze ibibazo by' abahutu n' abatutsi ibintu nk' ibyo . mwebwe ntabyo mwagiraga ku buryo ubonaaga yuko biriho ?
yes it was there and it was brought by the authorities . you could n't expect good result when you tell the hutu to stand up and after tutsi to do the same , for what purpose ? ||| bibaga bihari kubera ko ... uraumva ko abarezi ba ... nibo banabisho ... ntakuntu uba uri muri classe [ mu ishuri ] ngo ubwirae abanyeshuri uti @: "@ abahutu nimuhagurukae ,
we were asking ourselves what was all that for ? ||| nibarangiza bavugae ngo n' abatutsi nibahaguruke ,
and our parents used to tell us that they were survivors of hutu persecutions in the previous years . ||| ubwo se finalement [ amaherezo ] baumvaaga ko iryo barura rigamije iki ? nyine ubwo ntawe tusigaraaga ... usigaraaga wibaza icyo ibyo bintu rigamije . kandi kuko wa mu ... n' ababyeyi bacu babaga batubwira ko baje bahunze abahutu ,
they always used to complain about it . ||| batubwira ukuntu babatotezaaga , usanga bigize , bitutumba donc .
... did you see any changes after 1990 or were things the same ? ||| umh ... nravuga ngarutse inyuma gato tukiri kuri izo nyigisho , evenement [ ibyabaye ] za mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] zitangiye mwakomeje kubona byoroshye ? cyangwa byahinduye isura ?
that is when things got worse , the time the inkotanyi attacked . that is the time people started joining inkotanyi . ||| ahubwo nibwo bitangiye gu ... inkotanyi zitangiye kutera hatangiye kujya ... hatangiye kubaho kujya mu nkotanyi ,
i forgot to tell you that my brother had wanted to join the rpf , they caught him while he was in ngenda and put him in prison after seriously striking him . ||| ahubwo hari icyo nibagiwe kubabwira ko ... ubwo nyine hari musaza wanjye uwo nguwo , yari agiye ... yagiye mu nkotanyi bamufatair ku ntuza ... muri ngenda , bamufungair ... baramufunga habaho kumukubita ,
for them joining the inkotanyi was a big mistake and that would make them harass the families [ of the young people who would try to or manage to join the rpf ] . ||| iyo mbese babaga baumva ko ngo umuntu wo kwa kanaka yagiye mu nkotanyi , byo bibaga ari ibindi bibi , batotezaaga famille [ umuryango ] ye cyane .
was your family ever harassed ? ||| famille yanyu barayitoteje ?
of course it changed ; for days , soldiers kept coming home investigating on dad , saying that he is the one who had sent him . ||| yahise ihinduka nyine , ubwo abasirikare bakahora mu rugo baje kukoresha enquete bavuga ngo nibo bamwohereje n' iki ... ariko bigeze aho bira ... mbese ... kubera ko twebwe ... urabona burya ibintu byose biva mu nzego zo hasi .
in our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by tutsi , there was no hutu among them . so these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things . ||| kubera ko inzego inzego zo hasi zayoborawaga n' abatutsi mbese twe nta bahutu turi tuturanye nabo , bigeze aho babaumvaish ko ababyeyi nta ruharae bafitemo ,
despite that , the genocide was later on generalized . ||| bi ... bisa nk' ibaicishije make . usibye ko hari igihe kishize nyine kugira ngo jenoside ibae , bikakomeza bika ... noneho bikaba muri rusangae .
still in the 90s , political parties were created , such as cdr and mrnd ... did that affect you in your area or in your schools ? ||| tukomeje gato tuje kuvuga bizima , nyuma yaho , nyuma ya mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] hariho ibintu bitangiye kuzamuka by' amashyaka , za c.d.r ,
could you explain to us ? ||| na za m.r.n.d n' ibiki byose , ibyo bintu ahantu mwari mutuye ku murengae cyangwa ku mashuri cyangwa ... muri rusangae ahantu mwabaga . ntabwo bihageze ngo bigirae ingaruka ? utusobanurair .
it was similar everywhere . ||| biri bikiri nyine nk' ahandi hose .
those who were n't mrnd members were persecuted but that did not stop us from being members of the parties we chose . ||| nyine amashyaka ... uri mu ishyaka ritari irya m.r.n.d nyine bakamutoteza ,
even though there was so much tension , we were not going to pretend and be where we hated to be . ||| ariko rero ntibikubuze kujya aho ushaka . kubara ko nyine turi turamaze ntawe kaumva ko m.r.n.d itatukunda n' iki ... tumaze kaumva ko hari ishyaka umuntu yajyamo aka ... n' ubwo utagira amahoro ariko ni hahanri ntujyae mu utakukunda . ukavuga uti @: "@ kama mbaya ,
our attitude was @: "@ if they are going to kill me because that , let it be so . @" ||| mbaya [ ikishaka kibae ] . bazanyicae ariko ntaririmo .
there was a lot of tension . ||| ariko biteraaga nyine imyuka mibi . byarashyaminyaga , amashyaka yose yarashyamiranaga . nk' uko n' ahandi hose bibaga bimeze .
going back to just after the genocide ... what do you think of the new program that releases prisoners who acknowledge their crimes and that reintegrates them in the society ? ||| tugarutse noneho inyuma ... nyuma y' intambara . wowe ibintu ... hari ibintu noneho bihari by' uko bagomba kufungura abantu ; abantu kuko bireze bakaemera icyaha , bakazaza noneho muri societe bakabasha kaongera kubaan n' abandi .
do you think it will help in the process of unity and reconciliation ? ||| icyo kintu ukitekerezaho iki ? ese ubona ari ikintu kizatufasha kugira ngo tugerae ku bumwe n' ubwiyunge ?
when i think about that i find that it impossible . ||| njyewe icyo kintu iyo nkitekereje numva kitazashoboka ,
i think it will result into something worse . ||| ahubwo kizatuvairmo ibindi bintu bibi ,
i do n't know if my opinion is similar to what others think . ||| ntinzi niba ngewe uko nbiumva ari ko n' abandi babiumva .
when i hear that i have goose pimples all over my body ; so i try to ignore it . ||| kuko n' iyo babivuze mpita urumeza runjeho nkahita numva shwi ... kugira ngo umuntu azavugae ngo @:
can you imagine someone who has killed your people coming to live with you ? ||| "@ umuntu ngo @: nzae ngo @: mwegerane ... @" uzi neza ko yakuiciye , yaraishe n' undi muntu uzi !
do you think it will be safe ? ||| numva ari ibintu bizafata intera ndende .
you told us that your dad was from ruhengeri . ||| utubwiye ko papa wawe yaturutse mu ruhengeri .
were they neighbours with your mum or your mum came from a different place ? ||| bari baturanye na mama wawe cyangwa mama wawe yavuye ahandi ... ?
they were all living together . ||| bari ba ... bavaaga hamwe . bose mbese bari batuye hamwe ,
in fact all the people of ntarama were somehow related , they came together and lived together that way . ||| urabona abantu bari batuye ... bariya bantu bari batuye i bugesair hariya i ntiarama hafi ya bose . bose ni abantu bari muri famille imwe , mbese bari mu muryango umwe , baje i ntiarama ... uko baje niko bagiye baturana .

they did not want us to die as handicapped people ... they wanted to stay ... as soon as we left , the perpetrators came and started killing . we even heard them screaming from where we were . ||| interahamwe zihita ziza , babatemagura tuumva .

the others were killed while looking for a place where to hide like everyone else . they were hacked to death . ||| abandi rero bose bagendaaga bagiye kuihisha nk' abandi bose bakabatemagurira aho ngaho .
did you manage to exhume and rebury your people in ntarama ? ||| ese ntabwo ushoboye kushyingura mu cyubahiro abawe i ntiarama ?
i have never been there . the day they were burying them i was here . ||| nta n' umwe nshyinguye yo kuko biriya bintu byo kushyingura bibaye ndi ino aha nkaha .
i knew my parents ' bodies were at home . ||| kubera ko nri nizeye ko ... mbese bari iwacu , bari mu nzu ,
i went there once to bury them and i was so surprised ... it had been announced on the radio , it was in 1995 that people had gone to ntarama for burials ... when i went to bury them , i did not find them there . ||| ariho babiciye . ngenda ngiye kubitegura nsanga , igihe bavugaaga ngo bagiye kushyingura i nyamata ... igihe ba ... ni intuze ni muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] ahari . igihe bajya i ntiarama mubyo kushyingira .

there were other things piled on top of them , pieces of wood , stones ; there was even an axe , half of a machete that had been broken into two . ||| hari harimo n' ibindi bintu hejuru yabo bantu , nk' ibiti n' amabuye hari harimo n' umuhoro igice cy' umuhoro ucitsemo kabiri ,

my name is umuhire diane , i was 10 years old during the genocide . ||| nitwa umuhaire diane mu ntiambara nri nfite imyaka icumi ,
we are in kicukiro , in sahara sector , the cell is niboye ii . ||| aha turi ni muri kicukiro , muri segiteri sahara , serile niboye ya kabiri .
many people were killed here , over 500 people . ||| aha haicaiyew abantu benshi barenga magana atatu ,
those who were on the other side were killed on april 10th , 1994 . among them are my mother and my older sister . ||| abari hariya hirya baishwe ku itariki cumi z' ukwezi kwa kane ( 10/04/1994 ) barimo mama wanjye na mukuru wanjye ,
the ones who are in here were killed on april 14th , 1994 . ||| abari hano bo baishwe ku itariki cumi n' enye ( 14/04/1994 ) .
the killers had machetes , guns , grenades , swords . ||| abantu babaishe baje kubatwara bafite imihoro , imbunda , amagerenade n' inkota ,
they slaughtered them and some of them were burnt alive . ||| barabatemaguye bose , harimo nabo batwitse .
could you tell us who the members of your family were who were in here ? ||| abantu bo mu rugo bari barimo ushobora kubatubwira ?
there was mother , father and my older sister . ||| hari harimo mama wanjye na papa na mukuru wanjye .
what was your mum 's name ? ||| mama wawe yitwaaga nde ?
murebwayire veneranda , dad was called hakizimana fidele and my older sister 's name was hakizimana rosine . ||| murebwayire veneranda papa yitwaaga hakizimana fidele , mukuru wanjye yitwaaga hakizimana rosine .
could you briefly tell us how they were brought down here … how they brought them here … what happened from the time they were caught until the time they were killed . ||| noneho muri make tubwirae uburyo babamanuye hano uburyo babazanye hano , n' uburyo babafashe kugeza kubica , hano hari hameze hatae mbere ? hari icyobo kimeze kutae ?
here was a rubbish tip , we had sought refuge in a convent up there . ||| hano hari icyobo bamenamo imyanda , turi tuhungiye haruguru mu kigo cy' ababikira baza kubatwara ari interahamwe zigera nko kuri makumyabiri .
they came looking for them there , they were about 20 interahamwes . many of them had machetes , guns and they got them to go down , they got us to go down and sit in the middle of the road . ||| abenshi baambaye imihoro , bafite imbunda barabamanura , tuesae baratumanura batwicaza mu muhanda hagati nuko uwari ukuraiye interahamwe aravuga ngo ntihagirae uwica umwana ,
the head of the interahamwes said they should not kill the children , that they should only kill adults . ||| ngo bicae abakuru kusa .
and so after they went down , they started cutting them down , on april 10th , they threw them into this pit . ||| nuko bamaze kubamanura nibwo batangiye kubatemagura , abo bashyize muri kiriya cyobo ku itariki icumi ,
they also stole mattresses at home and in other houses in the neighbourhood , they poured fuel and burnt them . ||| bo babashyizemo basahura n' amamatela yari ari mu rugo , n' ayarari hirya no hino bashyiraho esanse barabatwika .
they cut them down and threw them into a pit , and then they put mattresses on top of them and burnt them . ||| barabatemye , babata mu cyobo barangije babashyiraho n' amamatela barabatwika ,
later on they came back to the convent . ||| nyuma nibwo baje kugaruka gusaka mu kigo cy' ababikira ,
that 's when my dad was taken away . ||| ari nabwo batwaraaga papa wanjye .
there were 5 interahamwes this time . ||| bwo baje ari interahamwe eshanu ,
two of them had guns , one had a hammer , two of them had machetes , that 's when they took him down and killed him as well . ||| harimo babiri bafite imbunda undi afite inyundo n' abandi babiri bafite imihoro , nibwo nabo babamanukaanye nabo barabica .
were they killed the same way or was his situation worse ? ||| abantu bose babaishe mu buryo bumwe cyangwa papa wawe biri bikabije ?
first , they hit him on the head with a hammer ; they took him pulling him across the ground . so you can understand that it was as though they had already killed him . ||| papa we barabanje bamukubita inyundo mu mutawe , ubundi bamutwara bamukurura hasi . ubwo uraumva deja bari barangije ni nkaho ari ukumwica ,
later again , they slaughtered him , because when we exhumed them , there were traces of a machete on his head and here [ on the neck ] , revealing the bones . ||| nyuma rero baranamutemaguye kuko nyuma tubataburura ku mutawe hagaragaraho imihoro na hano ( ijosi ) ku magufa biragaragaraaga .
so they are the ones who buried them here ? ||| nibo noneho bashyinguye hano ?
they are the ones who buried them here . ||| nibo bashyinguye hano .
do you know anyone else who is in here , perhaps your neighbour ? ||| hari abandi bantu uba uzi , bari abaturanyi banyu baba barimo hano ?
yes , i do . ||| yee , barahari .
could you tell us who they are ? ||| ubatubwira ?
there is baziga aloys ' family , some of them were our neighours , semana pierre 's family and his wife , there is also a child called mutama . ||| hari nk' umuryango wa bazaiga aloys , hari n' abandi bari abaturanyi umuryango wa semana pierre n' umugore we , hari n' umwana witwaga mutama .
there are many in there and i do not know them all . ||| ni benshi ni benshi harimo nabo ntazi .
how do you feel when you come here ? ||| aha hantu iyo uhageze hakubwira iki ?
i feel pain when i come here . this place reminds me of the many things that happened during the war . ||| aha hantu iyo mpageze , hantera ku babara kuko hanyibutsa byinshi nk' ibyaba birabaye mu ntiambara .
do you like the way this place is kept ? do you think it 's the way things should be or do you have a different opinion ? ||| uko hameze wunva bikushimaishije ? wunva aribyo , cyangwa wifuza ko hari ukundi bigenda ?
i do not appreciate the way it is now , i do not like it . ||| uko hameze ubu ,
i think they should be taken to a memorial site since this is somebody 's house anyway . ||| njyae uko nbibona nbona bitanshimaishije kuko numva babajyana nko mu nzibutso kuko n' ubundi aha ni mu rugo rw' umuntu ,
there 's nothing that shows that these people were killed during the war . ||| nta n' ikihamya kaerekana ko ari n' abantu bahaguye mu ntiambara .
i believe it would be better to take them to a memorial site and people would visit them there . ||| numva ikiza ari uko bajya nko mu nzibutso umuntu akajya abasangayo .
my name is theodore bizimana . ||| nitwa bizimana theodore ,
in 1994 , i was living here in nyakabanda , i was a mature , grown @-@ up person . i was 42 years old . ||| nkaba muri 1994 nri ntuye aha mu nyakabanda , nri umuntu mukuru ukuze nzi ubwenge nri nfite imyaka mirongo ine n' ibiri ( 42 ) .
could you tell us what happened here ? ||| ushobora kutubwira icyabereye hano ?
what happened here goes beyond imagination . ||| ibyabereye aha ni akahoma munwa ,
this was a neighbour 's family . ||| uru rugo ruri urw' umuturanyi ,
those who were killed here were with me at eto . ||| abantu bahaguye turi kumwe muri eto ,
they were deceived , and told that things had cooled down ... in the end , their day had come and they were killed . ||| hanyuma igihe kiragera barabashuka akantu k' akahumurae ab' umutima ( ari myoje ) nako ni abagejeje umunsi .
they headed back home but did not spend another night alive , they were killed . ||| bafata inzira barataha bageze aha ntibaharaye barabica ,
we stayed at eto and we left there for nyanza . but those who had remained behind lost their lives . ||| tusigara muri eto tuza kuhava tujya i nyanza ariko abo tusigaraanye barahaguye ,
it is evident that many people were killed there . i escaped death then . those people were our neighbours . ||| biraumvikana benshi barahaguye , niho nahonokeye njyewe ariko ubundi abo bantu turi tuturanye muri icyo kihae .
could you tell us how many people were killed here ? ||| abantu bicaiyew hano ushobora kutubwira umubare wabo ?
right here . ||| hano hano ,
they 'd been thrown into a pit that was here . ||| bari batabaye mu mwobo uri aha .
could you please tell us how they were killed ? ||| ushobora kutubwira uburyo babaishe ?
they hacked them , shot them and threw grenades on them . ||| barabatemaguye , barabarasa , babatera amagerenade barangije babajugunya muri uyu mwobo ,
the pit was a septic tank ... they had planned to make it into one , but it was not yet completely built . ||| uyu mwobo uri umusarane , uri wagenewe kuba umusarane ariko uri utarakoreshwa .
so they killed them and threw them in . ||| hanyuma barabica babajugunyamo rero .
was it the head of the family together with his children and wife ? ||| yari nyiri urugo n' abana be , n' umugore we ?
yes , actually the mother was the head of the family , as the father died , of old age . ||| yeee , nyiri urugo ni mama w' abana ise w' abana yari yarapfuye yari yarashaje ,
therefore , it was the children 's mother , the children and the grand @-@ children . ||| hanyuma ni nyina w' abana n' abana ndetse n' abuzukuru .
what happened after genocide ? ||| nyuma ya jenoside habaye iki ?
after the genocide , people fled . ||| nyuma ya jenoside habayeho kuhunga ,
when we came back from exile , we went back to our homes and we slowly found out where people had been killed . we arranged the pit , cemented it and left them in . ||| tuhungutse tugarutse mu ngo tugenda tumenya aho abantu baguye ino aho bagiye bagwa . abantu turi turakoze neza uyu mwobo , turahoma tubarekeramo .
later on , we wanted to bury them with respect and we exhumed them and took them to gisozi , last year . ||| hanyuma igihe kiragera biba ngombaw kushyingura mu cyubahiro , tubakuramo tubajyana ku gisozi bagiyeyo umwaka ushize .
thank you . ||| murakoze .
in 1994 ... if i start telling you from the beginning ; from the time political parties rose , how roads were blocked by the militias to stop people from moving from place to place , how we failed to find way to the market places , the story would be so long and it can take much time to say all of it . ||| mu 1994 rero umuntu avuze ukuntu bigenze kuhera mbere hose amashyaka atangiye , ukuntu interahamwe zafungaaga imihanda zikabuza abantu kuhita , inaha tukabura uko tuhaha tukabura biba ari birebire cyane bifata igihe cyo kubivuga .
i will tell you old the events , which took place in the last week or i will begin from the death of gatabazi and bucyana , who was a cdr member . ||| ariko nrababwira kusa nko mu cyumweru cya nyuma cyangwa se mpereye nko kuri katabazi amaze kupfa , na bucyaan wa cdr ,
that is when we started getting many problems . ||| aho niho tutangiye kugira ibibazo cyane ,
that is when many people ( the tutsi ) were killed . ||| niho bicaaga abantu cyane bakica abatutsi .
they used to get young boys who would be going to their homes and take their clothes off and force them to wear combat and boots . ||| bakafata nk' abantu b' abasore bamanutse bataha mu ngo zabo , bakahita babavanamo imyenda baambaye , bakabaambika iniforome z' igisirikare , bakabaambika baotae ,
they would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them inkotanyi , yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well . ||| bakabashyira amagerenade mu mufuka bakavuga ko ari inkotanyi , kandi ari abantu basanzwe bazi bahangaha .
then , they would be killed just over there . ||| baragendaaga bakajya kubicira hirya ahangaha bugufi ,
a certain old man called theodore bizimana decided to shift ; he fled and left this place because of the smeil of corpses , which they used to dump in front of his home every morning . ||| umusaza witwa theodore bizimana ku buryo bigombye kumuvairmo kuimuka , barahunga bahunga ino kubera imirambo bataaga inberae y' iwe buri gitondo .
during that time , they used to enter people 's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted @: either at night or daytime . ||| icyo kihae rero bainjiraaga mu ngo uko bishakiye bakainjirair igihe bashakiye yaba ku manywa yaba ni njoro ,
they could take any thing they wished from people 's houses and beat anyone they wanted to beat . ||| bakatwara ibyo bashatse , bakica abo bashatse , bakakubita abo bashatse .
i remember sometime , it was on the hory thursday towards esther . ||| rimwe nraibuka hari kuwa kane mutagatifu pasika igiye kuba nzamutse ngiye mu misa , ngeze haruguru hariya nsanga hari umwana w' umusore bahafataiye ,
i was going to church and as i reached just in front , i saw a certain boy who was caught by the presidential guards . ||| hari abasirikare bo kwa kinani bari ahongaho ubonaaga basa n' abajepe ,
it was close to the home of nsabimana 's sister , this nsabimana was a soldier and he had another name ; he was called castar . ||| ahantu bugufi aho mushiki wa nsabimana w' umusirikare yari atuye , nsabimana baitaaga castar .
around , there was a shop where they used to gather and take alcohol , there was also a certain boy , so they caught him and reached a very huge stone ; these stones used for making foundations for houses and hit it to that boy . ||| aho hari aka butike banywairagamo , hari umuhungu nbona baramufashe bafata ikintu k' ikibuye kinini iki baubakaish fondasiyo z' inzu ,
i sreamed but a certain old lady who was living around here , she was called dina , she was also moving in the same direction like me and besides hearing , i never knew what was taking place . ||| barakimukubise ntataka noneho umukecuru umwe uri utuye hano haruguru witwaga dina yazamukaaga kuko numvaishije ntamenye ibibaye ,
then she told me while she was pulling my arm , "@ let 's procced , it is the interahamwe ( militias ) killing the other tutsi . @" ||| ahita ankurura akaboko ati hoshi tugende n' interahamwe zirimo kuica uriya mututsi .
then i asked her "@ what did he do ? @" ||| nravuga nti ese arazira iki ?
"@ he is accused of being a tutsi and stop talking about it , otherwise they will kill you too . @" ||| ati arazira ko ari umututsi , ati we kubivuga batakuica nawe ,
i procceded but i was very frightened . ||| nzamuka numva nfite ubwoba ,
however , as i reached at the corner i saw soldiers . i told them that there was somebody who was being killed . ||| noneho ngeze mu ikorosi nbona abasirikare nrababwira nti hari umuntu barimo kuica .
but when they realized that he had a tutsi appearance , they replied to me in french because i had talked to them in french , so they said , "@ laisse @- le , lui il a le droit de mourrir . @" meaning , "@ leave him , he has right to die . @" ||| barebye babonye barebye afite isura y' abatutsi bati ... kuko nbabwiye mu gifaransa noneho aranbwira ati laisse @le ,
that is what that man told me . so i procceded . ||| lui il a droit de mourrir ni gutyo uwo mugabo yanbwiye ntakomeza .
and then , on the sixth at night we heard that ... hope you can see that we are neighbouring the airport . ||| nibwo rero ku itariki ya gatandatu ni njoro tuumvaaga urabona tutuye bugufi y' ikibuga ,
i heard an explosion of an europlain , however we did n't know it was a europlain . ||| numva explosion y' indege ariko ntitumenya ko ari indege ,
then later in about two or one hour 's time we started hearing grenades around the neighbourhood . they were terribly many and unsual in fact somewhere in the neighbourhood , someone screamed and when he screamed we heard a grenade exploded . when the second grenade was exploded , that person stopped screaming and never screamed again . ||| noneho nyuma yaho nk' amasaha nk' angahe nk' abiri cyangwa imwe muri iyi karaitaiye hatangiye kuvuga amagerenade ya yanri atasanzwe menshi cyane menshi cyane kuko ntinzi ahantu umuntu yatakaiye hano muri karaitaiye arataka atatse tuumva gerenade irakubise hakubisemo iya kabiri ahita aceceka ntiiongera kutaka ,
the trend continued until deep in the night at around 03:00 a.m. and we had not known what had happened . ||| kugeza mu gitondo mbese bigeze nka saa cyenda z' ijoro tuziko tuyobewe ibyabaye kuko nta nubwo turi tubimenye twebwe .
when president habyarimana . j. @"@ ikinani @" died they cut the cabble , which supplied electricity in our area . ||| ikinani kipfuye bahise bajya haruguru hariya batukatair kaburae y' umuriro ,
they cut it in order to stop us from communicating with embassies because they knew that some how we must be in tough with a certain embassy ; therefore , they knew we could call the embassy and tell them the situation around our area . therefore , they cut the cabble that used to supply up to this place . ||| ngo tudakominikana n' ambasade baumvaaga ko tufite ahantu tushingaiye kuri ambasade tuhita duhuruza tukahamagara tukababwira uko biifashe muri karaitaiye ,
frankly speaking , i can not clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time , there were no electric phones . ||| bakata rero kaburae yageraaga ahangaha .
at least they would have disconnected the communication system and leave the electricity . ||| ntinzi icyatumye bakata amashanyarazi kuko mu by' ukuri telephone zikoresha amashanyarazi zari zitarabaho wenda bari kukata insinga za telephone ariko ntibakatae umuriro .
then in the morning we heard that the president died . we got the rumours from the neighbours because we could n't listen to the radio because we had no electricity . ||| nuko mu gitondo nibwo tumenye yuko yapfuye nabwo tubibawiyew n' abaturanyi kuko radiyo ntitubashaaga kuyumva kubera amashanyarazi ,
they had started burning people 's houses and killing people . ||| tubona ahantu hose batangiye kutwika , batangiye kuica abantu .
they started from up there at a certain widow 's home . she was called claudette muteteri . her husband was called mutsinzi . ||| babanje ruguru hariya ku mudamu w' umupfakazi witwa claudette muteteri yari umudamu wa mutsinzi ,
mutsinzi was a hutu but he died before the war . ||| umugabo we yari yarapfuye mbere ariko ari umuhutu .
a week before her death ... ( i had forgotten to tell you this but i have remembered as i mentioned her name ) between her home and aloys ' ( ngirabatware aloys was the president of the militias ) home , there was a field where all of us would gather for meetings . ||| kuburyo icyumweru kimwe mbere yuko bapfa nbisimbutse nramuvuze mpita biibuka , inberae y' iwe iruhande rw' iwe hagati y' iwe no kwa aloys ngirabatware uri perezida w' interahamwe hari ikintu k' ikibuga ariho abaturage bose tukoreraaga inama ,
in that meeting , it was where the security problem was mentioned . ||| muri iyo nama nibwo abantu bavuze ibintu by' umutekano .
therefore , my husband pierrot acted so brave and raised his hand and asked , "@ i would like to ask aloys some question @: the militias he lead are the ones who are killing people of this area and kill them from here . yet everyone knows that those people belong here ! do you want tell us that you do n't know where the inkotayi are living ? ||| noneho umugabo wanjye pierrot niwe uteye urutoki aratinyuka arabaza ati ariko se njyewe ntashaka kubaza aloys ko interahamwe ze arizo zifata abaturage zikabica zikabicira muri karaitaiye hano kandi babazi yuko ari abacu ,
they are in cnd . why do n't you find them there and kill them ? ||| bayobewe inkotanyi aho ziri ko ziri muri cnd kuki mutazisangayo ngo muzaicae ?
in stead you attack this poor widow ‘ claudette ’ and menace her . @" they could never let her sleep for a minute . ||| ahubwo mu katera nk' uyu mupfakazi claudette akaba ariwe muza kubuza ... kuko ntibatumaaga asinzira na gato buri kihae babaga bari iwe bamwatse amafaranga ,
everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish . ||| bamwatse ibyo bashaka , ni nawe rero bahereyeho igihe cy' intambara .
when the genocide begun , she was killed first in our area . and then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called modeste ( i do n't remember his other name ) to go and face aloys about that issue . ||| icyo kihae rero muri iyo nama rero nibwo we n' undi mugabo ntiibuka izina w' aha haruguru abaturage babatoye uwitwa modeste nibagiwe izina rye rinri abaturage bati ni mugendae mugiraane imishyikirano na aloys ,
however , we were very worried ; we knew that no body goes to aloys ' home and comes out alive . we thought they would die . ||| ariko tuumva tugize ubwoba kuko umuntu abantu barajya kwa aloys ntibari bugarukae tuumvaaga ko bari bupfae .
therefore , they decided to meet him the following day . ||| ubwo babaha gahunda ko ari bugeyo bukeye bawho ,
but since my husband was the one who was brave to ask that question , as we had just reached at home tracing somewhere to sit , we saw everybody who was affected by the security problem coming to our home . ||| ariko kuko ariwe utinyutse kubaza icyo kintu mu nama tugeze hano mu rugo tuvuye mu nama igihe tukaicara tubona noneho umuntu wese wunvaaga icyo kibazo kimureba cy' umutekano muke yahise aza hano ,
most of the people who would come were tutsis . therefore , we came up with a dicision of shifting in that same week . ||| abazaaga benshi bari abatutsi ubwo tufata umwanzuro wuko muri icyo cyumweru tuimuka .
my husband started shifting people ; he had a track , so he would shift people at night . ||| umugabo wanjye yatangiye kwimura yari afite ikamyoneti niwe ubimuraga ni njoro ,
at night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas . ||| tuhaengairaga ni njoro umuntu akapakira ibintu ni njoro tukabimura bakajya mu zinri karaitaiye ,
they begun from across there , that is where they would always attack . ||| babanje hirya hano mu baturanyi abaturanyi benshi bagiye babimura babavana muri karaitaiye hano abahoraaga bateraw cyane .
we had also planned to shift on saturday ; we had got a house in kabgayi for rent . ||| ubwo ntawe turi tufashe gahunda yo kuimuka ari ku wa gatandatu tubonye inzu i kabgayi , tugomba kuzagenda ,
unfortunately , that was when the serious killings begun . others had left ; it was a few families and us who had stayed . ||| nibwo bitangiraaga ubwicanyi butangiye tutagiye araitwae tusigaye n' abandi bakeya .
because all our neighbours had sought refuge in our home with a belief that , since it was in a white family no body would guess they were there or bather to come . ||| kuko abaturanyi bacu bari bahungiye hano bavuga ngo hano ni mu bazungu nta muntu uri buhakekae nta muntu uri buhagerae ,
personally i thought so . therefore , i would put them in the bedrooms and under the beds . ||| nnjyae rero nkaumva ko aribyo bose nkabasunika mu byumba no munsi y' igitanda twebwe tuguma muri korodori nibaza bakatusanga muri korodori ntibari bushakae gusaka .
then us , we remained in the colidor thinking that , "@ if they find us in the colidor they would n't bather to check . @" therefore , i asked him to get out , "@ if they find you outside , they will not have a chance to enter because if they enter they will search around the house . @" i explained to him . ||| nramubwira ngo sohoka vuba vuba ugenda nugera hanze biratuma bataza kuza kuko nibinjira hano baradusaka ,
finally , he got out and when he reached out there , he told them that he was sick ; truly he was sick . therefore , they told him that , "@ let us go . @" ||| arasohoka ageze hano arababwira ngo nrarwaye koko yaranarwaye malariya ngo vayo tuzamukae .
as they had reached in front , they said , "@ in this home there are traitors ! @" ||| bageze haruguru hariya bati hano muri uru rugo harimo ibyitso ,
but one of them said , "@ do n't search them now . let 's first go up to the end . @" he said so because the inkotanyi had already captured that area of remera at the stedium . and fortunately they did n't come home . ||| noneho umwe arababwira ngo mubae muretse gusaka tubanzae tugende tukomezae tugerae haruguru kubera ko inkotanyi zari zimaze kufata hariya kuri sitade bituma batagera ahangaha ,
they looked scared and when they reached in front at the juction of the roads , they started saying , "@ among us they are traitors and suddenely the shootings from the inkotanyi increased . ||| bari bafite ikintu cy' ubwoba barashorera bageze haruguru gato hariya imihanda ihurair batangira kuvuga ngo muri twebwe harimo ibyitso .
therefore , they went back and said that they should ensure security right from their homes . ||| noneho amasasu y' inkotanyi aba menshi bituma bakata baravuga ngo non musubirae mu ngo zanyu mucungire umutekano hariya tuzabireba bagaruka gutyo ,
"@ about that home , we shall see it later . @" they said . that is how they left without searching our home . and , as he had just entered in the house , they throw a grenade to our house ; it landed on the roof , however no body was hurt ; it affected the roof only ; the roof split into pieces . ||| igihe akainjira hano nibwo tuumvaishe batuteye gerenade ikubita hano hejuru y' ibati ariko ntiyagira umuntu ikomeretsa amabati niyo yashwanyutse .
the following morning ... on friday we fled . ||| bwarakeye rero ku wa gatanu turagenda turahunga ,
we saw very many people fleeing therefore ; we also decided to join them . ||| tubonye abantu bose bari hanze bamanuka hakurya hariya tubona barahita mu nzira ntawe tufata icyemezo cyo kugenda ,
we were with our neighbours ; i was with my husband , my five children and one of them was a one year and two months old baby and my brother . ||| hano ubwo turi hamwe n' abaturanyi bacu nri hamwe n' umugabo wanjye n' abana banjye batanu , nfitemo n' uruhinja rw' umwaka n' amezi abiri na musaza wanjye umwe .
we went and reached those ends of rubirizi , where we found other people and joined them . we continued together up to butare . we reached in burundi on the 05th may 1994 . ||| turagenda tugera za rubirizi , niho tubashije kusanga abandi bantu turakomeza turinda tugera i butare , tugeze i burunri ku itariki 05/05/1994 .
however it is a long story about the experience in burundi . ||| ariko n' inkuru ndende kugera i burunri ni birebire ,
therefore , we came back and reached here on the 16th july , 1994 . when i left burundi , it was a few days after the inkotanyi had captured kigali . ||| noneho mu kugaruka hano ngeze aha ku itariki 16/07/1994 nvuye i burunri , kigali imaze iminsi ifashwae nibwo tuhise tugera aha ,
therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind . ||| nza nihuta n' imfunguzo nyine nvuga nti biibuze ngiye kureba n' imyenda ntahae n' imyenda n' iki ,
but i found when this part was demolished . even the other house of ours was demolished . ||| nibwo nsanze hano hashenye n' iriya nzu yacu yo haruguru ishenye .
after they took off the car , they saw a pit hole , where water from bathrooms used to flow . ||| noneho bamaze kukuramo imodoka , basanga harimo icyobo kijyaagamo amazi yo muri dushe kiri puis perdu ,
then they said that it was dug for the hutus so , they dicided to bury there the tutsis . ||| icyo cyobo rero batangira kuvuga ngo turi kurundamo ngo turi turakicukuraiye abahutu , ku buryo bahise bafata icyemezo cyo kurundamo abatutsi bose baishwe .
they could take their clothes off and kill them in a way that , one could n't identify them after the war . ||| barabazanaaga ngo bakabageza aha bakabambura imyenda bamara kubambura imyenda bakabajugunyamo , noneho bakabica ku buryo utashoboraaga kubatandukanya nyuma y' intambara .
there is a certain lady who had sought refuge in this area ; she was dumped in that pit yet she was pregnant . she had eight months pregnance . ||| ubwo hatawemo umudamu umwe uri ufite inda nk' amezi umunani uri uhungiye muri iyi karaitaiye ,
we never knew their names or where they were coming from . ||| abo bantu ntitubazi amazina ntituzi aho baturutse ,
the interahamwe dumped her in the pit where she spent five days agonizing before dying . later a certain man who was my neighbour ; he lived in the house close to ours . he got a very big stone and threw it to her in the pit and killed her finally . ||| baramuzanye ngo bamutamo amaramo iminsi nk' itatu ataka atapfuye ku buryo umugabo yaratuye mu nzu iri hano hirya tuturanye aho mu rugo rwo hirya yafashe ikintu k' ikibuye aka kimutaho hejuru akapfa
after some time we wanted to exhume their remains for proper reburial . ||| noneho nyuma yo kutaburura tugeze igihe cyo kutaburura , tumaze kusaan hano tuifashaishije minisitere ya affaire social ngo batufashe kuvanamo abantu ,
after reconstructing our house , we asked the ministry of social affairs to help us in the act of exhuming and reburying those remains of people . however , they seemed not to consider that as an agent issue yet we could n't continue living in someone 's house . ||| ariko barabirangarana ntibatufasha tubona tutakomeza kuba ahantu mu nzu tukodesheje tucumbitsemo ,
a certain relative had sheltered us but we did n't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house . ||| hari umuvandimwe uri utucumbikiye kukomeza kucumbika kandi tufite inzu yacu .
we came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there . ||| tufata icyemezo cyo kuza nubwo bari barimo ,
we would consol on ourselves that , "@ after all they are our people , we can live in the house while they are still there . there is no problem . @" ||| ariko turavuga tuti ngo ibyaribyo byose ni abacu ntawareka kubaan nabo nta kibazo ,
we started living in our house and four years later ... in 1998 that is when in the name kicuciro district there was a decision to exhume and rebury all the remains of people who lived in this area . ||| turaza tubamo hashize imyaka ine ubwo ni 1998 , nibwo mu rwego rwa komini yacu ya kicukiro bafashe umwanzuro cyo kutaburura abantu bose bari baguye muri iyi karaitaiye ,
then , they came to our home too . ||| baza rero hano ,
we first found about four skulls but when we scooped deeper , more fifty @-@ nine bodies were found , which still had fresh . ||| twarataburuye harimo tuvanyemo ututawe nka tune turi turabaye decompose . ariko tumaze kugera munsi tubonyemo bavanyemo imirambo mirongo itatu n' icyenda ariko yo ikifite umubiri ,
and , one could easily identify that woman who was pregnant ; she still had braids and nails . ||| uwo mudamu uri utwite ubashaaga kumubona afite inweri afite inzara ,
she even had fresh and one could see that she was pregnant although her belly was deformed . ||| umubiri ukiriho unabona n' inda yarahombaanye ubona koko ko yari atwite ,
we found children 's remains inside , men and women . ||| tuvanyemo abana , tuvanyemo abagabo n' abagore ,
one could tell women from their hair ; they still had hair . ||| abagore bo ahanini ubibiirawaga n' imisatsi kuberako ahanini bo bari bakiyifite .
however , we could n't tell who was who ; most people from this area , who lost their beloved ones , came here to see if they would find them . ||| ariko ntago tubashije kubamenya , abantu bose baje aho uwunvaaga yarabuze umuntu muri karaitaiye yaraje areba hano ,
the worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people 's death could n't tell us the names of people who died there . ||| ikibabaje rero n' uko ababirebaaga banzae kutubwira abantu bahaicaiyew abo aribo ,
among them , they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas . ||| kuko harimo abo muri karaitaiye hari abaturutse kure ,
however , the people who witnessed them the day they were killed could n't tell us who they were . ||| ariko ntibashobora kutubwira .
we even tried to contact my neighbour ( our houses are next to each other ) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim 's remains . ||| tugerageje no kureba umuturanyi ahangaha uwo tufatanyaije urugo , we yanze n' umunsi wo kutaburura yanze kugera aha ,
he stood in his home and could peep through his fencing ; he did n't want to come here . ||| yahagaze iwe kusa akajya arebair mu miyenzi ntatinyukae kuhagera .
it is hard to know the people who died here . ||| ntinzi rero ukuntu kugira ngo umuntu amenye abantu ,
up to now he can not tell you the truth ; he says that he saw the interahawe so and so passing by . ||| uko bizagenda n' ubu ntakubwira aravuga ngo n' interahamwe nbonye kanaka na kanaka kusa aribo bahahita ,
people 's remains are everywhere ; just in front here , there are remains , even in our gardens they are others . there is a time we wanted to dig in our garden but as one would dig in the soil , could fine a skull . ||| ukaumva ariko abantu niho barunze abantu igihe cyose n' ahangaha tuhinga hano muri jardin tutangiye kujya tushaka kubakararair biriya biti ukubita isuka ukasanga umutwe ,
in fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here . ||| kuburyo mbese tubanje kubanza kuhahamukair hano kubera ibintu tuhasanze .
i guess that it all i can say about that pit . ||| nraumva aricyo nvuga kuri icyo cyobo ,
but i left all the weapons they used to kill them in the pit . ||| icyakora nyuma yaho ibyo babaicishije nbigumaishijemo nk' ibintu by' ibyuma by' ibishasi by' imodoka ,
knives , the car chassis , stones ... all those weapons were stained with blood . ||| ibibuye ubonaaga hauzuyemo amaraso nraongera nsubizamo igitaka turahataba turahaihorera ariko ntikiuzuye neza ,
therefore , we just buried them in the pit although we never covered it completely . ||| turahareka .
as you said that it was the interahamwe who were led by aloys , who did all those deeds . which kind of person was aloys ? and , how many interahamwe ( militias ) came here ? ||| mu maze kutubwira ko hano hakozwe n' interahamwe z' aloys ese uwo aloys yari muntu ki ? ese hano haje interahamwe zingana iki ?
aloys was the president of the interahamwes . his full names were aloys ngirabatware . ||| aloys yari perezida w' interahamwe yitwaaga aloys ngirabatware ,
he was an origin of gisenyi and closely related to the family of the ex @-@ president ; he had married mbonabaryi 's daughter . ||| akaba yarakomokaaga i gisenyi , akaba ari umuntu wo mu kazu kuko yari yarashatse umukobwa wa mbonabaryi .
mbonabaryi noel was habyarimana 's ( ex @-@ president ) brother @-@ in @-@ law . ||| mbonabaryi noel yari muramu wa habyarimana ,
he was the head of all the interahamwe of this area . ||| uwo nguwo niwe uri ufite umutwe w' interahamwe zose z' ahangaha .
additional to that , after the genocide , in his house people found there bags of guns , bullets , corespondance documents , lists of people who were supposed to be killed , lists of interahamwe ... there were so many things . ||| ubundi ikindi nkaongeraho nbabwira ko iwe nyuma y' intambara hasanzwe amasanduku y' imbunda , hasanzwe amasanduku y' amasasu , hasanzwe amadokima ( documents ) , hariyo za corresondance ,
but people who seized his properties burnt some of the things ; they never knew the value of those things . ||| hari amalisiti y' abagomba kuicwa , hari amalisiti y' interahamwe , hari ibintu byinshi biri bihari . ababohoje nk' iwe bimwe barabitwitse ,
i just got a few of the information on small papers and the little information i got , was from some body from that home who had gathered them and called me . ||| ntibamenya valeur yabyo nadukeya nbashije kukurayo ni udupapuro nbashije kukurayo udupapuro duke nbashije kuvanayo nutwo umuntu waho yarunze kusa wahabohoje araturunda arabwira ngo hariya habamo ibintu abwira ibyahabereye ,
he told me abiout what took place there and so i rushed for the remaining information and brought it here . ||| mpita ngenda nrazitoragura nrazizana .
could you please tell us your name ? ||| ushobora kutubwira amazina yanyu ?
my name is murekatete serafina , before the war , i mean during the war i was staying here in this cell , before it was known as gasharu ‘ ya kabiri ’ ( gasharu 2 ) but know it is kagina , kicukiro sector , kicukiro district . ||| njyewe nitwa murekatete serafina , nkaba mbere y' intambara mu ntiambara nri ntuye hano mu kagali , mbere kari gasharu ya kabiri ariko ubu ni kagina , umurenge wa kicukiro ,
i was staying at my uncle 's place and when the war started , we fled , got out of the house we were staying in and went to another that was close by , and then the interahamwes came and made us walk , they brought us and my uncle was killed in a building that is close by . ||| akarere ka kicukiro . nbaga kwa marume noneho intambara ibaye , turahunga tuva mu nzu tubagamo turahunga tujya mu yinri iri hirya yayo , noneho interahamwe ziraza zihita zitushorera ziratuzana marume bamwicira kuri etaje iri hirya hano .
they brought us , they killed some people who were with us , they were more than seven . ||| baratuzana abandi turi kumwe babicira hano nraumva bararengaaga barindwi .
after killing them i escaped them , i passed between houses that are here nearby , i reached the dusty road , then i was raped by more than ten interahamwe , after raping me they spent the night with me , the next day i left and went back to my neighbourhood [ closer to where i was staying ] . ||| bamaze kubica ubwo njyae nhise nbacika , nyura hagati y' amazu hirya aha ngera ku muhanda wa hano hepfo w' igitaka ubwo interahamwe zarengaaga nk' icumi , zahise zimbohoza zimaze kumbohoza ziranraraan buracya nragenda nsubira hepfo y' aho tubaga .
did you say that seven people died here ? ||| ahangaha mwatubwiye ko haguye abantu barenga barindwi .
more than seven people died here . ||| haguye abantu barenga barindwi .
where were they killed ? ||| babiciye hehe ?
they were interahamwe , they were no soldiers among them , they were interahamwe with guns others had tools . ||| bari interahamwe , nta basirikare barimo , bari interahamwe zari zifite imbunda . abandi bari bafite ibyuma .
how many were they ? ||| bageraaga nko kuri bangahe ?
they were like ten , they are the ones who made us walk . ||| bageraaga nko kw' icumi , nibo batushoreye mbese .
are those the only things they used to kill them , they killed them with guns ? ||| ni nabyo babaicishije kusa , babaicishije imbunda ?
they shot them all , they shot them . ||| barabarashe bose , barabarashe .
where did they shoot them from ? ||| babarasaiye hehe ?
they shot them from here in front of the bus stop sign , here at the bus stop sign , at the roadside . ||| babarasaiye ahangaha inberae ku cyapa , aha ku cyapa cya taxi ku muhanda .
we can see that it is at the road side , when you pass here do you tend to remember ? ||| hano hantu turabona ko ari ku muhanda , iyo muhaciye cyangwa muhanyuze mwigendera , murabiibuka ?
yeah , i would really like them to , personally i would like everyone to , even though it is at the roadside to be fenced because bad things happened at the place during the genocide , people died from here , personally therefore i feel everyone should remember this place because of the bad things that took place here . ||| yeee , nrabiifuza , njyewe ku bwanjye nifuzako abantu bose , nubwo bigaragara ko ari ku muhanda bahasudirair ko ariko habereye ibintu bibi muri jenoside , abantu barahaguye . ku bwanjye rero numva ko umuntu wese yahaibuka kubera ibyo bibi bihabereye .
people who were buried here during the war , where were they put afterward ? ||| abantu bashyinguwe hano mu ntiambara buno bajyanawe hehe ?
we reburied some and took them to nyanza , we managed to take my uncle where we originate from . ||| bamwe twarabataburuye tubajyana i nyanza , abo ba marume tubashije kubajyana iwacu aho tuvuka .
serafina my name is murekatete serafina , i was 26 years old during the war , interahamwe at that time walked us to this house where they raped us , i was together with other girls , we were staying nearby , they used to bring people when they are going to kill and kill them from here , just behind here there was a fence and even houses , you can clearly see that there is a farm , but before there were houses . 3 people were killed from here . ||| nitwa murekatete serafina , nri nfite imyaka 26 mu ntiambara , interahamwe icyo kihae zaratuzamuzakanye zitujyana muri iyi nzu , ari naho zambohoreje hamwe n' abandi bakobwa turi kumwe . hanyuma ubwo muri iyi nzu tubagamo hirya aha , bagiye batunyuzaho abantu bagiye kuica babicira hano , aha inyuma yanjye hari urugo hari n' amazu , ngira ngo murabona ko hari umurima ariko mbere hari amazu . bahaiciye abantu batatu .
could you tell us what age group , gender , these people were ? ||| mushobora kutubwira abo bantu bari bantu cyi ?
were they children or men ? ||| bari abana , bari abagabo ?
one was a man with a family , the other one was an old man but not very elderly , the other was also a man . ||| umwe yari umugabo wubaatse , undi yari umusaza ariko utakuze cyane , undi nawe yari umugabo .
who killed them ? ||| baishwe n' abantu ki ?
interahamwe ? or soldiers ? ||| interahamwe cyangwa abasirikare ?
they were killed by interahamwe , because soldiers were rarely here , they were in republican guard barracks , others were on the other side at majyambere 's place , this place was mostly occupied by many interahamwe , who walked the peope who were going to be killed . ||| baishwe n' interahamwe kubera ko abasirikare bo ntago bari bakunze kuba bari hano , bari hakurya muri camp gp , abandi bari hirya hariya kwa majyambere hano hari haiganje interahamwe nyinshi cyane . ku buryo arizo zabazamukaanaga zibatunyuraanho hariya hirya aho turi turi .
can you please tell us the number of the people who came for you , approximate if you remember ? ||| ushobora kutubwira umubare w' abantu baje kubafata uko banganaaga , ugereranyaije niba mukibiibuka ?
the number of interahamwe , the ones who worked down the road , are the same ones who worked even here , they were very many , they would make a big squad . ||| umubare w' interahamwe , izakoraaga hepfo hariya tubanje , ni nazo zakomeje kukora na hano kuko zari zimawe , zari nyinshi rwose ku buryo zakabaga igitero ukabona ari nyinshi .
one can see that people lived here , were these people killed ? ||| hanyuma uru rugo uhita ubona ko habaaga abantu , abantu ba hano barabaishe ?
was the house destroyed at that time ? ||| ni nabwo bahasenyae icyo kihae ?
no , they were not killed , the houses were old and i think they broke down , but the owner is still alive . ||| oya , ntago babaishe kubera ko inzu zari iz' umuntu ubungubu zari zishaje ubungubu ngirae ngo n' uko zasenyutse , ariko nyirazo arahari .
and were those destroyed during the war ? ||| izi nazo bazisenyae mu ntiambara ?
no , they broke down , because of poor maintenance , and caring less i think that is why they broke down ||| oya , zarishenye kubera kuzifata nabi , cyangwa se no kutabiitaho banza ariyo mpamvu zasenyutse .
bad things happened in this place , people were killed from here , when you reach here after the genocide what does it mean to you ? ||| aha hantu nraumva harabereye ibintu bitari byiza , haricaiyew abantu , iyo mwebwe muhageze ubungubu nyuma ya jenoside hababwira iki ?
i rarely pass here , but nearby there is a short cut when i pass there , i always remember that we were once here , even in my conversations am always talking about it because i will never forget , we saw things that were not good , scary and sad things , and that is why i can not forget no matter what . ||| kubera ko , ntago nkunze kuhagera , kuhahita , ariko hirya aha hari akayira iyo mpahise mpita nibuka ko hano turi tuhari no mubyo nganira nba nbivuga kuko ntazabiibagirwa , kuko tuhaboneye ibintu bitari byiza kandi ibintu biteye ubwoba n' agahinda , ku buryo rero ntashobora kubiibagirwa niyo bigenda kutae .
people who were killed from here , where are they buried now ? ||| abantu bicaiyew ahangaha ubu bari hehe ?
what happened after the genocide ? ||| bigenze kutae nyuma ya jenoside ?
when we came back from refuge we arrived first because we had fled to indera ( it 's near ) , we knew where they had been buried , we exhumed them , we took some to nyanza but one man named raphael rwamukwaya who was staying nearby , his family , his wife was still alive and asked to bury him in her house , but after some time his wife died , the other day the authorities said that no body should be left in houses , we exhumed him and took him and reburied him in respect in gisozi . ||| nyuma tuhungutse kuko tuhungiye i nrera tuje mbere , turi tuzi aho babashyinguye twarabataburuje , bamwe tubajyana i nyanza hamwe n' abandi ariko umugabo umwe witwaga raphal rwamukwaya yari atuye hariya hirya umuryango we umugore we yari akiriho , amusaba ko yamushyingura mu nzu ye . ariko nyuma umudamu we yaje kupfa , apfuye ejo bunri igihe ubuyobozi buvugaaga ko nta bantu bagomba kuhama mu nzu tumukuyemo tumujyana ku mushyingura ku gisozi .
down the road at the bus stop sign , seven people were killed from there , they were killed by interahamwe , those interahamwe killed them using guns , they buried them below the tarmac road , there was a house before but it is now empty land , there is a tailor shop but one can clearly see that there was an empty land . ||| hano hepfo ku muhanda ku cyapa cya taxi haicaiyew abantu barenga barindwi , baishwe n' interahamwe , izo nterahamwe zabaicishije imbunda , babatabaye munsi y' umuhanda wa kaburimbo , mbere hari inzu ariko ubu hari ikibanza , hari na atelier yo kusudira ariko bigaragara ko mbere hari hari ikibanza .
how were those seven people killed ? ||| abo bantu barindwi baishwe batae ?
those people were shot , they were shot since many had guns , they were killed by more than ten interahamwe . ||| abo bantu barabarashe , barabarashe kubera ko benshi bari bafite imbunda . baishwe n' interahamwe zarengaaga nk' icumi .
that place is at the roadside , when you pass the place walking or in a bus what do you feel ? ||| ubu hariya hantu mwebwe ko ari ku muhanda , iyo muhanyuze mugenda , wenda muri nko muri taxi mwumva mumeze mutae ?
when we pass here , having stayed here for a long time , we still like passing here , when we reach here i emmediatly ... especially when i am with someone i emmediatly tell them that i lost my relatives , friends and parents here , and thus i can never forget . ||| iyo tuhaciye kubera ko tunahabaye igihe kirekire , n' ubu akaba ariho tukunda kunyura iyo tuhageze mpita cyane cyane iyo nrikaumawe n' umuntu mpita mubwira ngo aha hantu haguye abavandimwe , inshuti n' ababyeyi . ku buryo rero ntashobora kubiibagirwa .
personally do you feel that other people should also know about it even though it happened at the roadside ? ||| kuri wowe wunva ko n' abandi bantu bamenya nubwo bwose bibereye ku muhanda ?
we are here at the rubirizi diary , byimana cell , niboye sector in kicukiro district . ||| aha turi n' i rubirizi , turi ku ikaragiro rya rubirizi riherereye mu kagali ka biimaan , umurenge wa niboye , mu karerae ka kicukiro .
my name is justin nzaramba and i am 52 years old . ||| ubundi njyewe nitwa nzaramba justin nfite imyaka mirongo itanu n' ibiri ( 52 ) ,
i am married and i have children . ||| nfite umugore n' abana ,
i live here in byimana . ||| ntuye hano muri aka kagali ka biimaan .
i am here at rubirizi , a site of the killing of innocent people in 1994 . ||| tukaba nkaba ndi hano mu rubirizi ahantu haguye inzirakarengane muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 1994 ) ,
this place has a long story . ||| hakaba hari ukuntu rero aho hantu hari amateka maremare ,
it still has n't been possible to bury the victims who were killed during the 1994 war . ||| aho hantu ni ahantu hananiraanye kushyingura abantu bahaguye mu ntiambara yo muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 1994 ) ariko haguyemo abantu batagira ingano haguyemo abantu benshi .
in fact , thousands of people were killed here . ||| abantu bava ku mirenge itandukanye kicukiro , kagarama ,
the victims were from different districts such as kicukiro , kanombe , sectors such as kagarama , kabeza , samuduha ... it 's been a year that the remains of these victims are supposed to have been buried but we have n't been able to do anything because of this pit . ||| umurenge wa kanombe , ndetse n' utugari baita kabaeza ndetse na samuduha . ubwo rero aha hantu umwaka uba ushize nkuko abantu bagomba kushyinguraw bazize itsembabwoko , aha hantu haratunaniye uru rwobo ruratunaniye ,
we tried with the people of kicukiro , kanombe , kagarama , kabeza , samuduha ... but were unable to . ||| tufatanyaije n' abaturage ba kicukiro , na kanombe , na samuduha , na kagarama turagerageza birananiraan .
over 3,000 people lost their lives here . ||| kuko aha hantu haguye abantu barenga ibihumbi barenga nk' ibihumbi nka bitatu ,
maybe you will ask @: where did these people come from ? ||| mwambaza ngo bavaaga hehe ?
they were people who fled from their homes , some were killed in their homes . ||| n' abantu babaga barahunze , barahunze ingo zabo babasangamo bakabica ,
others were found out in the bush near the rubirizi farm [ there were many cows and a very wide bush ] and then the killers used to bring them here to kill them . ||| abandi bakabavumbura mu bihuru ahongaho muri ferme ya rubirizi dore ko hari inka nyinshi hari n' ibihuru . bakaza bakabicira ahangaha ,
they also brought some from the house of the then counselor named biziyaremye , after the latter had kidnapped them from their homes . those are the news that ... the victims were transported in pick ups and taken to the interahamwes who were at rubirizi . ||| abandi ba kabiri babavanaaga iwabo mu ngo babavanaaga ku mugabo uri umukonseye witwaga biziyaremye niko amakuru ampa barabazanaaga bakabafata mu modoka muri za kamyoneti ,
they used to throw people into a big pit after killing them . ||| bakaza bakabashyira interahamwe mu rubirizi bakabica bakabanaaga mu cyobo muri iki cyobo .
this pit is very deep . it was dug in order for dead cows to be thrown there . ||| ni kirekire cyane iki bari barakiteganyairije kushyiramo inka zapfuye ,
it is about 40 meters long and it was n't dug the usual way . ||| ni kirekire cyane ku buryo kifite nka metero nka mirongo ine ( 40 m ) z' ubujyakuzimu , ku buryo ntago ari bantu bakicukuye bwa buryo busanzwe ,
it is so deep that it has n't possible to exhume the bodies of the victims that are inside . ||| ni ikintu kirekire cyane ku buryo birananiraanye kugira ngo bakivanaemo abo bantu .
we tried digging but we were told they poured acid into it . ||| turagerageje rero tugerageje kukicukura ariko bavuga ko bamennyemo za acide ,
there are even remains of cows inside ! ||| bamennyemo harimo inka nyinshi ,
we tried in vain and the ministry told us we shall build a memorial site there . ||| mbega ku buryo ministere yatubwiye y' uko ubwo kinaniraanye tuzahashyira urwibutso ,
that way , we will be able to visit the place every year after it 's been built . ||| tuzakiubakair tukazakiibukairho , tukajya tuza kuhaibukair hafi buri mwaka ariko hakoze neza .
damascene rurangirwa is a man whose parents had been thrown into this pit . ||| hari umugabo witwa rurangiraw damascene ku buryo n' ababyeyi be bose ariho babashyize ,
he had tried to make it look better so people can show a bit of respect towards the place . he had realized that there was no other way of exhuming the corpses . he got it concreted . ||| yari yaragerageje ku kisukura neza kukikora neza ngo bazajyae bakiubaha kuko yabonaaga nta bunri buryo buhari bwo kuvanamo abo bantu ,
later on , the ministry lent us a machine and people from kicukiro and kanombe dug it up , but they were unable to go over 8 meters because of the gas and the cows remnant ... they were at least able to exhume the remains of 8 people that they buried in respect with other bones . ||| ahitamo kuki betona ariko nyuma ministere itutije imashini bafatanyaije n' akarere ka kicukiro na kanombe baragerageza bageze nko muri metero umunani birananiraan . ku buryo harimo za gaz n' ibindi bintu n' inka bari baranazaemo , icyakora tubashije kubonamo abantu nka batandatu kusa amagufwa yabo bagiye kuyashyingura hamwe n' abandi .
how were these people killed ? ||| abantu bicirwaaga hano baicwaaga mu buhae buryo ?
were they shot dead ? ||| barabarasaaga ?
did the perpetrators throw them alive into the pit ? ||| babazaanaga ari bazima bakabanaagamo ?
the perpetrators brought them alive to the pit , killed them and then threw them in . ||| abantu babazaanaga ari bazima bakabicira uruhande rw' uru rwobo hanyuma bakabanaagamo ,
some were even thrown in alive ! ||| harimo n' abo banazaemo ari bazima ,
for example , my older brother was thrown in alive . he spent 2 days agonizing and begging for drinking water ! ||| njyewe nzi nka mukuru wanjye bamunazemo ari muzima yamazemo iminsi nk' ibiri arimo kuvuga ngo bamuhae amazi ngo bamuhae amazi ,
the perpetrators cut up his arm and threw him in mocking him and saying he should bury himself . ||| bamaze kumuca akaboko bamunagamo ari muzima baramubwira ngo niyihambe .
what about the others ? did they shoot them or did they use clubs to kill them ? ||| abandi bararasawaga ? baicishawaga amahiri ?
here , most of the people were killed with machetes . ||| hano akenshi n' imipanga ,
only those who tried escaping were shot . the rest were killed with machetes and clubs or even thrown into the pit alive ! people were subjected to horrible deaths here and it was n't just here because there were other pits . ||| n' imipanga cyane cyane harasawaga nk' uwageragezaga wenda kuiruka , ariko n' imipanga ahanini n' impiri abandi bakabanaagamo ari bazima hano bapfuye urupfu rubi cyane .
this pit was called ‘ urwabayanga ’ and many cows were thrown in . ||| ariko ntago ari aha honyine hari n' ibindi byobo barimo ariko uru nirwo barwitaga urwabayanga ,
i believe you saw the cows that were here . they are from a very productive race ... we were n't able to do anything about it ! ||| kubera ko ni ahantu bashyiraagamo inka nyinshi cyane kandi murabona ko inka z' ahangaha zari inzungu zari inka ziriya za kijyambere ,
there are many people here . ||| ku buryo zananiraanye hano harimo abantu benshi cyane .
about how many people were thrown in here ? ||| ugereranyaije haba haratawemo nk' abantu bangana iki ?
the night he died . ||| akimara kupfa iryo joro ,
there were people who had already sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro . ||| ku buryo bamwe bari bamaze n' iminsi bahungiye muri eto ,
it had started way before ! people had been displaced since march 1994 . then , they 'd sought refuge in parishes . ||| biri biratangiye kera abantu bari baratangiye kuhunga mbere mu byo mu kwezi kwa gatatu 94 . abantu bamwe bari barahungiye ku ma paruwasi ,
it 's only from the 7th of april that they fled to eto . ||| kuva ku itariki ya karindwi nibwo abantu batangiye kuhungira muri eto ,
the ones who were lucky to survive the atrocities at eto went to nyanza . when they got to nyanza , they were killed . ||| ariko muri eto abashoboye kuva muri eto bageze i nyanza nabo barabica ,
very few survived . there were about 5,000 people at eto . ||| harokotse bake cyane kandi muri eto harimo abantu bageze nko ku bihumbi nka bitanu .
the ones you see are those who were hiding in the hills of gahanga . some were killed and others came back . when the interahamwes got to know that these people were going to come back here , they trapped them . ||| aba ni abashoboye kuva muri iyi misozi bajya za kahanga baraongera nanone bamwe barabica abandi baragaruka , baziko bagarutse babatangirair ahangaha ,
it was all the interahamwes from all the hills around here . ||| babatangirair ahangaha bose interahamwe zari ziri kuri iriya misozi yose zabazengurutse .
i believe that as a survivor and as somebody who lives in this cell of byimana , you know something about the people who were dumping people into the pits . ||| ibyaribyo byose nk' umuntu utuye muri aka kagali ka biimaan , kandi ukaba uri umwe mubaba bararokotse ngira ngo ufite icyo uzi ku bantu bataagamo abantu ahangaha ,
i 'd like you to tell us about them if possible . ||| ntinzi niba utubwira mu magambo makeya kubierekeye abo bantu ?
among the most popular interahamwes were gerard karanganwa , kabagabo , bizimungu , idi and kagarara . ||| inaha hari interahamwe zizwi cyane , hari interahamwe hari uwo baitaaga gerard karangaanw , hari abo baitaaga ba kabagabo , hari abo baitaaga ba bizimungu ,
in fact , there were many interahamwes but most of them did n't come back . ||| hari abo baitaaga ba idi , hari abo baitaaga ba kakarara . mbega hano hari interahamwe nyinshi cyane , inyinshi ntago zagarutse ,
i think they are still in congo . ||| abenshi ntibagarutse ndacyeka bakiiri muri congo .
all those interahamwes disappeared but maybe there 's still a chance with the gacaca jurisdictions . ||| abo bose barababuze ,
we will continue to get more information . i did n't personally see the people i told you about as i had sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro . ||| ariko nitugair amahirwe ahari gacaca zikazaba tuzakomeza tubaririze kuko nnjyae abo bantu nrabaumvise kuko njyae nhungiye hariya hafi kuri eto nnjyae nnyuze mu mirambo yo muri eto ,
i crossed over dead bodies ... but some people still survived . ||| ariko hari abantu bamwe bagiye basigara kuburyo izo nterahamwe zafatanyaije n' abaitwaaga ngo ni abazuru bavaaga za kanombe ,
i heard that those interahamwes were working in association with those of kanombe who were called the ‘ zulus ’ because all these hills ... maybe it 's because i am the one giving you this testimony but there are other people who know better than i do and who even know those interahamwes . ||| kuko iyi misozi yose ndetse nuko arinjyae utanga ubuhamya njyenyine ariko hari abandi benshi babizi bazi nizo nterahamwe .
we dug this pit ... most of the victims were from neighbouring sectors . those people know them and they know they threw them into this pit ! ||| tuza kucukura uru rwobo abenshi bari abaturage bo muri iyi misozi itukikije yose , abenshi barabazi bazi n' abagiye babanaaga ahangaha .
but the interahamwes such as kabagabo , karanganwa gerard , such as ... are known because they lived here in byimana ! ||| ariko cyane cyane abo nbabwiye ba bizimungu , ba kabagabo , abaitwaaga ba karangaanw gerard ,
i suppose that the interahamwes from kanombe are known by the people from kanombe . ||| abaitwa ... ibyo aribyo byose izo nterahamwe zirazwi bari batuye kuri uyu musozi wa biimaan aba kanombe bo bazwi nabo bahaturiye hariya .
over 2,000 people were killed at this pit and nearby . you can see it , some of them have n't even been properly buried yet . ||| ariko ku buryo hano hapfairiye abantu barenze nk' ibihumbi nka bibiri , abo muri uru rwobo n' aha iruhande barahari mushobora kuza mukabareba hari n' abatarashyingurwa ,
you will see their remains as time goes . ||| muraza kubona ibisigazwa byabo tugenda tubibona buhoro buhoro .
we 're planning to build this place so that we can come and commemorate every year . ||| hano bakazahakora neza tukazahaubaka mu nyuma buri mwaka ntawe tukazajya tuza kuhaibukair abacu .
they were killed here in rubirizi . there was even a veterinary who was hiding with my brother . we will ask him because he saw him being taken away to be killed . ||| bacibiciye hano mu rubirizi kuko nzi hari umugabo nzi w' umuveterineri uri wihishanye na mukuru wanjye hano nk' ubu tuzamubaza kuko yaramubonaaga bamutwaye baje kumwicira ahangaha .
are you talking about damascene ? ||| ni damascene ?
no , he is called rwagapfizi . ||| oya yitwa rwagapfizi .
rwagapfizi ... ||| rwagapfizi ?
yes , in those houses over there , the houses that belong to the diary . that 's where he was working . ||| muri aya mazu , ayangaya hariya muri laiterie ( ikaragiro ry' amata ) kuko yarahakoraaga .
if we agree that people were brought in pick ups ... were they accompanied by soldiers who shot them afterwards ? ||| ubungubu tuvugaeko abantu benshi bazaaga ahangaha bazaaga mu ma ( pick up ) baje mu camionette bazanye n' abasirikare bakabarasair ahangaha ?
the interahamwes were mixed with soldiers . ||| abasirikare bari bavanze n' interahamwe ,
they all came from kanombe and were armed with grenades , guns , machetes , cudgels ... not the ones you sae , check on the other side . ||| bari bavangavanze abasirikare bavaaga za kanombe kandi bose bari bafite n' imbunda na za gerenade n' imipanga n' impiri byose . ntago ari turiya twonyine ,
there are others there ! yes ! human beings ! ||| dore ziriya n' imbavu n' ibiki n' ukuvuga ko no hasi harimo n' abandi kuko bari ... buriya bariya ni abantu .
do you know a certain ndiramiye ? ||| umuntu witwa ndiramiye ntago ujya umumenya ?
ndiramiye ? ||| ndiramiye .
... ||| ikibazo ntikiumvikana
but i know gacaca will let us know . ||| gacaca bamwe izabatubwira tu ,
there was a big road here ; the killers would put the victims together and whenever they reached a big number , they took them over there . ||| hano hari umuhanda rwose munini n' imihanda yaragaragaraaga neza mbese bamaraaga kuba benshi bakabamanura hariya ,
the victims were already dead by the time they got there . ||| abo nibo bahageraaga bapfuye .
my name is justin nzaramba and i was born here in byimana cell , niboye sector , kicukiro district . ||| nitwa nzaramba justin nkaba nvuka hano mu kagali ka biimaan , umurenge wa niboye , akarere ka kicukiro .
i am 52 years , i am maried and i have children . ||| ndi mu myaka mirongo itanu n' ibiri ( 52 ) , nfite umugore n' abana .
a big number of people were killed here at rubirizi . ||| hano mu rubirizi haguye abantu batagira ingano ku buryo hakiboneka ibisigazwa ,
they were so many that we still find their remains till this day , there are still bones all over . in fact , there were many pits in rubirizi , they served for the feeding of cows . ||| hakiboneka amagufwa aho ariho hose kuko mu rubirizi hari ibyobo binyuraanye bagiye bashyiramo ibiryo by' inka .
however , the people who were hiding in their villages ... i did n't see the ones who were taken from biziyaremye 's house , he was the counsellor . the soldiers used to kidnap them and take them to rubirizi . ||| ariko imyobo miremire cyane ku buryo abantu babavanaaga aho babaga bihishe mu kituragae ariko abenshi nshoboye kumenya nabo bavanye kwa conseiller baitaaga biziyaremye babazaanaga ari ninjoro abantu b' abasirikare ,
among them were our neighbours , most of them were women . ||| ku buryo bazanyemo abantu turi tuturanye abenshi bari biganjemo abakobwa ,
there was a road from kicukiro that passed here , near this put and that went up to samuduha . ||| bakabazana hano muri rubirizi hano . hari umuhanda unyuze hano uvuye hariya za kicukiro ukambukiranya rubirizi ukagera samuduha aha hantu ni mu cyobo hano iruhande niho hanyuze umuhanda .
there were big roads here . the perpetrators were bringing them , killing then and then use a different road to go home since they were so many of them . ||| hari hari imihanda miremire bakabicira ahangaha noneho bakaongera bakazamukair hano hari imihanda myinshi bakazamukair hariya haruguru bakataha ,
they were chasing all over ! ||| bahigaaga hose n' abavaaga ,
they ... there were even trucks that brought corpses here from samuduha . there 's a man called gafaranga who told me that drivers from the minitrap [ ministry of transportation ] put corpses into the trucks and then came to throw them here at rubirizi . ||| hari n' amabeni ( camion ) yajyaaga avana abantu bapfuye hariya i samuduha nabo babazaanaga ahangaha kuko hari umugabo witwa gafaranga yanbwiye yuko abantu bakoraaga muri minitrape bajyaaga bashyira abantu muri bya bimodoka bya minitrape bakaza kubamenamo hano rubirizi .
how were the victims killed ? ||| baicwaaga mu buryo ki ?
oh ! ||| oooh ,
they cut them down into pieces . very few were shot . they mutilated their victims and then got rid of them because they did n't want to see the corpses of their victims near them . ||| barababatemaguraga abo barashe ni bakeya , ntibabarasaaga cyane kuko bafataaga umuntu bakamutema imirambo bangaga yuko iguma ahongaho iwabo ,
however , most of the dead bodies were devoured by dogs . they did n't throw all the corpses into pits , the rest was eaten by dogs . ||| ariko imyinshi n' iyariwe n' imbwa nanone hano . hari iyo batashoboye nibura kushyira muri ibyo byobo abenshi bariwe n' imbwa bapfuye nabi ,
in fact , some people were n't completely killed , they mutilated them and then left them to die of the wounds , after suffering greatly . they died a horrible death . ||| bamwe bapfuye baumva bamwe bapfuye ntago babicaaga burundu barabakomeretsaga kusa bakazaicwa n' ibikomere ,
what happened here is so atrocious ! ||| birababaje cyane ino habereye ibintu bibi cyane nubwo bavuga ibyabereye i nyanza ,
it was terrible even if it 's not spoken about as much as the nyanza and eto @- kicukiro events . there were dreadful scenes of atrocities here at rubirizi ! ||| cyangwa ibyabereye muri za eto hano rubirizi naho habereye ibintu bikomeye cyane ibintu bibi .
very few survived here ; when we consider the number of inhabitants of this sector or of the neighbouring ones , we realized that it 's very low compared to the number of the people who lived here before . most of those who live here today are new . ||| abacitse ku icumu ni bakeya nkubu kubona abantu barokotse muri iyi segiteri cyangwa iyo hakurya ni bake cyane ukurikije ukuntu bari batuye ni bake cyane abenshi ni bashyashya ,
in addition , very few interahamwes are in jail . the rest are probably in congo . ||| kandi abo bantu b' interahamwe abafunzwe ni bake abandi bashobora kuba bari muri congo .
but some did surrender themselves ; the rest are not there anymore ... in fact , mostly the kicukiro and rubirizi inhabitants lost their lives here . ||| icyakora bamwe bigeze kuza bashobora kuirega abandi baranangiye ariko ubirebye hapfuye abantu benshi muri kicukiro no muri rubirizi cyane cyane .
obviously , if there was a big number of victims , that means the perpetrators were many as well . ||| ibyo aribyo byose nubwo uvuga ngo hano haguye abantu benshi ,
i 'd like to ask you if you know some of the people who participated in those acts ... maybe they 're free ... ? ||| biraumvikana ko ibyo aribyo byose abo bantu nabo baishwe n' abantu benshi ngira nkubaze niba hari abantu mwaba muzi baba baragize uruhare muri ibi bintu baba bakihari bakidegembya ahangaha ?
free ... most of them are no longer free . those perpetrators were members of cdr and mrnd [ political parties ] . ||| kwidegembya abenshi ntibakihari cyane cyane abari muri cdr ,
people like idi , kabagabo whom i told you about were driving their cars , looting and looking around for other guys such as bizimungu , kagarara ... they had given themselves nicknames but we know their names and their families are still alive ! ||| abantu bari muri ya parti ya cdr na mrnd nibo babanri nbabwiraaga baitwaaga ba idi , ba kabagabo bari bafite n' ama modoka yabo bagenda bakafata ama modoka nibyo bairirwaaga bakora kusa , kusahura no kuzana abandi bantu abaitwaaga ba bizimungu n' abaitwaaga ba kakarara bari bafite n' andi mazina baiita ariko abenshi barazwi n' imiryango yabo irahari .
