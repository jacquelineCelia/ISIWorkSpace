ibintu bitangiye ... njyewe nvuga ko ibintu bitangiye nkiri muto cyane , ||| i would say it all started when i was still very young .
njyewe nraibuka ko nri ku ishuri kuri primaire ; buri mwaka bajyaaga batubwira ngo tuhagurukae tukahaguruka , bakatubaza ubwoko , ubwo rero tukivuga . ||| i remember how when i was in primary school , they used to tell us to stand every year and then they 'd ask us to tell them about our ethnicity .
ariko nraibuka ko umunsi wa mbere batuhagurutsa ... nraibuka ko umunsi wa mbere batuhagurutsa baravuze ngo abahutu nibahaguruke n' abatutsi nibahaguruke nigaaga muri 3ieme primaire ( umwaka wa gatatu w' amashuri abanza ) nicyo kihae nri nbonye ibyo bintu bitangiye . ariko nraibuka ko ntari nzi n' icyo nri cyo , kuko nrakomeje nraicara . abandi barahagurutse , ||| i remember how the first time they told us to stand up , they told the hutus to stand up and then the tutsis , i was in primary iii and that was the first time i was seeing something like this .
igice cya mbere kirahaguruka njyewe nsigara nicaye . ||| i did n't know what tribe i was and thus i remained seated .

aranbwira ati @: « ese ati wowe ntabwo uziko uri umututsi ? » ntahaguruka , nraibuka ko inshuti zanjye tuiganaaga utwana duto , ||| then i stood up ; i remember how my friends started mocking me saying @: "@ so you 're also tutsi ? @"
twarantsetse turanbwira tuti @: « eh ! nawe burya uri umututsi ? » icyo kihae nibwo ntangiye kumenya ibintu by' amoko . ||| that 's how i states learning things about ethnicity .
nyuma rero ntataha nraibuka ko nhuraiye na papa mu nzira , ||| i later on went home . i remember meeting dad on my way home .
nri nbabaye cyane . nbaza papa nti kuki bagenzi banjye bansetse bakanbwira ko ndi umututsi ? ||| i was very sad and i asked him why my friends had laughed at me telling me i am a tutsi .
nti kuba umututsi n' iki ? ||| "@ what does being tutsi mean ? @"
papa aranbwira ati @: ||| i asked him .
« ntinzi uburyo nkusobanurair ati ni gutyo . » nramubaza nti ese tuba ... nti nsobanurair . papa aranbwira ati @: « ntacyo nkusobanurair , ||| he told me @: "@ i do n't know how to explain that to you ... that 's just the way things are ... @" he told me he would one day explain to me as i needed to know that i was actually tutsi .
ati kuko ugomba kumenya nyine ko uri umututsi nnjyae ni gutyo nbisanze ; » ibintu nk' ibyo ... nyuma rero ntataha ngeze mu rugo nbaza mama , nramusobanuza , mama aranbwira ati @: ||| he said he also found things that way ... when i got home , i asked mother for more explanations .
« mu rwanda hari abo baita abataw , n' abandi baitwa abahutu , ati n' abandi baita abatutsi ati @: ||| she then told me @: "@ in rwanda , there are twas , hutus and tutsis .

ati ugomba kumenya ko uri umututsi . ||| you are tutsi . @"
mama rero niho yatangiye kunsobanurair anbwira yuko ntamenye sogukuru ; ntamenye se , kubera ko hari abantu babi babifata gutyo bakaumva ko umututsi ari umuntu mubi , ||| she went ahead and told me about my grandfather whom i never met . she explained to me that the reason why i did n't meet him was because there were some bad people who believed the tutsi was a bad person .
aranbwira ati ariko ibyo ntabwo aribyo , tuesae turi bamwe ibyo ntibizigerae bikuinjira mu mutawe . ||| she told me it was n't true and we are all the same and i should never believe such a thing .
hanyuma rero birakomeje nyine bakajya batubwira buri mwaka hafi nka buri mwaka bakajya batubwira ngo tuhagurukae , ||| it went on like that and they used to tell us to stand up every year .
tukahaguruka nyuma nza no kubimenyera nkaumva ko atari ikibazo kuba umututsi nrabimenyera . ||| i finally got used to it and stop feeling like being a tutsi was an issue .
nraibuka ko ngeze 4ieme ( umwaka wa kane w' amashuri abanza ) noneho nje kuzaganira na mama , ||| i remember a conversation i had with mom while i was in primary iv .
noneho nramusobanuza ... nramusobanuza , aranbwira ati @: « noneho umaze kumenya ubwenge , ati nkubwiye ko utaigeze umenya sogokuru wawe , ||| i wanted more explanations and she then told me what exactly happened to my grandfather .
ati noneho ngiye kukubwira impamvu . » nibwo yanbwiraaga komuri mirongo itanu n' icyenda ( 1959 ) baje bakatwara papa we ; bakamutwara ari umwana uzi ubwenge kuko mama yanbwiye ko yari afite imyaka nka cumi n' itandatu ( 16 ) . aranbwira ati @: ||| she told me how in 1959 , they came and took her dad , she was 16 and a mature person .
baramutwaye , bamutwaraan n' abo mu muryango we wose . ati @: « niyo mpamvu utajya ubona ko mu muryango w' iwacu nta muntu mukuru urimo , ||| she told me he was taken away together with other members of his family .
baramujyana ati @: njyae mperuka ... » anbwira ko yaherekeje se , bamushyira mu modoka baramuboha , bamaze kumuboha bamushyira mu modoka babapanga hamwe . ||| she told me how she followed him to the car where they tied his hands and put him in with other people .
kuko ngo hari imodoka yapakiraaga , bari bafite ama listes , mama anbwira ko yamuherekeje akamugeza aho imodoka yagendaaga hose , ihagarara muri iyo quartier yabo ifata abantu . ||| she told me she followed that car throughout her neighbourhood as they were picking up everyone whose name was on their list .
anbwira abantu anbwira sogokuru anbwira n' abandi bo mu muryango we . nibwo ntangiye ... bajyanye icyo kihae aranbwira ati @: ||| he told me about other members of her dad 's family who were taken away at that time as well .
« ntabwo nigeze menya uko bigenze , ariko sogokuru wawe yajyanye n' abanyeshuri bigaga mu mashuri makuru icyo kihae , b' abana b' abahutu nibo batubwiye uburyo sogokuru wawe bamwishe . » ||| she told me how they never found out what exactly happened to her father but that he was taken by some hutus secondary school students who told them how he was killed .
anbwira ko babajyanye ngo bakabata mu cyobo kiri mu ruhengeri , ||| she told me they threw them in a pit in ruhengeri but i do n't know the exact location in ruhengeri .
ariko ntabwo nshoboye kumenya mu ruhengeri aho ariho . nyuma rero ubwo haza kugera igihe cyo muri 1990 amashyaka atangiye , ||| then came the multiparty system in 1990 .
iwacu ibintu biza kuba bibi , ||| things went wrong in our area .
ariko ntabwo nhamaze n' igihe iwacu kuko nrahavuye njya i gisenyi niho nbaga mu bantu bo mu muryango wa mama , ||| but i was n't there for long , i moved to gisenyi where i lived with some of mother 's relatives .
kuko mama akomoka i gisenyi . ||| she is from gisenyi .
i gisenyi rero ibintu biri na bibi kuruta iwacu ku kibuye . ||| in gisenyi , things were worse than in kibuye .
ku kibuye wenda abantu ho barenzagaho na gato ariko ku gisenyi ho babishyiraaga ku mugaragaro . ||| maybe in kibuye people acted as though everything was fine , but in gisenyi , they were doing it in the open .
bakatubwira bati @: « igihe kimwe tuzabica , » ||| they used to tell us that they 'd one day kill us .
ariko jyae nkajya numva ko ibyo bintu bitashoboka . ||| but i thought that was impossible .
n' ubwo mama yansobanuraiye ko sogokuru bamwishe kuko ngo yari umututsi ; ngo yajyaaga kutaarama i bwami , ntabwo nigeze numva ko ibyo mama yanbwiye aribyo . ||| mother had explained to me that my grandfather was killed because he was a tutsi , saying he used to go the royal court but i did n't believe that was the reason he was killed .
numvaaga ko sogokuru afite ikindi kintu bamwiciye yaba yarakoze , ||| i felt like maybe there 's something else he did that made them kill him .
ntabwo numvaaga ko kuba umututsi bashoboraaga kuica abantu . ariko muri mirongo cyenda ( 1990 ) i gisenyi bibaye bibi ku buryo noneho ntangiye kubibona , ||| i did n't believe that one could be killed just because they were tutsi .
kuko noneho haicwaaga abagogwe , nkabona ko ibyo aribyo byose ariho bijyana ; ko igihe kimwe nnjyae bizangeraho , cyangwa se n' iyo bitangairho n' abandi bantu banri b' abatutsi . ||| but in 1990 , things were so bad in gisenyi that i started seeing that it was true , the were killing the ‘ abagogwes ’ [ a tutsi clan in the north of rwanda ] ; so i could see where things were heading , i even realized that one day it would probably reach me or any other tutsi .
nraibuka ko nvuye i gisenyi ... ( ararira ) nkajya kureba papa hari hashize n' igihe ntamubona ; ||| i left gisenyi [ she starts crying ... ] and when to see my father after a long time .
hari muri 1992 ngiye kureba papa , hari hashize igihe ntamubona ndi muri famille yo kwa mama . ||| that was in 1992 ... i had n't seen him in a long time as i had been living with my mother 's relatives .
kuko nri nzi ubwenge turaganiriye na papa . ||| i was a grown up and him and i had a serious conversation .
aranbwira ngo njyae nza kumureba ngo kuko ibintu bitangiye kuba nabi aranbwira ati @: ||| he told me to visiting him as things were going to be very bad soon .
« wenda ... mwana wanjye n' ubwo ugiye ntinzi ko wenda tuzaongera kubonaan . » ||| "@ maybe i will never see you again my daughter @" he said while i was about to leave .
nramubwira nti papa nti @: tuzabonaan , ||| i told him @: "@ we will see each other again , dad !
nti urabona ko inkotanyi zatangiye kurwana wenda tuzagira imaan zifatae i gihugu ntacyo bari batutwara . ||| the inkotanyis are fighting now and hopefully they 'll win the war before anything wrong happens to us . @"
nyuma papa rero nongeye kusubira mu rugo ntabwo njyaagayo igihe kinini . nsubiyeyo hashize nk' amezei nk' atanu . ||| i only went back home 5 months later and we would talk about what was going on .
turaganira nganira na basaza banjye uwankurikiraga nmurushaaga igihe gito kuko nmurushaaga umwaka umwe . ||| i talked with my brothers , the one who followed me was only a year younger than me .
edouard aranbwira ati @: « odette ibintu bimeze nabi njyewe nshaka kugenda kubera ko uba i gisenyi , ||| edouard told me @: "@ odette , things are going to be really bad around here and i want to leave .

aranbwira ati @: "@ uzabinkorera ? @" nramubwira nti nzabikukorera , ||| he insisted that i assure him that i was going to do it for him and i promised i 'd do so .
nragenda njya ku gisenyi ngeze i gisenyi hari umudamu utwaraaga abana mu nkotanyi yitwaaga immaculee nramubwira nti immaculee ntashaka ko unfasha i wacu hari abana nti iwacu ibintu bimeze nabi ku kibuye hari abana basaza banjye babiri bankurikira n' abasore none uzanfashe tubahungaishe ; ||| i went back to gisenyi and there was a woman called immaculee . i told her about my 2 young brothers , still strong , who needed to flee the country , i told her i needed her help . she told me she was going to help me do that .
immaculee aranbwira ati nta kibazo nzabikukorera ati ntugirae ikibazo nzabikukorera noneho ubwo edouard nramubwira edouard witegure nsubira iwacu ku kibuye njya kureba papa nramubwira nti papa edouard yanbwiye ko ashaka kuhunga ntashaka kumuhungaish aranbwira ati uzaba ugize neza niba ushaka kufasha basaza bawe ukabahungaish bizaba ari byiza ntituzapfae tuesae , ||| i told edouard to get ready . i went back to kibuye and told my dad about it , he said it would be great if it 's possible to get my brothers out of the country so that we would not all be killed . he was desperate , as though he already knew he was going to die . i was home on a monday and i remember telling edouard to get read and join me on friday .
papa yari yaraihebye ubanza yari aziko azapfa ; ||| that was in 1993 .

munyensanga nraibuka ko yaje nkanikanga , nramubwira nti ese baraza bose kujyana ? ||| i remember how surprised i was when i saw munyensanga , wondering if they were going to go together .
nramubwira nti munyensanga se edouard ko uhunze ko ubona twe bari kutuhiga n' ubwo batari babishyira mu bikorwa ariko bazatuica . ||| i tried reasoning him saying that edouard was fleeing because they were targeting us and we knew they 'd kill us even though it had n't happened yet .
aranbwira ati @: « oya , edouard niba agiye nnjyae ngomba kugenda . » ||| he said that if edouard was going to leave , he 'd go with him .
hanyuma rero ubwo nragenda nbwira immaculee , immaculee aranbwira ati @: « byose nbitunganyaije bazaambuka ari ku wa gatandatu mu gitondo ; ||| i went and talked to immaculee and she told me everything was ready for them to leave on saturday .

turamwinginga ngo atuhishe , helene aratubwira ati @: « ese nrabahisha he ? ati nta hantu nfite nbahisha , ||| we begged her to hide us and she said she had no place where to hide us as everyone had become so wicked .

tuongera tusubirayo ariko ntitubona ahantu tuca tuhita tuhingukair ahantu ku baturanyi bari batuye , ||| we went back there but it was n't easy to find a way to use .
tusanga bamaze no kufata abantu benshi bahita batujyana , ||| we came out at the neighbours ' and found that they 'd already caught other people and they took melanie and i together with them .

batujyana ahantu muri cercle ( cercle sportif de rugunga ) tujyana n' umumama , ariko ntabwo azanva mu mutawe . ||| they took us to the kigali sports club [ cercle sportif de kigali ] in rugunga . there 's a woman who was with us whom i 'll always remember .

tugeze mu nzira ahura na mugenzi we aramwinginga ngo amufataire umwana , aramubwira ati @: « ko tubanye untwaraiye umwana . » aranga aramubwira ati @: ||| on our way , we met a friend of hers and she begged her to take the baby with her .
« oya ntabwo nmutwara kubera ko imperuka yanyu yabaye ; ||| she refused saying that she could n't take the baby as our last day had come [ the tutsis ' last day ] .

turagenda batushyira ahantu hari hameze nk' ahashashe , n' ubundi muri cercle henda kumera nk' ahashashe . ||| they took us to a place that was kind of flat , the ‘ cercle ’ is actually kind of flat .
ubwo rero baratangira bararasa , bararasa abana barataka n' abantu bakasaba imbabazi , ariko ntacyo bitangaaga . ||| they started to shoot , both children and adults were begging for pity in vain .
nraibuka ko hari abana basaba imbabazi bakavuga ngo ntibazaongera kuba abatutsi , ngo nibababarire , ||| some children were asking for forgiveness and even promised never to be tutsis again in vain .
ariko ntacyo bitangaaga . nuko rero njyae ngize ubwoba mpita nikubita hasi , ||| i was so frightened i fell down !
abantu bose baangwa hejuru na melanie . ||| many people fell on me , melanie included .

tusubira kwa helene tujya mu gikoni kuko bari bafite ikikoni batakinga , turagenda tuicaramo . ||| we went back to helene 's house and entered the kitchen and sat there , they did n't used to lock .
ariko melanie ava amaraso menshi , afite n' ubwoba bwinshi yaratitiraga . ||| melanie was bleeding very much throughout and she was so frightened that she was trembling .
nyuma rero tuguma mu gikoni helene aza kuteka icyayi mu gitondo atusangamo aravuga ati @: ||| we stayed there until helene came in the morning to make some tea .
« muracyariho ? » turamubwira tuti @: ||| she was surprised to find us still alive .

nyuma rero aratubwira ati @: « rero ati nimuguma hano n' ubundi murapfa ; ati ariko mugumae ahangaha njyewe ngiye kubashakira umuntu wo kubahisha . » ||| she said if we remained there , we 'd still be killed anyway . she said we should stay there until she came back and she went to look for someone who would agree to hide us .
nyuma rero tuguma aho mu gikoni aratugaburira . ||| we ate .
ariko melanie we yari yanamaze no kunanirwa , ||| melanie was very tired .

aratujyana ari ni mugoroba , ||| in the evening , she took us there .
aba ariho atwicaza ajya kutushakira abantu bo kutuhisha . ariko igihe tuicaraanye na melanie , melanie aranbwira ati @: « njyewe nmaze kunanirwa . ||| as we were sitting there , melanie told me she was very tired .

ntasohoka hari mu gitondo nko mu ma saa yine , imvura yaragwaaga ari nyinshi , aranbwira ati @: « genda usubirae kwa helene . » ||| i remember leaving her house one day in the morning , it was raining heavily and she told me to go back to helene 's house .
helene aranbwira ati @: « uje ari ku manywa abantu bose bakubonye , ||| helene told me that the fact she asked me to leave the day meant they 'd all seen me and they 'd soon be looking for me .
yakusohoye ku manywa ntabwo njyae nshobora kukomeza kukuhisha , nnjyae ntinshobora kukuhisha kuko ninguhisha bamenye ko uje hano nnjyae bashobora kunyica . » ||| it was too dangerous for her to hide in those conditions .
aranbwira ngo ningende njyae kuri carriere , hari umugabo utangaaga ibyangombwa iyo umuntu yabaga yataye irangamuntu . aranbwira ati @: ||| she told me to go to the quarry , there was a man who was giving out identity cards for those who had lost theirs .

ikintu cya ... ikintu kintangaje nyuma nkibaza icyo tupfa abantu , ni uko bibi yaragiye kubera ko yagendaaga cyane hanze aragenda ari ku manywa asanga umuntu ku muhanda wishwe n' inzara , ||| something that ... something that really surprised me and made me wonder why people were so much against us is that one day bibi went out , she used to walk around a lot .
yaje amutwaye mu ntoki aramutuzanira ; yitwaaga minani . ntitusohokaaga , ubwo nyine abakuru bibi yatubwiraaga kumenya abakomeretse , ||| she met somebody who was dying of hunger .
kuko muri twe harimo abari barakomeretse , no kumenya abana . nyuma rero azana uwo mugabo minani . aranbwira ati ... ni nnjyae yamushinze . ||| she brought him to us , the man was called minani .
aranbwira ati @: ||| we never used to get out .
« uyu muntu umumenye . » ndamwegera ariko ntiyavugaaga kubera inzara yari yaramwiciye mu nzira . nramubaza se witwa nde ? ||| bibi put the adults among us in charge of taking care of the injured and of the children .
aranbwira ati nitwa minani nramubaza nti @: « se uva he ? » aranbwira ati @: « njyewe ndi impunzi y' umurundi nhunze i burunri intambara batumereye nabi n' umuryango wanjye , ||| she brought the man called minani and told me to take care of him .
nnjyae ntahunga . nyuma rero tumaze kuganira gake , kubera nta mwuka yari afite , ||| i approached him but he could n't talk as he was very hungry .
bibi aramunshinga . ||| i asked him his name and he said he was called minani .
hashize igihe , hashize iminsi yari amaze guhembuka gake ariko kuko yari yarazahaye cyane ... araambaza ati @: « ese ugeze hano kutae ? » nramubwira nti @: ||| i asked him where he was from and he told me he was a burundian refugee , him and his family were being persecuted and he fled the war in burundi .
ngeze hano mpunga . aranreba aranbwira ati @: « uri umututsikazi ? » nramubwira nti @: ||| a few days later , when he started getting back some strength , he asked me how i got there and i told him i sought refuge there in an attempt to flee .
yego . ati @: « nnjyae ndi umuhutu . aranbwira ati @: ||| he asked me if i was a tutsi and i said "@ yes @"@ .
rero ati ntacyo tupfa ati tupfa n' ubusa , ati koko ; ati dore ahantu tuhuraiye ati ubu n' imaan ikora ibintu nka bino kugirango ituerekae ko ntacyo tupfa , ko tuesae turi bamwe . » ||| his reply was that him on the other hand was hutu and the fact that we had met in such a place was probably god 's way of showing us how we really have no reason to fight and that at the end of the day , we are all the same .
ariko ntawe nbonye , kuko nshakishije igihe kinini nk' amezi atatu , numva amezi atatu ari menshi , ||| but i did n't see any of them for about 3 months ... for me 3 months seemed to be a very long time .
kuri jyae yari menshi cyane nyuma rero nza ku ... kubera nri nratanze amazina ya petit frere shumbusho baza kuzanbwira ko bafite umwana witwa shumbusho muri icyo kigo cya ‘ concern ’ kiri kiri i kitaarama . ||| i had given out my brother 's name and the organization cocern in gitarama told me they had a child called shumbusho .
nragenda njyayo mpageze mpasanga abana bato cyane , abana bato umwana muto uri ufite nk' umwaka , ||| i found very young children there .
aranbona ( bamwitaga mutoni ) aranbona araza ansanga cyane anbwira , ||| a one year old girl ran to me calling me ‘ mom ’ , she was called mutoni .
anyita mama . simbizi niba mama we yarasaga nkanjyae , ntabwo nbizi impamvu yanyise mama . ||| maybe her mother and i looked alike , i do n't know what made her call me mom .
yaje yiruka cyane aranyegera n' abandi bana bari baraho baraza biruka bavuga ngo @: ||| the other children came to me , they thought she had found her mother .
« abonye mama we burya uri uriho ? » nramuterura ariko abari bazi ubwenge nrababwira nti ... abari bazi ubwenge muri bo nti @: « ashobora kuba yibeshye . » ||| i explained to the ones who were old enough to understand that i was n't her mother .
nragiye nramuterura nramujyana . nragenda njya muri direction kubaza niba uwo mwana shumbusho ahari . baraambaza bati @: « shumbusho wande ? » ||| i carried her and headed towards the management to find out if the child called shumbusho was there . they asked me the names of the child 's parents .
nrababwira nti @: papa we yitwa kamuhanda matiyasi ; nti na mama ni nyiramatama yulida . ||| i told them father was called matthias kamuhanda and mother was called yulida nyiramatama .
bajya mu mazina y' abana bari bafite kuko shumbusho yari azi ubwenge , yari yarababwiye amazina y' iwacu , kuko yari afite imyaka irindwi . ||| they went through the names of the children they knew and shumbusho was a bright boy and he had given out those names , he was 7 .
baranbwira bati @: « shumbusho ariho ariko yagiye ku ishuri . » ||| they told me he was alive but he had gone to school .
numvise ari igitangaza kikomeye ntabwo numvise uko bingendekeye , kuko numvaaga ko nubwo banbwiye ko ariho ariko numvaaga ko atari byo . ||| it was a miracle and i felt like it was n't true even after they told me he was alive .
nrategereje ntahaguma kugeza saa sita igeze nko mu ma saa sita nibwo nbonaanye nawe kuko yigaga aho hafi . ||| i waited until noon when he came back from school . his school was n't far from the orphanage and he came at around 12 .
shumbusho yaranbonye amera nk' aho , yumvise ari ... bibaye nk' ikintu kimugwirairiye , ||| when shumbusho saw me , he became ... he was taken by surprise , he just stared at me , he did n't even come forward to say hi .
kuko yaranrebye cyane , nta n' ubwo yanyegereye ngo anramutse . ngiye kumwegera ngo muramutse nkabona afite ubwoba . ||| i approached him and he looked so scared .
araambaza ati @: "@ ese uracyariho wowe ? @" ||| the he asked , "@ you 're still alive ? @"
nravuga nti @: yego . ||| i said yes .
araambaza ati @: "@ ese mu rugo i wacu hari umuntu usigaye ? @" ||| then he asked me if there was any other survivor at home which i told him there was none .
nramubwira nti ntawe . ikintu yanbajije yanbajije ngirabakunzi , petite soeur kuko barakurikiraanaga . ||| he asked me about ngirabakunizi , our little sister because they followed each other .
araambaza ati @: "@ na ngirabakunzi ntawe uriho ? @" ||| he asked again , "@ even ngirabakunzi is n't there ? @"
nti oya nti ngirabakunzi ntawe uriho . ||| i told him no , she was n't there either .
ati @: "@ na papa ? @" nti @: ||| he asked again , "@ even dad ? @"
yego . aranbwira ati @: ||| i said yes , even him .
"@ oya papa ntabwo bamwishe , papa yari afite ingufu , ati ubwo papa yari afite ingufu , ||| he told me it was impossible , that dad was very strong and there was no way they could have killed him .
buriya yararwanye arahunga . ||| "@ he must have fought and run .
ntabwo buriya bamwishe . @" ||| they did n't kill him @" he said .
nti oya papa ntawe uriho . ||| "@ no , dad is not alive . @" i told him .
yahise ampunga aragenda . ||| then he run away .
yaragiye ariruka cyane arampunga , ntiiongeye no kunyegera , ntabwo nzi impamvu ... wenda ... ntinzi impamvu atashakaaga ko tuegeraan . ||| he run away from me very fast , he refused to approach me again ... i do n't know why ... maybe ... i do n't know why he did n't want to come near me .
ntinjya nshaka no kubimubaza . ||| i never ask him about it .
nratashye abamureraaga baranbwiye ngo @: "@ ni ntahae murekae . @" baranbwira ngo @: "@ buriya mu mutawe ntabwo abiiumvaish . @" ||| his guardians told me to go back home and leave him , they said it was still hard for him to accept it .
nratashye nyuma nza kuzasubira ku kazi nrababwira ko nmubonye , nbabwira ko baongera kunsubiza ku kazi nkakora , baranretse ntakora . ||| i went back home and then i started working again .
nyuma rero umuntu araza aranbwira turi tuturanye iwacu ati @: "@ na ba barumuna bawe bariho , violette na clodette ngo bariho ntabwo bapfuye . @" ||| a nieghbour once came and told me violette and claudette were still alive as well .
nrishima cyane numva ni ibitangaza . ||| i was very happy and i felt like it was a miracle .
nyuma nragenda nrabiibuka ko nri nfite amafaranga nragenda ngura ibitanda na matelas . ||| i had some money and i remember going to buy beds and mattresses .
nbwira bibi , nti @: bibi rero ntashaka kutaha ; nti ungiraiye neza nti ariko nbonye barumuna banjye , ||| i thanked bibi for all she did for me and i told her i wanted to leave because i had found my younger brother and sisters and i did n't want to bother her with them .
nti nbonye bene data batatu ntabwo nza kukugora . nti ntabwo tuza kukugora . bibi aranbwira ngo @: "@ oya guma hano nrakureze , ||| bibi told me not to leave , she said she was going to take care of them just like she had been taking care of me .
nabo nzabarera . @" nramubwira nti @: oya ntashaka kugenda ahubwo unfashe tushakae inzu , ntakora nzajya nyiriha nbatungae nta kibazo . ||| i insisted i wanted to leave and i asked her to help me find a house , i told her i could now afford paying a rent and taking care of them since i had a job .
namwe muzajyae munfasha ariko ntabwo tushaka kukomeza kukugora . ||| i told her she could continue helping me but i did n't want to continue bothering her .
bibi aranbwira ati @: "@ ok ngiye kukushakira inzu . @" ||| bibi finally agreed to help me find a house .
anshakira inzu y' ibyumba bitatu nkoresha ibitanda niteguye kusaba shumbusho bakamumpa aho yari ari muri orphelinat n' ibindi bibiri kimwe cya clodette n' ikindi cya violette . nragenda nongera naka uruhushya bararumpa , ||| she got me a three bed roomed house . i had 3 beds made , one for shumbusho as i intended to ask the people from the orphanage to give him to me and 2 others for violette and claudette .
kugirango njyae kushaka violette na clodette nragiye njya iwacu ku kibuye , nsanga yaranbeshye wa muntu , yaranbeshye kuko nsubiye kwa chantal masenge , aranbwira ati @: ||| i got another leave and went to look for violette and claudette . i went back home to kibuye and found out that the person who told me about them had lied to me .
"@ uwo muntu ukubwiye ibyo ngibyo ni uwahe ? ati @: barabaishe babiciye muri stade , ||| my aunt chantal told me they killed them at the stadium .
ati @: kuko nanze kubikubwira kuko nbonaaga ukibabaye , ||| she told me she had not wanted to tell me about it as she could see how difficult it was for me .
nkubwira ko bose bapfuye . ariko ati @: mutabazi so wanyu we yavuye muri stade yakomeretse , ariko ntabwo yari yapfuye ati @: ||| she said my uncle mutabazi was injured at the stadium but left there while he was still alive . he went to her house and told her everyone was dead .
kuko yaje iwe anbwira y' uko bose bapfuye ati ariko anbwira y' uko papa wawe we yari yashoboye kusimbuka stade akahunga ati @: ariko barabaishe bose ati nta ... nta usigaye . @" ||| he told her my dad got out of the stadium but they killed them all ... no one survived !
n' ubu njya nreba matelas zabo nranazibitse nanze kuzikoresha , hari igihe numva ko atari byo , hari igihe numva ko n' ubwo nbibonye ariko ko batapfuye , hari umunsi numva ko bitashoboka ... bitashoboka ko abantu bapfa bangana kuriya , ||| i still look at their mattresses today , i did n't use them ... sometimes i feel like it is not true , as though they did n't die ... some days i feel like it 's impossible ... it 's impossible that so many people can die at the same time , as though they were maybe somewhere else but that they have n't died .
ko wenda bari ahandi hantu . ko batapfuye . ariko nta kunri ntangiye kubiemera no kushima imaan ko yashoboye kumpa situation nziza nyuma nrimaraiye ( se marier @: ||| but there 's nothing i can do about it , it is something i am starting to accept and i thank god that i have a good life today .
nrashatse ) nfite abana babiri . ||| i later on got married and i have 2 kids .
iyo nibutse abo tuvukanaaga cyangwa n' abaturanyi agahinda karanyica ariko nbona abana banjye nkabona bimpaye kushaka kubaho , ||| whenever i remember my siblings who died and even our neighbours , i feel very sad but when i look at my children , it gives me the desire to continue to live .
nkabona nibo bavandimwe banjye kandi nibo bana banjye . ||| they are my siblings and my children at the same time .
shumbusho muracyari kumwe ? ||| are you still with shumbusho ?
yego , shumbusho turi kumwe , turi kumwe shumbusho . ariko naho turi kumwe ariko nkora byose kugirango shumbusho nrebae ko yakuibagirwa ibyo bintu byose yabonye . ||| yes , shumbusho is still with me and i do my best to help him forget all the bad things he saw .
ariko ubona hariho igihe ubona ko shumbusho kubaho nta na kimwe ... nta na kimwe bimubwiye . ubona hariho igihe ubona ntazi nnjyae aho ari . ||| but sometimes i get the impression that life is meaningless to him .
ariko akaongera akantera kuishima kuko nziko n' ubwo umuryango wacu uzimye nziko umunsi umwe imaan izaongera kuwutuha iwucaishije muri shumbusho . ||| sometimes he looks so absent . but he is such a source of joy to me because i believe that even if our family was wiped out , god will give it back to us one day through shumbusho .
wagirango papa yarimwise aziko ariwe uzaba shumbusho w' umuryango wacu . ||| you 'd think dad called him shumbusho ( meaning the substitute ) knowing that through him , we shall have a substitute to our family .
mwari bangahe , mwari abana bangahe ? ||| how many children were you in your family ?
turi aba ... abahungu bari ... bane bapfuye na shumbusho wa gatanu na petite soeur ngirabakunzi na njyae . ||| we were ... the boys were 4 plus shumbusho , that makes it 5 and my little sister ngirabakunzi and i.
tugarutse inyuma gato mu kihae cyo muri 90 ... niba ubiibuka neza utubwiye ko uri uri ku gisenyi , ese uje kuva ku kibuye kutae ujya kuba ku gisenyi ? ||| if we go back to 1994 ... can you remember exactly how you left kibuye for gisenyi ?
n' ibyo bibazo by' intambara ? ||| was it as a consequence of the war ?
oya ntabwo ari ibyo bibazo biri biriho by' intambara nnavuye iwacu ibyo bintu by' intambara bitari biba , ||| no , it was n't because of the war . i left home before the war started .
kubera ko mama avuka ku gisenyi niho narerewe , ||| i was brought up in gisenyi because that 's where my mom was born .
akenshi narerewe mu miryango yo kwa mama . ||| i was mainly brought up in her family .
igihe inkotanyi zitera muri 1990 hari abaturanyi mwari muturanye ku gisenyi baba baraishwe ? ||| did any of your neighbours in gisenyi die when the inkotanyis attacked in 1990 ?
abo turi tuturanye ku gisenyi oya , ||| not among our neighbours in gisenyi .
aho nri ndi nta bapfuye kaereka aho mama akomoka i kayove nibo nzi bapfuye . ||| not where i was living . but people i know of people who died in kayove where mom was from .
ku gisenyi ubanaaga na nde kuko utubwiye ko i kayove hari famille ya mama n' aba cousine ? ||| you told us your mom 's family and your cousins lived in kayove . who were you living with in gisenyi ?
ku gisenyi ni abana n' umucousine wa mama . ||| i was living with mother 's cousin in gisenyi .
hanyuma igihe uje ... uje i kigali kutae ? ||| how did you end up in kigali ?
uva ku gisenyi ntabwo ubitusobanuraiye neza . ||| we did n't understand it well ...
nri nfite inshuti tuuzuraaga y' umuzungu , fiance wanjye . ||| i had a white boyfriend .
njyaaga nza kumureba ariko nkaza nfite n' utuntu two kucuruza , kutugurisha nkagenda . ||| i used to come and visit him but i would also bring some things to sell .
ariko nkaba ndi kwa mariya , kwa mariya niho nbaga nshumbitse , kugeza igihe ibintu byanjye bizamara kugurairw nkabona kusubira i gisenyi . ||| i would stay at maria 's until i finish sellingmy things then i would go back home .
utubwiye ko , wigeze kutubwira ko intambara yabaye umaze iminsi itatu i kigali ; hari n' ahandi utubwiye ko uri kumwe na wa mwana witwa mishove , mwari mumaraanye nk' ibyumweru bibiri mumenyaanye , ntabwo tubiumvise neza ||| you told us the war broke up when you had been in kigali for 3 days , you also said that there 's a time you were with the child called micheveux for about 2 weeks , i did n't quite undertand that part .
ok , hariya nvuze ibyumweru bibiri nnjyae nbiumvise nyuma nibeshye . ||| well , when i said 2 weeks , i also realized later on that i made a mistake .
mishove tumaze nka 2 semaines ( ibyumweru bibiri ) tuihishaanye . icyo kihae nibwo yanbwiye ati @: "@ odette njyewe uyu munsi ntapfa . @" ||| i spent about 2 weeks hiding together with micheveux and that 's the time she one day told me she was convinced she was going to die .
nramubaza nti @: kubera iki unbwiye ko uri bupfae ? aranbwira ati @: "@ ndi kaumva ninukair amaraso ahantu hose . @" ||| i asked her why and she told me she felt like she was smelling blood all over her body .
nramubwira ngo ntabwo tupfa , nramuhumuriza . ||| i told her she was n't going to die , trying to reassure her .
ariko wagirango yari abizi ni uwo munsi iwabo wa mishove bose babatwaye , ||| but it was as though she actually knew she was going to die because that 's the same day her whole family was taken away .
ariko hasigaye umwana umwe iwabo w' umuhungu n' undi w' umukobwa uri i butare . ||| only a boy survived plus a girl who was in butare .
ariko micheveux yarapfuye . ||| michoveux died with them .
ba bantu mwari mwihishanye igihe ubaga kwa mariya ba giramata , nta makuru yabo ... ? ||| have you heard anything giramata , the one you were hiding with at maria 's ?
mama giramata yararokotse arokokaan n' abana be n' umugabo . ||| mama giramata survived together with her husband and children .
ariko melanie ntabwo nigeze menya amakuru ye . ||| but i have never heard anything about melanie .
ntabwo nongeye kumubona , umunsi wa nyuma turi turi kumwe mu gihuru niwo munsi nmubonye . ||| i never saw her again after the day i was with her in the bush .
harya helene yavukanaaga na mariya ? ||| were helene and maria sisters ?
yego baravukanaaga helene yari murumuna wa mariya . ||| yes helene was maria 's younger sister .
hanyuma ariko nyuma helene yabashije kukushakira ukuntu yagiye agusova ... ||| and helene kept on looking for ways to hide you ...
yego , yabashije kunshakira abantu bose bampisha , kuko njyae ntabwo nri nbazi nta muntu nri nzi i kigali . uretse uwo mukuru we na helene nta banri . ||| yes , she is the one who helped me to get all the people who hid me because i did n't know anyone else in kigali apart from helene and her sister .
ni ukuvuga ngo iyo helene atanfasha ngo anshakirae abantu bose bampishe , ntabwo nri kubaho . ||| meaning that if helene did n't help me find all those people , i would not have survived .
yari afite umugabo ? ||| was she married ?
yari afite umugabo ariko umugabo wicaga , ||| her husband was a killer .
umugabo we yaraishe . ||| he killed some people .
umugabo we yaraishe ubwo yarananbwiraaga ati @: « iyo umugabo wanjye aba atameze kuriya ngo abe atabaye igisimba , nnjyae nkugumana hano . ati ariko nkugumanye hano yakuica ntabwo ... urara . ||| she even told me that if her husband had n't become a monster , she would have kept me in her home and that there was no point of keeping me there because he 's kill me ... i would n't survive even one night .
kuko umugabo we yirirwaaga kuri bariyeri agenda , ntabwo yashoboraaga kufata uwo mutwaro wo kunshyira iwe . ||| her husband used to spend all his time going to roadblocks and she did n't want to have my death on her conscience .
iyo umugabo we aza kuba mwiza nawe aba yarangumanye ; kuko yari afite umutima . ||| if her husband had been a good man , she would have hidden me because it was on her heart .
iyo abantu bose baza kumera nka helene , bakamera nka mama sania ntabwo abatutsi baba barapfuye mu gihugu ngo bashirae . ariko mama sania niwe ... mu bantu bose bampishe , ||| if everyone had been like helene and mama sania , the tutsis in rwanda would not have died and been wiped out .
ariko we yashyizeho akarusho kuko we yanbereye umubyeyi . kuko we yaranbwiye ati @: « biriya byose bavuga ngo abatutsi ngo ni babi , ati @: ||| but mama sania is the one ... among all the people who hid me , she surpasses them all because she became like a parent to me .
ni ukubeshya ati @: njyae ntabwo ndi umututsi , ati @: nta n' ubwo n' iwacu harimo umututsi mu maraso y' iwacu . ||| she told me , "@ everything that 's said about the tutsis and how wicked they are is not true , i am not a tutsi and to the best of my knowledge , there 's no tutsi blood in our family .
ati @: ariko uko nbizi , ati data yakijijwe n' umututsi . ati @: ||| but i know my father became rich thanks to a tutsi , we lived a good life thanks to that tutsi and for that reason , i can not harm a tutsi .
data yahaatswae n' umututsi aramukiza ; ati tubaho neza tumair neza kubera uwo mututsi . ati @: ntawe na biriya bintu bavuga ngo bica abatutsi kuko ari babi , ||| the tutsi are not wicked , all this is only going to profit top leaders in the coutry .
ati @: kubera icyo kintu ntinshobora kugirair nabi umututsi . » ati @: « ntabwo abatutsi ari babi ati @: ||| do n't get discouraged to the point of asking god ... of saying that god ... @" sometimes i 'd be so discouraged that i asked her what crime we committed , what sin the tutsis committed to the point of becoming an outcast tribe .
n' inyungu z' abantu bafite ubwenge bo hejuru , bashaka kwitwaza ibyabo , ati @: ntiuzajyae wiheba ngo usabae imaan ... ngo uvugae imaan ... » kuko hari igihe nvuganaaga nawe nganiraaga , ||| i felt i cursed .. i felt like we all were cursed .
nawe nkamubwira nti @: ni igiki tukoze , ni igiki abatutsi bacumuye kitumye tuba ubwoko busa nk' aho ... kuko numvaaga nbaye maudit ( ruvumaw ) numvaaga turi maudit ( turavumawe ) kuko jyae numvaaga ntibishoboka ko imaan yaba yaraturemye ngo itumae abantu bapfa nk' impyisi . n' impyisi ntabwo zipfa kuriya ; ||| i did n't understand how god created us and could allow us to die like animals , even animals do n't die that way .
bapfa nk' ibintu ntazi kuko ntinzi ukuntu ntabwo njya nbona n' aho nbishyira ntinzi ukuntu nbibona ; ||| sometimes i do n't even how to put it .
nramubwiraaga nti @: imaan ntibaho ariko nyuma nsabye imaan imbabazi nrayibwiye ngo inbabarirae kuko iriho ntabwo ariyo yatumye bakora ibintu nka biriya . ||| i used to tell her that god did n't exist but later on i asked god to forgive me because i know he is there and he is n't the one who made them such things .
ka kana mwahuriyeyo nako kaitwa mutoni , ese ntabwo mwongeye kubonaan ? ||| what about the child called mutoni you met at the orphanage , did you see her again ?
umutoni nshatse ... bon nraje nyuma maze kubona inzu , ntekereza kugirango nzagendae nsabae umutoni bamumpe numvaaga ko , ngomba kumurera kuko nri nfite ubushobozi kuko nri maze kubura abo barumuna banjye bo kwa data wacu nkaumva ko we na shumbusho batazananira kubatunga . ||| umutoni , i looked for ... after i got my own house , i was planning to ask for her and raise her up together with shumbusho since my cousins had also died .
ariko umutoni nsubiye muri orphelinat nri maze kutangira amaprocedure yose yo kugirango mufatae , nzamufataane na shumbusho , kuko ni nabyo nshakaaga . kuko na shumbusho ntabwo bahise bamumpa . ||| i felt i could afford taking care fo the 2 of them . i had started all the paper works in order to ask for her and shumbusho , even shumbusho was n't immediately given to me .
bamumpaye babonye ko ndi capable yo kuba nmurera . ||| they gave him to me when they were assured that i had the means to take care of him .
umutoni rero nsubiyeyo baranbwira ngo hari abantu bene wabo babonetse bavuye i burunri , baragenda baramusaba baramutwara , kuko ngo umutoni yari yageze muri iyo orphelinat , ||| as far as umutoni is concerned , they told me relatives of her from burundi went to ask for her .
yatwawe n' undi mwana w' umukobwa ariko we uri ukuze . ||| she was taken to the orphanage by a 12 year old girl , she had picked her among dead bodies .
kuko ngo uwari umutwaye yamukuye mu mirambo yari akuze , kuko yari afite douze ans ( imyaka cumi n' ibiri ) yaramurutaaga ho ... yaramurutaaga ni nawe rero ushoboye kubwira muri orphelinat amazina y' ababyeyi b' umutoni . ||| she was older and she is the one who told the people of the orphanage the names of umutoni 's parents .
hari abantu bawe uba urabashije kushyingura mu cyubahiro ? ||| have you been able to bury in respect some of your people ?
yego , nshyinguye ngirabakunzi ma soeur ( murumuna wanjye ) na alphred n' uwitonze , na data wacu mutabazi . ||| yes , i buried ngirabakunzi my little sister , alfred and uwitonze and our uncle mutabazi .
kuko bo ... mutabazi bamwicanye na musaza wanjye muto baishe afite imyaka umunani , uwitonze bari bari kumwe tubakuye hamwe . ||| because they ... mutabazi was killed together with uwitonze my 8 year old brother . we found them together .
alphred nawe bamwiciye hafi uvuye i wacu . ||| alfred was killed near our home .
ku buryo nje kushobora kubona aho bari bari nrabashyingura . ||| i found their corpses and buried them .
papa rero nawe bamwiciye aho hafi y' iwacu kuko yagiye muri stade avayo agaruka aho iwacu mu ruvumbu niho bamwiciye . ||| dad was also killed near home , he was at the stadium but he managed to escape and then went back in ruvumbu , our home area and that 's where he was killed .
ariko papa nbimenye bamaze kumujyana mu bisesero hamwe n' abandi , ||| but i found out about it when he had already been taken to bisesero with other corpses .
abashoboye kumukura aho bamushyinguye bamwiciye , bahise bamujyana mu bisesero . ||| some people exhumed his body from where he was buried after being killed and took him to bisesero .
hanyuma nyuma y' intambara umaze kurokoka , umaze kuhura n' ibibazo , uhuye nabyo mu ntiambara , mbese umaze kuhura n' umwana shumbusho ; ||| how did you manage to face life after the war after all the difficulties you went through plus the fact that shumbusho was seriously disturbed by everything he had gone through ?
mutoya wawe ugombaaga kugirango umufatae . ndetse nawe ubonaaga yaragize ibibazo by' ihungabana . ese utubwira uburyo ubashije kuba muri ubwo buzima ni kutae ubashije kubumetiriza ( maitriser ) ||| how did you manage to face such a life ?
nhise numva nbaye mukuru , kuko nhise numva nbaye nka mama wa shumbusho , kuko nhise numva nbaye mu bunri buzima . nhise nvuga ngo shumbusho ngomba kukoresha uburyo bwose bwo kugirango nbashae kumutunga , ||| it made me feel mature because it was as though i became shumbusho 's mother , i started a new life ; i felt very responsible for him and i knew i 'd have to do everything i could to be able to raise him up and pay for his education .
ndetse no kumurihair ishuri . ariko nyuma maze kwiyenstalla ( s' installer @: kushyira ibintu hamwe ) nbashije kubona undi mwana wa murumuna wa mama , witwa cynthia . ||| besides , when i finished organizing myself and putting everything together , i found cynthia , my cousin , the daughter of mom 's younger sister alive !
ubwo nbana nabo . ||| so i was living with both of them .
ariko ntabwo byanyoroheye , kuko cynthia we nijoro yararaga asakuza , kandi n' ubu ntibiri bimushiramo . ||| i t was n't easy as cynthia used to spend the whole night screaming , she still does it at times today .
na n' ubu niko aryama arabyuka ninjoro ati @: « nimuhungae interahamwe zije kutuica ... tuhungae interahamwe zije kutuica . » ubwo bararaga basakuza , ||| even today she wakes up in the middle of the night saying , "@ let 's flee , the interahamwes are coming to kill us ... let 's flee , the interahamwes are coming to kill us . @"
shumbusho akasakuza , ||| so they 'd make a lot of noise in the night , even shumbusho would join her .
cynthia akasakuza ubonaaga ko mu mutawe wabo intambara bari bakiyirimo . ||| it was as though in their mind , they were still living in the war .
ntabwo bari baizera ko intambara yashize ; ||| they did n't believe it was over .
nbasize ... nsize shumbusho ku ishuri , cynthia ariko we ntibiri kushoboka kubara , yari yaraangiritse cyane . nbanje kumureka kugirango abashae kaumva ko tutakiri mu ntiambara , ||| i put shumbusho in school but it was n't going to be possible for cynthia to be away as she was in a very bad state .
kugirango ... kuko ntabwo ishuri yari kurishobora . icyo kihae yaje kujya ku ishuri nyuma . ||| she went back to school later on .
shumbusho we rero ... nkoreshaaga ibishoboka byose kugirango abo bana banjye nshoborae kubashimaish . ||| shumbusho on the other hand ... i was trying my best to make my children happy .
udufaranga mpembwe nkagenda nkahaha nkariha inzu , nkariha ishuri , nri nrabaye ... ngize amaresponsabilites ( inshingano ) ntinhita ngira bya binri by' aba ... ntabwo nvuga ngo nbayeho ubuzima icyo kihae bw' imyaka nri nkwiriye , ||| i would use my salary to shop and pay the rent ... i suddenly had all these responsibilities ... my reaction was n't to ... the life i lived then did n't quite match with my age ... i turned 18 during the war .
kuko umuntu ufite imyaka cumi ... kuko nraibuka anniversaire y' imyaka cumi n' umunani nyigize mu ntiambara . ntabwo ntekerezaaga nk' umuntu ufite iyo myaka yanjye nri nfite . ||| i did n't think like an 18 year old person .
numvaaga ngomba kukoresha byose , ubushobozi bwanjye bwose nri nfite kugirango shumbusho na cynthia bazashoborae kuiga , ||| i felt i needed to do all i could so that shumbusho and cynthia could study .
nta kinri kintu njyewe nrebaaga . ||| that 's all i was concentrating on .
hari abaturanyi mwari muturanye baba baragize uruhare mu kukuicira umuryango bakihari , bataigeze bafataw ngo bafungwae ? ||| among the neighbours who killed your family , are there some who participated openly and never went to jail ?
barahari , iwacu ho , ibintu byo ... abenshi bo nta nubwo bari baumva ko banagize nabi ngo biibura bashoborae no kuvugaish ukuri . ||| yes there are ... in our areas ... most of them still do n't believe what they did was wrong and have n't come out in the open to tell the truth .
kuko njyewe nragiye nyuma y' intambara , banbwira uburyo abantu b' iwacu bapfuye . banbwira uburyo bapfuye banbwira n' ababaishe . ||| i went there after the war and they told mehow my family was killed and who killed them .
ariko nyuma batangiye kugenda bafataw , hatangiye kujya haba ibintu by' imanza bakanga kubivuga . ||| but when people started being arrested and the lawsuits started , they refused to testify .
umubwira uti @: « ese ko ubinbwiye cya kihae , akakubwira ngo ntabyo nigeze nkubwira , njyae ibyo bintu ntabwo nigeze nbikubwira . » ||| and when we would ask them about the previous times they said it , they 'd say they never said it .
hari abafashwae ariko hari n' abatarigeze bafataw . ||| some got arrested but others were never arrested .
kuko nko mu baishe ngirabakunzi , ma soeur mu baishe ma soeur harimo umuhungu uri ukuze muri abo bana bato bamwishe , ariko nawe yari umwana . kuko niba se umuntu yishe afite imyaka 12 cyangwa 15 nawe aba ari umwana ! ||| for example , among the children who killed ngirabakunzi - one was mature enough - do you believe a 12 or 15 year old person who kills is still a child ?
ariko baramufashe nyuma baranamurekura ngo afite ibibazo by' umutima . ariko nibaza ko banamurekuye kubera ko yari n' umwana . ||| they arrested him and released him later on saying he is mentally disturbed , but i also think they released him because he was a child .
ariko abandi , abaishe abantu b' iwacu , cyangwa se n' abandi bantu turi tuturanye , abenshi ntabwo bafashwae . ||| but even the rest of the people who killed my family or neighbours were never arrested and those who were have been released .
ntabwo bafashwae n' abari barafashwae barabafunguye . ariko ku buryo ahubwo n' iyo nbimenya ko bazabafunga bakabafungura , nta nubwo nba nririwe nta igihe cyanjye ngo nrabirukaho ngo babafungae . ||| if i had known that they were going to release them , i would n't have wasted my time pursuing them .
nba nrabaretse nkabaihorera . ||| i would just have let them go .
nba nrabaihoreye kuko ubu nibwo muri make ... ubu nibo bakagombye kugira isoni , kuko banyiciye cyangwa baishe n' abandi . ||| i would have let them go because this should be the time when ... they should be shameful of their deeds ... but when i see them , i am the one who is ashamed because they killed my family and others as well .
ariko ubu nrababona nkuibuka ukuntu nbirukaagaho ngo babafungae ... ariko nrababona nkaumva arijyae ufite isoni . ||| today i see them and i remember how i pursued them , wanting them to be arrested and i feel ashamed .
nkaumva arijyae umwaye , nkaumva iyaba nri nfite aho nkuihisha , cyangwa nfite ahandi hantu njya ntababona , ngenda . ||| i see them and i am so dishonored i could hide myself or i wish i could move to a place where i would n't be seeing them anymore !
njyae kuko biteye isoni kuiruka ku muntu ukugiraiye nabi ngo bamufungae , ejo bakamufungura . ||| it 's so shocking to run after somebody who killed your people so they can be imprisoned and then see them released !
iyo nbimenya ntabyo nba nririwe njyamo . ||| had i known it was going to be that way , i would n't have gotten involved .
hari ikintu leta ikora cyo kufungura abantu ngo bireze bakaemera icyaha , kugirango baze mu banyarwanda , baongerae baiyungae . ||| the politic of the government consists in releasing the people who have acknowledged their crimes so they can live with the rwandan nation again and be united with them all over again .
icyo kintu ukibona kutae ? ||| what do you think of that ?
wowe ubona bigenda bite ? ||| and how do you think things should be ?
ku bwanjye ntabwo nvuga ngo ... urebye bariya bantu barampombeje . ||| personally , i can not say that ... i have lost so much because of those people .
kuko banbujije umuryango , bahombya n' uwunri wese ubuze abe . ||| they took away my family and everyone else who lost his or her people lost in the same way .
ni ukuvuga ngo nvuze ngo @: ntekereje ngo babakomezae babafungae wenda ngo babagumaishe mu munyururu , ibyo aribyo byose njyae hari abo nasabonuje , kandi numva ko aribyo ... ari nabyo nvuga ngo iyo menya hakiri kare ntabwo nba nririwe nbirukaho ngo babafungae . ||| if my opinion is that they should be imprisoned and remain there - i have asked some people - and i believe that would be the right thing to do ... and that 's why i am saying that if i had known it from before , i would n't have spent so much time running after them for them to be put in jail .
kuko hariya bafunze ibyo barya ni leta ibibagaburira . bagirae kuba barayiciye abantu , ibyo aribyo byose ibyo barya birahenze ! ||| in jail , it is the government that feeds them .
n' ubuzima bwabo , iyo barwaye ... burahenze . nraumva rero igihugu kirahomba kandi n' ubundi kiranahombaye . ||| not only did they kill my people - i 'd expect that their meals are expensive , their lives , their health , all that is costly - so the country is losing and it 's already lost anyway .
ubwo rero ibiiza nraumva ko kuba barabaretse bakagenda bakajya hanze , bakagenda bakakora bakanakorera n' igihugu nraumva jyae ntabwo nvuga ngo bagize nabi . ||| so in my opinion , releasing them so that they can be working for the country is n't bad .
nta yinri solution nta kinri kiboneka . ||| there 's no other solution anyway .
kuko ubundi nk' iwacu ku kibuye ahantu i rubaengair , abantu hafi ya bose baraishe . baraishe abantu hafi ya bose , n' utarafashe umupanga yatungaiye mugenzi we agatoki aho umututsi yari ari . ||| because if i take the case of my home area in kibuye , almost everyone in rubengera killed ; even the one who did n't take a machete pointed at the place where a tutsi was hiding , showing his or her friend .
ni ukuvuga ngo ku kibuye ho hageze n' aho abana bica . bafite n' imyaka icumi bafite irindwi bakagenda bakajya mu masaka bakajya kuhiga abandi . ||| it reached a point where even children killed in kibuye , a ten year old child or a seven year old one were busy looking for people in the bush .
ni ukuvuga ngo abo bantu bose ukagombye kugenda ukabafata , ukabashyira ahantu bose ukabafunga . ariko ntabwo bishoboka . ||| meaning that all those people should be taken to jail which is impossible .
igihugu se kitera inberae kutae abantu bari mu munyururu ? ||| how would the country develop if everyone is in jail ?
ntabwo bishoboka . ||| that 's not possible .
ni ukuvuga ngo tugomba kubiemera nta kunri . ||| so we just have to accept , there 's no other solution .
kusa iyaba babiemeraaga , bakasaba imbabazi kandi bose . ||| but it would be so much better if all of them would accept their crime and apologize .
ntibibae ngo nimbyemera nkasaba imbabazi nzafungwa igihe gito , nzagabanyirizwa icyaha . kiriya kintu nicyo kintu kinbabaza . kugenda bakabaigisha ngo nimusaba imbabazi ngo muzagabanyirizwa icyaha , ||| not so much because they know acknowledging it and apologizing is a means of being in jail for a shorter time . i have a problem with it ! they teach them that if they accept their crimes , their punishment shall be reduced .
biriya byo biranbabaza . kuko ubundi umuntu yagombye kusaba imbabazi bivuye mu mutaima we , atari undi ugiye ngo abimuteraemo . kuko barabibafasha bakabibatsindagiramo , ||| one should first of all apologize from the heart , it should n't be because someone else has instilled it in one 's mind .
bakababwira ngo nusaba imbabazi wishe abantu bangana gutya uzafungwa igihe gito , ||| they keep telling them how when they apologize even after killing many people , they 'll be in jail for a short time .
ntaho bava ntaho bajya . ||| it 's useless .
kuko kuba bonyine batabiikuraiye mu mutaima wabo ngo babikuraeyo kubera ko babibawiyew n' umutima wabo , ni ukuvuga ngo ejo , ejo bashobora kaongera kabikora . ||| the fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again .
none se abaishe sogokuru wanjye , nibo nyuma baishe musaza wanjye nibo bamwishe ? ||| are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ?
hari hashize imyaka myinshi kandi bamwishe muri 1959 . ||| it was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 .
ni ukuvuga ngo niba bo bonyine batavuze ngo tukoze nabi tuica abaturanyi , tuica abantu tusaga nk' aho tuva inda imwe , ntacyo tubaziza , none koko reka tusabae imbabazi ; ||| meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong .
ni ukuvuga ngo ntaho bava ntaho bajya ejo bazaongera babikorae . ||| so , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again .
uravuga uti @: « kubafunga n' uguhombya igihugu . » ||| you said that imprisoning them is a waste for the country .
ese ubona kubafungura igihugu aribwo kizaunguka ? ubona hari agaciro hari icyo bizamarair abanyarwanda ? ||| do you believe the country will gain when they are free ? do you think it will be of any use for the country ?
nraumva njyewe kubafunga ... none se umuntu wishe ... umuntu wishe abantu nka kuriya abantu baishe impinja , akafata uruhinja akakubita ku rukuta uruhinja rukapfa , akafata umubyeyi akamwica amwicishije igisuti ! ||| putting them in jail in my opinion is ... a killer ... someone who killed infants , who got an infant , hit it on a wall and killed it ; who killed a mother with a shaped stick of wood !
ubundi ... uraumva wa ... kumufunga ubundi njyae nraumva atanafungwa . ||| actually ... you 'd ... i do n't think they should even be imprisoned .
nraumva yapfa ... nraumva yagombye kujya hariya akapfa , akacirwa urwo kupfa , akapfa . ||| i think they should die ... they should just die , they should be sentenced to death .
ariko se niba hafi ya bose barakoze ibintu nk' ibyo ? nraumva kubafunga ntacyo biba bimaze , ||| but if almost all of them did that , what 's the point of imprisoning ?
nraumva babarekura bakajya hanze bakajya banatubona , bakatubona kuko bo baumvaaga ko tuzashira . ||| they should let them free so they can be seeing us on the streets ; they thought we would be wiped out !
baumvaaga ko ngo umwana azajya abaza ngo ariko umututsi yasaga atae ? ||| they thought their children would be asking what a tutsi was looking like .
bakajya banatubona ... bakatubona . ||| let them see us !
kusa ikintu kinbabaza , ni nko kubona umuntu ucitse ku icumu akaumva ko yasigaye akajya mu nzaoga akaba umusinzi . ||| one thing that hurts me is seeing a survivor becoming an alcoholic .
ntabwo tukagombye kuba abasinzi , cyangwa ngo tucikae intege . ahubwo ibyabaye bikagombye kutubera impamvu yo kuva hasi , tukashaka uburyo bunri bwo kuva hasi , ||| we should n't turn into alcoholics or get discouraged .
tushaka ukuntu twakwiteza inberae ababishoboye . abatabishoboye nabo bakajya baegera bagenzi babo nta kunri ... nta kinri nbona , nta kinri . ||| on the contrary , what happened should be a reason for us to stand up and develop ourselves as much as possible for those who have the means to attain that development and those who do not have comfortable life , they could approach their friends ... that 's all i can think of .
ubona ubuzima bw' abacitse ku icumu bwitwaye kutae muri kino gihugu ? ||| what do you think of the lives of the survivors in this country ?
ibintu bya gacaca n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ubuumva kutae muri make ? ||| how do you feel about gacaca , unity and reconciliation ?
( yabanje kuseka ) ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ! ||| [ she laughs ... ] unity and reconciliation !
ubundi ntabwo ukabwiye abantu ngo ntibakaiyungae , ntushobora kubwira abantu ngo ntimukaiyungae . ||| of course you can not tell people not to be united , because if you say so , you 'd be like the people who killed the tutsis .
kuko ubwiye abantu ngo ntimukaiyungae nawe uba ubaye nk' abaishe abatutsi . ||| you would n't be any different from them .
ntaho uba utanaiye nabo . ariko ubundi ubu se ngewe unbwira ngo ngendae niyungae n' umuntu wishe alphred ? ||| on the other hand , would you dare tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed alfred ?
ubu se njyewe unbwira ngo ngendae niyungae n' umuntu wishe data ? ||| would you tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed my father ?
ni ukuvuga ngo tugomba kubaan kugirango tuubakae igihugu , ariko kuvuga ngo ngendae niyungae n' umuntu unyiciye ibyo ntabwo bishoboka . ||| yes , we have to live together in order to build the country but you can not tell me to reconcile with them .
ni ukuvuga ngo ni ukukusaba ... ni ukusaba ibintu bitashoboka . uri ubona umuntu akusaba ibintu bitashoboka n' ukukusaba ibidashoboka , ||| you would be asking for the impossible !
ibyo ntibishoboka ... ntabwo bishoboka . ||| that 's just impossible !
iyu munsi n' itariki 21/03/2007 tukaba turi ahangaha ku kicaro cya avega mu ntara y' iburasirazuba turi kumwe na mujawamariya francoise , ||| today march 21 , 2007 , we are here at the head office of avega in the eastern province with mujawamariya francoise , one of the people supported by avega . we are going to have a discussion with her and she will tell her story .
umwe mu bafashwa na avega aho tugiye kuganira nawe atubwira amateka ye kuri genocide . ||| the story of what she went through during the genocide .
mujawamariya francoise rero ndagirango mutangirae mutuibwira . ||| mujawamariya francoise you could start up with introducing yourself ?
nitwa mujawamariya francoise nkaba nvuka i gashirabwoba ahairi gisumu kiera . ||| my name is mujawamariya francoise and i was born in gashirabwoba , former gisumu .
none genocide itangira nkuko tubizi yabaye hirya no hino mu rwanda hose . mwebwe iwanyu i gisuma tugiraaga ngo mutunyurairemo mu magambo arambuye . ese genocide yabagezeho kutae ? ||| when the genocide happened ... we all know it happened all across rwanda ... you , with your family in gisumu , would you tell us in detail how the genocide affected you ?
ese yabasanze hehe ? ||| where did it find you ?
mu rugo mwari abantu mungana iki ? ||| how many people made your family ?
byabagendekeye bite ? ||| what happened to you ?
mu rugo turi abana umunani n' ababyeyi bombi . ||| we were eight children in my family with both parents .
genocide itangiye turahunga tuhungira ku bitaro mu bushenyi , ||| when the genocide started we fled to the hospital in bushenyi .
interahamwe zitusangayo aba ariho zaicira n' ababyeyi banjye n' abana tuvukanaaga , ||| interahamwes found us there and killed my parents and all my siblings .
igihe kiragera nkomeza kurorongotana tuirukanka . tuhungira ahantu hitwa kukagatamu interahamwe naho zirahatusanga , abo turi turi kumwe barabica ariko nbasha kaongera kuirukanka , ||| i continued to run ... we fled to a place called ‘ ku kagatamu ’ . interahamwes found us again and killed everybody that was with me but i managed to escape .
muri uko kuirukanka nje kuhura n' interahamwe zinfata ku ngufu . ||| while running , i met other interahamwe militiamen . they raped me but did n't kill me .
nyuma nrakomeje ntizahise zinyica nrakomeje ntahunga hari umugabo , hari umusore papa yari yaragiraiye neza ansanga aho ndi anjyana mu rugo kwa nyina , ||| ... i kept on running away ... there was a man whom dad had been in the past ... he took me to his mother 's house where they hid me .
barampisha igihe kiragera baraza kuhankura aba police ngo n' uko turi tufite umwana mu nkotanyi . ||| later , the police took me out of that house saying that i had a son in the rpf .
banjyana kunfungair kunfunga kuri commune hari commune gisuma , ||| then they took to be jailed at the commune office of gisumu .
aba police ba commune nabo baranfata ku ngufu , igihe kiragera banjyana i cyangugu ngo bafashe interahamwe nako inkotanyikazi , ||| policemen at the commune office raped me ... then at some point i was taken to cyangugu saying that they caught an interahamwe ... sorry an inkotanyi woman instead .
njyeze i cyangugu naho banfata ku ngufu abasirikare . ||| when i reached cyangugu , the soldiers raped me again .
igihe kiragera havamo umusirikare w' umurokorae ubwo yiitaaga umurokorae , ||| at some point , a born @-@ again soldier came ... he called himself so !
ambaza niba hari bene wacu nfite hakurya muri congo , nbeshya ko nbafite kugira ngo nrebae ko nrokoka . yaje kuncikaish nko mu ma saa kumi n' imwe za mugitondo nbasha kugera muri congo nambukaijew n' umu n' umu zairaw uje uri uvuye kubohoza hano i kamembe mutwaza utuntu ngera hakurya . ||| he asked me if i had any relatives in congo then i lied to him that that i did .
igihe kiragera interahamwe zitangira kuhungira hakurya zitangiye kuhunga nraongera nragaruka njya kuba mu nkambi i nyarushishi . ||| i was trying to find a way to survive .
nonese bariya bantu ba mbere bakufashe ku ngufu , ziriya nterahamwe hari izo harimo abantu uruzimo cyangwa ugereranyaije banganaaga iki ? ||| the first people who raped you , the interahamwe militia ... did you know any of them ? how would you describe them ?
bari babiri ariko bari baturutse muri karengera ntabwo nri nbazi . ||| they were two and they came from karengera . i did n't know them .
hanyuma uwo musirikare utubwiye w' umurokorae se niwe uri ukufashije kukugeza kuwo mu zairoise ? ||| the born @-@ again soldier you told us about , is he the one that helped you get to the congelese woman ?
oya yangejeje hariya hano ha hano mu muhanda abasha kunbwira ngo nii njyende njyewe ngiye mpura n' uwo mu zairoise ngeze hariya ku rusizi mpita nambukaan nawe , ||| no . he just took me up to the road and he told me to go . i went i met the congolese woman on my way and when i reached rusizi river , we crossed it together .
yangejeje mu nzira ntabwo tugeraanyeyo . ||| that man only took me up to the road but we did n't go all the way together .
hanyuma ntabwo ariko mwadusobanuriye neza ku bintu bierekeraanye n' urupfu rw' ababyeyi bawe cyangwa n' abavandimwe bawe . ||| but you did n't tell us about the death of your parents or your relatives .
ese baba baraishwe rupfu ki ? ||| how were they killed ?
ese babajugunye he ? ||| where did they throw them ?
ugerageza ukatunyurairmo . ||| could you try to tell us about that ?
papa we yari yabashije kugera hariya ku kibuga cy' umupira i gashirabwoba ba baramurashe ni n' abapo n' abasirikare bari bavuye i cyangugu barashe , ||| my dad after managing to reach the football court of gashirabwoba got shot by some policemen and soldiers from cyangugu .
bagiye kuharasa yapfuye muri ubwo buryo . ||| that 's how he died .
naho maman n' abana bo babaicishije amahiri n' imipanga hariya mu bushenge ku bitaro . ||| my mum and my siblings were killed with machetes at the hospital of bushenge .
none n' ukuvuga ng' ubungubu mu mulyango wo mwabanaga usigaye wenyine ? ||| does that mean that from your whole family and all the people you lived with , you are the only survivor ?
uuuu ||| yes .
hanyuma mu maze kuba mu nkambi y' inyabushishi bije kugenda bite ? ||| what happened in nyabushishi refugee camp ?
turagira ngo ukomezae utubwirae uko ubuzima buje kugenda kugira ngo turangizae . ||| we would like you to continue telling us how life was like went so we can wrap up .
tumaze tugiye mu nkambi i nyabushishi nri nfite musaza wanjye mukuru uri uragiye mu nkotanyi , ||| after some time in the camp in nyabushishi ... i had a brother who was in the rpf who came to know that i was in nyabushishi .
aza kumenya ko na ndi i nyabushishi aza kuhanvana anjya yabaga i butare tubana i butare ariko igihe kirageze aza kuicwa na accident ya moto . ||| he came and took me where he was staying in butare . we stayed together in butare but after sometimes he died in a motorcycle crash .
amaze kupfa ngarutse i cyangugu avega itangira kunfasha , ||| after he died i returned to cyangugu and avega started to help me .
ni muri ubwo buryo ngarutse . ||| that 's how i came back .
tugira ngo noneho ugeragezae utusobanuraire mu buryo na none burambuye kuva icyo kihae uvuye i butare utubwirae inkuru ndende y' uko avega yakumenye n' ubwo uri usanzwe ibya aribyo byose uryariye mu bushenge ariko ntabwo bipfuye kuza gutya kusa , ||| we would like you to explain in detail from the time you left butare how avega came to know about you ... of course you were admitted in bushenge hospital but i do n't avega knew you out of the blue !
hari ukuntu bigiye bigenda . ||| it must have happened in a way .
ubuzima bwawe uko bugiye bu bugenda n' ubwo bwose , noneho ugeragezae kugenda ubituha mu buryo burambuye kukomeza nyuma y' igihe kingana gutya genocide irangiye . ||| describe in detail how your life was like from the time the genocide started until late when it ended .
nrarwaye icyo kihae cyane abakozi bo kuri tribunal i kigali baza mu buryo bw' akazi i cyangugu ntinzi uburyo bamenye y' uko ndi mu bitaro . ||| i was very sick at the hospital when some staff of the tribunal in kigali came to cyangugu for work .
bansanga mu bitaro nrembye cyane bagerageza kushaka avega nibo bari bayizi nyine kugirango ibashae kunkuriikirana no kubabwira imibereho yanjye , ||| i do n't know how they found out that i was there but after visiting me , they started to look for avega ... they were the ones to know about avega . they said that they would contact avega and let them know about my status and also so they follow me up .
ariko igihe kirageze banyijyanyira i kigali njya kurwarair tribunal nako njya kurwarair roi faycal . ||| after some time they took me to kigali to be admitted to the tribunal ... no rather to king faycal hospital !
avega rero ni ni nk' uburyo bwo kusha kunshakira unyitaho mu kihae nri i cyangugu nnjyae ntabwo nri nyizi . ni muri ubwo buryo ntinzi , ||| that 's how avega started taking care of me . i never knew it before then when i was in cyangugu .
nnjyae ntinbabwira uko yamenye kuko nri nrembye cyane . ||| i do n't can n't tell you how they knew about me ... i was way too sick .
nonese abantu bo muri tribunal bakubawiyew n' iki ? ||| how did the people at the tribunal know about you ?
ese bari bakuzi ? ||| did they know you before ?
n' abantu nyine kubera ko nri nrwaraiye mu kacae nvukamo n' abantu bari ba bari baje kumenya ibintu by' ihohoterwa nabo , ||| in fact those people were working on rights abuses and ... in the area where i lived ... they asked people and they were told that i was at the hospital .
baza kubabwira ko nrwaraiye ku bitaro nyine baje ku ngo nbahae ubuhamya , usibye ko icyo kihae nri nrembye ntabashaaga kuvuga ariko nyuma yaho nrabutanze nabyo . ||| so they came to collect my testimony but ... i was so sick then that i could n't even speak but later , i was able to tell them my story .
ni muri ubwo buryo baje . ||| that 's how they came .
hanyuma icyo kihae uri mu bitaro n' inyuma y' ibyo bintu utubwiye by' ibyo b' ifataw ku ngufu . ||| during that time at the hospital it 's all after being raped .
uba uraigeze ujya kwa muganga kugira ngo wipimishe umenye niba uranduye ? ||| did you ever go to the hospital to be tested for hiv ?
icyo kihae ndi kwa muganga nibwo banpimye basanga nranduye . ||| i got tested during my admission period and that 's how i found out i was infected with hiv .
francoise ngira ngo n' ubwo ari ibintu bitoroshye nagirango utusobanuraire ese n' ubwo bwose uri urwaye urembye ariko ushoboraaga no kukeka yenda ko biba biraturutse kuri ririya fataw ku ngufu ribaye muri genocide no guhohoterwa bikabije . ese ikintu cyo kaumva uranduye ukiakiriye utae muri wowe ? ||| francoise , i know it is not something easy but i would like you to explain ... i guess when you were very sick , you could think and ... after realizing that it was the result of the raped that you went through during the genocide ... i mean how did you receive the fact of being infected with aids ?
kubera ko mbere y' intambara ntari nraigeze nbonaan n' umugabo nhise menya ko ari mu ntiambara , ||| i had never been with a man before the genocide so i immediately realized that i contracted it during the genocide .
nkimara kubimenya ba banshize ku miti kuko nri ngeze igihe , ||| immediately after figuring that out i was given medication because i had the right stage for the cure .
ntagira kubifatair roi faycal kubera ko ariho nri nrwaraiye . n' ubwo bigoye nrabiakiriye ariko ntabwo byoroshye . ||| i started taking them at king faycal hospital where i was ... even though it was hard i had to accept it .
hanyuma , ihanganae . ||| sorry but you have to be strong .
na nendaaga , nendaaga kukubaza ugeragezae kuihangana rwose unbabarirae kuko si nta kunri bigenda . ||| i wanted to ask you ... please try to be strong and bare with m but ... there is not another way .
nshakaaga kukubaza nt' ese avega nta nta wunri muntu n' umwe w' umuterankunga wigeze ubasha kuba yagira ikintu akufasha nyuma ya genocide ? ||| i want to ask if there is anyone else other than avega who has supported you after the genocide .
ntawe . ||| there is no one .
wenda ntari ninzira cyane mu bintu bya avega n' uburyo ibafasha . ||| maybe before i go into details about avega and how they help you .
uraumva genocide yarabaye ikutwarair abavandimwe irangije irarangaza ikufata no ku ngufu , ntashaka kukubaza . ha nta muntu n' umwe usibye ni n' abongabo bakufashe ku ngufu uraigeze umenya ba baba baragize uruhare mw' iicwa ry' umulyango wawe . ||| the genocide happened and it took away your relatives and you were raped ... the question that i would like to ask you is @: is there not anyone apart from the men who raped you that were involved in the killings of your relatives that you recognized ?
ntabo nmenye ntinmenye n' uko bapfuye kubera ko tutari turi kumwe icyo kihae turatataanaga ntago turi turi kumwe kuko iyo tukiba tukiri kumwe nnjyae nba nrapfuye . ||| i did n't even know how they died because i was n't with them . we were all scattered and i was n't with them . i were with them i would have also been killed .
hanyuma uba uraigeze nibura upfa kumenya n' aho babajugunye ngo nibura babae barashyinguwe ? ||| were you able to know where they threw them at least ? that could have helped burying them ?
uhh bashyinguwe hariya ku ku rwibutso rwo rw' igashirabwoba . ariko papa we bamutaye mu mu kivu kubera ko abo bose barasaiyew ku kibuga cy' umupira baba babajyanye mu kivu . ||| yes they buried them at the memorial site of gashirabwoba . my dad was drowned into the kivu lake . in fact all the people who were shot at the football court were thrown into the kivu .
ese uyu munsi abaturanyi bawe ahantu mwari mutuye ubundi ubu mubanye mutae ? ||| today your neighbours from where you used to live ... how is life like together today ?
nibura ubona nyuma ya genocide hari ubwo ujya uhagera nibura uka ukabasha ku kugira icyo uhura n' abaturanyi bo mwari muturanye ? ||| at least after the genocide when you go there , do you ever meet with people who used to live nearby ?
huuu ntabwo njyayo , ||| no i can not return there .
ntabwo nbasha kuvugana nabo ntinbishobora . ||| i can not be able to talk to them .
reka noneho genocide irarangiye , hari ingaruka nyinshi za genocide ubuzima butari bwiza nyuma ya genocide . ||| now that the genocide is over , there are many consequences after the genocide like misery .
muri ubwo buzima bwose ugize nyuma ya genocide bwumvikana ko atari bwiza , avega nayo ikaba utubwiye ko yagiye igerageza kukufasha uko ishoboye . ||| your life after the genocide ... it is clear that it was not good but you told us that avega tried to help you as much as they could .
ese ubona n' iki kintu utubwira ? ||| so what can you tell us ?
ese avega urabona ibyo aribyo byose n' ubwo ikufasha , ||| with the help from avega , do you sometimes feel that it is enough ?
hari igihe uba uvuga uti ubufasha burampagije , hari igihe uba uvuga uti nrabona inkunga ari iica ntikize . ubivugaho iki kugeza ubu ? ||| or do you feel like the help is kills more than it can save the situation ?
ubuzima nyuma ya genocide iyi myaka cumi n' itatu irashize utubwira bimeze bite ? ||| can you tell us about that ?
kubera ko avega ifasha abantu benshi inkunga igenda iha umuntu ntabwo imuhaza . nkatawe tuba tunafata imiti tubona ntacyo bitumaraiye kubera ko tuba tukeneye ibintu byinshi . ||| because avega supports many people , the support it gives to individuals can not satisfy them . for people like me who are also on medication , it does n't help because we have lost of needs .
none ha ha ngirango ahongaho ushobora kutanga inama . ese inama utanga se n' iyihe ? niyo kaongera ubushobozi avega n' iyo kushaka indi milyango ibafasha ? ||| now i would like you to share your opinion ... what kind of advice would you give ? is it to increase the capacity of avega or to look for other organizations to help you ?
mwongereye avega a i ubushobozi birushaho kuba byiza kubera ko cyangwa mutushakiye nindi milyango uko mwabishobora kuko avega nayo irageragera nta nta kibi ijya itukorera . ||| increasing avega 's capacity would be much better because ... or you could find other organizations if you can . avega does the best they can and there 's nothing negative that they do .
ikibazo ahubwo n' uko inkunga zayo aba nke cyane zika kandi zikeneye abantu benshi , nk' ubu turi tufite ishyirahamwe ririmo abantu bageze kuri mirongo hafi mirongo cyenda . ||| the only problem is that the support is very small and a lot of people need it . for instance , we have an association that has almost ninety people .
abo bose bareba avega kandi ukabona nti ntibashoboye ntibafashe uko bikwiriye . ||| all those people have their eyes on avega and it is clear to see that it does n't help them much .
ehh iryo shyirahamwe n' ishyirahamwe ryi riitwa ngw' iki ? ||| what 's the name of that association ?
tuhozaanye . ||| duhozanye .
utusobanurair mu magambo arambuye n' ishyirahamwe rikora iki ? ||| could you repeat for us in detail what this association does ?
ese abarimo ni bande ? ||| who are the members ?
harimo abantu benshi amazina yabo ntabwo nbasha kuyibuka , bari banatumiye presidente waryo niba yaje simbizi . ||| there are many people . i can n't remember their names ... they invited the lady who is the president the association but i do n't know if she came .
ari n' ishyirahamwe nyine ry' abarwayi ariko nta nkaunga rifite ihagije . ||| it 's an association of patients . it does n't have enough support though .
nta kinri kintu ibyo ari ibyo byose usibye no kaumva ko ibibazo atari ibyawe ariko kuhura na bagenzi bawe mushobora kugira igitekerezo wenda cyo kuba mwagira ikintu mukora koko biraumvikana ko niba ari ishyirahamwe ry' abantu benshi hari igihe mushobora no kungurana ibitekerezo . ||| is there nothing else apart from the fact that the problems are not just yours but meeting with your friends ... you might come up with an idea because it is clear that if it is an association of a lot of people , there are times you might be able to discuss and exchange ideas .
ugerageza kutubwira ubuzima bwo mw' iryo shyirahamwe niba hari ikintu ubona bishobora kufasha umuntu usibye no ku kaumva ko yaba atariwe ufite ibibazo kusa . ||| would you try and tell us about life in that association if there is any help that it provides to you other than knowing that you are not the only one with problems .
tubonye inkunga tushaka icyo kukora nicyo kiza cy' ishyirahamwe kandi duhuje . ||| if we ever get support , i am sure that we can find what to do . that 's the good thing about this association ... we would do it together .
none mbere wenda y' uko turangiza numvaaga hari ikindi kibazo nifuzaaga kukubaza . ||| now before we finish , there is another question .
urabona hari hari hari abadamu benshi hari abana nabo bagiye bahura n' ibibazo mu ntiambara byo kufataw ku ngufu , ||| i would like to ask you ... you see , there are lots of women and children who confronted lots of problems in the genocide .
harimo uyu munsi abarwayi barembye harimo abagiye ba banateraw n' inda bakananduzwa , bakabyara abana uyu munsi nabo baranduye . ||| that is to say rape ... and today , they are very sick , some woman got pregnant and infected ... they gave birth to children who are also infected with aids .
donc ibibazo byinshi urabona birahari , nyuma ya genocide ku nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu genocide irangiye tuvuga ko ibibazo biri kuba kubadamu bahohotewe mu ntiambara na n' uyu munsi bikiri ingorabahizi . ||| it 's clear that there are lots of problems . thirteen years after the genocide , it 's obvious that women who were raped during the genocide still face a number of problems today .
none ni iyihe message cyangwa n' ubuhe butumaw wunva uha abo bantu bose bavuzawe haruguru ? ||| now what message would you send to all the people mentioned above ?
ubutumwa nbaha cya n' uku n' ukubabwira ko bakwiriye kuihangana . ||| the message i would tell them is that they should n't give up .
huu nraumva nta kinri , usibye ko kuihangana biragoye cyane cyane iyo nta nta n' imibereho ufite birarushya . ||| i do n't think there is anything else although patience is not easy especially when you do n't have good welfare .
tsuu ariko usibye n' ikintu cy' avega ifasha bano bantu ari nayo ibaitaho wenda nvuga nga niyo yonyine , mwumva ubundi ubusanzwe , ubundi mwumva leta yakora iki ? ||| apart from what avega helping those people and looking after them ... maybe it is only avega that takes care of them ... what do you think the government should do ?
ese nka leta urabona hari igihe umuntu unavuga uti genocide yaratuishe nyuma ya genocide abantu nibura bagerageje kuitabawho , ||| do you think that sometimes ... after the genocide has destroyed someone 's life , that people have some kind of care at least ?
baravuraw cyangwa se babona ubushobozi leta ishyiraho farg . ese reka njyae nkwibarize ikibazo . nyuma ya genocide , genocide imaze kurangira ubona hari ikintu nibura kikozwe usibye n' avega kugira ngo nibura abo bantu bagiye bahura n' ibyo bibazo haba mu buryo bw' uburwayi , ||| let 's say , the government established an institution called farg ... the question is @: after the genocide , do you think that there is any effort done apart from avega regarding people confronted with diseases , regarding the issue of education , rebuilding lives ... could you say something about that ?
haba se mu buryo bwo kuiga , ||| if you believe that something was done , what is it ?
haba mu buryo bwo kuisaan kugira ngo ubuzima bukomezae . gira ikintu ibinbwiraho niba ubona hari ikintu kikozwe niba ubona harakozwe iki . niba ubona harakozwe iki uvugae uti hakwaiye kukorwa iki kugira ngo abo abantu barushaeho kuitabawho ? ||| and if you know it , could you also tell us if the help improved people 's welfare ?
ibyo bakoze byo ni byinshi kuko abantu , ||| what they did is a lot .
abana babashije kuiga n' aba bamwe na bamwe babasha kuibonera amazu yo kubamo usibye ko atari bose . ariko hariho ikibazo cy' amacumbi abantu benshi batarafata , batarabona n' ikibazo cy' imibereho mibi . ||| children were able to go to school ; some people were housed though it 's a few of them because housing and poverty are still the major problems .
nraumva ntinzi . ||| i do n't know ...
aaa aba abadamu bagiye bafataw ku ngufu ndetse bakananduzwa mu ntiambara bakeneye kubona imiti kandi tuzi ko iriya miti ihenda tuzi ko n' ubuzima bujyana n' iyo miti bisaba ko umuntu aba yifashije akabaho mu ubuzima bwiza . ntinzi niba wenda niba muri iryo shyirahamwe ryanyu cyangwa n' abantu murya muhurair muri avega . ese avega ibyo bintu byose ibasha kubishobora mukabasha kubaho muri ubwo buzima bukenera n' ibyo bintu byose , ||| all these women who were raped and also infected with aids during the war [ genocide ] need medication and we know that the medication is very expensive and we know that the life that goes along with that medication requires that you are self sufficient and a certain level of good life ... i do n't know if in that association or the people you meet in avega ... is avega able to do all of that to allow you to live a life that requires all of those things ?
nrabiumva nkubu uvuze ngo ntabwo inkunga ihagije . ariko se ushobora kutanga nk' igitekerezo ukavuga uti hakozwe ibi ku badamu baho bahuye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi bigenda bitya . imiti itabonetse aba bantu bameze batya . mbese ukagira nk' ikintu ubitubwiraho . ||| i understand ... you have already told us that the support is not enough but can you give us an idea and you maybe could tell us that if any of the woman facing these challenges could do this or ... if there was no medication for them ... just tell us something about that .
ibierekeraanye n' imiti , ||| concerning the medication , most of the people who have reached the stage to take the medication have already started to take them .
imiti yo abenshi abageze ku kihae cyo kuyifa batangiye kuyifata nta kibazo kirimo ariko iyo miti kuberako bayifata mu buzima bubi nabyo ntibibabuza kupfa kubera nyine ko iriya miti iba isaba ubuzima bwiza nk' uko ubivuze , kubaho neza kurya ibintu bifite gahu , ||| that 's not a problem but because they take the medications in poor conditions , they end up dying because those medications require a good life as you said .
akamaro kandi abenshi ntabyo babona . avega nayo ntiyabasho , ntiyabafasha ngo ibashoborae , ||| most of them do n't realize its efficiency . avega is also not able to help them .
hagize icyunganira avega biba byiza kurushaho kuko ubuzima bwabo nibura bugenda burushaho kuba bwiza . ||| if there was something else to support avega , that would be good because their life would be much better .
cyane cyane ko n' umuterankunga wa avega yahagaze ubu noneho nta n' icyo avega iri kubamarair . ||| plus , since the donors of avega stopped funding it , avega does n't help them anymore .
ntinzi n' iba hari ikintu wenda wunvaaga wifuza kuba ukaongera kuri iki kiganiro tugiraanye niba hari icyo ntakubajije wunvaaga ushaka kutubwira , nabyo ibyo aribyo byose . hari ikindi kibazo mbere y' uko nvuga ibyo ngibyo nri ngiye kukubaza , nti ese ni nubwo bwose hari ibyo bibazo byinshi bimeze gutyo ukaba ubona hari ibibazo by' ubuzima hari ibibazo by' imibereho , donc ibibazo ni byinshi biraumvikana . ese nibura wunva hari ibyiringiro by' ubuzima ? ||| i do n't know if there is anything you would like to add to this discussion that we had but if there is something i did n't ask that you would like to say , whatever it is ... there is another question before you say something , i would like to ask you ... although you have all these problems ... problems of health ... do you still have hope in life ?
ibyiringiro by' ubuzima byo , nonese ugira ibyiringiro by' ubuzima utari kubona uri kubaho neza ? ||| hope ... can you have hope in life when you realize that your current life is not good ?
nta byiringiro by' ubuzima ndi kubona cyane cyane nta n' aho kuba nfite . ||| i do n't have any hope ! i do n't even have a place i can call home .
avega yari igiye kaungurair inzu yo kubamo ariko kubera ko umuterankunga wa wayo yahagaze bihise biburizawmo , nta bu nta kaizerae cy' ubuzima nfite . ||| avega was going to buy for me a house but because the funders stopped their support ... i do n't have any hope today .
ese k' ubu tureba hashize imyaka cumi ni tatu genocide irangiye ubuzima nvuga bukaba buri mu kugenda burushaho kugenda bugoraan , nibura tuizerae ko nyuma y' igihe runaka hari igihe ibi bibazo ubona , ||| it 's now thirteen years after the genocide and obviously life gets more and more challenging but do you believe that at some point , all these problems will end ?
ubona bizashira baiga bikavaho bikashira ubuzima bukaba bugenda kubaho kuba burushaho kuba bwiza ? ||| and that people will have a better life ?
icyo kaizerae se umuntu yakikura he ? ||| where would one get that hope ?
ko nyine bigenda birushaho kuba bibi , keretse mu mugize icyo mwatumarira nraumva bugenda burushaho kuba bwiza buhoro . ||| living conditions are even getting more challenging ... maybe if you could do something , i think that would be help somehow .
usibye na ntawe nka leta y' u rwanda mwumva yo ishobora kuba yakora iki ? ||| if not individuals , what do you think the government of rwanda should do ?
cyane cyane by' umwihariko kuri bano bantu bafashwa n' avega cyangwa se n' abandi badamu bose bagiye bahura n' ibibazo mu ntiambara . ||| especially for those supported by avega or even others who faced similar problems during the war [ genocide ] .
by' umwihariko leta y' u rwanda ikwiriye kutwitaho kubera ko nraumva hi itatuitayeho nta kinri kitwitaho , ||| most especially i think the government of rwanda should take care of us because if they do n't , no one else will .
ntabwo tutegereza ibivuye hanze kandi leta y' u rwanda ariyo izi n' ibyatubayeho itabasha kutwitaho kandi ntabwo ijya itwitaho nk' uko bikwiriye . ||| we can n't wait for foreigners when the government , aware what happened to us does n't take care of us as it should !
hanyuma turangiza wenda dusoza hari ikintu wunva mwifuza wenda kugira icyo muvuga niba ntacyo nbashije cyangwa se ikindi kintu mwumvaga mwa mwatubwira ? ||| in conclusion is there anything you would like to say that i did n't ask or you would want to tell us ?
icyo numvaaga nbabwira n' uko mwagerageza gusha kushaka uburyo ubuzima bwacu bwa bugerageza kubaho kuba bwiza buhoro kuko kuba bwiza cyane bwo ntabyo ariko nibura no muri icyo kihae cyo kufata imiti tukabasha kubona ibyo kurya n' ibindi byose bijyanye nabyo nibura tukabona ko ubuzima bwacu ntawe tufite aba abo bubabaje . ||| what ... i would like to tell you is that you could try and see if you could find a way to help us to improve our lives at least as we are on medication ... so we can get food and all the other things that are related to that . then we can really feel that there are people who empathize with our sorrow
aho tugiye kuganira amateka y' ibintu bibaye muri jenocide ..... twagirango mutangirae mutuibwira . ||| we would like you to introduce yourself to us as we are about to talk about what happened in the genocide .
nitwa murebwayire josephine ntuye mu kimironko mu kagali ka nyagatovu mu karerae ka gasabo . ||| my names are murebwayire josephine i live in kimironko in the sector of nyagatovu in the district of gasabo .
ese twagirango noneho utubwirae mbere ya jenocide itaraba umuryango wanyu mwari mubayeho kutae ese uri ufite umuryango ungana iki ? ||| we would like you to tell us about your life with your family before the genocide , how big was your family ?
utusobanuraire umuryango uko unganaaga abana umugabo noneho nurangiza uzae kutuereka ishusho cyangwa se isura yuko uwo muryango wanyu uri ubayeho mbere ya jenocide . ||| explain to us and tell us how big your family was ; your children , your husband and then after try and give us an idea or paint an image for us on how your life was before the genocide .
mbere ya jenocide turi tutuye ahantu baita imasoro icyo kihae bahitaaga muri secteur ya nrera . ||| before the genocide we lived in a place called masoro at that time it was called ndera sector .
komine rubungo niho turi tutuye ubu ni akarere ka gasabo nri nfite umugabo n' abana batandatu . ||| commune rubungo is where we lived , nowadays it 's called gasabo district , i had a husband with six children .
abahungu batatu n' abakobwa batatu turi tufite nundi mwana twarairaga mwishywa w' umugabo wanjye . ||| three boys and three girls , we also had a child that we had adopted , my husband 's niece .
turi tubanye neza turi tufite urugo rwiza turi tufite imibereho ishimaishije umugabo wanjye yarakora . ||| we were living in harmony , we had a nice house , our standard of life was good , and my husband was working .
yeee hanyuma abana baangae bari bakuru bari bamaze kukura bari muri sogonderi umukuru yari ari mu wa kane sogonderi umuto yari mu wa kane primaire . ||| my children were growing up and were in secondary school , the oldest was in senior four and the youngest was in primary four .
hanyuma nri nfite n' abandi bavandimwe tubanaaga basaza banjye babiri . ||| we also lived with my two brothers .
umwe turi tumaze kumushyingira atuye hafi yacu mbese turi umuryango munini ushimaishije hanyuma jenocide yatangiye mubyukuri muri mirongo icyenda nibwo tuumvise ko inkotanyi zateye . ||| one had just gotten married and he lived near us , we were a big nice family , the genocide rally started in 1990 , that 's when we heard that the inkotanyi [ rpf ] had attacked .
bavuga ko zaturutse ibyumba ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwacumi mirongo cyenda tuesae tubiumvise kimwe n' abaturanyi bacu ntabwo turi tuzi ibyo aribyo . ||| they said they came from byumba on the 1st of october 1990 , we all did n't know what it was when we heard about it with our neighbours .
ariko itariki ya karindwi z' ukwacumi mirongo icyenda niho umugabo wanjye baje kumufatako ari ikitso k' inkotanyi . ||| on the 7th of october 1990 that 's when they came to arrest my husband saying he was a spy for the inkotanyi .
basanze atari no murugo kuko babanje kuvuga ko nta bantu bagomba kuva murugo ariko twebwe kuberako turi tufite iyo butike yari iriho musaza wanjye . ||| they did n't find him at home , because even though they had said that nobody should leave their homes , my brother went to the shop to work because it was near the house .
azamuka agiye kureba uko bimeze kuri iyo butike abaje kumufata basanze arijyewe uri murugo n' abana . ||| so my husband also went to see how things were at the shop , the people who were coming to arrest him only found me and the children at home .
ni njyewe babanje kutwara ariko babanje kukora ibindi bitari byiza gusaka kukubita , bakajya bankubita ibibuno by' imbunda baambaza ngo imbunda turi tufite irihae ? ||| so they took me first but before that they were doing bad things ; searching the house and throwing things around , hitting me with their gun @-@ butt asking me where i had hidden the gun that we had .
bayibonye bavuga yuko ariyo turebairmo inkotanyi baba babonye urwitwazo hari gurude za mazi abana bajyanaagamo amazi nubwo hari hafi ariko hari ubwo batwaraagamo amazi . ||| when they saw it they said that we use it to look at the inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . there were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them .
bavugako ari izabasirikari barankubita ariko baita babaje cyane baambaza ngo ninerekane ibyo nhishe ngo ninerekane izo nkotanyi . ||| they said it belonged to soldiers and they started beating me but not too much , telling me to show them everything else i had hidden and show them the inkotanyi .
imbunda zabo hanyuma babibuze barantwara mu modoka banbwira ngo nibamubona baranrekura turazamuka tugeze hafi yiyo butike turamubona . ||| when they did n't get the guns they took me in the car and said that if they get my husband they will release me and let me go , when we reached near the shop we saw him .
nrababwira nti dore umugabo wange nguriya araje barahagarara baramubwira ngo niinjiraemo ajyae kaubaha imbunda nabemereye ngo ariko njyewe nanze kuzibaha atampaye uruhushya . ||| so i said to them , there is my husband , he is coming . they stopped and told him to enter the car and go give them the gun i had promised them but could n't give it away without his permission .
nravuga nti muranbeshyeye baranbwira ngo ninsohoke nsangae abana ngo we baraza kumukarura . ||| so i protested that they had just lied and they told me to get out of the car and watch over the kids saying that they will bring him back later .
umugabo baramujyana nangae nramanuka nsanga abana ariko ubona ko abaturanyi bacu babonyeko koko turi inyenzi ako kanya batangira kutuha akato . ||| they took my husband and i went back home to watch over the kids but at that moment you could see that our neighbours started looking at us like we were cockroaches and stigmatizing us .
nragenda njya murugo negeranya ibintu byose bari bavangavanze negeranya amasaka negeranya n' amasukari ntabwo bagira gahunda . ||| i went home and rearranged everything they had disorganized and thrown around , wheat and sugar . they were very confused .
nuko birangije abana nrabaegeranya nrabahumuriza nrababwira nringiye nangae na papa yagiye nubu bagaruka bakantwara ariko muhurae . ||| i called all my children and started comforting them telling them that they almost took me , dad was taken , they might come back and take me too but do not be afraid .
nta muntu uri ukigera murugo yewe nuwo negeraaga ubonaaga afite ubwoba yuko ndibumukoreho . ||| nobody was even reaching our home anymore ; if i came close to someone they would seem afraid that i was going to cause them trouble .
nuko nkajya nbyuka ngenda murugo hariya irubungo ni kure ya kigali nkabura unbwira ati araha nha . ||| so i would wake up and go home , rubungo is far from kigali and nobody would direct me where he might be .
bigeze mu kwezi kwa cumi na biri baza kutubwirako tuzajya kubaza kuri seyiseyeri bakatubwira amakuru y' abantu bacu bafunz . ||| in december we were told that we can go ask at cicr about our people who were put in jail .
ntinri nhazi nzakujyayo umuntu aranyobora icyo kihae nrayobye ntiungukair kwa perezida habyarimana hariya mu kiyovu . ||| i did n't know the place so someone directed me but i got lost and went to president habyarimana 's house in kiyovu .
abasirikare banyicaza hasi baambaza ibyangombwa baambaza indangamuntu nuko baranbwira ngo ndi inyenzi nrabahakanair ko ntariyo . ||| soldiers made me sit down and asked for my identity card and then they said that i was a cockroach but i denied it telling them i was n't a cockroach .
baranbwira bati ugiye he nti ngiye kuri seyiseyeri bati ubwo ufite inyenzi ubwo ufite ibyitso nti n' umuntu wampamagaye ushaka kumpa akazi . ||| they asked me where i was going and i told them cicr so they said i was going to see spies , no someone called me to offer me a job , i said .
nuko nragenda banbwira ngo ningende nikoreye amaboko ngendae nririmba ko nta nzira iri aho . ||| so they told me raise my hands and walk away singing there is no way here .
ngenda nbivuga ariko uwo musirikari arahanyereka arahangeza mpageze rero nrabaza baranbwira bari reka turebae niba ari muri computer ntinrinzi na computer icyo aricyo . ||| one of the soldiers showed me the place and i walked away saying what they had asked me to say , when i reached there i asked and they told me they were going to check in the computer , i did n't even know what a computer was .
nti umugabo wanjye baramutwaye none baranbwiye ngo ntawe aranbwira ati noneho genda nyuma y' iminsi itatu uzagarukae kureba nragenda . ||| my husband was taken , now i am being told that he is not on the lists . so she told me to go home and come back in three days .
nyuma y' iminsi itatu nragarutse aranbwira ngo nimusigire amazina ngo azambariza nragarutse nsanga umugabo yanyandikaiye nyine anbwira amakuru ye nyine ko ari muri gereza . ||| after three days i came back , she had asked me to give her the names of my husband . she told me that my husband was in prison .
hariya 1930 ntangiye kujya njyayo ngirango nramusura ariko yarinze afungurwa nyuma ya mezi atandatu ntaramubona kimwe n' abandi . ||| so i started going to visit him at the 1930 prison but did n't see him until he was released six months after just like everyone else .
ntabwo abantu bacu tubabonaaga baravugaaga ngo nituzaane ibintu babashyirae tukajyayo kuwa kane wa nyuma w' ukwezi . ||| we were not allowed to see our loved ones ; they told us to just bring whatever we were bringing for them on the last thursday of the month , telling us that it would be delivered to them .
icyo tujyanye tukagihereza aba suruveya ariko baducunaguza ariko batukubita ntiumenyaaga niba bimugezeho cyangwa bitamugezeho . ||| so whatever we would take we would give it to the guards as they were threatening and beating us , there was no certainty that our loved ones would get it .
yafunguwe yari amazemo amezi atandatu araza tuba murugo umuntu akibaza ese bizagenda bite ariko tubona habaye akahaengae umuntu asubira mubuzima busanzwe . ||| he was released after six months and came back home , but from that point we were not sure what was going to happen next , but after a while it was peaceful and life seemed to return to normal .
bigeze muri mirongo icyenda na kabiri nibwo tutangiye kaumva baishe za bugesair bigogwe akavuga ati ubanza bitazagera hano mbese tukaumva ninko kutoranya nk' abagabo . ||| in 1992 that 's when we started hearing about the killings in bugesera , bigogwe and he would say that may be it will n't reach our region , we thought they were just selecting and killing men .
ukavuga uti noneho ngenda ntagaruka ariko tukaumva bitazafata intera ndende nkiyo bifashe muri mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| when he would walk out i would keep thinking that he will n't return but we never thought that it would be as bad as it was in 1994 .
ariko uko yagiye itangira biterawaga na karerae ese wowe iwanyu ahantu mwari mutuye ese mwabwiwe niki ko jenocide yatangiye ese mwaba mwaramenyeko iyo nregae ya habyarimana yaguye . ||| but i think the way it started depended on the region and the place where one stayed . how did you know that the genocide had started in the place where you stayed ? did you know that habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
ese bibagezeho bite twagirango utusobanuraire ? ||| how did all the events unfold in your lives , i would like you to explain and tell us ?
twebwe aho turi tutuye hari hateganyae na kanombe mubyukuri ari mu kabande ariko ibyaberga ikanombe ushoboraaga kubibona . ||| the place where we stayed was just opposite kanombe , it was in the valley but you could see everything that happens in kanombe .
indege yarahanutse ntitumenya ibyo aribyo ariko tuumva ikintu kiraturitse hari ni joro tuiryamaiye nta mashanyarazi turi tufite ngo turatarama cyane . ||| when the plane was shot down we did n't know what it was but heard a loud explosion , it was at night and we were sleeping , we did n't have electricity so that we can stay up late .
turi turyamye ariko kwa kunri abantu baba bakiri maso abantu baganira ntitubiitaho turakomeza turiryamair . ||| we were in bed but not really asleep , in fact we were still talking but when heard the explosion we did n't give it much thought and we went on sleeping .
saa kumi nimawe umugabo yafunguye radio tuumva harimo musique classique aravuga ati habaye cout d' etat igihe tukishaka kubiganiraho ngo tubijyaeho impaka . ||| at 5 am my husband turned on the radio and it was playing classical music so he said there was a coup @-@ d' etat , when we were starting to argue about it .
baba bacaishijeho itangazo niba ar' ingabo niba ari irya perezidanse ivugango indege yari itwaye umukuru w' igihugu yahanutse . ||| there was an announcement on the radio am not sure if it was from the president 's office or the military command but it said that the plane carrying the president had crashed .
ubwoba buratuica turabyuka nramubwira nti turashize aranbwira ati reka reka ati uwaduhigaga arapfuye none ngo turashize nramubwira nti oya nti ntabwo tukize ahubwo turashize . ||| we were terrified and woke up , i said to him that its over for us but instead he said no the one who wanted us dead is gone and you are saying its over for us , i replied and said that we were not going to live instead it was over .
ngo barajya kwa nde barica kwande ahubwo babiteguye kera indege iba imbarutso . ||| they knew where to find everybody and who to kill , it was planned long ago , the plain just marked the beginning .
kusa wo kugirango barangizae umurimo wabo ariko ntabwo aribwo jenocide yatangiye baraitoje bakora gahunda neza ahubwo nvuga ko uwo munsi aribwo bayinonosoye . ||| that 's when they started working but that 's not when the genocide started , because they were already well trained and had planned , so i say that 's the day when it was implemented and perfected .
ni nabwo jenocide yarangiye nubwo aribwo yatangiye ubwo abasirikari baraje bazana n' umwana w' iwacu aje kubayobora . ||| that 's when the genocide was over even though that 's when it started , so the soldiers came with one of our children showing them the way .
bamufashe munzira yari umwana w' abatutsi kuko hahigawaga abatutsi ariko niwe ubazanye bari bafite liste y' abantu benshi ariko ari twebwe turi ku isonga . ||| they found him on the way , tutsi 's were being hunted and him being one they got him and he brought them . they had list with many names and ours were at the top of the list .
baraza nkinguye nyine turakubitaan barambwirango mwishimye se ngo abantu bahanuye indege y' umukuru w' igihugu barihae hehe ? ||| when i opened i saw them and they said that i must be happy and they asked for the people who shot down the president 's plane .
nravuga nti se bari hano ngo ariko mwishimye nti se tuishimye umuntu yishimira ko undi yapfuye . ||| i said there was nobody here and told them that we can not be happy because someone else died .
ngo nti mwamwangaga se nti se tumwanga turamuzi cyangwa we aratuzi nti ntabwo tuishimye nti tubimenye nkuko abandi bose babimenye . ||| did n't you hate him , they said ? can we hate someone we do n't even know or does he know us ? we heard it like everyone else .
ntabwo bitushimaishije ntawishimirako undi yapfuye ngo kandi araimawe mwamuhanuye ngo kandi inyenzi zamuhanuye ari zenewanyu . ||| nobody is happy that he died especially when you are the ones that shot down his plane and the cockroaches who did it are your relatives
tuhae amafaranga ati nta mafaranga nfite bati urayatuha ati ubu se ko musanze nryamye ngaho nimuyashake ubwo kikora urabiumva ntibari kumureka baramukubise amafaranga yari afite arayabaha . ||| give us money . i do n't have money , he replied . you will give it to us , they said . he told them that they had found him sleeping and asked them to look for it . they did n't just let him go , they beat him and he gave them all the money he had on him .
baramubwira bati umugore wawe ashobora kuba abitse amafaranga menshi abagore nibo babika amafaranga . ||| they said to him , your wife must be keeping a lot of money ; women are the ones that keep money .
baraza barankingurair abana baraongera barabakingirana nragenda bati tuhae amafranga umugabo wawe avuzeko ari wowe uyabitse . ||| they opened the door for me and kept the children locked up , and then they told me to give them the money that my husband had told them that i was the one keeping it .
nti nta mafaranga nfite rwose bati tuhae nrababwira nti se ubunriko mwaje mufite ibyo mushaka mwakwihaye ibyo mushaka ariko mukatubisa . ||| i told them that i did n't have any money as they kept asking for it . so i said to them , why do n't you take whatever you want and leave us in peace , it is clear that you came for a purpose .
nuko bafata ibibabangukaiye baragenda barangije baravuga ngo yemwe turi tuje kuishakira ibintu ngo ababica bari inyuma . a ||| so they took whatever they could manage as they were going away and said that they were only there looking for what to take but those who were going to kill us where on their way .
bahita bagenda bamaze kugenda bimaze kuba hafi saa tatu abantu bo kugasozi ka batutsi abagore babo bose tubona baramanutse baje iwacu . ||| they went away and then around 9h we saw the wives of all the tutsis on one of the hills coming towards our house .
turi tufite urugo runini cyane nrababwira nti se ko muje hano muziko hano ariho ibintu bicikair bwa mbere nitwae batwaye mu byitso murajya he . ||| we had a big compound , so i asked them why they were coming at our home when it was the first place where they look , we are the ones they arrested first as spies , why did you come here ?
nitwae babanje bwa mbere bati oya wenda tupfaane cyangwa bigenda ukundi ariko turaguma hano . ||| we were the first ones to be arrested . no , may be we 'll die together or something like that but we are not living this place .
nbasaza banjye babiri n' abahungu baangae babiri bakuru basigara murugo nragenda n' abana batoya abana banjye bane nako kakobwa twarairaga nabo badamu turi kumwe . ||| my two brothers and my two older sons also stayed home and i went with the four remaining children with the girl that we had adopted and the other women that we were together .
tugeze hakurya abantu batangira kutukumira batubuza kugenda naho zari interahamwe zihunze inkotanyi i remera . ||| when we reached a bit farther some people started blocking our way stopping us from moving forward but we did n't know that they were interahamwe fleeing inkotanyi from remera .
kuko ntituri tuzi ibyo aribyo tutangira kutatana bamwe bakaca murutoki abandi bakagenda uraumva tuvuye murugo ari ku manywa ariko tugeze ahantu tushakaaga kujya inrera ariko biratunanira tuhura n' umuntu aratubwira ati hariya hari bariyeri . ||| but we did n't know what was happening and started separating some going through the banana plantations , others going on along the way . we left home during the day but almost reaching our destination , a place called ndera it was n't possible because we met someone who told us that there was a road block just ahead .
abandi barakomeza bajya ahantu hitwa ijurwe ngewe n' abana tujya ahantu hari imyumbati tuihishamo tubonye imodoka y' abapolisi tubamo tugeze k' umugoroba hatakibona . ||| the others continued to a place called jurwe , me and my children we went and hid in a place where there was cassava when we saw a police car , we stayed there until it was dark in the evening .
turagenda noneho yanzira y' inrera turayireka tufata inzira y' ahantu hitwa i musave uri bawije hatabona tusanga abantu bose niho bahungiye hari hara mashuri . ||| we went on but decided not to go to ndera but instead went to a place called musave , it was dark and we could n't see but reaching there found that that 's where everyone took refuge , there was a school .
nbwira abantu turi turi kumwe nti nnjyae nimunyicire ririya shuri nangae nigairemo n' abana nrabona hariya hauzuye . ||| so i asked the people i was with to force the door open of one of the classrooms since all the other classrooms seemed full .
naho ubwo nrabwira interahamwe nziko ari abantu b' iwacu tuturanye ishuri barariishe turaramo n' abakozi ||| i did n't know that i was telling interahamwe , i thought i was telling my people . they forced the door open and we spent the night there with the workers .
n' abandi bana babaturanyi mu gitondo hafi saa mbiri nbona abandi baratetse nta kintu nri njyanye kikora nri ntwaye isukari yo nri nyibutse jya kutira isafuriya . ||| with other children that were our neighbours , in the morning around 8 am i saw that the others were cooking but i had n't taken anything except for sugar that i had remembered , i went to borrow a saucepan .
kuberako nrinfite souvenir mbi cyane ngewe natakaye mu ishyamba iwacu bahunga muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu . ||| i had very bad memories because i got lost in the forest when my family was fleeing in 1963 .
ntoraguraw n' abantu noneho nkahora numva umwana wange murekuye nawe yatakara ubwo nrabakuruye tugeze inberae gato tuhura n' imodoka y' umuhungu w' iwacu ariko nawe yari interahamwe . ||| i was found by some people , so i felt that if i let go of my child they would also get lost . so i pulled them and when we reached a little bit further we saw a car and inside was a guy form our region but he was an interahamwe .
yari umushoferi w' imodoka ya komini yari aje kutwara umuryango we uri uraho ngaho turi tuhararaanye . ||| he was a driver of the commune and was coming to take his family which had also spent the night in the same place with us .
nbona nramuzi noneho nramubwira nti none se nangae mwanshyizemo mukantwara n' abana arancira mu maso aranbwira ngo urajya hehe se ko akanyu kashobotse ubwo arabapakiye baragiye . ||| i recognized him and i asked him if he could also take me with my children , he spit in my face and asked me where i was going since it was over for us . he packed his family in the car and left .
nnjyae ntakomeje nkururaan n' abana tugenda n' amaguru tugana inrera tugeze mu nzira ahantu baita imusave ugiye kugera inrera . ||| so i kept pulling my children behind me as we walked towards ndera , when we were almost there at a place called musave .
tuhura n' imodoka irimo burugumesitiri wa rubungo ari kumwe nundi mugabo wiwacu nawe uruje kureba umuryango we uri uraho ngaho abana turi turaraanye . ||| we saw a car with the head of region of rubungo and another man that was also from our region who was also coming to see his family which had spent the night in the same place with us .
nti abana bagiye nti bababwiye ko maman wabo ariho nti abana bagiye nuko atushyira mu modoka aratujyana atugeza inrera kuri paruwasi . ||| i told him that his children had left ; they were told that their mother was alive . so , he put us in the car and took us to ndera at the catholic parish .
aravuga ati umugabo wawe nba bahungu bawe bari inrera kuri paruwasi ngwino nbakushyirae turagenda tutaragera kuri paruwasi tugera ahantu hitwaaga mugahoromani tuhasanga bariyeri . ||| he said , your husband and sons are at the catholic parish let me take you there . we went but before reaching the parish we reached a place called mugahoromani and there was a roadblock .
yitwa rugengamanzi niwe uri padiri mukuru aratuakira azana yari yabahaye nibyo bateka batetse baratuakiriye baratugaburiye tubonako tubonye ubuhungiro . ||| he is called rugengamanzi , he was the head priest . he welcomed us ; he had even given them food to cook . so they welcomed us and gave us food and we were comforted that we had got refuge .
ariko ngewe kuri paruwasi nkaumva simpashaka kubera hari umugabo tuhoraaga tuhanganye kuva umugabo wanjye yafungwa mubyitso . ||| but personally i did n't want to stay at the parish because there was a man that we were not at good terms with since my husband was imprisoned among the spies .
umupadiri witwa kakuba yahoraaga ampiga anbwira abantu ko ndi ikitso ko turi inyenzi mbese akahora ashakisha ikintu kituma hari ncika no mu kiriziya ahari kikatuma n' abantu baangirira nabi . ||| a priest called gakuba always looked for me telling people that i was a spy , that we were cockroaches , always looking for a reason that i would stop me from coming to church or cause other people to harm me .
nuko noneho nbwira umugabo nti ariko aha hantu ntabwo bahakorotiriye nti kandi dore abantu barimo barahagendagenda nti kandi na kakuba ntubona arahatutsinda ||| so i told my husband that the place had no fence and people were walking in and out at ease and also told him that if gakuba sees us he will kill us .
nti tuigirae mu iseminari ubwo hari ku itariki ya munani nuko ducunga abandi ku jisho tuigira mu iseminari abandi t . basiga aho ngaho ariko biri biegeranyae . ||| so i told him that instead we go to the seminary , it was the 8th . so we made sure nobody saw us and then went to the seminary which was not very far away .
n' abana banjye bose na basaza baangae bose turagenda tujya mu iseminari turaharaye hari ahantu hari isale tuicaye turaye tusenga mbega tubonaaga ibintu bitameze neza . ||| with all my children and brothers we went to the seminary where we spent the night . there was a hall and we spent the night praying because things were not well .
bashyiraho gouvernement ya batabazi nibwo tumenyeko tuvanze n' interahamwe baratangira barishima noneho tukaumva ntabwo tukivuga ibintu bimwe . ||| the interim government was put in place , that 's when we found out that we were mixed with interahamwe because they started celebrating , all of a sudden we did n't talk the same language .
turara tufite ubwoba buracya mugitondo ku itariki ya cyenda niba guverinoma barayishyizeho ku yamunani niba ari kuya cyenda simbyibuka ariko ni muri iyo minsi ku itarik ya cyenda ku wagatandatu hari mugitondo ||| we spent the night in a lot of fear , in the morning of the 9th , i do n't remember well if the interim government was put in place on the 8th or 9th but it 's around that time . so on the morning of the 9th .
rwose hariho intambara ati reka bagumae aha nkaha ntacyo babaye nibirangira bazataha ati mwanze mwanze kubarekurae ati se mwabaretse ko taubaha abasirikare bo kubarinda . ||| there is still a war going on out there , let them stay here they are ok when its all over they will go back home . so you do n't want to let them go ? let them go and we will give them soldiers to protect them , mbonapeka said .
baravuga bati ariko abo bantu bo kubarinda ntabwo bajya barinda buri muntu ati nibabarindire ahangaha aho bari . ||| those people who are going to protect them can not protect every single one of them , let them protect them from here .
mbonampeka aragenda hashize akanya gato cyane tubona aragarutse n' abasirikare baba padiri baba barabarashe . ||| mbonampeka went away and after a short while he came back with soldiers and shot the priests .
bari abapadiri babahutu umwe yari na mwishya wa musenyeri nsengiyumva yitwaaga naniya rukasair undi we ananiya ubwo yahise apfa ako kanya . ||| they were hutu priests ; one was bisop nsegiyumva 's nephew , he was called naniya rugasira and the other was ananiya , he died on the spot .
uwitwa ndereya nubu ngubu arahari aba hariya muri saint michel baba baguye aho ubwo noneho bahita bavuga ngo uziko ari umuhutu wese nfatae irangamuntu ye asohokae . ||| one who is called andre now lives at st. michael 's , they died on the spot . so they said whoever is hutu walk out with your identity card .
noneho batangira kuivangura umuhutu akaerekana indangamuntu nutayerekanye bibaga bigaragara akasohoka . ||| so people started walking out showing their identity cards and the ones who did n't show it , it was still visible .
abashatse kuihishamo babana babasore babatutsi bagiye babarasair ku irembo amasasu atangiye kuvuga ubwo ntawe tugumaye aho ngaho biratuyobeye abana banjye babiri babahungu bakuru babona abandi barimo barasoka noneho baraza baratureba aho turi tuicaye . ||| young tutsi men who tried to hide in the crowd were shot from the gate . we did n't know what to do , two of my older boys so the other people going out and came to see us where we were seated .
baradupopera baratubwira ngo tuzahurair mu ijuru bo bakoze icyo kusimbuka igipangu bariruka bagwa inyuma na musaza wange umwe . ||| they waved goodbye at us and said that we weill meet in heaven , they jumped the fence and ran away with one of my brothers .
nyinshi cyane baraza baratubaza bati amafaranga ya habyarimana mwayikwije muri inkotanyi muri inyenzi mutuhae amafaranga y' umubyeyi wacu . ||| there were very many and said , you took all of habyarimana 's money when your inkotanyi and cockroaches , give us our father 's money .
ati kandi uwo tusangaan n' igiceri turamwica ubwo ngwee n' umugabo nta kintu turi tufite uretseko turi twagerekeranyije imyenda kusa nta ni giceri turi tufite . ||| and whoever we find with even a coin will be killed , me and my husband did n't have anything except wearing a lot of clothes , we did n't have any money on us .
nuko abayafite barayatanga ariko ntabwo ariyo bashakaaga mubyukuri biri ukwiyenzi barangije bashaka kutera grenade aho ngaho turi turimo . ||| so whoever had money gave it away , but they did n't really want money they were just toying with us . after that they tried to throw a grenade where we were .
noneho grenade haza umukobwa uri unbaye ibintu by' amashara nundi mugabo uri ufite umuheto n' imyambi hari amazina bari bafite . ||| and then a lady who was wearing clothes with pearls came in with another man who had a bow with arrows , they had a list with some names .
hari uwitwa pasteri na rukaanika n' umugabo wange na nkundabarashe ariko we ntibamuhamagaraaga cyane bahamagaraaga pasteri na rukaanika . ||| on the list was a man called pastor , rukanika , nkundabarashe and my husband , but they did n't call out my husband a lot , they called out for pastor and rukanika .
noneho hakaba hari undi musore witwaga mutsinzi nawe baramuhigaaga noneho bamwambika kuvureri baramutwikira amera nk' umudamu . ||| there was also another young man called mutsinzi that they were looking for , they put a bead cover on him which made him look like a woman .
arangije we abasohokamo ariruka yirutse baramurasa noneho baba babonye umugabo wanjye ngo dore nayanyenzi iruta izindi ngo haguruka baramuhagurutsa . ||| he tried to run away but they shot him , and then they saw my husband and said , here is the head of all the cockroaches , stand up , they said .
bahagurutsa n' abana banjye babakobwa babiri barabasohokaan babajyana hanze njyewe ntibanbona nri negamye inyuma y' abandi badamu . ||| they also told my two daughters to stand up and took them outside but they did n't see me because i was behind some other women .
noneho uwo mukobwa abambura imyenda yabo ahita ayambara bari baambaye amapantalo arangije arababwira ngo nimugendae murapfair rimwe n' abandi ntawe ugiye kupfusha umwanya ubusa ||| the woman removed their clothes and wore them , they were wearing trousers . she said to them , go back you will die at the same time with everyone else no one is going to waste anytime .
babakarura munzu babagaruye munzu wa mukobwa aba aranbonye ati tusohoye umwana tuibagirwa nyina ati kuramo iyo myenda barampagarikiye imyenda nyikuramo nta muntu wayinkuragam . ||| they brought them back inside the house and then the lady saw me and said , we took the child and forgot the mother remove all your clothes . they watched as i removed all my clothes .
nkuramo imyenda yose nsigaraan agakanzu nri nambaye ndayimuhereza baragenda nka nyuma y' iminota nk' icumi nibwo bagarutse barasa umugore witwa makurata ni n' umugore wuwo mugabo witwa pasteur . ||| i removed all my clothes and gave them to her as they walked away and only remained with a small dress i had on . after around 10 mins that 's when they came back and shot a woman called makurata , the wife of pastor .
bamurasa amaguru baramubwira ngo nhagurukae kandi bamurashe amaguru bagenda bamukurura ntawe baratusohora . ||| they shot her legs and asked her to stand up when they had shot her legs ; they dragged her as they took us all out .
mubyukuri buri muntu ngirango ubanza yari afite abantu babiri bo kumwica bari benshi cyane baradusora batujyana mu kibuga baratubwira ngo nituryame . ||| they were so many i think each one of us had two people to kill him , they took us in a field that was there and asked us to lie down .
unzae kuryama bakakutema uhagaze byose biri kimwe turaryamye mperuka uko nryamye nramye nfatanyae mukiganza n' umwana wanjye w' umukobwa . ||| if you did n't lie down they would hack you with a machete , it was all the same whether you lied down or stood , we lied down . my last memory is that i lied down holding hands with my daughter .
abandi nabo nbashyira iruhande rwange mbese numvaaga batanva iruhande nuko turaryama tuubitse inda batuerekaaga position turi buryamaemo bari bafite ukuntu bari bubigenze . ||| and i put the others on my side , i did n't want to part with them , they told us to lie down with our stomachs on the ground , they knew how they wanted it done .
ikintu mperuka nuko kuryama nongeye kugira ubwenge nbona barantemaguye ubwo batutemye ari nko ku itariki cumi nimawe bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi nebyiri nibwo imvura yaguye numva nbaye nk' umuntu ukangutse ||| my last memory was lying on the ground i regained consciousness only to see that i was hacked , i think it was on the 11th , at around 6pm is when it started raining and i felt like i was waking up .
nuko baragenda bigeze nijoro ngenda negura nbona bianga ubwonko buri busohotse nnjyae aho batemye bugombaaga kuba busohotse . ||| so they walked around and then at night i tried to lift myself up but it was very hard , i think my brain was out where they had hacked and cut me .
nuko ari imaan yankijije kuko aho bantemye ni nkaho bari batemye abandi bose . ||| it 's just that god kept me otherwise they had hacked me just like everyone else .
nuko nravuga nti ubu nabo baraza guhembuka nti jyewe se ko nahembutse kandi bari bantemye . ||| so i thought to myself that the others will also wake up since i had also woken up after being hacked .
nicara aho ngaho muri iyo mirambo ngiye kubona nbona za nterahamwe ziragarutse . ||| i sat there among all those corpses and then all of a sudden the interahamwe came back .
ngenda ngiye kumywa amazi igiye kunkubita umupanga indi iramubwira iti ariko se uyu mugorae igihe utaemeye ntiuhaze . ||| i went to drink water and then as one of the interahamwe was about the hack me with a machete another asked him , you have hacked this woman so many times are n't you satisfied ?
ngo ntago ariho ngo nnabaho ngo azaicwae n' agahinda ngo murekae . ||| she is n't really alive and even if she lives let her die of sorrow , leave her alone .
baragenda nrangije nbona umupadiri uri uhagaze inberae ya chapelle ubwo umurambo wuwo nguwo ananiya niho bari bawushyize ahagaze k' umuryango . ||| they went away and then i saw a priest standing in front of a praying room that 's where they had put ananiya 's corpse .
ngenda musanga tuziraanye ariko aranyoberwa kubera ukuntu nri nbaye nramubwira nti se wampishe aho ngaho nti ko hano bari kuza kandi ko bari bunyicae nabi . ||| i went towards him , i knew him but he did n't recognize me because of the way i had become , i asked him to hide me inside since the interahamwe were coming back and they were going to kill me badly .
ninjiramo niba ariwe untwikiraiye uruyuzi ni ari imaan icyo nzicyo nzicyo nuko bagarutse kunshaka ngo banrangizae bakaambura . ||| i went there , i do n't know if he is the one that covered me with those plants or god but all i know is that they came back looking for me to finish me off and they could n't find me .
bahita bagenda bavuga ngo ariko se wa mugorae uri uraha ngo agiye he ngo aciye he se ko atakinguye ? ||| they walked away saying , where is the woman that was here , where did she go since the priest did n't let her in ?
baranshaka ngo yewe ngo niba akinariho ngo ntago ejo azagaruka nrara muri urwo ruyuzi bigejeje mugitondo nko mu ma saa kumi nimawe . ||| they looked for me and then said , even if she is still alive she is not coming back tomorrow . i spent the night there and then in the morning around 5am .
nsubira muri ya mirambo nraongera nreba abana banjye bose nkasanga ubwonko bwabo busohotse nreba umugabo . ||| i went back and looked at the corpses , looking at my children and i could see their brains , i looked at my husband .
we nkabura ahantu bamutemye ariko yapfuye yari afatanyae nundi mugenzi we mu ntoki bapfuye bafatanyae . ||| i could n't see where they had hacked him but he died holding another man 's hand , they died holding each others hands .
nuko nragaruka nicaramo muri iyo mirambo nraicara ngeze aho nravuga nti ariko se ubu nraicara . ||| so i sat among the corpses and then after a while i asked myself what i was doing .
ngeze aho nravuga nti ariko se ubu nraicara aha ntahakora iki noneho nzenguruka hahanri hose ngeze aho nravuga ngo reka basi njyae hariya muri toilette . ||| so i asked myself what i was doing among the corpses and then i walked around and then decided to go in the toilet .
mbe ariho njya noneho nravugaaga nti noneho nibaza uretse no kunyica barankorera n' ibindi byose birenze no kuica nkaumva nfite ubwoba bwa viol . ||| let me hide in the toilet , i was thinking to myself that if they return except killing me they were also going to do other bad things , i was really afraid they were going to rape me .
barakomeje bakajya baza aho ngaho bakaza bakituma ariko yayinri ntibayizemo . ||| they kept coming to use the toilets but they did n't enter in the one i was in .
noneho hashize iminsi nk' itatu bagendaaga basubira muntumbi ariko bareba niba nta urokotse . ||| after around three days they were still going through the bodies checking if there were no survivors .
hashize nk' iminsi nk' itatu nibwo mbonampeka yazanaaga essence arabarundanya barabatwika nkaumva barabivuga ndaho muri toilette . ||| after three days is when mbonampeka brought fuel , piled up all the corpses and then burnt them , i heard them saying it from the toilet .
bararundanya baratwika bacukura aho ngaho inberae ya chapelle babashyiramo barenzaho itaka baragenda . ||| they piled and burnt them and then dug a hole in front of the praying room and threw them in and then covered it and left .
ariko ubwo nkajya nvuga nti wenda hari umwana wanjye uriho nkuko nnjyae nriho kuko ukuntu bari bangize ntago ngombaaga kuba nriho . ||| but i kept saying to myself that may be one my children was alive just like i was , because the way they had made me i was n't meant to be alive .
ubundi nkavuga nti ba bana banjye buriya bairukanse bo hari uwarokotse mbese nihishaaga nvuga ngo hari uwarokotse . ||| and then i would say that may be my boys who ran away at least there is one who survived , i hid myself because i thought there was a survivor .
nuko nbaye aho muri toillete iminsi ibiri itatu nta kintu nywa amaraso yanvuyemo yaravuye yarakamye . ||| so i stayed in that toilet two three days without drinking anything , i had lost so much blood till there was no more to bleed .
nuko k' umunsi wa gatanu nibwo haje umwana wigaga aho ngaho mu iseminari nawe bari baratemye intumbi ziramugwira ariko ntibamutema ariko basa nabamukomeretsa akantu gatoya . ||| on the fifth day is when a student from that seminary came , they had hacked people and corpses fell on him but they did n't really hack him but he was wounded a little bit .
ararunguruka arungurutse aranbona niwe utangiye kumpa amazi yo kumywa akajya akoza akantu ku rurimi agatonyanza . ||| he peeped through and saw me ; he is the one who gave me water to drink . he would give me tiny little droplets on my tongue .
akanbwira ati numywa menshi arakuica tubaye aho ngaho muri toilette haza kuzamo n' abandi bana . ||| he would say to me that if i drink a lot , the water would kill me . we stayed in that toilet and were joined by other children .
mbega tuhavuye turi nk' abantu nka batanu bahaza buhoro buhoro ubwo tubayemo kugeza ku itariki ya 01/05 nibwo baturokoye baragenda umwana umwe uje wigaga mu iseminari nawe uri uturutse iruhanga . ||| more people kept coming slowly ; by the time we left we were around five people . we stayed there until may 1st , that 's when they helped us from there ; we were also joined by another young boy @/ girl who also studied in the seminary .
ntinzi aho yakuye ikintu niba ari icyuma niba ari urwembe rushaje niwe unyogoshe imisatsi yarafashe mu bisebe ariko imisatsi kuyikuramo biramunanira . ||| i do n't know where he got a knife or a razor blade , he is the one that shaved me , my hair was stuck in my wounds and he could n't remove it .
abaganga b' inkotanyi nibo banvuye batangiye kunvurair inrera haraboze nangae ubwange ntinrinziko nzakira cyangwa ngo ni nkira ngo mbe muzima . ||| the inkotanyi doctors are the ones that treated my wounds ; they started treating me from ndera . my wounds were rotten and i did n't think that they would heal or even if they healed that i would be normal again .
ariko rero baranvuye bageze aho bajyana n' ibyumba niho nvuraiyew ubwo rero abana banjye bose uko ari batandatu n' umugabo wanjye na basaza banjye n' umugore wa musaza wange . ||| but they treated me and then they took me to byumba , that 's where i was treated from . so all my six children , my husband , my brothers and my sister @-@ in @-@ law .
bose barapfuye ariko muri uko kupfa ntabwo nrinziko bose bapfuye numvaaga abana babiri bashobora kuba bariho nravugaaga nti ntago bapfuye rwose barirutse . ||| they are all dead , but i did n't know that they were all dead . i thought that my two sons were alive , i kept saying to myself that they ran away , they are not dead .
wenda buriya babayeho nkajya mpora nraumva bariho ndetse umuntu aza no kunbwira ngo hari umwana wange w' umukobwa uhari . ||| i kept thinking that maybe they are alive , there is even someone who told me that my daughter was alive .
noneho musaza wanjye wo kwa maman wacu yari ari ibyumba akora kuri prefecture niwe uje kuhankura aranjyana aranfasha . ||| so one of my cousin @-@ brother from my mother 's side is the one that moved me from there and started helping me .
ariko ubwo ngubwo tuva inrera nbonye ukuntu abana banjye bapfuye nravuga nti . ||| but when we were coming from ndera i saw they way my children had died and said .
kuko hari n' abandi bana barokotse nkavuga nti hari abarokotse wenda barabatwaye nangae reka ntwarae aba babanri . ||| maybe someone took my children adopting and helping them , even me let me help some .
mbese nri nrahahamutse numva abana nta mwana ugomba kubabara nuko ubwo ngeze ibyumba nfite abana bagera kuri batanu ubwo musaza wange agiye kuntwara . ||| i had been traumatized i did n't want any child to suffer so i reached byumba when i had around five children when my cousin @-@ brother was coming to take me .
bamwe nbajyana muri orphelinat undi umwe muha umuntu w' umusirikari aragenda amwigirira kadogo . ||| i took some of them in an orphanage ; i gave the other one to a soldier who turned him into a kadogo @/ child soldier .
nuko intambara irangiye rero ngaruka mu matongo ariko nsanga barahashenye barahamaze hanyuma rero umwana nbereye nyinawabo . ||| after the war i came back home but they were just ruins , they had destroyed everything , one of my nephews .
niwe watubohoreje inzu njyamo n' abandi bana babavandimwe be jyamo turabana . ||| he is the one that got a a house for us , i went in with some of his siblings .
nbabera nyina bambair abana hanyuma baza kubona umuvandimwe wabo abatwara hanze . ||| i became their mother but they got a relative who took them abroad .
ufite ukwamera ni muri ubwo buryo rero ngiye nshaka abana b' imfubyi tukabana ubonye abe akabasanga utabafite akansanga . ||| that 's how i got orphans and took care of them and when they would find their family they would go and stay with them and if not they stay with me .
aha unbwiyeko igitero kije kubica mwari muri inrera ? ||| you told me that the people that came to kill you were in ndera ?
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu mu iseminari . ||| hummmm , at the seminary .
noneho nreba noneho nreba n' ahantu mwari mutuye biragaragarako harimo akanya aho babiciye izo nterahamwe nizari zivuye aho mwari mutuye cyangwa niza hanri ? ||| looking at where you lived its evident that it 's a long distance from where they killed you from . were those interahamwe from the region where you lived or from somewhere else ?
yewe iby' interahamwe rero baraguranaaga abi nrera bakajya i kanombe ab' i kanombe bakajya i kanombe nkubwo ngubwo rwose interahamwe zaishe aho ngaho mu iseminari urebye nizikanombe . ||| the interahamwe would take turns , those from ndera would go to kanombe , and those from kanombe would go to ndera . the interahamwe that killed form the seminary must have been from kanombe .
nizi ikanombe zari kumwe n' abasirikari ariko rero nab' iwacu kuko abana banjye bakuru barahunze basubira kumusozi w' iwacu . ||| even those from kanombe were with soldiers , also those from our region , because my eldest sons fled and went back on our hill where we lived .
na musaza wange umwe niho baguye , niho baguye ariko ntabwo nri nraigeze nbimenya . ||| with my one brother that 's where they died from but i did n't know about it .
nhoraaga nshakisha muri mirongo icyenda na karindwi niho tugiye mukikorwa cyo kushyingura amagufa yari yandagaye k' umusozi . ||| i kept looking for them , in 1997 is when we went to bury the remains that had been scattered on our hill .
banbwira ngo bari aha nha aho banyeretse amagufa nkagenda kutoragura nta bimenyetso nshakaaga nhitaaga nvuga nti ubu nibo rwose . ||| they would tell me that they are in this particular place , wherever they would show me bones i would not look for signs and i would think to myself finally i have got them .
ejo bunri mu bihumbi bibiri na gatanu ngirango nibwo tushyinguye hari mukwezi kwa kane . ||| recently in april 2005 is when we buried .
umuntu aranyemeza ati nihariya noneho rwose ni nangae unabishyinguraiye ngwino njyae kubakuha nragenda ndataburura abantu makumyabiri na batatu nbashyinguye ku gisozi . ||| someone convinced me that he knew where they were buried saying he was the one who had buried them , lets go i show them to you . i excavated twenty three people and buried them at gisozi .
nama sanduka manini cyane n' imisaraba yanditseho ayo mazina yabo nuko ariko biza kugaragara ko yanbeshyaaga ntinzi icyo yaragamije . ||| they are very big graves with crosses written on their names but i realized that he was lying to me .
niba yari abizi cyangwa atari abizi ntinzi ngewe nayobowe ibyo aribyo . ||| i do n't know if he knew what he was doing or not but i was really shocked .
mu makuru ya gacaca niho haje umwana ubanaaga n' abana banjye bangana niwe uvuze ibyo aribyo ni nawe uvuze uko babataye muri toilette . ||| n gacaca si where child who knew my children , he @/@ she was there age mate , he @/@ she is the one that clarified and said that they were thrown in a latrine .
nibwo babatabururaga mu kwezi kwa cumi tubashyingura mu kwa cumi na biri noneho ari ariko n' ibimenyetso byabo nrabibona n' amarangamuntu . ||| that 's when they were excavated in october and we buried them in december and i saw signs that it was really them , like identity cards .
amakarita y' ishuri imyenda yabo uretseko kusa bari barabaye utugufa barashengaguritse . ||| school cards and their clothes but they were just bones because they had decomposed .
twataburuye abantu magana abiri na mirongo itanu icyo kihae kandi abantu bahariya iwacu baratubeshyaaga tugataburura abataribo buri kihae . ||| that day we excavated two hundred and fifty people , before that people kept lying to us and we would excavate the wrong people .
tushyinguye inshuro nyinshi tushyingura abntu batari abacu ariko n' abanyarwanda tushyinguraaga . ||| we buried a lot of times burying people who we were not related to but we were burying rwandans .
ntabwo tubyicuza uretseko batushinyaguraiye bihagije kuhora ushyinguye wataburuye ushyinguye . ||| we do n't regret it but they toyed with us , always excavating and burying .
ushyingura abataribo . ||| burying the wrong people .
noneho ikintu ngarutse kuri icyo kintu cyo kushyingura incuro nyinshi ushyingura abantu bataribo abantu babarangira abo bantu n' abantu mwari muturanye ? ||| let 's talk again about burying a lot of times burying the wrong people , the people who were directing you on where to excavate were they your neighbours ?
iyo mwitegereje mubona ntinzi ukuntu mwabisobanurira umuntu ngo yaguye aha wenda anakubeshya . ||| looking closely , how would someone say that somebody died from a certain place even when they are lying to you ?
abantu babarangiraaga n' abantu mwari musanzwe muturanye ? ||| the people who were telling you where to excavate where your neighbours ?
n' abantu tubanaaga rwose turi tuturanye cyane uwo we wandangiiye akanbwira ko yabashyinguye ni numucikacumu . ||| yes they were our neighbours ; the one who even told me that he had buried my children himself was even a genocide survivor .
nti izi ningaruka za jenocide zikomeje kunkurikirana ariko noneho we uraumva ko buri incuro ya kabiri kandi n' ubwambere nramubwiraaga nti ngiye . ||| i said that these were the consequences of the genocide on me , it was the second time , before i use to tell him that
ngiye kuibuka nta kintu nkoraaga nta mubwiye nk' umucikacumu mwenewacu nkamubwira nti uyu munsi nzakora amasengesho yo kuibuka akaza . ||| i am going to remember , i did n't do anything without telling him as a fellow survivor , telling him that today i am going to pray and remember and he would come .
noneho nramubaza nti ariko se kubera iki ugeze iki kihae cyo utaranbwira ko aba bana bashyinguye aho hantu akabwira abantu ko ngo yangaga ko mpahamuka . ||| i even asked him why he had taken so long without telling me where my children were buried and he said that he did n't want me to get traumatized .
nkamubwira nti se nri kuhahamuka nti nubundi mu kwa kane buri tariki cumi n' imwe nkora amasengesho yo kubaibuka . ||| and i told thim that i could n't get traumatized it was all the same since every 11th of april i would have prayers to remember them .
kuki utaretse ngo mpahamukire kimwe ariko nbashyingurae nuko muri gacaca rero uwo mwana abivuze byaho babashyize noneho . ||| why did n't you let me get traumatized once and for all but atleast bury them , so in gacaca that child said where they were buried .
muhamagaye ngirango uwo mwana niwe unbeshya turi tugiye kutongana nukwitesha agaciro nanga kutongana nawe no kuhangana nawe . ||| i called him and even thought that the child is the one who was lying to me , we almost started arguing but i realized i would be disrespecting myself and did n't want any confrontation with him .
ndamwihorera nravuga nti ibi byose n' ingaruka zingairho reka mpangane nabyo nkuko nsanzwe ariko ikindi cyo nuko muri za mirongo cyenda na karindwi . ||| i ignored him and said that i was just feeling the consequences of the genocide so i decided to fight them they way i normally fight but the other thing is that in 1995 .
abadutaburuje iyo misozi yose tuyiruka n' abaturanyi ni nbabigizemo uruhare mu kubica atari no kuica abanjye kusa no kuica abantu bo kuri ako gasozi bose . ||| those who misled us in excavating all those bodies on the different hills are the ones who participated in killing the not only my people but all the people on that hill .
kusa gacaca irimo iragenda ibatahu abafunzwe bakarega abatarafunzwe abafunzwe bakashinja abafunguwe . ||| but gacaca is exposing them all , they are turning on each other , those who are in jail denounce those who were not put in jail and those who are in jail also denounce those who are being released .
niko iwacu bimeze . ||| that 's how things are in our region .
reka ngarukae kuri abo bana abandi bo tuumvise ko baguye inrera nyuma bakaza no kubatwika ubwo biraumvikana ........ ||| lets talk again about the other children who were killed from ndera and were later burnt , we can tell that ...
aho bashyinguye rero ngewe niba ari uko nri nkihahamutse cyane muri mirongo cyenda na karindwi nibwo tubakoreye amasengesho yanberae . ||| where they buried them , i do n't if it 's because i was still very traumatized in 1997 is when we first said prayers for them .
ariko ubwo ni nangae werekanye aho babashyize hari ikigunda rwose n' amafoto yaho . ||| i am the one who showed where they were thrown there is a bush even pictures of the place .
y' ukuntu ngiye mpufira niki birahari ariko bavuze ngo mutabururae ngewe nravuga nti oya ntinshaka ko mudaburura urebye rero ntabanri bantu benshi baharokokeye . ||| and the way i watered the place but when they said to excavate the bodies i said no , i do n't want you to excavate them ; they were n't many other people that survived from there .
ninge nuwo mwana umwe ubu ari mu busuwisi ubu ari no muri ibuka yahariya yitwa sezari turavuga tuti mwikwirirwa mubataburura rwose baranabatwitse . ||| it was me and the one boy who is now in switzerland , he is a member of ibuka there , his name is cesar . we asked them not to excavate them since they had also burnt them .
nimuhakore neza hanyuma abapadiri batuemerair kuhaubaka urwibutso rwiza ruraho rurahari iteka kuri cumi na rimwe z' ukwa kane tujya kubaibuka . ||| we asked if they could make the place look good and the priests promised us they were going to build a beautiful memorial , its there and every 11th of april we go there to commemorate .
yewe bari nka magana ni hafi magana ane urebye kuko amashuri yose yari yuzuye hari n' akasarae kari kauzuye kusa abari abahutu baje kusohokamo baragenda ariko ntago aribo bari benshi . ||| they were in hundreds around four hundred because all the classrooms were full , there was even a hall that was full , the hutus later went out but they were few .
abari benshi n' abatutsi bari bahahungiye . ||| the majority were the tutsis seeking refuge .
nukuvuga ko mu bantu magana ane bari bahari abarokotsemo ntabwo barenga icumi . ||| so you mean that in the four hundred seeking refuge the survivors are not more than ten ?
aho ngaho mu iseminari oya ntabo nuwo mwana sezari nangae hari nutundi twana tubanje kugenda tuiruka ariko abo tuzi tuibara turi babiri . ||| at the seminary it 's just me and cezar , they are some kids who also ran away , but the ones we are sure of and count are me and cezar .
muri izo ntumbi nitwae tuvuye muri izo ntumbi . ||| we are the only ones who came out of the corpses .
ngarutse kuri babana bawe baguye hariya imasoro uba uraigeze umenya abantu babaishe cyangwa se n' uburyo babaishemo wenda uretse no kubata muri toilette ? ||| if we talk about your children that died in masoro did you get to know who killed them or how they were killed except the fact that they were thrown in the pit latrine ?
muri gacaca rero barabivuga ariko iyo babivuga bavuga abapfuye mubyukuri n' abazima bahari mubyukuri nabo babigizemo uruhare kikora ikigaragara nuko abo basae abashaijew ubu ngubu barafashwae na gacaca . ||| in gacaca they talk about the people who died but even the ones who are there played a major role in it but what is clear is that whoever is involved were arrested because of gacaca .
usibye hari ikintu cyo babanzaaga kutema umuntu bakamuta mu musaraane ntinzi niba uraigeze umenya niba barabataye mu musarani ari bazima cyangwa niba barabanje bakabatemagura . ||| they normally first hacked people before throwing them in the pits , did you get to know if your children were thrown in the pit alive or after being hacked .
turabanye turapfuye aho tugiye nta nkweto baambara ati akira izi nkweto ujyae uzinyibukiraho . ||| we 've been very good friends and we are going to die ; where we are going they do n't wear shoes , take my shoes and remember me whenever you look at them .
ati kandi uzajyae ubivuga . ||| and please tell the story .
ati hanyuma ngo noneho banbwira abari bagiye kubica bati nimubae muretse kutuica tubanzae tusengae , abana ngo barasenga ngo barangije babata mu musarani . ||| and then they told those who were about to kill them to wait so that they can first pray , and when they had finished praying they threw them in the pit .
niwe utuhayemo ayo makuru . ||| he is the one who told us all that .
ariko ngewe nraumva nukuva ngo niba uwo mwana aba yarabashije kuba yarahawe inkweto n' umuhungu wawe nukuvaga ngo nbabatemye arabazi . ||| but personally i think that if that boy was given shoes by your son it means that he even saw the ones who killed them .
arabazi mubyukuri we aravuga ngo yahise yiruka ntabwo baemera kuvuga ngo babihagararaeho neza . ||| he knows them but he says that he ran away , they do n't agree to say everything clearly .
ngo mbese bemeze ikiriho kugirango nbasigaye batabagirair nabi aravuga ati ngewe nhise niruka akavuga ngo nuwamwirukankanye ngo akamukubita inkoni mubitugu . ||| they do n't want to state facts i think of fear that the remaining ones will hurt them . he says that he ran away and says the one who chased him away and hit him with a stick on the shoulders .
kuvuga ngo rero ngo ntago yabonye uwamutemye ariko noneho abandi bakavuga ko ngo batemawe n' umuntu witwaga habari n' umuntu upfuye . ||| so he says that he does n't know who killed them but others say that he was killed by a man called habari , he is dead .
we nta nubwo araongera kubura ngo kuko yanafunzwe ari umwana ariko wenda azaburana gacaca niyo izi uko izabigenza ntabwo nge nbizi . ||| he has n't even come back to court because he was imprisoned when he was still young but may be he will . gacaca will deal with it , i personally do n't know .
none abantu biraumvikana ko abantu bakushizeho ariko hari ikintu ibyo aribyo byose nta muntu ujya wibagirwa umuryango we none twagirango utubwirae kumugabo wawe yari muntu ki ? ||| i understand that your whole family died but no one forgets her family , can you please tell us about your husband , what kind of man was he ?
yari ateye atae mu mibanire ye n' abandi bantu ikintu ujya wunva umwibukiraho utashobora kupfa kuibagirwa ? ||| how did he relate with other people and what is the one thing that you remember about him that you can not forget ?
nta na kimwe kituma mwibagirw ngewe nmuvuga se ngo iki kumuvuga ntago bihagije ngirango niriya photo ishora kubikuereka byonyine yari umugabo utuje . ||| there is no way i can forget him , i do n't know how i can describe him i think that picture describes a lot , he was a very calm man .
yari umuntu ucaish make ariko ubana n' abantu bose cyane cyane nawe yakundaaga abana ngirango ni nayo mpamvu yajyanae n' abana . ||| he was avery humble man who easily related with everyone but especially he loved children , i think that 's why he went with our children .
be simbizi yari umuntu wumvikana kandi ugira impuhwe cyane kuburyo yashoboraaga kuiibagirwa cyangwa akaibagirwa abandi . ||| he was very easy to relate to and was very merciful ; he could easily ignore himselfo or others .
niko yari ateye uuuuuuuu yari umuntu ukunda umuryango we cyane ngirango iyo aza kuba umugabo w' igisambo afunguwe mubyitso yari kuhita yigendera akanadusiga . ||| that was his nature , he was a man that really loved his family , i think if he had been greedy when he was released from jail he would have abandoned us .
ariko ntago yabigize yakundaaga bose nta muntu yangaga yakundaaga abantu baciye bugufi abantu babakenae . ||| but he did n't , he loved everyone , he did n't hate anyone , he loved the poor and humble .
n' abana banjye kandi nuko bari abana bakunda abandi bana bagira urugwiro ntabwo nshobora kubibagiraw ahubwo ngerageza kubigana bikananira . ||| my children were also like that , they loved other kids and were always warm and happy , i can n't forget them , instead i try to imitate them and fail .
ntinzi ukuntu nbivuga noneho ngewe ntashaka kuvuga aha nkaha baishe abantu bakumaraho abantu ese ..... birega bakaemera n' icyaha baje kukuirega bakaemerae n' icyaha abo bantu baje kukuirega ubabarira ? ||| i do n't know how to say it , but here they killed all your family and finished it , if they came and confessed their fault , would you forgive them ?
kubabarira hari amagambo abantu baihutaish kuvuga ukabona utazi nibyo aribyo ari wamuntu umanuka akakusanga ari nawe uvuga ngo uramubabariye n' ibintu bikomeye cyane . ||| to forgive , they are words that people are quick to use but it does n't even make sense . the person who asks it and you who says that you have forgiven him it 's not something easy .
kuko ngewe uko nbona iki gihugu nicy' abanyarwanda bose ntabwo ari ikiangae ngenyine nta nubwo ari icy' uwacitse ku icumu wenyine ntibinashoboka . ||| because personally the way i see this country it belongs to all rwandans , its not just mine it 's not even for only the genocide survivor , it 's impossible .
ntabwo icyaha kihanaishw ikindi cyaha cyangwa se ngo ubugome buhanishwe ubundi ngewe ku giti kiangae nbwiye imaan ibyo nkora byose nta na kimwe nikoresha . ||| evil is not repaid by evil ; personally i told god that i can n't do anything on my own .
kuko ntacyo nakwishoboza biikoresheje nta nubwo nba nkiriho nba nrabaye n' umusazi simbizi ariko ngewe ibiangae byose nbiha imaan kuko nubwo kuva muri iyo mirambo ya bana banjye . ||| i can n't manage anything on my own , i do n't think i would even be alive , i think i would have gone mad . i surrender everything to god because to be able to get out of all the corpses of my children .
n' umugabo wange n' abavandimwe n' abatunyi bose nri nsize aho ngaho bagaramye ari intumbi ntinrinziko nzabaho . ||| my husband , relatives and neighbours that were lying there dead , i did n't think i was going to live .
nbwiye imaan ko ariyo ibizi ariyo izi impamvu yabyo ikintu rero nsabye imaan kandi yarakimpaye nyibwiyeko niba ari aba bapfuye niba hari abandi bo kubaho izampa kukunda nkakunda nta kinri kintu nreba kuruhande . ||| i told god that he is the one in control and knows why everything happened . i asked god for something and he gave it to me , i told god that those who died and those who are alive , i asked that he may give me the power to love without focusing on anything else .
noneho nkavuga nti ngewe aho kugirango nremerairwe nsabye imaan kumpa umutima wagutse urimo impuhwe nka zikiirira uwo nbona azikeneye . ||| so instead of being burdened i asked god to give me a big heart so that i can offer mercy to everyone who needs it .
niyo yaba ari umuhutu wa wunri unyiciye ariko akaza nbona yapfuye . ||| even if it 's a hutu who killed my family and he comes when he is broken down .
akeneye impuhwe kubabarirwa nge nmubabarira kuko ari umuntu nge ntabwo nkora ubunyamaswa nkubawe ntabwo rero aringe ubiihaye ntingiye kukubeshya . ||| in need of mercy and forgiveness , i would forgive him because he is a human being , i can n't do the same atrocities like he did . it 's really not by my strength that i can do this , i will n't lie to you .
kuko ngewe ubwange ntawe nriwe nta nicyo nba ndicyo pe ariko kuba imaan yarabonyeko abana banshizeho umubiri ukanshiraho . ||| because on my own i am nothing and i would be nothing but the fact that god saw that my children and body were dead .
nkakokoka nkasigara nteye isesemi ikaongera ikanrema umuntu yumva ashaka kunyegera mbere barampungaga abantu banbonye nyuma ya jenocide ho gato barampungaga . ||| i was disgusting and he revived me and people want to be with me when before they use to run away from me , people who saw me immediately after the genocide would avoid me .
ntari nteye ishozi n' isesemi nta muntu wanyondoye nta muntu ugize ikintu ankorera ngo avugae ngo nkugiraiye ntya . ||| i was hideous and disgusting and there 's no one who really took care of me to say they did it .
nubwo hariho uwanyondoye nkuwo musaza wange unjyanye akanshyira iwe ariko hatarimo imbaraga z' imaan ntabwo biri kushoboka . ||| except my cousin @-@ brother but even for him it would n't have been possible without god 's power .
nri kusara bivuga ngo imaan niyo yambungabunze ingira uko ndi uku nangae murukundo rwayo ngomba kukora icyo insaba uwaza ansaba imbabazi ambwiza ukuri ngewe nzimuha . ||| i would have gone mad , but god kept and made me who i am today , so even me in his love i must do what he asks me to do and whoever asks me for forgiveness in truth , i would forgive them .
kandi iyo umuntu avuga ikintu abikuye k' umutima urabibona nzimuha ariko rero ntago bazisaba kuko usaba imbabazi nufite umutima wa kimuntu . ||| and when someone is saying something from the depth of their heart you can tell and i can forgive them , but they do n't ask for forgiveness because someone asks for forgiveness is someone with a human heart .
ufite ubu muntu arakusanga kuko aba abona uri umuntu iyo atakusanze rero aba abona ukiri cya kinri ya kuitaaga cya kihae . ||| someone with humanity in them comes close to you because he sees that you are human , whe he does n't it 's because he thinks that you are still the thing that he called you before .
n' ubundi batuambuye ubumuntu batwita inyenzi batwita ibyo ntazi batwita ibiki nubu aracyabinbonamo ariko uwaza aka nyegera ngewe nzimuha pe . ||| they dehumanized us by calling us cockroaches and other horrible names so i think they still see that in us , so whoever comes close to me , i would forgive them .
noneho nyuma yo kaumva ibintu bikomeye uciyemo uraumva kuroka mu bantu bangana kuriya noneho ukaza no kugira n' ikibazo umuryango wawe wose ukakushiraho . ||| after hearing the difficult things that you went through , surviving among all those people and your family being dead .
ubu muri iki kihae ntinzi nvuga nti se murebwayire josephine ubu muri iki kihae n' umuntu umeze utae ? n' umuntu ufite ibyiringo nubwo abantu bamushizeho mbese nyuma ya jenocide . ||| nowadays how can i describe murebwayire josephine , what kind of person is she even though her whole family died , is she someone with hope even though her whole family died in the genocide ?
utusobanurair mbese muri wowe wunva umeze utae ntabwo nbiumva ? ||| please tell us , how do you feel deep inside because i do n't understand ?
erega ntabwo biumvikana mu buengae bwa muntu n' indengakamere kandi iyo bavuze indengakamere wunva ko ari ibirenze kamere muntu . ||| it does n't make sense humanly speaking , it 's beyond our human nature and when they say beyond our human nature , it means it 's not human .
ntabwo ibiambayeho mu buzima bwanjye kuva ndi uruhinja kuva ndi umwana kugeza kuri iyi myaka nfite n' indengakamere ariko indengakamere hariho uwaremye kamere . ||| everything that happened in my life since i was a child up to now is beyond human nature but there is someone who created human nature .
kandi izo nshingano nta nubwo nrinziko nzazigira nri npfuye nrazuka nukuvaga ngo muri uko kuzuka nzutse ndi undi wunri utari wa wunri . ||| i did n't think i would have those responsibilities , it means that i had died and resurrected . in resurrecting i resurrected a new being not the same person .
nkagombye rero kuemera uko njya nkunda kubwira abantu nti josephine yarapfuye habaho tantae . ||| so i have to accept the way i always tell people that josephine died and aunty lived .
kuko ubu nitwa tantae w' abana bose kuko umwana unsanze afite ikibazo nbasha kugikemura ndagikemura . ||| because now i am called aunty of all the children , any child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it .
nkamuhumuriza nkamwumvisha ko agomba kubaho nka mutera imbaraga numva rero nrasigaraiye kuba tantae w' abana bose . ||| to confort and convince that that child must live and encourage him @/@ her , so i think i was left behind so that i may be an aunty to all the children .
umwana unsanze afite ikibazo nshobora kugikemura ndagikemura nkamuhumuriza nkamwumvisha ko agomba kubaho . ||| a child who comes to me with a problem that i can fix , i fix it and confort them and convince him that they must live .
nkamuremaish kandi nkamutera imbaraga numva rero nrasigaraiye kuba maman w' abana batafite banyina . ||| i encourage and strengthen them , i feel like i was left behind so that i can be a mother to all children without mothers .
ntabwo aringombaw ko nba nbatunze murugo rwange ariko hariho uwo nbwira nti ibi nibi ibi nibi nkabona ndamuremesheje ateye intambwe . ||| it 's not a must that i take care of them in my house but they are some i advise on certain issues and they move forward .
hari abo nfite hano murugo ubu nfite abana batandatu nfitemo abakobwa babiri nfitemo n' abahungu bane . ||| they are some that i have here in my house . i have six children , two girls and four boys .
ikindi nuko imaan yanrokoye infiteho umugambi infasha no kuwusohoza ntiyankojeje isoni ntiyampinduye umusazi birashobokaaga . ||| the other thing is that god who kept me has a plan for my life that he helps to fulfill it , he did n't put me to shame , i would have gone crazy , and it was possible .
batamye mu mutawe ubwonko ntibugiye ntatekereza nukuvuga ngo ngomba kubaho nshima imaan ntatekereza nukuvuga ngo rero ngomba kubaho nshima imaan kandi nkora icyo nshoboye . ||| they hacked me in the head but i did n't loose my mind i can think , it means i must live my life thanking god and doing what i can .
n' ikintu cya girair abandi akamaro . ||| it 's something that can help others .
abantu mwari muturanye ahantu mwari mutuye uyu munsi mubanye mutae ? ||| how do you relate to the neighbours that you had befor all this , how is your relationship ?
ese nyuma yubu bw' icanyi bwa kukozeho ndetse bukora no kubanyarwanda benshi ubu ubona hashobora kuzaongera hakabaho ikintu cyo kubaan nta kintu cy' urwikekwe . ||| after the genocide which affected your life and the life of many rwandans , do you think that there can be normal trustworthy relationships ?
hagati y' abantu baishe n' abicaiyew ? ||| between the killers and victims ?
ariko urwikekwe ntinzi ngo niba ari kadafi ubivuze ngo ujyae unrinda incuti zaangae ngo abanzi nrabazi . ||| about trust i do n't know if its kadafi who said that , protect me form my friends because i already know my enemies .
ubundi umuntu murabana ariko imaan yatuhaye ubwenge ituha gushishoza nta mpamvu yo kumuhutaza yagize ibyago mpari nmutabara nk' umunyarwanda yagize ibiiza tubisangira . ||| god gave us the wisdom to think , when you live with someone there is no reason to disturb someone who is going through hard times , if i am able i can help him @/@ her as a rwandan and if they are celebrating i can celebrate with him @/@ her .
ukarigendamo ngewe nuko nkubwira ariko rero abaturanyi turabana ntabwo nzi kuvangura ubwo ngo umuhutu simusuhuza ntinzi kugenda ntuka umuntu ngo uriya n' interahamwe . ||| but i live well with my neighbours i do n't how to segregate people saying one is hutu so i will n't greet them , or insulting someone that they are interahamwe .
umuntu iyo tuhuye tuhura mubonamo umuntu hanyuma ikibi kikaza igihe kikorewe nangae nkabonako ari kibi ariko ntago njya nigizayo umuntu uwo ariwe wese . ||| when i see someone i see a human being and i only see evil when that person commits it , but i do n't push anybody away .
nkaumva umutima wanjye ukeneye kukira buri wese uje awugana yawugana nabi simuhe umwanya . ||| my heart welcomes everyone who comes to me with good intentions , if you do n't then i do n't give you my time .
hari muri jenocide by' umwihariko abantu babadamu hari abantu babadamu benshi bagiye bahura n' ibintu byibibazo usibye no kuba babica n' abana bakabamaraho hari nbagiye bahura n' ingorane bakabaviyora bakabanduza indwara . ||| in the genocide especially women went through a lot of difficulties , besides killing them and finishing off their children , many were raped and infected with diseases .
usibye no kubaviyora hari nbagiye bahura n' ibikomere bikomeye kuburyo uyu munsi iyo ugiye kuitegereza usanga nge nvuga nti abapfakazi benshi bafite ibibazo . ||| besides being raped they went through a lot of fifficulties and problems that personally i think that widows have a lot of problems .
bituruka kuri jenocide ndetse ubona binakomeye cyane uyu munsi koko nkubungubu umuntu yikoreye umutwaro w' indwara izamwica igihe iki niki . ||| as a result of the genocide , it is very difficult because you find that someone has a sickness that will kill her at some point .
utafite uwo mutwaro jenocide yarangiye aguma mu buzima butari bwiza ubukene burakomeza bumumerair nabi aha noneho nagirango nk' umuntu nkawe w' umubyeyi . ||| if she is not burdened by disease , the genocide ended and she is probably in a lot of poverty , i woulk like you as a woman .
ugize ikibazo bakakumaraho umuryango icyo nikindi kintu kikikomerae kiteye ubwoba aha nagirango umpe ishusho y' abapfakazi ba jenocide babayeho ubu bari mungaruka zikomeye cyane . ||| who went through the same and lost your whole family which is a very difficult thing to endure , i would like you to paint a picture for us of the genocide widows who are suffering the hard consequences .
ikintu unbajije kirakomeye ubundi ngewe nba no mu muryango w' abapfakazi ba jenocide avega agahozo . ||| you have just asked me a very difficult question , i am part of a widows ' association called avega agahozo .
ndi vice presidente wa kabiri ku rwego rw' igihugu ni umuryango tushinze kubera ibibazo abapfakazi bari bafite abapfakazi barimo ingeri nyinshi harimo abafashwae ku ngufu koko barwaye bandujwe sida . ||| i am the second vice @-@ president on the national level , it 's an association that we set up because among widows there are many categories . there are some who were raped and infected with hiv & aids .
harimo abana babakobwa babyaye abana batashaka harimo abatemaguwe batafite ibicae byo kumubiri umwe ukasanga nta kaboko afite . ||| there are some girls who gave birth to children they did n't want , they are some who were hacked and do not have some limbs , some do n't have hands .
uwo ijisho rivuyemo mbese harimo ubumuga butandukanye noneho rero reba aba bantu bafite ubu muga bwo mu mutaima . ||| some do n't have eyes , they are different handicaps and then they are those who are emotionally handicaped .
n' umubiri batafite aho bataha batafite inzu yo kubamo kenshi na kenshi baegamiye aba bahekuye . ||| and physically they do n't have a home , without a house to live in , many times they are next door to the ones who kileed their families and injured them .
uraumva ko ari agahinda kageretse ku kandi ariko nka association yacu icyo tukora nukubatera ingabo mubitugu tubabwira tuti muhumurae . ||| you understand that its adding more sorrow to an already broken heart , so our associationts goal is to stand by them and confort them telling them not to loose heart .
kuba ukiriho nejo uzabaho tugira amahirwe amahirwe tubonye umushinga ubafasha kubona iriya miti igabanya ubukana bwa sida . ||| telling them that the fact that they are still alive that they will continue to live , we are lucky that we got a project that helps them with anti @-@ retro viral medication for hiv & aids .
abatarapfuye kuko hari benshi barapfuye kuko iriya miti ije vuba kuko hari benshi batucitse . ||| there are many who died because the medication just started coming in recently , they are many who passed away .
nayo ikamuzonga kubonera ikintu umuntu arya buri munsi n' ibintu bikomeye kuko urabona turi abapfakazi bagenzi babo . ||| and it can really affect her because the medication is strong , to get food everyday is not easy because you can see that we are widows like them .
nta kazi tufite bamwe na bamwe bakafite nabo bafite izindi charges mungo zabo ariko turafashanya turahumurizanya . ||| we do n't have work and those who do sometimes have other responsibilities in their home , but we try to help and confort each other .
icyo tukora nubuvugizi uraumva mubyukuri benshi babaho baihebye ariko noneho avega ikintu ikora nubujyanama guhumurizanya kuegeranya . ||| what we mainly do is speak out because most people live in despair , so avega advises , conforts and brings us together .
ni nayo objectif y' umuryango wacu kuegeraan , guhumurizanya , guhozanya umuntu ukamwumvishako niba ababaye ejo ashobora kuhumurizwa niba arwaye ejo ashobora kaoroherwa . ||| that is our main objective of our association , to bring us together , confort each other , convincing someone that if they are in pain tomorrow they might be conforted , if they are sick tomorrow they can get better .
sida yo nikimungu kiba mu mubiri ariko bimaze kugaragarako itakinica kuwabashije kubona iyo miti . ||| hiv & aids is bad disease in the body but its clear now that it does not even kill when one gets those medication .
icyo rero tukora ngewe ibyiringiro nbaha nuko kubabara atariko kupfa ariko nbuvugizi na leta kandi ubwayo undi twebwe icyo tuba tuifuza nuko aba bantu batarekuraw . ||| so what we do is tell them the fact that they are in pain does n't mean that they die , and we speak up for them to the government , our desire is that these people are not given up on or forgotten .
aba bantu bataha aba bantu bahabwa imbabazi mbese usanga biduhungabanya kuko usanga basa naho aribo bitaweho . ||| these people who are sent home and forgiven really traumatizes us because it seems as though they are the ones who are cared for .
twebwe ukasanga ubuvugizi butuvugair yego burahari ariko ukasanga nta nbaraga ubona bushyirawmo kugirango ibibazo birangirae yego ntawe uzakarura abantu . ||| but with us it seems as though those who advocate for us do not have strength or there is no emphasis so that the problems are solved , of course nobody can bring back the people who died .
ngo tufashwae tufashwae ikarangira . ||| if they help us it can be over .
ariko tumaze imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide irangiye aha ntawavuga ko uko abantu bari bameze jenocide ikirangira ariko bakimeze . ||| but it has been thirteen years after the genocide , can we say that people are still the same way they were when the genocide had just ended ?
nyuma y' imyaka cumi nitatu ese mwebwe iyo murebye uko biri bimeze jenocide ikirangira mukaongera mukareba uko bimeze nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu . ||| thirteen years later , if you compare the way things are now and the way they were immediately after the genocide .
mubona nibura hari ikintu kibayeho cyo kuba abantu baragiye bava mu gihirahiro kugeza ubu umuntu yavuga ngo ubuzima burimo buragaruka . ||| do you think that atleast people are moving from the state of turmoil and life is being restored ?
nukuri wenda uretseko ntawarangiriza ibibazo rimwe cyangwa wenda niba tubonye abantu ijana ngo tuvugae ngo abantu barashize ariko ibintu birahindutse none se iyo ubona abana b' imfubyi barize bakaba bararangije . ||| it 's just that no one can solve all the problems at once , or if we see a hundred people go on to say that everyone died but things have really changed a good example is the orphans that went to school and now have completed their studies it is evidence .
bakaba bari muri universte abandi bararangije hari umwana uvuye mu mwobo aziko azaiga . ||| and now they are in university and some have finished , is their a child who came out of a pit thinking that he was going to study .
abapfakazi bamwe niba barabashije kubona aho baegeka umusaya ubwo uwo muntu yavugako ntacyakozwe . ||| the widows did n't have a place to stay , can that person say that nothing was done .
biba ari bikeya ariko wenda mu mikoro make ariko ntago nrahira ngo nsembe ngo ntacyo tukorewe . ||| it 's not enough may be because of limited means but i can n't say that they did n't help us .
n' abanyarwanda bose muri rusangae ntabwo bameze neza nkantswe nuwakuwe mutawe burundu . ||| generally rwandans are not doing great now imagine those who were taken out of their own .
ariko buhoro buhoro ngewe nbona hari icyahindutse kusa haracyarimo abameze nabi cyane binanbabaza iyo numvise bavuga ngo batanga inkunga y' ingoboka ya farg . ||| but slowly i think something has changed but there 's still a long way to go . they problem is that there are some people who are doing very badly and it huts me when i hear that they support farg .
ukasanga baravuga ngo mu mezi atatu ibihumbi icumi hari nutabirya mu mezi icumi icyo kintu rero kiranbabaza icyo kiumvise hari nubwo numva ari agashinyaguro . ||| they say that in three months there are people who do not even it ten thousands francs , i am hurt whenever i hear this , sometimes i think thats its mocking us .
bakwaiye kuiga uburyo bakareba ukuntu umuntu afashwa koko bihoraho bitahora biirukanka bajya kusaba . ||| they should look for a way that a person should be supported continually so that they do n't keep going to ask for help .
hari ikintu nendaaga kubabaza kijyanye n' ibintu byo kuibuka abantu bacu bagiye bamburaw agaciro muri jenocide . ||| i wanted to ask you something in line with rememebering our loved ones that were degraded and humiliated in the genocide .
babajugunya hirya no hino nyuma ya jenocide habayeho kugenda umuntu ashakisha ..... noneho bakashyinguraw noneho nagirango mutubwirae mwumva abantu bacu bashyinguraw kutae ? ||| they were thrown in different places after the genocide , someone has to go searching ... and then they are buried , so i wanted to ask you how do you think our people should be buried ?
abantu bacu bagiye kubaibuka kwiza icyambere nukumenya aho bajugunyawe tukabashyingura tukabavana mu myobo . ||| the first and best way to honor our people is to know where they were thrown and we bury them taking them out of the holes .
tukabavana mu misarane tukavuga tuti abantu bo muri aka karerae bashyinguye aha tukikora tukajyayo tuka habaibukair ariko noneho kuibuka kwiza nukwibuka babantu basizwe na babanri ntibajyae kuibuka umugabo w' umuntu . ||| to take them out of pit latrines , to be able to say that teh people in this district are going to be honored and buried and all of us get ready and go there remember and honor them . but rememeber well is to remember well is to remember the ones that remained behind . do n't go to remember a man
ngo tubakanguraire kuitwara neza no kugira imico myiza nkiyo ababyeyi babo bari kuba babaha tujyae ku ma sites memoriaux ariko tuibukae na babantu basize na babanri . ||| we teach them good manners just like their parents would have done and then go the memorial sites and remember all the people who passed away .
ubundi hari ukuntu njyae numvaaga ibintu numvaaga tukabaye tuibuka abantu bacu tukabashyingura neza tukahora tunabaibuka . ||| personally there is a way i feel that we should remember our people and bury them in such a way that we would always remember them .
ariko ibyo bintu byombi bikajya bigerageza kujyana nkuko uri ubivuze kuri abo bantu basigaye nta kuntu umuntu yasigara muri ibyo bibazo byo kubura aho aba n' inzara . ||| but both things work together just like you have said , about the survivors . there is no way that someone can remain in that kind of trouble without knowing where to live and starving .
ngo buri kihae tujyae tuibuka kuko ikintu nshaka kubivugair aho kugirango nzae kubasaba ko mwagira ikintu mubivugaho . ||| so that we may always rememebr them , i want that you will make your comment and say what you think .
ngirango nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide irangiye ngirango ni mike cyane ariko iyo witegereje uburyo inzibutso zo mu rwanda zifashwae . ||| i think that after thirteen years that the genocide has ended its not a lot of years , but when you look at the way the memorial sites are maintained .
ubona ko hatabaye ikintu cyo kuhindura uburyo zifashwaemo ubona ko hatabaye ikintu cyo kuhindura uburyo zifashwaemo ubunako nka nyuma y' imyaka makumyabiri zishobora kuba ziraangiritse muburyo bugaragara . ||| it is evident that they are not well taken care of and nothing is done about it , clearly if nothing is changed about the way they are managed then after twenty years they will be in a visibly bad condition .
noneho ahangaha nkaba nshaka kugirango nvugae ngo kuibuka nibyabande nibyabacitse ku icumu nibyabaturanyi bacu se bo mubinri bihugu ? ||| so here i want to ask , remembering is for who ? is it for the survivors , is for our neighbouring countries ?
kuko kenshi abantu bagira ikintu cyo kuibuka ari uko ukwezi kwa kane kugeze ntabwo harimo akantu ko kushishikara izo site memorial zikaba zakorerwa . ||| because many times people remember in april , there is no initiative so that memorial sites are always mintined and in good condition .
wagirango tuba turaibagiwe aho bagiye tukavuga tuti nzajya kusura abantu baangae mu kwezi kwa kane . ||| you would think that we forget where they went and say , i will go visit my people in april .
ariko uwawe umuhozaho umutima ukahora ushaka kureba aho ari naho yiriwe hariya hantu rero munzibutso arizo mubyaro ari nizi zikomeye . ||| but your loved one is always on your mind and heart and you always want to know where they spent the day and where they are but those memorials in the provinces and even the strong ones here .
ahubwo ngewe imyaka makumyabiri uvuze nrabona ari myinshi kuko hari naho ubona zitantaiye no kaononekara . ||| you said twenty years but i think twenty is a lot of time because they are some that are already getting spoiled .
hari aharidutse hari ahari ibigunda usanga baragiramo amatungo ntago rero kuibuka ariby' abacitse ku icumu nta nubwo ari ibya leta kuko leta ni abaturage . ||| some places are crumbling , in other places there are bushes where animals are taken to eat grass , remebering is not for the genocide survivors only , its not even just for the government , because the government is people .
niby' abanyarwanda bose kuibuka simbona rero impamvu umuntu aturanye na site njya ngira urugero rwa hariya ikanombe . ||| it 's for all rwandans to remember , i do n't see how some one who is neighbours with a memorial , i always take an example of kanombe .
kuri kaburimbo bigeze kuhashyira cloture y' ibyuma ariko barayibye bayimazeho umuntu ujya kuiba kuri site memorial abagiye kukoresha iki ibyo bintu ? ||| at the main road they had put there a metallic fence but they stole them and finished them off , i do n't understand how some one steals from a memorial site , what do you do with those thinks ?
ukibaza uti uru nurugo ruba bantu bantu batakireba ku isi ariko n' urugo rwabo . ||| it is the home of those people , they may not be here on earth but it is there home .
ngewe rero nkabona abantu bakagombye kubishyira mu nshingano zabo noneho tukagira n' amahirwe haje inzego zo hasi umudugudu . ||| i personally think that people should make it their purpose and we are also lucky that now we have lower levels of government the umudugudu @/@ village .
kugirango wenda tugana k' umusozo nubwo habayeho jenocide ariko ntabwo tuzayibagirwa . ||| as we are winding up , even though the genocide took place , we can n't forget about it .
kandi nta nubwo tuumva tukuifuzako yakaongera kubaho hagati aha rero nagirango nsabae ese mwumva dukurikije ibihe tunyuzemo nibyo tubonye tuumva tuifuzako bitazaongera . ||| and we do n't wish for it to happen again , so i would like to ask you , according to the hard times we went through and saw we do n't want it to happen again .
wunva uraga abana bazavuka ejo hazaza uko b' u rwanda rwejo bataigeze baba muri ibi bintu . ||| what heritage would you like to give to the rwandan children who did n't go throught these things ?
ubaraga kuzabaraga mu rwanda ruba rumeze rutae ugereranije nuru tubayemo ? ||| what kind of rwanda would you like to give to them as a heritage compared to the one you lived in ?
mubyukuri ahubwo nbona umurage uratangiye kukorwa nuko haba harimo za kidobya iyo ntekereje ko nta mwana ukihagurutsaw mu ijuri kubera ubwoko bwe . ||| i think that the new heritage has started already , there are still problems but i am really glad that no child is asked to stand up in class because of their ethnicity .
uko bitakorwa mu ishuri bikagombye no kutakorwa mu ngo z' abantu kuko burya imico mibi yigishirizwa munzu . ||| the way it 's not being done in schools it should also be the same in people 's homes because all the ad influence takes place at home behind closed dooors .

tugize amahoro bikakomeza abana bacu bazabana mu mahoro bakabana mu rwanda rutarimo umwiryane rutarimo nubwoko . ||| if we continue to live in peace , our children would live together in peaceful rwanda with no turmoil and ethnicity .

nibo rero barimo kuza bavuga ngo "@ masengo turi inkotanyi ; muhumurae muso ; musohokae @"@ hanyuma njyewe numva ko ari interahamwe zije kututaw ; ||| they came saying , masengo it 's us inkotanyi do n't worry ; come out of where you are .
kututwara ari amayeri ; ||| i thought it was interahamwe trying to fool us so that they can take us .
nsohotse ndi uwa mbere kugirango ; kuko aho ; aho ngaho nihishaaga nryamaaga mu banri ; ntabwo nbaga nihishe rero . ||| i tried to leave the place in order to hide in a nice place because i was feeling unsafe .

kukumira interahamwe . nramanuka ngeze hasi njya mu kagunda gato nbona ndengeyingoma ari inberae y' abo basirikare ; arimo kumpamagara . nrabanza nritegereza koko ; ||| i went down slowly and hid myself in a bush , i saw ndengeyingoma in front of those soldiers calling me .
inkotanyi nri nzizi ; hari abo turi ruziraanye muri ; muri cnd ; hari n' abo nri nrabonye nkora cada cosse ; ||| i carefully looked at them , because i knew how inkotanyi looked like . they were some of them i knew at cnd and others i knew from military course i took .
hanyuma nva mu kigunda nza nbabwira ngo ndi masengo ; ndi hano ; ndi hano . ||| i came out of the bush and said to them @: "@ i am masengo , i am here ! @"
ndengeyingoma ahitako anbwira ati "@ turi inkotanyi tuje kubabohoza @"@ ati "@ ahubwo byutsa abandi @"@ nsubiye muri etage hejuru aho nraraga ; ||| ndengeyingoma said to me @: "@ we are inkotanyi and we came to rescue you . @"

ariko kuko bari bamaze iminsi batanbona kubera nyine ko ngaragaraaga mu ijoro ; ||| it has been a good while they did not see me ; i usually came in the night .

abasore bakeya babona ni inkotanyi ; basubira babwira abandi ; bitabujije ko hari nbahasigaye banzae kuemera ko ari inkotanyi ; ||| few young men went out and found it was them , so they came back to confirm that it was inkotanyi .

mu kibuga cya ; kiri kihari baratubwira bati "@ mumanukae aha nkaha @"@ batubwira inzira tunyura ; batu ; ||| they [ inkotanyi ] told us to sit on the ground and they said to us @: "@ go down this way . @"
tuumva turayizi baratujyana ; tumanutse hariya muri ya ; munsi ya saint fa ; munsi ya saint paul ; ||| they showed us the way and we knew that road .
tugwa ku muhandawa mbere wo muri rugengae ; tumanuka gato tugwa ku wa kabiri , turagaruka ku wa gatatu tugera kuri poid lourd ; poid lourd tuca mu gishanga ; ||| we went down until we reached the first road in rugenge , we continued up the second one until we reached the third one known as the heavy weight road [ poid lourd ] .
twa tufata kacyiru ; tugeze kacyiru buba budukereyeho ; kandi abasirikare bari baje kutu ; kutubohoza bari bacyae cyane ; ||| we passed through the swamp , heading to kacyiru by the time we reached kacyiru it was already in the morning and the soldiers were few around thirty soldiers .
bari 30 ; hanyuma ababashije kurenga kacyiru bararenga ; abandi babacumbikishiriza ; inkota ; ||| the ones who managed to reach kacyiru continued but other camped there .
izo ; abo basore b' inkotanyi babashyira mu mazu ahongaho bagaruka kurwana ; eeh n' abo ba ; n' izo nterahamwe . ||| the soldiers tried to find them places to stay in and they went back to fight with interahamwe .

haza n' abandi n' undi musada uraza urabafasha bararwana ; bigeze nimugoroba bituma babasha kuambuka . ariko bitabujije ko mu nzira ; nk' umugore wa manyenzi ; ||| other soldiers [ inkotanyi ] joined them in order to give them a hand , in the afternoon that is when the remaining group managed to cross .
hari umwana w' umukobwa nawe uguye mu gishanga nawe ; hari ama ; hari ama barre perdu ; amasasu yazaaga ; ||| on the way going , some people like the wife of manyenzi , another girl lost their lives due to the shooting ; some were caught by the bullets because we were a long chain of people .
akaza kuko turi benshi ku murongo umwe ; akaza akagenda agira abo agwaho . turagiye rero tugera ; tugera ku gisozi ; ||| we went and reached gisozi , we were welcomed .
baratuakira ; ariko ngarutse inyuma gatoya tumaze kuva muri saint paul ; ba banri batinye ; batinye bavuga ngo ni interahamwe zakoze amayeri yo kugirango zaiitae inkotanyi ; ||| if i go back a little bit , the 30 people who stayed at saint paul saying that it was interahamwe trying to fool us were killed almost all of them .
barahazindukair ; umenya harasigayemo umuntu umwe muri abo 30 ; umugabo witwa all ; ||| one man called ally was one of the few people that survived the interahamwe attack .

twebwe rero ni uko nguko tugiye tugera ku gisozi ; turagenda ; ||| so for us we reached gisozi .
abari abasore baitabair kuinjira mu gisirikare ; abakecuru babajyana i kabuga ; nnjyae ndi mu bitabiriye kuinjira mu gisirikare ; abandi bajya i kabuga ; ||| the young men became soldiers and the old women and others were taken to kabuga . i was one of the young adults that became soldiers .
baba i kabuga ; hanyuma intambara irarangira ; ||| the war [ genocide ] came to an end .
ariko eeh ; ntabwo tutinze mu gisirikare ; tusabye yuko bamwe turi tukiri batoya tusabye ko tusubira mu mashuri ; ||| we did not stay longer as soldiers ; some were still young so want to return to school .
ariko ahanini tushakaaga kugira ngo tuvae mu gisirikare kuko ntabwo turi bazima ; mu mutawe ntabwo turi bazima ; kaumva ko uri ufite umuryango w' abantu nk' icumi ukaba usigaye wenyine . ||| the main purpose was to quit the army because we felt kind of traumatized when remembering that someone had a family of ten people now he is left alone .
twaraa ; bisabye bamwe baratuemerair tuvamo turaza ; tutangira ubuzima bunri bukomeye cyane umuntu ataigeze abamo ; ubuzima bukomeye ; ||| we applied to leave the army and some were allowed .
kusanga inzu ari itongo ari wowe wowe wenyine ; nta ; nta so wanyu ; nta nyoko wanyu nta ki ; ||| we went on and started new hard lives where there is no father , no mother only you alone .
mbese uri wowe uko uri . ni ukuvuga ngo ; ||| we found the houses already destroyed .
iminsi ya mbere yaratugoye bikomeye cyane ; kubona ; bigatu ; rimwe na rimwe kubona icyo urya ukakibona kuri nyagasani ; ||| it was very hard the first days ; there was no food we had to search for it if not try to find a place where to sleep also visit friends .
ariko uba utanakibonye ukashakisha aho urara . ukasura abandi bana ; ni muri urwo rwego nnjyae nbayemo ; ||| that is the kind of life i lived in .
nje kugerageza kushakisha ngo numvae ko hari umuntu wanjye uba urasigaye ; nsanga bose barapfuye ; ariko nza kurokora umwe umukobwa umwe witwa chantal ; we icyatumye arokoka we ntabwo yari mu gihugu ; ||| i tried to search if there is any one of my family who is still alive unfortunately all of them died except one girl called chantal who was out of the country .
ntabwo yari mu rwanda . n' abandi bose menya impfu zabo ; bakuru banjye ; barumuna banjye ; ||| she was out of rwanda during the war time .
maman ; bose menya impfu zabo ; hanyuma nrabiakira . na rya shuri nri nrasabye kujyamo birananiye ; ||| i knew about the death of everyone , my siblings , my mother and i accepted what happened .
birananiye numvaaga ntari muzima ; numvaaga nta ; nta kintu nshobora ; numvaaga ntashobora kuteranya rimwe ngo nbonae kabiri ; ||| about the other school i applied for , i was not able to go for it because i felt unhealthy , very weak , i felt i was not able to add two numbers .
cyangwa cyangwa mbe ; numvaaga mbese kuiga ari ; numvaaga nigair iki se ? numvaaga se nigair ngo maman azazukae ? ||| i wondered why do i have to go to school , will it resurrect my mother so i felt it was useless .
numvaaga nta cyo bimaraiye . abantu benshi baka nyinginga bati uracyari muto jya kuiga ; ||| a lot of people begged me to go back to school as i was still young .
nkababwira aah ; aah ; munbabarirae n' abize aho bagiye nrahabonye ; n' aba docteur bafite ama doctorat n' iki ? ||| i said to them @: "@ i saw where intellectual people went , even the phd holder died ! @"
nkomeje kubaho gutyo rero mu buzima bubi ; ||| i stayed in that miserable life .
ariko rimwe na rimwe imaan igera igihe ikaibuka umuntu . ||| sometimes god remembers someone .
mushiki wanjye uwo nguwo tuje kufatanya tusaan inzu yo mu rugo ; tubona aho tuba ; hanyuma mu mikoro makeya tugiye tubona akazi hamwe na hamwe ; hari nk' aho tukoze muri o.i.m ; ||| i and the other sister of mine whom i told you , tried to rebuild our home house in order to have where to stay . in our financial weakness we managed to get small jobs .
udufaranga umuntu akaza akagura agasima ; undi ; umugiraneza yaza akagu ; akakaongera akandi gasima ; ||| we worked in o.i.m and the small salary we could get out of it , we would use it to buy cement or other good people would buy for us cement .
tubona inzu irahagaze ; ||| we finally completed the house .
ni cyo kiri ikibazo kikomeye kubona aho utaha ; kuko ubundi biri bikomeye kurara mu ngo ; kumara umwaka ugenda mu ngo z' abantu kandi nabo batari bafi ; ||| it was a big problem to have where to live ; it was hard for us to stay in several places , spending the whole year changing houses to live in when sometimes the people in there are financially unstable .
bifite ; ukasanga ; ntabwo uri kujya mu bantu bifite kuko abari bifite bose ahanini bari abana b' abakizi ba nabi ; twebwe abacu ; ||| the ones who are financially stable are mostly bad people .
amazu y' abacu yari yarasenyawe ; kandi nabo bafite ibibazo nk' ibyo ufite . ||| our houses were destroyed and their too .
ukasanga ni ibintu bikomeye ; ukasanga kujya kumutera ibibazo ; ukaemera ukapfair mu ; ukapfair inberae . ||| so asking for help when they also have such problem , we preferred to let it go .
eeh ; twa ; tumaze kusaan inzu mushiki wanjye yaje kwimaria we ; ubu njyae ndi jyenyine n' umukozi biraumvikana ; ||| after completing the house , my sister got married and i stayed with the housekeeper .
ariko bigeze igihe numva ; uko iminsi igenda yiongera numva ngomba kusubira mu ishuri ; ishuri nje kurisubiramo ubu nraiga ; niga muri ulk mu mwaka wa ; ||| as time passed by i had this idea to go back to school and i finally went to school at ulk university .
nrangije umwaka wa kabiri back ya kabiri ; ngiye muri licence mbere . bitabujije ko ubuzima ; ubuzima bwacu bw' abacika cumu njyae nbona buragoye ; ||| i have finished the second year and i am going for the third year .
buragoye ; cyane cyane ko nbona ; ntabwo tuitaweho nkuko tukagombye kuitabawho ; ntabwo abacikacumu bakwi ; ||| it does n't mean that the life of genocide survivors is easy ; we are not treated the way we should be treated .
bitaweho ; buri munsi tuumva ngo umuntu yapfuye ; umucikacumu ; hanyuma ujya kaumva ukaumva ngo ruharaw yafunguwe . ||| we always hear someone is dead , a genocide survivor , and another day you hear a criminal was released .
twe ni uko tubayeho rero ; ruharaw yafunguwe umucikacumu yapfuye . ||| that is the way we live , a criminal was released and a genocide survivor was killed .
ngirango ababizi amaradiyo arabivuga ; ||| you hear it on the radios .
ntabwo abacikacumu muri iki gihugu cyacu rwose umutekano wacu ugeraw ku mashyi . ||| in this country the security of genocide survivors is insufficient .
kandi uretse ko wenda twebwe ubuzima tugomba kubaho kubera ko nyine ari nacyo tuharanira ; tuharanira kubaho ; ariko ibyo bano bagabo batukorera ntabwo ; ntabwo bitunanira . ||| we can not forget that we have to live and we are aimed at living but what these men did for us , it is not that hard for us to do it too but we were not created for that .
ariko njyae nbona atari cyo twaremewe . njyae nbona nnjyae ubwanjye n' urukwavu kuba narwica cyangwa inkoko nbona ari ibintu biva kure . ||| i realized it is even hard for me to kill a rabbit or a chicken .
ariko ukafata umwana w' uruhinja ukamukubita ku ; ku kikuta ; ukafata umukecuru ukamwambika ubusa ukamukorera ibya nfura mbi ; ||| imagine you take an innocent baby and hit the baby on the wall or remove an old woman all clothes and rape her .
njyewe nba nbona yuko hari ; hari ibintu bimwe biba birenze abantu bakora ; ukibaza niba ari umuntu uremawe nk' uko wowe uremawe bikakuyobera . ikindi kintu rero kitubabaza cyane ni ukubona umuntu ; ||| you ask yourself if this person was created as you were created and you can not get an answer .
umuntu yidegembya ngo ; ngo yishe abantu ijana akabarondora akabavuga ; akavuga uko yabaishe urubozo ; ariko ngo yavuze kusa ngo ; ||| another thing that hurts me , you find a person really confessing proudly of the a hundred people he killed , the horrible way in which he killed those innocent people , and the next day he is realized because of that .
ngo nzae hanze . ukareba ukuntu leta imutangaho ibya mirenge hari umukecuru muri komine iyi n' iyi ; ku gisozi ; uri ; ||| you find the government is spending a lot on him while there are old women let 's say in gisozi who have nothing to eat , no where to live .
uburara utafite ; kugeza n' ubu utarabona aho arara ; njyewe numva rwose bagombye kubitekerezaho ; leta ikabitekerezaho ; ||| this should be taken care of , the government should think about this .
wenda twebwe turi abasore ariko ikabanza ikareba abantu bababaye ; abafite ibikomere ; aba ; abafashwae ku ngufu ; ||| okay for us we are still young men , they should care about weak people , wounded people , raped people and old women so they could die happily because the ones who betrayed us die happily .
abakecuru ; bakabanza bakabahumuriza nabo bakazasaza neza . kuko abandi bo batuhemukaiye bo basaza neza . baraje babasubiza imitungo yabo ; ||| they came back and were given their properties .
amafaranga muri bank ; nta jambo turi tufite ; amafaranga muri bank barayasubijwe ; amazu yabo barayasubijwe ; ||| got back their money from the bank got back their houses .
ariko bikababaza kurushaho iyo umuntu yagusenyeye akaza ukabona ari muri cadastre ya se ; ||| it is sad to see someone who destroyed your house living in a very nice house of his father .
ntayo tukeneye twebwe ariko leta nayo ; niyu ; niyubakaire wa ; ||| we do n't want those nice houses , the government should build for genocide survivors houses to live in .
wa cikacumu nawe abonae ahantu aba ; uburenganzira bwe bwose ; bamushubije ibintu bye ukabona abayeho neza kuturusha ; tukakomeza kubaho nk' uko twa twwabagaho na kera . ||| it is our right , when he is given back his properties he lives nicely than us .
numva icyo kintu nikidahinduka rwose ntacyo leta izaba itumaraiye . ||| if this is not changed so the government will n't be helping us .
mu byifuzo byanjye rero eeeh ; nibahane abantu batuhemukaiye ; kuko nibatadu ; ||| here is what i want ; all people who hurt us should be punished .
nibatabahana na bwa buiyungae ba ; baa ; bavuga numva ko butazashoboka ; ||| if not i do n't see where this unity and reconciliation will come from .
cyane cyane ko hari n' imvugo mbi bavuga ngo nidusabane imbabazi . ||| there is this thing of asking forgiveness between each other and i find it bad .
mbese nk' ubu ngubu twebwe tuzabasaba izihe nbabazi ? tuzabasaba imbabazi z' uko batuishe ? ||| what are we going to ask forgiveness for ? it is because they killed us !
iyo mvugo rwose izavae muri ; njya numva abayobozi bamwe na bamwe babitubwira ngo nidusabane imbabazi ukagirango ; ||| i hear some leaders insisting that we should say sorry as if is there any fault we committed .
ukagirango hari ikosa tubakoreye . nuko ukaumva ngo ; ngo bagiye kutuha indishyi ; ngo turashaka indishyi . ||| you hear them saying that they are going to give us indemnity because we do need it .
nta ndishyi rwose igihe nta ndishyi y' umuntu ibaho . ||| let me tell you that there is no indemnity that can replace a human .
bazarebae indi mvugo babiita ; bazabiitae impoza marair , bazabiitae ikindi kintu ; kusa barebae uko twa ; ||| it should not even be called indemnity ; it should be called compensation or another name .
uko abo bakecuru n' abo basaza n' abo ba ; n' abo ; ||| they should find a way so the old men and women , and those wounded people could live .
n' ibyo bimuga babaho ; kandi nanone umutekano ubacika cumu wubahirizwe ; kuko birababaje kaumva ngo umuntu yishe undi saa munani ; ||| they should maintain the security of genocide survivors .
i kabuga birabaye ; ||| it is sad people are killed in the day time , this happened in kabuga .
i katuha ho ntinvuga ibyo ni ibintu bisanzwe . ukaumva ngo ; ||| in kaduha , it is also the same .
ngo baramufunze ; ariko umunsi wo kusura ; umunsi wo kusura baragenda bakamusanga muri ya gereza bamushyiriye inyama , bamushyiriye icyayi , ||| you hear a person was sent to prison , but during the visiting days they take for him meat , tea , and other nice things .
bamushyiriye ibiryo byiza bishoboka ; ababara mbese kuva ku wa mbere kugeza ku wa kane ; kuwa gatanu aba ariho nk' uko yari ariho hanze . ||| you find that he struggles only from monday to thursday , but he lives nicely on friday like the way he lived while he is outside .
murakoze namwe ; hari umuntu wigeze kuvugaho witwa nsabiyera ; cyangwa se nsabuwera eraste wa ; ||| thank you too ; there is someone who said they call you nsababera , or nsababera eraste .
nsa ; nsa ; uhh . ||| uuh !
mwigeze ngo ; maman wawe yigeze kubakira . nyuma ya genocide hari ; wigeze umubona cyangwa ; ||| your mother built for him a house ; did you find him after genocide ?
sina ; ntinbivuzeho ; ntinzi niba hari na ; hari ukuntu twa kenseramo . ||| i said about it .
hoya njyae nracyafata ; nagirango niba hari icyo uvuga utusobanuraire . ||| if is there anything you can say about it , go on and say it .
nsaba ; nsababera eraste amaze kutuirukanaish muri iyo famille ; yaje kumenya aho maman ari aragenda arahamuvana ; ||| after when nsababera eraste caused us problems in ste famille , he came to know where my mother was and shifted her to another place .
yaramwubahaga pe !! arahamuvana aramubwira ati mukecuru rero ibintu bikomeye va muri iki kiyovu urimo kushakishaw . ||| he really respected my mother . he took her and said to her @: "@ old woman , things are getting worse here in kiyovu so leave because you are most wanted . @"
amuvana ku mukecuru uri hariya mu kiyovu aramujyana amugeza mu ba caricuta ; ||| he took her from she was , at another old woman and took her to the carcuters .
mu ba caricuta ariho maman yaguye ; ariko ubwo yagirango ; mama yapfuye ku italiki 17 z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| in the carcuters that is where my mother lost her life .
nsababera rero ubwo mu kugaruka kwe noneho yari abonye uburyo yica abantu . kuko yari abonye cya gitinyiro yara ; ||| when nsababera came back , he got a way to kill people .
cy' umukecuru wanjye yubahaaga ; yaramwubahaga pe !!! kiri kimaze gu ; ||| he respected my mother at a point he could not kill while my mother is watching him .
yari amaze kubona ko amwigije kure ; ||| as my mother was far from him , he got strength to kill people .
atari buze kaumva koko ko yishe abantu ; kandi ubwo nsababera tumufataaga nku ; nk' umwana wacu ; ||| we raised nsababera as a child in the family .
ubundi deja twanamwitaga kajevuba kubera nyine ko maman atari yakamenya izizna rye ; yamwitaga ngo ni ka kana kaje vuba ; ||| we used to call him kajevuba [ new comer ] because my mother did n't know his name . she used to call him kajevuba .
afata rero icumu atangira kuica abantu . ||| he took the spear and started to kill .
yaje kuica rero umugabo witwa ruhotorinyana ; ubwe ariwe umwiyiciye hanyuma umugore eeeh ; umugore wa ruhotorinyana akaba yari umuhutu kazi . ||| he came to kill a man called ruhotorinyana , ruhotorinyana 's wife was a hutu .
arairukanka ajya kuri secteur ahari hari abajandarme ; ||| his wife ran to the sector where she could find the police .
muri abo bajendarme hakaba harimo umwe w' umurokorae . ||| among those police men there was one who was a born again and she reported to him .
uw' umurokorae araza abwira uwo kajevuba ati "@ ruhotorinyana umujijije iki ? @"@ ||| the born again asked kajevuba @: "@ why did you kill ruhotorinyana ? @"
ati "@ mujijije ko ari umututsi @"@ ati "@ ese ntabwo uzi amabwiriza tufite ? @"@ ||| he [ kajevuba ] replied @: "@ i kill him because he is a tutsi . @"
umujandarume aramubwira ati "@ nnjyae ngiye kukuzeiza ko uri umuhutu @"@ ati "@ ubikora se ? @"@ ||| the born again said to him again @: "@ do n't you know the rules , so i am going to kill you too because you are a hutu . @" kajevuba said @: "@ you can not do that ! @" the born again told him @: "@ i am going to do it . @"
undi ati "@ kandi ngiye kubikora @"@ ati "@ noneho nfite ibihumbi makumyabiri ati enda @"@ undi ati "@ oya ibyo ntabwo nbiemera @"@ ariko umugore wa ruhotorinyana agiye kutabaza kuri secteur ; ||| kajavuba said to him @: "@ i have twenty thousand on me , you can have it . @" the born again replied @: "@ no , i do n't want your money . @"
kajevuba yasigaye acukurair ruhotorinyana ; n' abandi bantu ; n' izindi nterahamwe bagenzi be ; ||| ruhotorinyana 's wife went to report to the police meanwhile kajebuva and other interahamwe stayed behind and dug a hole in which they wanted to bury ruhotorinyana .
noneho umujandarume yaje batari barangiza kucukura ariko bari hafi kura ; bamaze kugera nko muri cm50 ; aho umuntu yajya bakarenzaho akataka . ||| this born again police man arrived when they have already dug only fifty centimeters but it was enough to put in a person an cover him with sand .
aramubwira ati "@ ubwo rero ; aramubwira ati umujijije ko ari umututsi ; ||| the police man said to him again @: "@ you have kill ruhotorinyana because he is a tutsi and i am going to kill you because you a hutu . @"

undi aranga ; ||| the police man said to him @: "@ stand in front of the wall and i shoot you . @"
aramubwira ati "@ jya ku kibambasi nkurase @"@ undi ati "@ noneho nbabarira nbanzae nbwirae umugabo witwa gikongoro ko ugiye kunyica @"@ undi aramubwira ati "@ ibyo ntibinreba ye ; ||| he begged him to give him the chance to say goodbye to a man called gikongoro .

ariko ruhotorinyana akaba yari atari yapfa neza ; ||| he stood in front of that wall and he got shot . ruhotorinyana did not die straight a way .
uwo mujandarme yari umukizi wa neza rwose imaan imuhae umugisha . ||| the police was a good person , may god bless him .
yafashe abaturage aho ngaho bafata ruhotorinyana bamushyira mu ngobyi bamugejeje mu nzira nawe arapfa ; ||| he called other people to take ruhotorinyana at the hospital , on the way going to the hospital ruhotorinyana died .
ariko kajevuba nawe ajya muri wa mwobo yari yacukuraiye ruhotorinyana . eeeh ni uko yapfuye . ||| kajevuba was put in the same hole he dug for ruhotorinyana and that is how he died .
hanyuma ; ibyo aribyo byose ; hari igihe umuntu avuga ati "@ ibi bintu ntabwo bigenda neza @" ariko nawe ukaumva utanga ho umwanzuro ; ugiraho inama nka leta ukavuga uti mbese ; ||| sometimes a person would say "@ things are not going well @"@ . you feel like commenting on it , a small advice to the government .
nibyo koko mwashyizeho gacaca ; ariko gacaca ikwiriye kubahairizaw gutya ; ||| yes it is good you have started the gacaca justice but it should be followed in a certain way .
nibyo koko muravuga ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ariko bukwiriye kuba nyuma y' iki cyangwa bukagenda gutya ; kugirango usae n' uwanzura muri ; ||| there is also unity and reconciliation but it should come after this or match in another way so that we can conclude within this direction .
muri icyo cyerekezo . kuko impamvu nbikubaza ni uko nzi ko uri umuntu umwe mu bantu bitangira kugirango abacitse ku icumu basubizwae agaciro kabo ; ariko kandi nanone abakoze ibyaha bahanawe ; ||| the raison i say this is because there are people who are willing to give genocide survivors their respect back , who want criminals to be judged and to send free innocent people .
n' abarenganyae babae barenganuraw . nk' umuntu ucaish mu kuri nraumva ukuanzura ujyana muri urwo ruhande . ||| the kind of people who work truthfully , i think this is the way we should pass through .
kuko burya hari ikintu abantu baiga mu ishuri ; kikatuma umenya ukuntu societe iteye ; ukamenya ukuntu ukuitwara muri societe ; kuko ntakeka yuko rwose abanya ; ||| studying is a tool to a better knowledge ; the same knowledge will enable you to understand the society and get to know how to handle the society .
abanyabwenge bari muri iki gihugu ; wenda bakafatair kuri imanute da ; kuko umuntu wa ; ||| we do have intellectuals in this country ; let 's take an example of the ones who finished high school because they have lived in society for a while . they know what is true or wrong .
wize muri imanute aba yarabaye muri societe ; azi ibibi n' ibiiza ; ariko nta kuntu uzagenda ngo ufatae umusaza ; azae umuhungu we nza aje kuburana hanyuma amushinjae ; ||| you can not take an old man and it happens that he judges his son , this is a rare case .
bishobora kubaho ariko izo cas ni nke cyane ; ni umwe ku ijana mirongo cyenda n' icyenda icyo kihae bararekuraw . ||| the probability that it happens is one percent out of ninety nine percent . if it happens , the judgment will be dropped .
ako kantu rwose numvaaga bakwiriye kukitaho ; hanyuma inkiko gacaca turazishyigikiye rwose ntabwo turwanya inkiko gacaca ; kuko nta kunri kuntu ; ||| i endorse the fact that gacaca justice is there .
nta wunri muti w' inkiko kaca ; w' aba bantu ni benshi ; ubushobozi bw' igihugu ni bukeya ; ||| there is no other choice , the number of people is big and the capacity of the country is small so the gacaca courts are there as a quick solution .

abo rero ni ukureba ukuntu ukuramo ababi kandi baba bazwi ; burya ntabwo ushobora kukora ikintu ki ; kibi rimwe kabiri ngo ntumenyekane ; ||| the good thing is to remove the kind of people ; a person can not commit a mistake first time , second without noticing it .

nitwa mutankuha fredy , nkaba nfite imyaka 28 . ||| my name is mutanguha freddy and i am 28 years old .
freddy ushobora kunbwira ibintu wibuka ku buzima bwawe bw' ubwana ? igihe uri ukiri umwana unbwirae ibintu uba wibuka . ||| freddy , can you tell me ... tell me your earliest memory . the first thing you can remember about your childhood ? from when you were a child , what sort of things do you remember from your childhood ?
nkiri umwana nraibuka yuko nri umwana ukubagana cyane ... ko nkubaganaaga cyane . ||| when i was young , i remember i was very boisterous .
nraibuka ko na mama yajyaaga akunda kunganira n' abandi babyeyi ati @: « nfite umwana ariko arakubagana , amena ibintu cyane . ||| i used to be so boisterous . i remember my mum would talk about me with other parents , telling them she had a very boisterous son who would break all utensils .
kandi nkaibuka yuko nkundaaga umupira ; umupira w' amaguru . ninjiye mu ikipe y' abantu bakuru , ndi umwana cyane niga muri primaire [ amashuri abanza ] , ||| i remember i used to like playing football ; i joined a senior team when i was still in primary school .
ku buryo numvaaga rwose nta kintu kishobora kunshimaish cyane kitari umupira w' amaguru . ||| nothing else could make me happy as much as playing football .

cyane cyane ko nmubaye iruhande igihe cyose yari akiriho . ||| maybe because i used to be by her side all the time .
nibuka ko yari umubyeyi utaba gito , yari umubyeyi ugira ubuntu cyane . ||| i remember she was a very kind and generous parent .
yakundaaga abantu , ndetse akagira inshuti nyinshi . izo nshuti nyinshi yagiraaga , ||| she was very social and had many friends .
yakundaaga no kunbwira ati @: « kubaho ni ukugira inshuti , kandi kubaho ni ukubaan . iyo ubana n' abantu ntacyo ubura , ||| she used to tell me , "@ life is about making friends and learning how to live with people . when you know how to live with people , you will never fail to get anything .

bari bane , babica bose kandi babica nabi , kuko hari mo bataye muri toilettes batarapfa . ariko ikintu cya mbere ... cya mbere nibuka ni uwari urimo witwaga angelique . ||| they were four and all of them were killed so badly because , some of them were dumped alive in the latrine ... of all my sisters who died , angelique is the one i remember the most .
hari igihe uba uvukana n' abantu , ariko ukagira mubo muvukana uwo ubona ko ari inshuti yawe bikabije . nmurushaaga imyaka myinshi , ariko turakundanaaga cyane . ||| sometimes there 's a special bond between two siblings . i was much older than her but we loved each other very much .
yarankundaaga nnjyae nkamukunda . ||| i loved her very much and she loved me too .

ikintu nibuka kitushimaishaga mu rugo cyane cyane nkunda kuvuga nko mu kihae abarimu bahae ... mama yari umwarimukazi wo muri primaire , ariko ikintu kinshimaishaga ni uko iyo yajyaaga kuhembaw , bavugaaga ngo bagiye mu nama ariko akanbwira ati @: "@ nibigeza saa saba uvae mu rugo uzae unsangae , ||| the most special event that used to give me joy was that whenever they would get paid ... my mother was a primary school teacher .
" ni ahitwaaga i rubaengair . iyo yabaga yahembawe , bianze bikunze yagombaaga kaungurair amata na kekae , nri umwana biraumvikana . ||| whenever she 'd get her pay , she used to tell me to find her in a place called rubengera at around 1 p.m. after her meeting and she 's buy me milk and cake as i was still a child .
bigezaaga aho ... aho ngereye muri secondaire yigeze kunbwira ati @: "@ noneho nrabona umaze kuba umugabo , ntashaka kukugurair primus . @" yarayinguraiye ariko anbuza kuyinywa ngo nyimarae ; ||| when i reached secondary school , she once told me that she wanted to buy me a bottle of primus ( beer ) , but she forbade me to finish it .

kuko icyo kihae yanbwiye byinshi ntinzi niba nbirondora , ariko icyo kihae umunzi wa mbere angurair primus yanbwiye ibintu byinshi cyane . ||| she told me many things on that day .

ni nabwo yanbwiye yuko ajya kuba umwarimukazi , ya ... akimara kutsinda avuye muri primaire agiye muri tronc commun [ igihimba rusangae ] kiri igice ... ni ibintu bya kera ariko ubungubu biragarutse . yuko amaze kurangiza humanite [ amashuri yisumbuye ] nibwo umwana w' umututsi yongeye kutsinda kuri icyo kigo akaigishamo . ubwo uraumva yuko hagati aho yaragiye kuiga nta wunri mwana w' umututsi wigeze atsinda kuri icyo kigo . ||| she explained to me how when she passed her primary school exams ‘ ordinary level examinations ’ [ tronc commun in french , it was once in the school system in rwanda and it is back again today ] , no tutsi ever passed again that exam until she completed her secondary school and became a teacher in the same school [ six years later ] .
aravuga ati @: "@ ubu nize jyenyine iwacu kandi nfite basaza banjye bazi ubwenge . ati @: bose bagiye kuzaba abahinzi , ||| she said to me , "@ i am the only one who is educated in my whole family yet my brothers are intelligent and yet their fate is to become cultivators .

nibyo nibuka ariko wenda buhoro buhoro ngenda nibuka ibindi . ||| that is all i remember right now but slowly by slowly i will recall other things .
nbwira ingorane zikomeye wibuka uhuye nazo muri jenoside . ||| tell me about a difficult memory from the genocide .
icyo umu ... bagiye kuica bashiki banjye byo nrabirebaaga , ||| well ... i was there when my sisters were about to be killed .
kuko baje bakavuga bati @: "@ ibi byana binini byo , tunaniwe turaza kubitwara mu kanya . @" ||| the perpetrators came saying @: "@ we are tired , we shall take these fat kids [ freddy and his sister ] later . @"
njyae na mushiki wanjye turasigara , batwara abana bato . ||| therefore , my sister and i stayed behind and they took the younger ones .
bo bagiye tubareba , ndetse naho babiciye ntabwo ari kure yaho , ||| with our own eyes , we saw them being taken and they were killed not far from where we were .
uretse ko ntabirebaaga neza , ||| however , i was not able to see each and everything .
ariko babiciye ... babicaaga basakuza tubaumva . ||| but while killing them ... they would scream and we heard them screaming .
ikindi ni uko mama bagiye kumwicira kure , ||| another thing i remember is that my mum was taken very far away to be killed .
ariko tuje kuirukanka ... kuko bumaze kwira yari akiri ku gasozi . ||| therefore , we went running ... at night she [ her deadbody ] was still out there .
nragenda n' undi muhungu tubanaaga , turairukanka tujya kumushyingura , tumushyize ... twamurengejeho ututaka kusa . ||| a certain boy and i rushed there and buried her . we simply covered her with soil .
muri make n' uko nbonye umurambo wa mama kusa , ||| in brief i only saw my mum 's corpse .
nta banri nbonye . ariko abo bashiki banjye bo , induru zo kubica zo narazumvaga . ||| i never saw the corpses of the rest . i only heard the noise my sisters made while they were being killed .
uba uzi uwabikoze ? ||| do you know who did it ?
... uba uzi uwabishe ? ||| ... do you know who killed them ?
kubera ko ntamurebaaga ... ntabarebaaga nk' uko nvuga ngo ndi kureba inberae yanjye , ariko abaje kubatwara nrabazi . ||| because i would n't see him ... i would n't see them the way i am seeing you in front of me , but i know the people who took them .
ni abantu turi tuturanye barimo umugabo witwa benoit , hari n' umu ... uwo mugabo witwa benoit ndetse bari baranabanye cyane , ||| it was our neighbours , among them was a man called benoit who had been our neighbour for years and who owned a shop nearby .
kuko hari n' igihe mama yaburaaga amafaranga yo kunjyana ku ishuri aka ... kuko we yari afite boutique akaba ariwe uyampa . ||| he was her friend and he even used to lend her money for me to go to school the times she did n't have money .
akaba ari ... niwe ugiye ... uje ashoreye igitero nawe ari mu bantu bakomeye muri icyo gitero , baje kubica . ||| they were relating to each other very well . he was one of the leaders of the group that took them the time they came to kill them .
hakaba hari n' umuhungu yigishaaga ... yigishije muri primaire , witwaga kanani , nzi neza ko ari nawe umukuye mu nzu nyuma i gitero ... abo bari bazanye ; ||| there was another young man called kanani . she was kanani 's teacher in primary .
abari bari mu rugo bari bahaye amafaranga bakasa nk' abajya kurwana . ariko we yamufashe akaboko amukura mu nzu nyuma aza kumurekura , ||| some people inside the compound tried to fight with them as they had been given money by my parents and he 's the one who was holding her hand when they were taking her out of the house ; he later on let go of it .
mama nawe aza kuirukanka , nyuma baza kumusanga iyo yirukankaiye . ||| when he released her , my mum ran away but they found her where she had ran too .
ariko ibyo aribyo byose ibyongibyo byo nrabiibuka byo ... ||| at least i can still remember that incident very clearly ...
uba uzi uburyo bamwishe ? ||| freddy , how did they kill your mother ?
bamukubise amahiri bamwica . ||| my mother was beaten to death with clubs .
nyuma y' aho jenoside ibereye , bijya bikunda kukubaho mu buzima bwa buri munsi ko bikugaruka mu bitekerezo , ukabona ibyabaye , abicanyi ... ||| during the rest of the genocide , did you continue to witness what the killers were doing ? did you see the killers often ?
ibyo nkunda kubibona , bikunda kuza cyane cyane mu kihae cyo mu kwa kane , kuko ariho nrushaho kutekereza ku bibaye mu rwanda . ||| i normally think about it ... it normally happens during april because that is when i think about what took place in rwanda the most .
mu kwezi k' ukwa kane nibwo nkunda kuibuka . ||| yeah , in april is when i remember .
ubwo icyo kihae rero nibwo nshobora kurota nbona abantu bica abantu , nbona interahamwe zaica abantu ... ariko ubundi ntabwo kurota bikunze kunbaho . ||| and during that time , i get nightmares , i see people killing others ... i see interahamwe killing people .
ngira amahirwe ariko mu kihae cyo mu kwa kane rimwe na rimwe nrabirota . ||| but otherwise , i am lucky i rarely have nightmares . however , in april i get them .
unyemerair nkakubaza ibindi bibazo bibiri bikomeye ? ||| can i ask you more difficult questions ... can i ask two more ... is it okay ?
... ubonaaga abicanyi bakora iki muri kiriya kihae ? bicaaga abantu kutae ari abo mu muryango wawe n' abandi ... ibintu wibuka ubonye ukuntu bicaaga abantu ... ||| how did the killers go about doing their work ? what did you see them doing to your family , to other people , what did you see ? how did it happen ?
eh , nrabazi cyane . nrabazi . ||| yes , i know them very well ... i know them .
nrabazi baitwa ba niyonsenga abongabo ... uhoraaga arwanair kugirango aviyole [ afatae ku ngufu ] mushiki wanjye . ahubwo n' uko ata ... ntabwo yashoboye kubigeraho , ||| one of them is called niyonsenga ; he wanted to rape my sister . however , he never succeeded .
ni benshi nrabazi . ||| they were very many and i knew them .
kuba uri umuntu ucitse ku icumu , kuri bwawe wunva bivuze iki ? ||| freddy , what does it mean to ... be a survivor , what did you feel when you survived ?
ngewe kuba nracitse ku icumu , usibye ko ari n' amahirwe ariko ubundi ni n' inshingano . ||| personally i believe having survived ... being a survivor is luck yes but it is also a big responsibility .
nbibona mo inshingano kuko abacitse ku icumu benshi , batafite uko bameze . abakeya muri bo bakaba aribo bifite , bashoboye no kugira icyo bigezaho ku bierekeye no kutunga ubuzima nravuga nk' ibyo kurya nibyo ... mbese n' ubuzima bw' ibanze ababufite ni bakeya . ||| i look at it as responsibility because many of the survivors are very poor and do not even have the least necessary for life [ food and a shelter ] .
ni inshingano rero cyane , z' ababufite , ubwo ubuzima bw' ibanze kubusangira n' abatabufite . ||| that 's why those who have something to share need to feel responsible for the ones who do not have anything .
nvuga ko arero amahirwe ... kuko iyo urebye ibyabaye mu rwanda , ukareba n' ingufu biri bifite n' abari babirimo ; ari leta y' u rwanda ; ||| and i call it a privilege because when i consider what took place in rwanda , with all the determination that was put in and when you consider all those who were fully motivated such as the government of rwanda or other governments of powerful countries , like the french government .
ari leta z' ahandi , ||| we can easily say that it is a miracle that some people survived .
kandi z' ibihugu by' ibihangange nk' ubufaransa . ubonaaga yuko kugirango umuntu asagukae biri bigoye cyane . numvaaga rero kuba uwacitse ku icumu n' amahirwe kandi ni n' inshingano zikomeye . ||| therefore , i believe that it is a privilege to be a survivor and i believe it is a big responsibility .
ese wiyumvaga kutae muri1994 ? harya uri ufite imyaka ingahe cumin' itandatu ... ok , ||| what did you feel in 1994 ... ? how old were you ... 15 , 16 .. ?
cumi n' icyenda . none se wiyumvaga kutae ? ||| oh 19 .
wunvaaga ufite umujinya , wunvaaga se umeze nk' igishushungwe ... wiyumvaga utae mu mutaima , utekerezaaga iki ? ||| what did you feel ? did you feel angry , did you feel empty ? did you feel ... what was in your mind and in your heart ?
njyewe icyo ... uko numvaaga meze muri icyo kihae , hari igihe ubungubu ntashobora kubisubiramo , ||| how i felt during that time ... maybe i can not say exacty how i felt .
ariko ubundi bwa mbere ngiraaga ubwoba bwinshi . ||| but i was so afraid .
nkahora ntekereza ukuntu umuhoro ugiye kuzakubita igikanu kikagwa , ||| i used to imagine a machete cutting my neck all the time . and i would imagine my neck on the floor .
nkahora nkibona hasi kiguye , ||| i would always imagine seeing my mum being killed [ i mean the period from the 8th to the 14th of april .
nkahora nbona ukuntu bagiye kuica mama [ nravuga nka periode yo kuva ku itariki umunani kugeza kuri cumi n' enye mu kwezi kwa kane ] nraanzwe n' ubwoba ahantu nbaga ndi muri plafond z' abandi bantu . ||| ] my heart was full of fear while in the cieling where i was hiding in someone 's house .
nkakonja bakanjyana ku ziko bakanshyira inyuma y' urutaro , ||| they used to allow me to sit near the fire as i would be freezing in the cold .
kugirango umuntu ucanye ataza kunbona . nbagaho ku buryo numvaaga nrangaw n' ubwoba , ||| i was hiding behind a big sieve [ used for sorghum ] so that whoever was making the fire , would n't be able to see me .
nta kaizerae cyinshi cyo kubaho nfite . ||| i was so afraid and i lost hope of survival .
ariko nyuma y' aho ngeze aho ubwoba buranshiraan neza neza ku buryo numvaaga npfa , ntapfa , numvaaga ntacyo bintwaye . ||| i reached a point where i was no longer scared . i was no longer afraid of death ; death or life meant nothing to me anymore .
ku buryo hari igihe njyewe na mushiki wanjye tugendaaga mu nzira kuko tukoze urugendo rurerure , ||| sometimes my sister and i would walk on the road ... we walked a lot but we were not afraid of passing where there were roadblocks .
ntitutinyaaga kunyura ahantu ngo bari bariyeri , ngirango tubitinye rimwe kandi tubonye ko atari na byiza , kuko hari ahantu ngeze ... ||| we only feared to pass a roadblock once but we realised that it was n't good , because there is a certain place where i reached ...
... ubwo ngeze ahongaho kuri iyo bariyeri , tushatse kuyinyura munsi , ||| when we reached that roadblock we tried to hide and used a way down that road but we were found out .
ni ahantu baita muri mwendo ku kibuye . ||| that was in a place called mwendo in kibuye .
tushaka kunyura hepfo gatoya , kugirango wenda abantu bo kuri bariyeri bataza kutubona baratuzamura batuzana kuri bariyeri , batubaza niba turi abatutsi turabwira tuti @: ntabwo turi abatutsi . ||| they took us up to the roadblock and asked us if we were tutsis and we said we were not but they looked at us and told us we must be tutsis because of our soft hair and all .
batubwira byinshi ... bigeze aho bati @: "@ urebye iyo misatsi yanyu , urebye iki ... bati @: ntimuzae kutubeshya . @" ||| they said many things and told us to stop lying to them .
baranbwira ngo @: "@ wowe ugomba kuicukurair , " ariko nrabianga . bigaragaza ko icyo kihae ntabwo ntinyaaga , ||| they asked me to dig up my own grave and i refused which shows that i had reached a point where i was no longer afraid .
turi tugeze aho tutatinya urupfu . nyuma baza kutukura aho ngaho baravuga bati @: "@ bourgmestre wa mwendo niwe uza kuca urubanza , " batushyira kuri commune baratufunga . ||| we were taken to the commune . they said the borgamster would be the one to judge our case .
batufunze ariko kuko bourgmestre tusanze yasinze , aravuga ati @: "@ babae batufunze . @" ||| we ended up spending one night in a cell as we found when the borgmaster was drunk .
ariko muri icyo kihae numvaaga nta bwoba , ||| but i was n't afraid anymore at that time .
n' ubwo nri nfite nri nbufite ababyeyi batarapfa . kandi turi tumaze kugenda mu nzira tusimbuka intumbi nyinshi , ku buryo tuumvaaga twebwe nta bwoba bituteye kuba tupfa kugeza ubwo . ||| all my fears died up after my parents were murdered and after seeing so many dead bodies on the way .
wibaza ko abantu baumva cyangwa basobanukirwa ibyo mwanyuzemo . ||| do you think that people understand your experience ? .
bake barabiumva . ||| a few people understand .
ibyo nbayemo ntabwo babiumva bose biramvikana , ||| obviously not everyone can understand what i went through .
harimo n' abatifuza y' uko nbaho , kandi na n' ubu batabiifuza babazaw n' ukuntu babona umuntu agenda atera inberae . ||| some people did not even want me to live and they still do n't want me to be alive today and they 're not happy when they see me prospering .
ariko abandi turi kumwe barabiumva , cyane cyane abo tusangiye ubuzima bwa buri munsi . ||| those who are with us do understand , those who went through similar things , especially those who share our lives daily .
wunva urababariye abakukoreye ibyo utubwiye ? ||| can you forgive people that carried out these problems ?
kubarira biragoye . ||| it is difficult to forgive .
kubarira biragoye kuko n' iyo nzira numva ntarayitangira , kuko njyae numva ntazi aho nyihera . ||| it is difficult to forgive and i have n't gone down that road yet because i do n't even know where to start .
ese ntangirae nbabarirae leta kuko nayo yari ibifitemo uruhare ? ||| who should i forgive anyway ? the former government as it contributed to it very strongly ?
ntangirae se nbabarirae umuntu ku giti cye ? ||| do i forgive people individually ?
ntangirae se nbabarirae ... nreba ababigizemo uruhare bose nkabura uwo ntiangiriraho . ||| do i start from forgiving ... ? i look around and i do n't know where to start from , as so many people were involved in it .
ibyo aribyo byose , birakomeye ariko birashoboka . ||| it is certainly hard but it is possible .
impamvu nvuga ko bishoboka ni uko umuntu ukunda igihugu ... ... abacitse ku icumu bakisigayemo ni bakeya , amaboko yabo ni ma ... ntabwo bonyine bashobora kuzazamura i gihugu bonyine . ||| the reason i say it is possible is because patriots ... the survivors in this country are very few . and their strength is ... they can not develop the country on their own .
ni ngombaw ko abari mu gihugu bose bafatanya ingufu zabo kugirango igihugu kizamukae . ||| therefore , all people in the country should put their energy together and develop the country .
ariko ku bwanjye ntabwo iyo nzira nteganya kuyitangira vuba , mu kihae ntaramenya uwo nhera ho nbabarira . ||| personally , i am not ready to begin that journey [ of forgiving ] soon .
biri bikwaiye ko uwabikoze uwo ariwe wese yatangira kusaba imbabazi , ||| first i do not know who i should forgive . it is better those who committed the crimes start asking for forgiveness .
tukanegeraan akaza tukanabiganiraho wenda . ||| they should come to us and we talk about it .
ari umuhutu wishe akaza akavuga ati @: njyae nraishe , ariko munbabarirae . ||| let 's say if it is a hutu who killed , he should come and say , "@ i killed people and i am really sorry . @"
bikaza ari ibintu ubona ko bifite umutima wihariye wo kusaba imbabazi . ||| they should do it in way one would really see that somebody is truly sorry .
bikagenda bigenda , bikagera no mubihugu bibigizemo uruhare . ||| then things would proceed and finally reach the countries that participated .
ndetse no muri ibyo bihugu bibigizemo uruhare ukurikije ubuhangange bwabyo , bikanitabair kufasha inbabarae z' abasigaye . ||| and they [ those countries ] should use their power to help the survivors who are needy .
njyewe ntinri mo kuko njyae ntinri ikimuga , ||| i am not among them because i am not handicapped , i am able to work for myself .
njyewe nshobora kuikorera . nshobora no kuhangana n' abandi , nkajya muri competition [ irushaanw ] y' ubuzima njyewe numva ndi tayari [ niteguye ] . ||| in fact i could compete in healthy competions ... i am very ready .
ariko se izo mfubyi , abo bana bibana batarageza imyaka , bafite inshingano nyinshi babaho batae ? ||| but what about those orphans , those other kids who look after themselves with several other responsibilities , how do they survive ?
aho ibyo bihugu bibigizemo uruhare birabizi ? ||| the countries who participated in the genocide know about that .
kugirango wenda nabo batangirae kaumva ko ... wenda nubwo ... bacitswe bakabikora , bakifite umutima wo kubakunda . ||| they should do something to show that although they participated , it was involuntarily ! they need to do something to show that they care about them [ the orphans ] despite everything that happened .
njyae numva gahunda yo kubabarira irakomeye ariko irashoboka . ||| i believe the process of forgiving is hard but possible .
tuzi ko ubaye mu muryango a.e.r.g , ni iki uwo muryango uwuvugaho ... ubona ko ari iki kitumye ushingaw ? ||| why did you start to be involved in a.e.r.g , why did you do that ? why did you think it important to try that ?
a.e.r.g. ni umuryango njyewe kubwanjye numva ... abawutekereje ngomba kubashimira . ukurikije intego zawo , ibikorwa byawo , nsanga ari umuryango ngomba kushimira , ||| i personally would like to thank those who founded a.e.r.g. when you look at its objectives , its deeds , you ought to thank a.e.r.g. it is the only association with so many people willing to help the genocide survivors , starting with young kids and themselves .
kuko niwo wonyine nibonye y' uko ... harimo n' abantu benshi barimo ubona bafite ubushake bwo kufasha abacitse ku icumu . bahereye ku bana bato kandi nabo bihereyeho . njyae nbona ari umuryango ... kubera ko nrawukoreye , nwubayemo igihe kirekire , ||| i think it is an association worth ... i even worked with them and lived with them for a long time .
ubona ari umuryango ushobora ku ... kutuma umuntu yiumvamo yuko kuba yarabuze ababyeyi ... ariko inshuti cyangwa umunyeshuri bigana ashobora kurangiza inshingano umubyeyi we yagombaaga kukora . ||| it was an organization that helps people believe that , although they lost their parents , some friends or a fellow students can try and do as much as a parent as much as possible .
ikaizerae nywufitemo rero n' uko igihe cyose uzaba ukiriho , abana bazagabanya kaumva ko bari imfubyi . ||| and my hope is that as long as that association is still operating , orphans will stop looking at themselves as orphans .
abana bazaumva yuko umuryango witwa a.e.r.g ubabereye aho ababyeyi n' inshuti zabakundaaga batari . ||| that they will find that , in the absence of their parents and friends , a.e.r.g. is there for them .
kuko bawuboneramo amahoro , ||| that they 'll find peace in it .
njyae nrabizi kuko nwubayemo nnjyae nwuboneyemo amahoro . ||| i know this from experience ; i once lived there and found peace in it .
hari ikintu ubona jenoside ituigisha ... hari isomo ubona tuyikuramo ? ||| do we learn anything from the genocide ? do we learn anything from the genocide ... ? does genocide ... does it teach us anything ?
ubundi kuba jenoside yarabaye , yigisha byinshi . ||| the occurency of the genocide teaches a lot .
yatuigishije byinshi , ||| there is much we learn from it .
ntituishima kuba yarabaye , ariko nyuma abantu bakuze batarakura . abantu bafashe responsabilites [ inshingano ] ari abana kandi babiikuramo neza , bikurikije na experience bagize . ||| we are not happy that it occured but it has helped people grow before time . people became responsible while they were still young and they forgot they were young due to the experience they went through in life .
ntinvuga ngo ni nziza , ahubwo hari icyo yatuigishije kikomeye , cyo kumenya yuko ugomba kuimenya . ||| well it was n't a good experience but it taught us great lessons .
cyo kumenya yuko ... kumenya aho ugeze , ukanamenya n' icyo ukorera undi , ||| a lesson on knowing who you are , how far you can go , how to behave with others and where you belong in this world .
no kumenya uruhare rwawe muri iyi si . ibyo ari byo byose numva jenoside yabaye yatuigishije byinshi ku bierekeye na responsabilites [ inshingano ] umuntu agomba kufata . ||| generally genocide taught us a lot of things as far as being responsible is concerned .
ugira icyo utubwira ku muryango mpuzamahanga ? ni irihae somo umuryango mpuzamahanga ukwaiye kuigira ku bibaye ? ||| what do you think the international comunity should learn ?
ibihugu by' amahanga cyangwa se abanyamahanga , bakwaiye kumenya yuko icyo bavuze batagomba kuisubiraho . ||| the international community needs to know that it is very important to keep one 's word and that they can not take it back .
bagomba kumenya kandi ko bagize intege nkeya zo kutabara , abapfaaga mu gihugu cyacu . ||| they also need to know that they did very little to save the people who were dying in our country .
bagomba kumenya kandi ko hari abasigaye , kandi abo basigaye bakeneye ubuzima nk' ubwabo . ||| they also need to know that survivors are there and that these survivors need to live a good life .
bagomba kuibuka y' uko jenoside yabayeho , kandi bakaha icyubahiro abayizize kuko batagiye ari imbwa . kandi bakamenya yuko bazize ubusa . ||| they need to know that the genocide actually happened and they need to show respect to its victims and to acknowledge that these victims were actually innocent .
wunva wifuza kuzagira umuryango umunsi umwe ? ||| can i ask you the same question again .... would you like to have a family one day ?
numva mu ntego zanjye nazo nfite mu munsi iri inberae , no kugira umuryango nabyo birimo . ||| in my future plans , i plan to have a family .
ni ukuvuga yuko ningira umuryango , no mu byo niteguye kuzakora ku muryango wanjye , ni ukutanga inyigisho nhawe nyine . ||| and i plan to teach my family the same morals i was taught .
ni iki uzajya ubabwira ? ||| what would you tell them ?
ikintu cya mbere , ni ukumenya y' uko ijambo ry' umubyeyi riba rifite agaciro kakomeye . icyo bagomba kukifata , ||| what they first need to know is that the word of a parent is of great value .
bakakishyira ku mutaima . cyane cyane iyo ari ryiza ... nzajya ngenda nbaha urugero rw' ibyo nbawiyew , ||| that 's something they need to know and keep in their hearts ; especially when they are positive advice .
y' uko nshaka yuko nabo ubwabo bagomba kugenda babwira abazabakomokaho . ||| i will keep on showing them the example of what i was told so they can one day tell it to their descendants .
ubwo aho nravuga abana banjye n' uwo tuzaba turufatanije . ||| here i am talking about my wife and my children .
hanyuma turangiza , nagirango utubwirae tuvuga ko freddy ari muntu ki , muri iki kihae ? ||| and finally , who is freddy today ? which sort of a person are you ?
njyewe uwo nriwe , ni ikibazo kigoye kukisubiza , ariko numva ndi umwe mu bacitse ku icumu , bafite igitekerezo k' iterambere ryabo . ||| i feel like i am one of the survivors who have the development of all the others on their heart , whose goal is for us to be united as we fight against all the consequences of the genocide .
bafite kandi n' intego y' ubufatanye mu rwego rwo kurwana n' ingaruka z' itsembabwoko . ndi umwe kandi mu bahora barota amajyambere y' igihugu cyanjye . kandi ndi umwe kandi mu bahora barota kurwanya igitekerezo icyo aricyo cyose , kiganaish ku itsembabwoko ni ukuvuga @: ||| i am one of the people who dreams of a developed rwanda and i am also one of those who really wants to fight all genocidal ideologies .
[ ideologie genocidaire ] . ibyo n' abandi benshi nzi nabo ntazi , tufite umugambi wo kuzabarwanya tuivuye inyuma . ||| several people , some of whom i know and others i do n't know are ready to fight those ideas as much as we can .
kandi tukaba tufite n' umugambi wo kuzamura i gihugu cyacu . ibyo tuzabigeraho tuibanda cyane kubakiri batoya , tubakuramo ibitekerezo bibi , baiga n' ibitekerezo byiza . ||| our plan is to build our nation and we shall make it only if we put into consideration the younger generations and if we work towards removing all bad ideologies from their minds and replace them with new ones .
turi ku itariki 29 werurwe 2004 , turi i kigali , kandi turaganira na rosette . ||| this is the 29th of march 2004 , in kigali and we are speaking to rosette .
rosette , mbere na mbere ubanza kutuibwira ? amazina yawe n' imyaka ufite . ||| rosette could you first of all give me your name and your age ?
nitwa sebasoni musabae rosette , nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu . ||| my name is sebasoni musabe rosette , i am twenty @-@ five years old .
hanyuma nyuma ya jenoside ... upfushije abantu bangahe mu muryango wawe muri jenoside ? ||| and after the genocide ehh ... how many of your family were killed in the genocide ?
mu kihae cya jenoside hapfuye ababyeyi banjye hapfa n' abavandimwe banjye bane ... ubwo bose hamwe ni batandatu . ||| during genocide , i lost my parents and my four sisters . in total , i lost six people in my family .
unbwira kuri mama wawe ? sa n' umunshushanyiriza mu magambo , nbwira mama wawe . ||| can you describe for me ... eh , describe for me your mother ?
maman wanjye yari ... nvuga ngo yari umubyeyi utangaje cyane , kuko nmubonyeho urugero rukomeye . ||| my mother was a wonderful parent . because i learnt strong lesson from her .
yari umubyeyi uzi kuturera neza cyane , ||| she a parent who knew very well how to look after us .
njya nbitangaho urugero . ||| her great example is still very vivid in me .
yatubwiraaga byose nk' abana yabyaye , ||| she was very open with us , she used to tell us everything .
biratutangazaaga kaumva atubwira ko atukunda . ku buryo tubibwiraaga n' abandi bavuga bati @: "@ ibyo nta mubyeyi ubibwira umwana . @" ||| we used to think it strange that she would tell us that she loved us ; everyone we would tell about it could not believe it , as it is not something a parent easily expresses to his @/@ her child [ in our culture ] .
ariko yari umubyeyi uzi kuturera neza , ||| but she was a parent who knew how to look after her children .
akamenya kubaan neza n' abantu , cyane abantu bose n' ubu tuumva babivuga , n' ubu atakiriho . ||| she was very sociable and people still say so today .
akamenya kujya inama abantu bazaaga kumugisha inama . akagira inshuti nyinshi cyane , urugo rw' iwacu ruhoraaga rugendaw . tuhoraaga tubona abantu , ||| she was a very good adviser , people used to come home to seek advice from her . she had very many friends and there would always be visitors at home .
abaza kuhaba , abo arihair amashuri , ||| we used to see several people coming home ; some would come to live at home , others would come for school fees or some were domestic workers .
abakozi nk' uje ari umukozi , yabona hari ... yabona amenye ubwenge , yabona ko hari icyo yazavamo , akamujyana mu ishuri . ||| if my mum found a worker to be bright enough to go to school , my mum would take him or her to school .
turi tufite abantu benshi yagiye arihair amashuri , akabajyana no muri secondaire bari baraje ari abakozi bo mu rugo . ||| they are a lot of people whom she took to school and some went up to secondary yet they started as domestic workers at home .
kumuvugaho biba birebire cyane , icyo nzi cyo yari umubyeyi utangaje . ||| saying everything about her would take ages ; all i know is that she was a very wonderful parent .
noneho nbwira no kuri papa wawe . ||| tell me about your father .
icyo nvuga kuri papa ni uko nawe yari umubyeyi utangaje . ||| all i can say about my father ... he was also a wonderful parent .
tubibonye wenda akenshi nyuma ya jenoside , aho tuumva bose babavuga neza , ||| we realized it after the genocide as people say a lot of good about them .
bavuga bati @: "@ ntibiri kushoboka ahari ko babana ngo basazaane , tuesae batubonae tukuze , ||| they say , "@ it seemed impossible that such good people would spend their old age together and see their own children when the latter are adults . @"
" kuko ibyo nvuze kuri mama , nibyo nvuga no kuri papa . kuko papa we ... ntiyagiraaga amagambo menshi , ||| actually all i said about my mum similarly applies to my dad .
ariko yari afite inshuti nyinshi cyane . ||| although he was a quiet man , he also had so many friends .
... cyane abo bakoranye , abo babanye , ||| ... especially his collegues and neighbours .
n' ubu inshuti tufite nyinshi abantu bagiye batufasha nyuma ya jenoside ni abantu bashoboye kubaan neza na papa . ||| and most friends we have now ... the people who helped us after the genocide were my father 's friends .
abo baiganye , abo bakoranye ... kusa umubyeyi w' umu mama burya niwe ukunda kuegera abana cyane ariko data nawe yatureraanye urukundo . ||| former schoolmates , colleagues ... usually the female parent is the one who is more familiar with the children . however , our dad too showed us love .
nbwira noneho ibihe byiza ugize mu buzima bwawe . ku bw' umwihariko ibintu wibuka bikushimaishije ... ukiri kumwe n' ababyeyi . ||| tell me about happy times ... a particularly happy memory that you have with your parents .
uwankurikiraga yitwaaga consolee , ||| the one who was after me was called consolee , another one was called angelique .
undi yitwaaga angelique ukurikiraagaho witwaga illuminee undi yitwaaga florence . ||| she was followed by the one called illuminee . another one was called florence .
turi tufite n' undi mwana twarairaga [ adoptif ] ubwo nawe tubara nk' umwana yitwaaga jeanne nawe yabaga i wacu nawe tumubaraga nk' umwana . ||| there was also an adopted child at home called jeanne . we considered her as part of our family .
bishoboka ko unsubirairmo amazina y' abavandimwe bawe na none ? ||| sorry , could you please tell me the names of your sisters again ?
abavandimwe banjye bapfuye muri genocide hari uwitwaga consolee , hari uwitwaga angelique , hari uwitwaga illuminee , n' undi witwaga florence . ||| my sisters who died in the genocide , were consolee , angelique , illuminee and florence .
ariko hari n' undi adoptif nawe bapfaanye tufataaga nk' umwana wacu , ||| but there was also an adopted child who died together with them and we considered her as our sister .
nawe bapfaanye witwaga jeanne . ||| she was called jeanne .
imibanire yawe na barumuna bawe yari iyihe ? ese mwasabanaga mutae ? ||| what was your relationship with your sisters , how did you get on with your sisters ?
icyo nvuga kuri ... ku bavandimwe banjye , bari bakiri bato , ||| what i can say about my sisters ... they were still young .
igihe tuvuye i burunri , haciyemo igihe kinini mu rugo batarashobora kubyara abandi bana ... bakibiitegura . ||| it took long time before my parents gave birth to other children after we left burundi . they were still preparing themselves for having other children .
ubwo abana .. abato ... bari bato kuri twebwe . ikintu ... icyo ... turi tumeze bari abana bari bazi kaubaha cyane , ||| therefore , the young ones were much younger than us . they were very obedient kids .
banfata nka tantine wabo . nk' umuntu mukuru ubakuraiye , ||| they considered me as their aunt . they considered me as someone more mature than them .
tukabaha discipline [ tukabashira ku murongo ] kuko ariko mama yajyaaga atubwira . ||| we used to discipline them because that is what mum used to tell us .
ikindi nvuga cy' icyenzi nvuga , ni uko mama yari yaratubujije kutukaan . abana bacu tubahaga uburaire , ||| another thing i can say , our mother had forbidden us to fight . we used to teach them good manners ; we would tell them that none of them should abuse the other .
tubabwira ko nta muntu ugomba kutuka undi . ko ... akajya atubwira ko ngo kera iyo babwiraaga umuntu ngo n' ikigoryi , yakuraaga yumva ko ari cyo . mama rero akatubuza akatubwira ati @: ||| she used to tell us that insulting someone as stupid could make them grow up with a belief that he or she is actually stupid .
"@ ntimuzaongerae , ntinzaumvae umwana utuka undi . @" ||| therefore , she would warn them never do it again , she told them she did not want to ever hear them abusing each other .
ku buryo n' abo abana tuvukanaaga , ariwo muco tubatozaaga . ||| and that is the discipline we taught to our young sisters .
nta muntu ushoboraaga kutukaan . barakubaganaaga nk' abandi bana , tukabahana . ||| of course they were naughty just like other children are and we would punish them .
ariko ikintu cyo kutukaan ntibakigiraaga . kuko turi turakibabujije . ||| but they would never abuse each other because we told them not to .
ikintu na ... ikindi nkuibukair ku bavandimwe banjye , ni uko umwana witwa angelique , yari umwana ubona atasanzwe , ||| another thing i recall about my relatives , angelique was an extraordinary child .
yari afite ubwenge bwinshi muri we ... afite ubwenge bwinshi muri we . nraibuka ko yajyaaga akina umukino witwa dame ... dame ngirango abantu barayizi benshi , ||| she was very bright . i remember she was good at playing draughts ; it is a very popular game .
yajyaaga akina dame n' abantu bakuze . bafite nk' imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu ... mirongo itatu . ||| she would play with twenty @-@ five or thirty @-@ year @-@ old people .
ni umukino usaba ubwenge , usaba kutekereza . ||| it a game that requires thinking .
ariko yarawukinaaga abantu bose akabatsinda . ||| but she would win over them all yet she would be the youngest .
ari umwana , icyo nrabiibuka ko yigaga mu wa kabiri yari mu mashuri abanza , ||| i remember she was in primary two .
yakinaaga n' abantu benshi akabatsinda . ||| she won over many people .
ikindi mwibukiraho yari umwana ufunguye cyane mu mutawe , ku buryo kuva kera yari azi kutandukanya indirimbo , nvuga nka sorte z' indirimbo . ||| i remember she was a very sharp child ; she knew how to distiguish different types of music at a very young age .
yakaumva iyi akavuga ngo ni funk , ukaumva ngo ni rock , akaba azi ngo ni zouk akiri muto , ||| i mean types of music ; she could listen to music and tell which one is funky , which is rock and which is zouk .
akabikunda akakunda kubyina cyane . abantu benshi bakamukunda , ||| she also enjoyed dancing a lot and most people liked her .
akaiga muri maternelle [ ibinyoni ] hari abantu baigishaaga ahongaho bajya bamujyana kuri lac , bakamujyana i gisenyi , bakamujyana ku kibuye yari umwana ushimaishije cyane . ||| while she was still in nursery school , her teachers used to take her to the lake in gisenyi or in kibuye .
ku buryo abantu bose bamukundaaga cyane , ||| she was such an interesting child that almost everybody liked her .
akamenya kuririmba akamenya kukunda abantu ari mutoya ni ... tuumva ko tumufite ikintu cyo kumwibuka cyane . ||| she knew how to sing and how to make friends as young as she was . she left us special memories , we shall always remember her .
urebye abandi bari bafite caractere isa nk' icecetse , ||| the other children had a more quiet spirit .
ariko we yari eveillee [ afungutse mu mutawe ] ... cyane yari umuntu uzi ... ubona ko utamufata nk' umwana , ||| however , she was different , she was more noisy . it was easy to forget she was just a child looking at her ability to reason like an adult .
n' ibitekerezo bye ukaumva ko utamufata nk' umwana . ||| no one considered her to be young .
kandi yapfuye afite imyaka mike , yapfuye afite imyaka icumi kusa . ||| but , she died so young ; she was only ten years old .
uwakubaza nk' ikintu kimwe wibukiraho mama wawe , uvuga ikihae ? ||| if you were going to remember only one thing about your mother , what would it be ?
ikintu nkuibukairho maman cyane ... cyane ni ... ni ukujya inama . nvuga ngo @: ||| what i remember about my mother ... is the advice she used to give all types of people .
elle etait conseillere de tout le monde [ yari umujyanama w' abantu bose ] nicyo abantu benshi bamukundiraaga , kuko yacaishaga make , akashobora kujya inama cyane . ||| and that was why most people liked her . she was humble and able to give people advice .
numva aricyo ngicyo . ||| i guess that is the one thing i recall .
none se ibyo urabibonye biba ? ||| did you see it happen ?
yes ! ibyo byo nrabibonye kuko babatwaye turi kumwe , babica tubona ... ||| yes , i saw it . because we were together when they took them . and killed them in our presence .
bibaye bite ? ||| what happened ?
mukihae cyo ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane [ 7 /04 /1994 ] , turi turi mu kiruhuko , turi muri vacance . nibuka ko hari igihe nri nvuye ku isoko , ||| on the 7th of april 1994 , it was during the holidays ... i remember i was with mum coming from the market .
ndi kumwe na mama , aranbwira ati ... ibyo ari byo byose yari amaze kusoma ikinya ... hari ikinyamakuru yari amaze kusoma . aranbwira ati : ||| then she told me that ... meanwhile she had read a certain newspaper .
"@ ariko mu rwanda hashobora kuba hagiye kuba ibintu bibi cyane tutari tuiteze . @" ||| then she said , "@ horrible things are going to suddenly happen in rwanda . @"
avugana n' undi muntu uri inshuti ye witwaga savera , ariko n' ubu aracyariho baraganira . tunyura ku isoko tugura ibyo tuguraaga turataha ... ... tutega imodoka turataha . ||| then she talked to her friend called xaverine who is still alive today . then we passed by the market and brought a few things , then went back home .
agenda anbwira ukuntu ibintu bimeze . ||| she went telling me how bad the situation was .
ubwo ntitubiitegaaga ariko ku itariki zirindwi [ ubwo hari mu matariki nk' ane ] , ku itariki zirindwi niho [ indege ya habyarimana nyine imaze kuhanuka ] . tutangiye mu ijoro , ||| but we were not prepared for anything like what happened . then on the 7th [ around the 4th ] on the 7th ... that is when ... [ after habyarimana 's plane crashed ] it began at night .
tutangira kaumva bavuga bari mu cyumba ababyeyi bacu . barabyuka baravuga bati : "@ nimubyukae ibintu ntibimeze neza , ||| we heard them talking in the bedroom [ our parents ] they woke us up and said , "@ wake @-@ up , things are not good . @"
" batangira kaumva amaradio y' amanyamahanga , babiumva mu gifaransa no mu cyongereza . ||| they tunned on the foreign news and heard it being said in both french and english .
tubabaza uko bimeze , baratubwira bati @: "@ mwigira ubwoba ariko hashobora kuba hatagiye kuba ibintu byiza muri iki gihugu . @" ||| then we asked them what was taking place , they told us not to worry , but bad things were likely to happen in this country .
hanyuma mu gitondo niho tuumvise umuntu w' umuturanyi , turi tuturanye , ||| in the morning we heard that our neighbour had been killed .
bavuga ngo baramwishe . mama aratubwira ati @: ... atutumaho umuntu ucuruzaaga hafi y' iwacu , yumvaaga ko agomba kuica ari umututsi aravuga ati @: ||| then mum sent us to a certain person who was selling ... in the neighbourhood , he was also a tutsi .
"@ mugendae mumunbwiraire ko ibintu bikomeye , afungae . @" ||| she told us to go and tell him that he should close his shop because things had deteriorated .
yari afite akabari . ||| he was running a bar .
hanyuma tugiye kumubwira tuhura n' abantu bariho bajya kuica abantu , ||| and on our way as we were going to tell him , we met people going to kill others .
turagaruka ntitugira icyo tuvuga . ||| we ran back home and never said anything .
ariko mu by' ukuri ... ubwo intambara niho yari itangiye , batangira kuica abantu . ||| that was when the war had really started ; people started to kill .
twebwe mu rugo iwacu bahishe ku itariki cumi n' ebyiri . ku tariki cumi n' ebyiri niho baje , ||| at home they came to kill on the 12th .
bari babanje kuturinda , tubona abantu baravuga ngo @: bazaturinda @: ||| they first protected us ; some people were willing to protect us .
twebwe nta kintu bazatutwara . ||| "@ nothing will happen to you @"@ , they promised .
ariko abantu bakaturuka hirya no hino , bavuga ngo @: "@ niba urugo rw' iwacu rutarapfa abatutsi ntibarapfa , inyenzi ntizirapfa ... @" ||| but people from different areas were saying that if our family was still alive , then no tutsi was dead , then the inyenzi were still alive .
hanyuma tuza kubona ibitero biturutse i gisenyi biza bitusanga mu rugo , ||| later we were attacked by groups from gisenyi ... they headed towards our home .
bibaza ukuntu tutarapfa mbese batabiumva . ||| they could n't believe we were still alive .
hanyuma bashobora kurwana n' abantu bari bahari bashaka kuturinda , b' abasirikare n' interahamwe , ariko bakajya baba mu rugo batubwira bati @: " tuishe kwa kanaka , ||| therefore , they fought those who were protecting us ... the soldiers and interahamwe who used to come home would tell us who else they had killed and in what way they had killed them ... @" mum would constantly comfort us saying , "@ do n't be scared .
tubaishe gutya , " ariko cyane cyane nravuga nka mama niwe ututeguraaga . akatubwira ati @: "@ ntimugirae ubwoba . ||| even if you die , several people have died too , do n't be afraid .
niyo mwapfa , hapfuye abantu benshi , ntimugirae ubwoba , ubwo araba ari ukuvuga ngo nta mututsi ugomba kusigara . ||| that would just mean that all the tutsi were meant to die . maybe if you survive you might suffer .
n' iyo mwasigara mwasigara nabi . ati @: ntimugirae ubwoba abantu bose bapfuye muri iyi quartier nitwae tusigaye twenyine ... @" uraumva baraturinze batubuza no kuhunga , ngo nitugume aho . ||| so do n't be afraid , all people in this area have died , we are the only ones remaining ... @" they were protecting us and stopping us from fleeing telling us that we should n't go anywhere and that we should just stay there .
hanyuma igitero cyo kuri cumi n' ebyiri [ 12/04/1994 ] kitusize , kuri cumi n' enye [ 14/04/1994 ] ... ariko mu rugo bari bamaze kuza , baravuga bati @: abahungu bose nibavemo , ||| then later , after the attack of the 12th of april 1994 left us alive , on the 14th of april 1994 ... meanwhile they had come home and said that all the boys should come out .
musaza wanjye mukuru ntiyari ahari , n' abantu tubanaaga b' aba cousins bacu [ babyara bacu ] barabafata babajyana ahandi hantu bakajya baba mu maplafond . ||| but my older brother was not there ; together with other cousins who lived at home , they had taken them to hide in the ceiling of other people 's house .
noneho icyo kihae bahasanze nta mu ... hari ababyeyi kusa , hari nnjyae . n' abandi bantu bato ... n' abandi bari bahungiye iwacu bibaza ngo bazaturinda . ||| therefore , they did n't find any ... they only found my parents and i plus the young ones , who had come to hide at home thinking that we would be protected .
hanyuma kuri cumi n' enye , nibwo igitero kije kiratuirukankaan kiratushaka aho turi turi hose , ||| on the 14th is when the group of attackers ran after us and searched for us in all corners where we were hiding .
turahunga baratushaka baratubona , ||| we fled but they followed us and found us .
ba ... njyewe ngiye ahantu munsi y' igitanda banankubita ikintu cy' ubuhairi bariho bashakisha ... mu rubavu . ||| i myself hid under the bed . they even hit me with a club on my ribs while they were searching for me .
nravuga nti @: ||| then i decided to get out .
reka nvaemo , ||| i had realised that they may kill me inside there . we came out .
kuko nri maze kaumva ko ubwo bagiye kunyiciramo n' iki ... tuvamo ba ... barumuna banjye barabairukankaan bari abana batoya ba criya [ crier ] bavuza induru ... hanyuma bafata ababyeyi banjye ... ntibatuha umwanya . ||| they ran after my young sisters . they were young and they were screaming . they took my parents .
baravuga bati @: "@ abantu bose barashize nimawe mwari musigaye , muri inyenzi nkuru , ||| then they said , "@ everyone is dead , you are the only ones remaining , yet you are the top inyenzi [ cochroaches ] " then they killed them .
" ba ... barabica . ariko mama agiye kugenda aratusezera . ||| mum said goodbye to us before they left .
turavuga tuti @: reka tusezerae , ntibatumye ubwo tusezera kuri papa , ||| we asked them to let us say goodbye to them but they never let us say goodbye to dad .
ariko tusezeye kuri mama , ||| but we got to say goodbye to our mum .
mama aratubwira ati @: "@ muzakomerae . @" ||| then mum told us , "@ be strong . @"
ikintu kitutangaje ni uko yatubwiye ngo @: "@ ntacyo muzaba mwebwe , ngo @: ||| and the way she told us , "@ nothing will ever happen to you .
hari abavandimwe banyu bari i burunri hari n' abandi bose bari i kigali hirya no hino , ||| you have several relatives in burundi and in kigali .
muzabanae nabo nta kibazo . ||| you shall live with them with no problem and nothing will happen to you @" still surprises me today .
ati ntacyo muzaba ... @" ikintu yatubwiye yaratubwiye ngo @: "@ muzabae abagabo , ||| the only thing she told us is to be strong .
" turamusezera turagenda . ubwo rero bo baravuga bati @: ||| we said goodbye to her and then we left .
"@ ntabwo mwe tubica turashaka kuica inyenzi nkuru , ||| then they said , "@ we will n't kill you , we only want to kill old chockroaches .
bati hanyuma abandi nimugendae . @" ||| the rest of you can leave . @"
batushyira ku muntu w' umusaza , ariko hari n' abandi bantu b' interahamwe , ||| we were taken to a certain old man 's house but there were several other interahamwe .
barabaturindaish baravuga bati @: "@ aba bana nibava hano tuzabica . @" ||| they told those interahamwe to keep an eye on us , "@ these kids should not leave this place , we shall kill them later ! @" they were back on the 15thof april 1994 .
baza kuza ku itariki cumi n' eshanu [ 15/04/1994 ] interahamwe zaraye ziturarairiye , batutuka , bavuga uko baishe abantu ... abavandimwe bacu n' iki ... bukeye mu gitondo baza kufata barumuna bacu , ||| the interahamwe had spent the whole night watching us ; they abused us , bragging about how they had killed people and some of them [ the people they killed ] were our relatives . in the morning they came to get our sisters .
baravuga ngo @: twebwe ngo @: tubarushya ngo @: turi bakuru n' iki ... hanyuma barabafata barabica , ||| they said , "@ you , you look older , killing you would require some energy . @" therefore , they took our sisters and killed them .
abana bagenda batusezera , bati @: "@ murabeho muzabaeho neza , imaan izabafashe ... @" mbese wagirango bari bazi ko ahubwo tuzanabaho , ||| poor kids , all the way they went saying goodbye to us , "@ bye bye ... we wish you a good life and may god help you ... @" it was surprising to see them talking to us as though they knew we would actually survive for everyone [ tutsi ] was entitled to die .
kuko buri wese kuri ukupfa , ntinzi impamvu wenda bo bashoboraaga kutusezera bavuga ngo @: muzabaeho ngo muzagirae kutae ... hanyuma , ||| i really wonder why they said words like such as ‘ we wish you a long , good life ’ .
tu ... tuva ... tuvuye ahongaho batangiye kuvuga ko bashaka kuzantwara bakantandukanya na musaza wanjye , ||| later we left that place when we realized that they wanted to separate me from my brother .
bakazanjyana muri congo bakazagira kutae ... tuza kugira ... tuza kuha umuntu amafaranga , aratucikaish ari ninjoro . umwe akajya agenda nk' ugiye kuri toilette [ ku musaraane ] n' undi kuri toilette , ||| they were planning to take me to congo and do with me ... we bribed someone and then he helped us escape at night .
turagenda . ||| we left as though we were going for a short call , one by one and then we all left .
turagiye tusa nk' aho twazungurutse hafi u rwanda rwose , za kitaarama ... za gikongoro ntinzi ubanza n' i cyangugu turahageze kuko kenshi tugendaaga ninjoro . ||| we walked so much that it seemed as though we had walked around the whole of rwanda , in gitarama , in gikongoro and maybe in cyangugu as well . most of the time we used to walk at night .
nraumva ... tuza kurokoka ... tunyuze mu bikomeye nraumva kubisubiramo ahari biba ikibazo . ||| i guess ... for us to survive , we went through several hardships ; it would take too long to talk about everything one by one .
tunyuze muri byinshi , tuishwe n' inzara , turaye mu bihuru , ||| we went through many things , we were starving most of the time , we spent nights in the bush .
hari igihe tugeraaga ahantu tukabura ikintu ... tukabu ... turi nko mu ishyamba , nraibuka hariho igihe tuigeze kugera mu ishyamba ntituzi aho ariho , ||| we used to get somewhere and fail to find ... i remember once in the forest , we had no idea where we were , neither which province it was .
ntituzi ngo ni muyihae province [ ntara ] . tuumva impyisi , tuinjiye mu ishyamba tunanirwa kusohoka tunanirwa no kuinjira . ||| then we suddenly heard hyenas . we got into the forest ; we did n't seem to know whether we wanted to get in or out of it .
hanyuma tuumva impyisi ziza zihuma zishaka kuturya n' iki ... turyama ahongaho imvura ikatunyagira , ||| then we heard the hyenas squealing and heading towards us , wanting to bite us . we slept there and were rained on .
ku manywa tukairirwa tuihishe ninjoro tukagenda , ||| we used to hide at day time and spend the night walking .
nri ndi kumwe na musaza wanjye witwa freddy . ||| i was with my brother called freddy .
nraumva ari ibyo . ||| i guess that is it .
uba uzi uburyo ababyeyi bawe baishwe ? ||| do you know how your parents died ?
ababyeyi banjye babaicishije ... babaicishije amahiri . ||| my parents were hit with clubs to death .
babaicishije amahiri . barabaishe babata ku gasozi , babavugairho amagambo menshi cyane , ||| after killing them , they threw their bodies outside and cursed them .
nyuma ku mugoroba musaza wanjye n' undi muntu umwe , baragenda barabafata babarenzaho ibitaka . kubera ko bari babatayeho ku gasozi . ||| later that evening my brother went and covered them with some soil with the help of someone else .
wigeze ubona n' amaso yawe interahamwe zaica abantu ? ||| did you witness ... did you see the interahamwe carrying out their killings ?
nbonye interahamwe zaica abantu . ||| i saw the interahamwe killing people .
tubaye ... twebwe tubaye mu ntiambara igihe kinini , kitari ukwezi kumwe , kitari n' abiri . ||| we experienced the war for quite a long time , not just one or two months .
kuko kuva ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane [ 7/04/1994 ] kugera ku itariki ya mbere y' ukwezi kwa munani [ 1/08/1994 ] twe turi tukiri mu ntiambara , kuko turiho tuirukanka . ||| from the 7th of april 1994 to the 1st of august 1994 , we were going through the war because we were still running away .
interahamwe zaicaaga abantu tubona . ||| we witnessed the interahamwes murdering many people .
zibarasa , abandi zikabakubita amahiri , tubibona . ||| some were shot down and some were beaten up with clubs and we saw it all happening .
akenshi tukasimbuka abapfu tukagenda , tukagera kuri bariyeri , bakica abantu . twebwe tuka ... bakatubwira bati @: ||| we sometimes had to jump over dead bodies as we were running away . we could at times reach a roadblock and they would tell us to go away with the hope that we would be killed on the next one .
"@ nimujyae inberae muicwae n' abandi , cyangwa tukabacika . ||| in other cases we were able to somehow escape .
twa ... nrababonye benshi bica abantu . ||| i saw many of them killing people .
ushobora kunbwira ikintu kikomeye kikusigaye mu buengae ... mbese ntashaka kuvuga ikintu kimwe mu bintu bikomeye ubonye bitajya bikuvamo . ariko mbere banza unbwirae , ni kutae wiyumvaga kiriya kihae ? ||| can you describe for me anything very dificult ... can you discribe for me , the ... just one of those things you saw that stays very strongly in your mind and maybe ... no. before you do that , what was going though your mind ?
ese uri ufite ubwoba bwinshi , cyangwa wiyumvagamo kuzarokoka ... muri wowe icyo kihae biri bimeze kutae ? gerageza ubitubwirae . ||| was it fear , was it survival , what happened during that time ... what were you thinking ... what were you feeling ?
mukihae cya jenoside , tumaze ibyumweru bibiri tufite ubwoba bwinshi ... tumaze icyumweru tufite ubwoba bwinshi cyane . ||| during genocide , we spent two weeks very frightened ... for a week we were so terrified .
ariko aho tumaze kubona bamaze kuica ababyeyi , baishe abavandimwe , tubona abantu bose bashize . ||| and after we saw our parents being killed , our sisters and other people ... when we realized that all people were finished .
nta ... nta muntu usigaye , ikintu kisa ... cy' ubwoba kisa nk' ikikuvuyemo . ukibaza ahubwo impamvu utapfuye . ||| all the fear disappeared . the only problem remaining was why you did n't die with the rest .
nraibuka hari igihe umuntu yaje ... yitwaaga niyonsenga nrabiibuka , aranbwira ngo @: arashaka kunjyana ngo akampungana , ngo @: ||| i remember this man called nyarusenge who came and told me he wanted to help me flee so i would n't die ; he said he was going to take my brother somewhere else .
ntinzapfae , ngo musaza wanjye nawe ngo bakareba aho bamujyana . kandi icyo kihae nri muto , ariko nkaumva ko muri gahunda ze ashaka nko kungira umugore , ||| i was still very young but i could understand that he either wanted me to become his wife or he had in mind to rape me .
cyangwa se ashaka nko kumviyora [ ku nfata ku ngufu ] . ntinzi ... yari afite ubuhairi hari ubwo baitaaga ‘ nta mpongano y' umwanzi ’ , ubuhairi buri bufite imisumari . ||| he had a club they called nta mpongano y' umwanzi [ a spiked club ] .
hanyuma aranbwira ngo ... aranbwira ngo @: "@ ninjye mu nzu ngo aransanga yo , ngo nininjire munzu iwe . @" ||| he asked me to enter the house and wait for him .
numva biranbabaje cyane . ||| i was so hurt !
ikintu kikuereka ko ubwoba buri burashize , ni uko nmubwiye nabi cyane . nramubwira nti @: ||| what shows that all fear was gone is the way i replied him so rudely , "@ i can not do that ! @"
ibyo ntinshobora kubiemera ... ... ni nacyo kintu urebya kitumye tuva ahongaho , turi turi . kuko turi tuumvise ko ibintu bikomeye , ||| i think that 's the reason why we left that place ... when we realized that things were going so wrong .
bavuga ko bashobora no kuza kumviyora [ kunfata ku ngufu ] n' iki ... musaza wanjye abiumvise , ||| they were saying that they would come to rape me .
nnjyae ubwanjye bimaze kuntera ubwoba , turavuga tuti @: "@ tujyae kugwa ahandi . @" ||| when my brother heard about that ... i was scared about that ... we decided to go and be killed elsewhere .
ni ukuvuga ngo igihe cya jenoside jyae nri nrashize ubwoba ku bwanjye . ||| during the genocide , i was n't scared most of the time .
njyewe nramubwiye nti @: "@ uraumva ushaka kunyica ngo unyicae ? ||| i told him , "@ if you feel like killing me then just go ahead and kill me .
ababyeyi banjye barize , bapfuye bafite diplome [ impamyabushobozi ] , bapfa barabanye nawe bapfa barakugaburiye , uza mu gitero cyo kubica , ||| my parents are now dead , they were educated people , they had degrees ... you were among the attackers who came to kill them yet you once lived together , they once fed you , you were friends .
urabanye nabo . none uraumva ko njyewe ushaka kunfata uko ushaka . ||| and now you want to use me in any way of your wish . @"
nramubwira nti @: "@ aho kugirango mbe umugore wawe , cyangwa mpungane nawe , unyica . @" ||| i went on and told him , "@ i 'd rather be killed than becoming your wife or fleeing with you . @"
ajya mu nzu afite umujinya mwinshi cyane , anbwira ngo @: "@ afite uburenganzira bwo kunyica . @" ||| he entered the house , very angry saying that he had the rights to kill me .
nravuga nti @: "@ ko utanyica se ? @" ||| then i asked him that , "@ why do n't you kill me ? @"
arabiihorera aragenda , ||| he just kept quiet and left .
ubwo bari bategereje kutugirair nabi ninjoro . ||| but they were waiting for the nightfall to kill us .
ahari bagiye kureba ubundi bugomae bunri bari buze kunkorera , cyangwa baza kutukorera , ||| it could even be that they were thinking of other ways of mistreating me or both of us .
njyae nri ndi kumwe na musaza wanjye . ||| i was with my brother .
hanyuma imaan iratufasha tuzinduka tugiye , ||| but god helped us and and we left in the morning .
baratubura . ||| they never found us .
kikuereka ko nta bwoba umuntu yari afite mu by' ukuri . ||| it shows that in reality , we were n't scared .
nta ... icyo kihae bwo nta bwoba turi tufite . ||| by then , all fear was gone .
ushobora kunbwira ikintu kikomeye ubonye , ikintu kibi ... kibi cyane , kitajya kikuva mu buengae [ mu bitekerezo ] . ||| can you discribe for me just ... just something you saw during that time , which really stayed in your mind as the most terrible , the most difficult moment ?
ikintu kinbabaza cyane , ni ukuntu baishe barumuna banjye . ||| the one thing that still hurts so much is the way my sisters were killed .
numva ababyeyi kuba yenda barabaishe babaziza ko ari abatutsi ; ko wenda se bakotizaga mu nkotanyi ; cyangwa se iki ... ko bari bakuru wenda bavuga bati @: "@ mwazize icyo mwumva mwari muzi . @" ||| it 's maybe understandable that my parents were killed because they were tutsis and they were even maybe contributing in helping out the inkotanyis , they were adults and responsible for the actions but my sisters were just kids !
ariko nk' abana bato bariraga , ||| but what about young children were just screaming ?
nraibuka nka cadette umuhorerezi wo mu rugo , ||| i can still recall the way the last @-@ born was crying .
kuko baramufashe bamuteruye aravuga ngo @: bamushyiriye mama we . kuko yajyaaga avuga ngo @: "@ mama yagiye muri reunion [ inama ] , ||| they carried her and told her that my mother had gone for a meeting and that that was where they were taking .
iyo mama yavaaga mu nama [ kera iyo abarimu bajyaaga kuhembaw bavugaaga ko bagiye mu nama ] bajyaaga ba ... yabazaniraaga ama biscuits , akabazani ... mbega icyo baumvaaga bashaka cyose akaza akizanye , noneho bakamubwira ko ariho yagiye . ||| my mother used to go for meetings and she would bring for them biscuits or anything else they wanted and so they told her that that 's where my mom had gone .
bishaka kaumvaish ko abana ... nbabazaw n' ukuntu abana bapfuye muri jenoside . nta kintu bazi , ||| what i am saying is that what hurts the most is the way children were murdered in the genocide .
batazi inkotanyi ngo n' iki ? kuko bazize ngo ni inkotanyi , batazi ngo inyenzi n' iki ... ? batazi niba ari n' abahutu cyangwa se ngo niba ari abatutusi ... , ||| they did n't even know the meaning of "@ inkotanyi @" and they acussed them of being "@ inkotanyi . @" they did n't know what the word "@ inyenzi @" meant . they did n't know whether they were hutu or tutsi .
ku buryo binanira kubiumva . ||| sometimes i do n't understand it !
nicyo kintu nbona ko abantu bari abagome bikabije , ||| those people must have been extremely cruel to do such a thing !
kaumva wica umwana atazi n' icyo azira . nta shyaka ... nta kintu azi . ||| killing an innocent child , who does not belong to any political party , who knows nothing !
nicyo cyonyine ... ikintu kingarukamo , ||| that is the only thing ... that comes back to me .
sinegeze nrizaw n' ibya jenoside ariko kenshi iyo image ... iryo shusho ry' abana bo mu rugo uko bapfuye , iyo nbiumvise kenshi numva ... numva binbabaje cyane . ||| i was never cry when memories of the genocide come back to me ... the image of the death of our kids .. whenever i recall it , i feel so much pain .
rosette , kuri wowe kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu rya jenoside , wunva bivuze iki ? ||| rosette , what does it mean for you , being a survivor ?
ku bwanjye , nko kuvuga ngo ndi umu rescape ... nrasigaye , numva binshimaishije kuko numva ko imaan yaturinze , ||| personally , knowing that i am a survivor ... the fact that i survived makes me feel good because i realize that god helped us .
nkaiishima cyane kuko benshi barapfuye nkaumva ko ifite icyo yadushigarije . ||| it pleases me so much because so many people died . i strongly believe there a reason why god saved us .
ariko kuri njyae kuba uri uwarokotse , ni uko numva ko nfite nvuga ‘ objectif ’ [ intego ] yo kuba muri place y' abantu ... yo kuba mu mwanya w' abantu bose bapfuye . ||| to me , being a survivor ... is to have the responsibility to stand in the position of the people who died .
ni ukuvuga ngo @: ||| what do i mean ?
nkaba mama , nkaba papa , nkaba abavandimwe , ||| i have to be my mum , my dad , my sisters and try to be complete .
nkaumva nrauzuye . nkagerageza kuba mu myanya yabo , ||| i have to try and be in their position .
ni ukuvuga ngo kukora ibyo ngomba kukora niba ari ukuiga ni ukuiga . niba aribyo kukora n' ibyo kukora , ||| i mean , i have to do what i am meant to do , go to school and study and finish my studies , i have to work .
kubaan n' abantu , ariko nkaumva ko , nta uvuga ngo @: "@ kanaka yasize ubusa yasize abana b' ibirara se , ||| if it is to be a sociable person ... i would n't want to hear people saying that my parents left no one behind , or that we are irresponsible .
yasize abantu batazagira icyo bifasha ... @" ku buryo wenda n' ababaishe babonaaga ko bamaze umuryango , ariko aramutse akubonye , ||| i would n't give a chance to those who thought that they exterminated my family to find us in a shameful position .
nibaza ko akubonye uri umuntu ... ntabwo nvuga kuihagararaho yenda ntinzi nka terme [ imvugo ] nziza ... ariko nvuga ngo akubonye uri umuntu w' umugabo . ||| i can n't find the right way to express it .
uhagaze mu mwanya w' ababyeyi n' uw' abavandimwe , ||| standing in the position of both your parents and your siblings who died , being a man is a big responsability .
ukabihagararamo kigabo , numva nta ... numva ko ari ikintu kikomeye cyane . numva ko ari inshingano ya buri wese . ||| and , i think it is everybody 's resposibility .
kuba mu mwanya w' abadahari . ni ukuvuga ngo kukora ibyo bakagombye kukora uri umwe ukagerageza . ukabikora . ||| to stand in the position of those who are gone . meaning that you do what they were supposed to do . although you are only one person , you try and do their work as well as yours .
hanyuma nagirango utubwirae nyuma ya jenoside . ||| and after the genocide , how did you survive ?
ese ugiye he ? ||| who looked after you ... where did you go ... ?
ese ubayeho utae ? ||| what did you do ?
nyuma ... nyuma ya jenoside , tugerageje kushakisha umuryango , abenshi tubanaaga barapfuye . ||| we tried looking for a family after the genocide ; many of the people we were living with had died .
abo muri famille yo kwa mama , abo mu muryango wo kwa maman urashize , umuryango wo kwa mama w' abantu bari bageze nko kuri mirongo itandatu n' abandi hasigayemo abantu batarenze batanu . ||| my mother 's family was completely decimated . only 5 out of more than 60 people survived !
umuryango wo kwa papa niwo nvuga ngo ugerageza , ariko nabo abari bari mu rwanda bose barapfuye urebye . ||| in my father 's family seemed to be more ... but all those who were in rwanda during the genocide had been killed , nobody was left .
nsigaraanye n' umutante [ masenge ] umwe , tusigaraan abantu bakeya b' aba cousins [ babyara bacu ] , abana , kuko ba data wacu barapfuye . ||| only one aunt survived and very few cousins who are very young , our uncles also died .
abenshi bashyinguye gisozi , ||| most of them were exhumed and reburied at gisozi .
abandi ... mbese urebye mu by' ukuri umuryango urashize . ||| others ... almost the whole family was decimated .
ubwo rero uko tubanye ... uko ababyeyi bacu babanye , nibyo urebye bitumye tubaho mu minsi batari bariho . ||| the way we used to live with other people ... how our parents behaved around others is what helped us to live in their absence .
kuko umuntu wese utubonaaga yaravugaaga ati @: "@ dore abana bo kwa kanaka , bashoboye kurokoka . @" ||| everybody who would see us , would say , "@ these are the children of so and so , they survived . @"
abantu batubanaiye neza bakatufasha mu kuiga , bakatufasha ... kuko ntituri tufite aho tuba , ||| and people were good to us , they helped us in completing our school education .
tuigeze kugira ikibazo kinini cyane cyo kugira aho tuba . ||| we did n't have anywhere to live , it once happened that we did not have where to live .
ariko tubayeho bitari byiza ariko turagerageza , ||| we led a horrible life but we tried our best .
kubera ko ababyeyi bacu bashoboye kubaan tubana nabo . ||| our parents lived well with others , we also had to do so .
hari umuryango uri urasigaye i burunri baraje turabana . ||| there is a certain family , that had remained in burundi ; when they came we lived with them .
ariko ubungubu tubana n' umukecuru uri uratufashe ‘ en charge ’ [ utuishingaiye ] ubanye na mama , ||| presently we are living with a certain lady who adopted us .
tubanye kuva kera , abana na papa ; ||| she had once lived with both my parents and we had known her for a long time .
ariko ubungubu by' ibyago nyine muri iyi minsi yarapfuye , ||| unforfunately , she recently passed away .
ubu turi mu rugo tubana n' umuryango yasize . ||| now we are living with the family she left .
ni bangahe babashije kurokoka mubo muva inda imwe ? ||| how many of your simblings survived ? who survived among your brothers and sisters ?
mu ... mubo tuvukana , tuvukanaaga turi batandatu , harokotse babiri . ni njyewe na musaza wanjye mukuru . ||| in my immediate family , we were six and only two survived ; my older brother and i.
utekereza kutae ejo hazaza ? ubona ejo hazaza hazaba hameze kutae ? ||| what do you think about the future ... what kind of future do you see ?
njyewe uko nbona igihe kizaza , ntekereza ko ari kiza . ubundi kuri njyae nbona ko ari kiza , ||| the way i think about the future ... i think it will be good .
nbona kiruta icyashize . ni ukuvuga ngo nyuma ya jenoside . ||| in my opinion , the future is promising ; the future will be better than the past [ i mean after the genocide ] .
kuko mbere ya jenoside ho biri ibindi . tubonaaga ari amata n' ubuki . ||| because before the genocide things were the other way round ; everything in life was like milk and honey .
ariko ubu nyuma ya jenoside kugera ubu , nbona ko umuntu ashobora kugira ikintu cyo kuizera , cyane cyane burya ubuzima bw' abaturage budepa ... bushingaiye kuri leta . ||| but after the genocide until today , one can believe ... in most cases , the citizens still depend on the government .
kuko nbona uko ubuyobozi bw' ubu bumeze , bushaka kurair butavangura , bushaka kuhuza abantu , ||| when i consider today 's leadership , i can say that their aim is to bring people together and stop divisions . they want to unite people .
nbona mu by' ukuri igihe kiri inberae kishobora kuzaba kiza ku bantu benshi . ||| therefore , the future will be good to many people .
ariko ntinnirengagizae ko hari n' abantu kizabera kibi ... bibi cyane kuko hari abasigaraanye indwara . hari abana batashoboye kujya ku ishuri yenda bari kuzabishobora . ||| but i would n't want to ignore that some people will still find the future so disappointing ... because they were left with diseases , there are some children who never went to school yet they were able to study .
igihe kizaza kuri jyae ntekereza ko kizaba kiza kurusha ikishize ni ukuvuga ngo nyuma ya jenoside kubera ko akenshi , ||| but to me , the future will be better than the past [ i mean straight after the genocide ] .
umuntu yari atarabona umurongo agendairmo . ||| because one had not yet defined the right path to go through .
nkanjyae kuri njyae ngize amahirwe nraiga , ||| personally i was lucky .
nrarangiza amashuri yisumbuye , nrangije na universite [ kaminuza ] . ||| i am educated ; i completed my secondary school and i have now completed university .
ku buryo nbona ko ... yego ubuzima ntibushingair ku mashuri kusa , ariko ntekereza ko yenda ibyinshi ... ibyo ntekerezaaga ibyo ntekerezaaga ko ntazageraho , nshoboye kugeraho numva ko biba aribyo . ||| and now i see that ... well , of course life is not totally based on education but i guess there is much i thought i would never be able to achieve that i have achieved , which i am glad i did .
ibindi bisigaye numva ko biba ari gahunda y' imaan , ariko nnjyae ku bwanjye numva ko nzabiitwaramo neza . ariko nkavuga nti @: ||| i guess the rest will go according to god 's plan and personally .
n' ubuzima bw' abaturage bushingair cyane cyane ku miyoborere y' abantu . ||| i will emphasize on the fact that in many ways , people 's lives are dependent on the leadership .
kuko abantu bapfuye bazize leta . ||| people died due to a bad government .
iyo leta ibiitwaramo neza , abantu ntibaba barapfuye . ||| if the government had done the right thing , people would n't have died .
nbona gahunda leta ifite ubungubu , iha ikaizerae abantu benshi cyo kubaho . ku buryo numva ko igihe kizaza mu by' ukuri kizaba kiza . ||| thanks to the plan that today 's government 's has , many people have the hope of living and this reassures me that the future will be good .
ariko ntiirengagije ko hari n' abandi bantu banri bazagira ubuzima bubi , ntinvuga ngo ibintu byose n' amata n' ubuki ku bantu bose . ||| i am not forgetting that some people will have a bad life in the future . i am not saying that things will be like milk and honey [ a good life ] for all people .
nibaza nk' abantu basigaiyew sida na jenoside baaka ... abana bari bakiri bato , bafite imyaka itatu ... ibiri bataigeze babona urukundo rw' ababyeyi , ||| i always think about people who were infected with hiv @/@ aids during the genocide ... very young kids who were two or three years old then who never experienced parental care .
bakareraw nabi mu nzu z' imfubyi . bakaba munsi y' imihanda , bakareraw n' umuhisi n' umugenzi , bakava mu rugo bajya mu rundi , ||| today they are not well cattered for in orphanages . others live on the streets , they are cattered for by passers @-@ by . they move from house to house .
nibaza ko nabyo bizagira ikintu cy' ingaruka itoroshye ku buzima bwabo bw' inyuma . ||| i think that may have some negative impact on their future lives .
yenda njyae ngize amahirwe yo kubona ababyeyi barantegura , ||| i guess i was lucky because i got a chance of having parents and they prepared me .
ku buryo wenda numva ko basae [ urufatiro ] nyifite . mbese numva ko ibyo aribyo byose nta kibazo nzagira cyane . mu by' ukuri . ||| and now i guess i have a foundation . i tend to think that i will never have to face plenty of problems [ as i did in the past ] to be sincere .
rosette , wowe ubona bishoboka kubabarira abantu bakoze buriya bwicanyi ? ||| rosette , is it possible to forgive the people who committed these crimes ?
ntibishoboka ko umuntu yakuibagirwa abe . ||| it is not possible for one to forget his or her people .
ibyo byo ni ibidashoboka . ||| that 's impossible .
ngirango n' abahanga bavuga ko kuibagirwa ari indwara . ||| even wise men say that forgetting is a form of sickness .
noneho kuibagirwa rero ibyakubayeho ... nk' ubu ntinkuibagirwa ko nta babyeyi nfite . ||| forgetting what happened in one 's life ... for example there is no way i can forget that i had no parents .
ntinvuga ngo nvutse ku giti mu by' ukuri . ||| sincerely i can not believe that i was born from a tree !
ntinkuibagirwa ko nri nfite abavandimwe , ||| i can never forget that i once had sisters just because i do n't see them anymore !
kuko simbabona . kenshi njya nbona nk' abo banganaaga , nkabona barangije secondaire , biganaaga mu mashuri amwe , ||| i often see children of their age who used to go to school with them and who are now finishing secondary school .
ni byinshi bikuibutsa . ||| there 's a lot that reminds me of them !
ariko kuibagirwa byo ntibishoboka . ntibishoboka . ||| it is simply impossible to forget .
ntabwo tushobora kuibagirwa . ||| we can never forget !
ese ku bwawe utekereza ko habayeho ubutabera ku babyeyi n' abavandimwe bawe ? ||| do you think that you have had justice for your parents and your sisters ?
ku bwawe ubona ubutabera burakoze akazi kabwo ku buryo bukwiriye ? ||| has justice been done to your parents ?
nvuga ngo ubutabera ... ubutabera bwo ni ngombaw . ||| i would say that justice ... justice is needed .
ariko ku bantu bapfuye bazize jenoside , bazize akarengaane . ||| the victims of the genocide were innocent .
nk' ababyeyi banjye ; inshuti ; abavandimwe . numva koko ubutabera bukwiriye kubaho . ||| my parents , my friends and relatives ... i really believe that justice needs to take action .
kusa wunva utabona uko ubivuga . umh ... nta kishobora kubakarura , icyo ntikishoboka . ||| it is hard to find the right words to say it ... umh nothing can bring them back , that is impossible .
abantu baishe abantu ... yenda tuvugae ko hari abantu baishe abandi mu mateka y' isi , ariko yenda badahuje batafite icyo bahuraiyeho . ||| some people killed others ... let 's say there are several people who killed others in the history of the world , but they were killing people with whom they did n't have anything in common .
ariko nk' abanyarwanda bicanye ari abavandimwe mu by' ukuri . ||| but rwandans killed each others while in reality , they were brothers and sisters !
kaumva ko ubona icyo uhanaish umuntu ho wunva ko kitahari . urupfu ubwarwo wunva atari igihano . ||| therefore , you can never find the appropriate punishment to exercise on them . death is not a punishment .
kufungwa ubwabwo wunva atari igihano . mu by' ukuri , jyae numva abantu bakwaiye kuigishwa . ubutabera bukabaho , ||| neither is imprisonment . i guess people should be sensitized and there should be justice .
igihano baumva batanga mu mategeko kikabaho , kugirango abantu babonae ko uburenganzira bw' umuntu wese bugomba kubahairizaw . ari umwana , ari umukecuru , ||| and the law should determine the kind of punishments to be given so that people will learn that human rights should be respected .
ari umusaza , ari umuhutu , ari umututsi , ari umunyamahanga , ||| be it a child or an old woman or an old man , be it a hutu or a tutsi , be it a foreigner or any other person , as long as blood is shed , nobody should be killed when they are innocent !
ari umuntu awo ariwe wese , ko ava amaraso , ko ntawe ukwiriye kupfa azize ubusa . ubutabera bwo bugomba kubaho . ||| and justice needs to be there .
atari no mu rwanda , njyae numva nbusabair n' isi yose . ||| not only in rwanda , i would request for justice in the whole world .
ko bukwiriye kubaho , ||| because justice is needed .
abantu ntibapfae bazira ubusa . ||| people should n't die innocently .
ndagirango nkubaze ikibazo kinyuma , ||| my very last question .
ubona bishoboka ko jenoside yakaongera ikabaho mu rwanda ? ||| do you think that genocide is possible here again ?
nfite ikaizerae ko jenoside itazaongera kubaho mu rwanda . ||| i hope genocide will never happen again in rwanda .
nbona ko ingengabitekerezo [ ideologie ] y' u rwanda rufite , nkabona n' isomo abantu bakuye mu kuica abandi , mu by' ukuri abantu ... nta ... bitakaongera kubaho . ||| i guess the ideology that rwanda has now , together with the lessons people learnt from killing one another , really people ... i do n't think it will ever happen again .
ntawe numva ko tubibayemo , tugize ibyago byo kubibamo , ||| i believe we experienced it , we unfortunately experienced it .
nibaza ko tufite inshingano zikomeye zo kuigisha abantu kaubaha abandi . ||| i think we have a task of teaching people how to respect each other .
uburenganzira bw' abandi . ni ukuvuga ngo uburenganzira bwa buri muntu wese nibushobora kubahairizaw , nta jenoside izaongera kubaho mu by' ukuri . ||| i mean , if everyone respects human rights , then there would be no genocide again .
kandi n' ubu nizeye ko itazasubira . ||| and even now i believe there will be no genocide again .
reka noneho nkubaze akabazo gato kanyuma na nyuma , ||| i said that was my last question but i have one more question .
nyuma y' ibyo byose uri umuntu ki ? ||| what kind of person are you after this ?
ese uri umuntu wizera ejo hazaza heza ; uhora se unezerewe ... rosette ni inde ? ||| are you hopeful , are you optimistic ... are you sad and unhapppy ? who is rosette ?
[ araseka ] kuri ubu ngirango ni nako nhoze ahari , yenda abanzi . njyewe ndi umuntu uhora nishimye . imaan yampaye ibyishimo , ||| [ she smiles . ] today i am a very happy person , that 's who i have always been for those who know me .
numva ko nta kibazo mu by' ukuri muri njyae , numva ko nisanzuye [ je suis libre ] ndi umuntu uri libre . ||| i am free ; i am a very free person .
numva ko ntateye ikibazo muri societe . numva ntakagombye kuba ... numva ntari ikibazo cya societe y' u rwanda [ umuyango nyarwanda ] mu by' ukuri cyangwa se abo tubana . ||| i do not constitute a burden to the rwandan society or to the people around me . i strongly believe that i will live long .
numva nfite ikaizerae cyo kubaho , numva nshaka kuza ... numva nshaka kuzabaho kurusha ukunguku . ||| i wish i ... i wish i would live a better life than this .
ni ukuvuga ngo nbivuze kare ko nshaka kuba mu mwanya w' ababyeyi , inshuti , abavandimwe bose numva bazize jenoside . ||| i guess i mentionned it earlier that i would like to stand in the position of my parents , my friends and my sisters ; all those who died in the genocide .
numva nshaka kubahagararira . kubahagarira rero bisaba kuba uri undi muntu wunri . ugera kubyo nifuza , ||| i wish i would represent them .
nraumva ntinzi uko nbivuga [ aramwenyura ] . ||| to represent them requires to be a different person , that 's my goal ... how can i say this ... [ she smiles ]

hakaba hari ntuza hari ingunguru bari bari bafite iyo ngunguru barangije bayitereka aho ngaho interahamwe zijya kuvoma amazi mu gifunzo , ||| they took the metal tank they had with them and went to fetch water in the swamp .
bari bafite ingunguru babohoje ahantu na ntuza na muvero , n' amasafuriya n' ibiki ibintu byinshi cyane , ||| they had a metal tank , a water tank and casseroles that they stole in several places .
barabifata bafata ya ngunguru bavomairmo amazi bavomairmo ya mazi bamaze kuvomairmo amazi bashyira ku ziko baracana bajya kushaka inkwi baracana , ||| after fetching water , they searched for fire woods to cook with .

imihini bari bafite bahondaishaga abantu bakajya batsindagira basubiza mu ntuza bamusubiza mu ngunguru ngo umutwe utareremba kubera ko yari muremure ntago yabashaaga kukwiraw mu ngunguru bari bamuhinanze . ||| they took shaped woods and started to press his head saying his head is getting out but the truth was that he was tall and could not fit in it .
baracanair nyuma y' isaha ubwo nnjyae ntegereje ukuntu bagiye kunyica , nicaye aho ngaho baranbwira ngo ubonye urupfu tumwishe ? ||| they heated the water , after an hour i was scared thinking the way they are going to kill . i sat there and they said to me @: ‘ you have seen how we killed him ’ .
ngo turi tugiye no kumubaga ngo ariko tubonye ngo inyama zashizemo ubumuntu , ngo nta kintu tuba turiyemo , ||| they even said we were about to cut him in pieces but his body is of useless state , nothing we can eat from it .
baramufashe bamusuka hasi bamaze kumusuka hasi nyine yahindutse umweru bari banamwambuye ubusa hose n' ibiki byose babimwambuye noneho barangije bansiga aho ngaho barazamuka baranbwira ngo wowe ngo wowe ngo pun go n' ubundi ngo uragwa aho ngaho ngo twebwe ngo nta ntegae twifitiye ngo intege tuzimaraiye muri uyu musaza wawe barazamuka bansiga aho ngaho . ||| they took him out of the tank and he was completely naked that his body started to become white . they left me there and said to me @: ‘ you ..... you are going to die right there , we do n't even have the strength to kill you , and we finished all of it in your brother ’ .
nragiye nicaramooo hashize nk' iminsi nk' ingahe nibwo inkotanyi zaje zimaze kuza baraza bakuramo abantu ariko nanga kusohoka ngirango n' interahamwe zagize , n' interahamwe ziri kubeshya ngo na nanone amahoro yabonetse , ||| i spent three days feeling crazy and even all others we fled together none of them passed there .
ubwo hashira indi minsi nk' ibiri nenda kupfairmo n' ibizi biri birimo bya bya nyine biranukaaga n' ibiki , ubwo ngubwo nyuma nibwo baje kuhagarara hafi y' urufunzo baravuga ngo ee ngo amahoro ngo yaje ngo n' inkotanyi ngo nimuzae tubasangae noneho abo turi turi kumwe baravuga ngo nimuzae tusohokae ngo usanga ari inkotanyi zaje , ubwo baranfashe nabob a mama icyo kubera ko nta nbaraga nri nfite narasukumaga , n' ibisebe nri nfite mu mutawe biri biranze kukira ahubwo hazamo inyo nshakisha ibyatsi nkahonda nkashyiraho , ||| i stayed there , on the third day i regained my sense i woke up and found my brother still beside me but the smell was so awful and his body has grown bigger .
bikanga kukira , ubwo baranfashe bangi ubwo abongabo baravuga ngo wowe uzatupfairho reka tukujyanae kwa muganga ubwo abasirikare baranfashe barampeka , nabo badame turi turi kumwe nta muntu n' umumwe nri nzimo , ubwo banjyana kwa muganga hariya inyamata , ||| i had a dress that i used to tie up my stomach so that i do n't feel hungry , the same dress he used while taking me on his back so i took it and covered him .

bamvu bahise banjyaan ahariya muri olphelina baranvura . ||| they fled to ntarama , nor to nyabarongo .
ntahaba mu kihae kigeze nko mu mezi abiri , ||| i stayed in there after some days the inkotanyi came wanting to rescue me , but i refused to go with them thinking they were interahamwe , who are trying to fool me that it is safe .
ubwo croix iza kutuvanamo hariya rero muri olphelina yo kwa mingeti , ||| after two days i felt like i am almost to die , even the water in the swamp was stinking .
banjyana muri olphelina y' igisenyi , ||| a while later , the inkotanyi stood at the edge of the swamp and said to us @: ‘ it is safe , get out and come to us ’ .
nyibamoooooo , ||| the people we were with said okay lets get out it may be the inkotanyi who came .
baranvura ntakira ariko icyenda na gatandatu nza kaongera kurwara kubera nyine izo nkovu zari zangarutse , nkarwara umutweeeeee nkarwara umutwe cyane , noneho nza kugera m ukihae cyo kujya nva amaraso , nva amaraso cyane nkajya nva amaraso aturuka hano mu matwi no mu mazuru hose , ||| they helped me because i was not able to move and the wounds in my head were not yet healed .

njyewe ndi umwana wawe uranreze nk' umwana wawe ntago bishoboka ! ||| so i stayed at home with the children and their father .
aravuga ngo rero ugomba kuba umugore wanjye ! nti ntago bishoboka , arangije ubwo aranbwira ngo nta kibazo ngo niba bitashoboka ngo nta kibazo ngo ubwo ngubwo ubiihorerae . ngo tuzagenda ngo hanze ngo wikomereze ubuzima bwawe nti sawa . ||| one month later , the father decided to send the children outside the country and we , i and the father , will follow them later because it was not easy to get air tickets for all of us .
ubwo ntiyahwemye yakomeje kuhinduka akajya avuga nabi n' iki , ||| he sent them in belgium to meet their mother because that is the place where she the mother was hospitalized .
hacaho iminsi mike cyane murugo turi tufite umukozi w' umuhungu n' umukobwa , ||| i stayed with the father of the children .

nuko nri nfite irungu ndi hano jyenyine ntago azagaruka . ||| i was used to not sleep alone at home ; i always called a neighboring friend to sleep with me . he did not know that i sleep together with somebody else .

aho turi tutuye twebwe ni hafi ya kie hafi yo kwa ruhama , ||| from there i accepted whatever he asked me to do , i took off all my clothes and he raped me .
ubwo ngubwo nsubira murugo ngiye kureba ko wenda yaba yaba raiho ari njyanye na wa mudame ngezeyo nsanga yapakuruye ibintu byo mu rugo byose yaraimutse nsanga yaragiye . ||| when he finished raping me , he went back to his room to sleep and i remained in my room . he locked my room and he opened it while he was going for a shower in the morning , after he went to work . i woke up in a desperate mood feeling like a fool . i was asking myself what if he is hiv positive and that he just contaminated me , what if ....... i do n't know .
ubwo ngubwo nshakishije uburyo nmenya amakuru ashoboka kugirango menye ahantu ari kubera n' ibintu byanjye byose yari yabijyanye akantu yabashije kunsigair yasigaiye umuntu w' umuturanyi kuko nrahingutse barabimpa n' utudocument twanjye kuko hari harimo diplome yanjye n' utuntu dukeya n' amakaye ibintu bigize kiri kifite agaciro kiri kirimo ni ntuza ni diplome yanjye yararimo , ||| i woke up right away and went to see a neighboring madam who was a friend of mine ; i told her the whole story . she said to me @: ‘ let 's go and report him . @" we went to remera police station because we lived nearby , closer to rwahama 's building .
ubwo ngubwo ngerageje kushakisha tubura amakuru ye nyuma tuza kaumva ko ibintu yose biri aho ngaho yabigurishije akahita ajyenda akahita yurira indegeakagenda , ||| we reported him and they sent him a letter asking him to come at the station . the madam asked me to not go back home , i stayed there the way i came . i came with nothing except the clothes i was wearing . when he came at the police station , he was directly sent to prison .
hashize nk' amezi abiri nbaye aho ngaho ndi kuri uwo mu mama nigunze meze nabi nyine meze nk' umuntu ugize troma nta buengae nfite , ||| i went to stay at the madam 's house . four days later , i passed at the police station and i found out he was released .
nza kurwara ntatangira ndarwaragurika noneho uwo mu mama aranbwira ati rero ati hari n' igihe yaba yaranakusigaiye n' inda , ||| when i realized that he was sent free , i asked why ? and they said to me @: ‘ he escaped . @" i went to the madam 's house ; she lived near the prison in a short distance .
ati ibyo utekereza ati wirirwa uvuga ngo yaba yarakwanduje ati wenda yaba yaranakusigaiye n' inda byose ati tujyae kwa muganga , aramperekeza tujya kwa muganga . ||| but us , we lived closer to kie near rwahama 's building . i and this madam went to check if he might be at his house and we found he packed everything and shifted to another place .
tugezeyo baranpima bamaze kunpima basanga yanteye inda , ||| when we reached there , they checked on me and found out i was pregnant .
ok nrikarumye nbaye aho ngaho nrikaruma umu mama abasha kunkaruma , ||| i tried to calm myself and this mother helped me to calm myself .
turabana aranbwira ati nzakufasha mu bishoboka , ati wihangane nta kunri ati niko bibaho , ati none se ko yagutorotse yagiye ati umukura he ? umenya se anari hehe ? ||| we stayed together and she said to me @: ‘ i will help you as i can , just be strong now that he left you and we can not find where he went . @"
ubwo ikintu nkoze nje kuandikair wa mu mama tubanaaga kubera ko tukiranga contact na na na nabo bana be noneho nza kumubaza amakuru yose , ||| i wrote to his wife because i usually used to contact the children and their mother and i asked her about everything .
mubwira ibyo umugabo we yankoreye nrabimubwira , aranbwira ati ihanganae ati kuki utamureze nti nramureze nti ariko yaranantorotse yaraje , ||| i told her everything his husband did to me and she told @: ‘ i am sorry , but you should have reported him at the police . @" i said to her @: ‘ i reported and later on he escaped . @"
kumbi ntago yari yaraigeze amu mbese ntago yigeze amusanga yagiye mu gihugu ke , ||| i realized that the man did not go in the same country of his wife , but he went in different one . the wife was still in belgium .
noneho undi aguma mu gihugu cye yari ari mu bubiligi , ||| later his wife wrote to me and said that he was in australia and he has contacted her .
nyuma rero niwe uje kunbwira amakuru ye ko yagiye muri ostralie yamwandikiye akamubwira ko yagiye muri ostralie nba aho muri ubwo buzima nbana nuwo mu mama nrabyara uwo mu mama anyitaho mu bishoboka mubyo yari ashoboye aranfasha nrabyara , ||| i stayed in that life , i stayed with that mother and she helped me as she could till i gave birth .
finalement rero maze kubyara maze amezi abiri wa mu mama tubanaaga nawe yaje kugenda yari afite umugabo wiga makereri yari uganda aza kumutumaho rero aramusanga , ||| finally i gave birth . after two months , she left the country because she had a husband who was a student in makerere university in uganda . so she went to see her husband .
amaze kumusanga ubwo nsigaye aho jyenyine ngumana n' umwana aranbwira ati rero nta kunri nragiye kandi ntago bishoboka ko nkujyana nta hantu nkujyana ibugande ati kuko ubuzima bawho ntago nbishobora , ||| i was left alone with the child and she said to me @: ‘ there is nothing i can do , i have to go and i can not take you with me because i do n't know where to take you . @"
ati rero shakisha ubuzima bwawe uko ubishoboye , ||| she said to me again @: ‘ you can not handle the life out there , so try your best to live . @"
ikintu yabashije kunsigair ubwo yansigaiye matela yo kuryma ho nsigara aho ngaho ntangira ubuzima bushya bwanjye bwo kuibana , ||| the only thing she left me was a mat to rest on .
ntatangira ndateseka mpura n' ubuzima bugoye n' umwana nta muntu n' umwe nreba n' iki ubwo ntangira ubwo buzima nyine , ||| i stayed there ; i started to struggle with my child .
nkajya mu nzu jyenyine nkigunga , ||| i could stay in the house desperate ; i could spend the whole day and night without eating .
nkabwirairw nkaburara ejo nbona umugiraneza akampa icyo kurya ejo nkamubura , ||| the next day , if i meet a good person and he or she gives me food . perhaps the following day i do n't find someone .
nuko , umwana yarwara ngira amahirwe nkabona arakize , ||| my child could get ill , if it happens i get a job i take care of my child .
noneho nza kusubiraan indwara nri nfite nri nrarwaye icyenda na gatandatu umutwe nza kaongera kurwara umutwe , nkajya nva amaraso mu mazuru ariko uko nbirwaraaga mbere siko bigarutse ariko yaturutse mu mazuru nkajya nva cyane , ||| later i suffered the kind of headache i suffered in 1996 , i started bleeding in the nose but it was somehow different from before , though i was bleeding so much .
ubwo ntatangira nkajya nta ibiro buri munsi buri munsi buri munsiiii , ||| i started to lose weight every single day ; day and night i was losing weight .

nta kibazo nri nfite ubwo nkajya nta ibiro nta ibiro nta ibiro , ||| i went on with other tests in order to be aware of how i am doing physically , i found out i was alright .
nkata ibiro buri munsi ubwo ngubwo nkomeza gutyo nkomeza kwikaruma mu buzima bwanjye nta ibiro , ||| i continued to lose weight ; i lost weight every single day . i did not stop calming myself though i was like that .
nri nfite ibiro mirongo inani na bitanu ngumana ngirango ntaye ibiro mirongo itatu na bitatu , muri ubwo buzima bungoye nyine . ||| i had 85 kilograms before ; i lost almost 33 kilograms in that sorrowful life .
, ubu n' ubu buzima nbayemo ubungubu nubwo ngubwo n' ukwigunga ndi jyenyine , ||| up to now , i live alone and i feel lonely .
iyo bawije nkabona bucyeye nshimira imaan uko nbayeho n' inshuti n' abagiraneza , bakaangirira impuhwe nuko nbayeho , nubwo buzima buangae , ||| whenever a day passes , i thank god the way i live with friends and good people who understand me and my life .

nba munzu y' inkodeshaanyo nta cumbi ngira , nyine ubwo nbaho ngaho bakancumbikira nbona ayo kukodesha ibihumbi bitanu nkayatanga ibihumbi bingahe gutyo nkayatanga , ||| i stay in there and when i manage to get the rent which is five thousand rwandan francs i pay it .
hakaba n' igihe bashaka no kunsohora mu nzu ariko imaan ikancira inzira nbona umugiraneza nkabona yenda ampaye ibihumbi bibiri nka bibakinga mu maso nkabona burije buracyeye nubwo buzima nbayemo . ||| sometime they even want to throw me out of the house but god helps me , or i meet a good person and he @/ she gives me two thousand rwandan francs so i pay it that way coz that is the only money with me .
uuh ||| i finally finish my day and night like that .
none se icyo ukuisabair abantu , aba bafite ubushobozi wunva ari iki bakufasha ||| what would you ask for , the people who are able to help you .
aba bafite ubushobozi nu icyo banfasha ni mu mibereho n' icumbi , kuburyo na ngira nasu nhita njya mu ishuri nkajya kuiga . uuh ||| i would ask the people who are able to help me to live , house renting and send me back to school .
ese n' iyihe shusho n' ikihae kintu kishobora kutuma buri kihae genocide itazasibangana mu mateka yawe cg mu buzima bwawe ? ||| what is the image , or thing that will cause you not to forget genocide in your entire life or your memories ?
ikintu kitazatuma genocide itazasibangana mu mateka yanjye mu mutawe wanjye no mu mateka nba nrabonye muri genocide , ishusho ya musaza wanjye uko bamwishe , uburyo bamwishe , ||| the thing or image that will make me not forget genocide in my memories or my thoughts is the way my brother was killed , how he was killed .
nicyo kintu kitazatuma mwibagirwa , ||| this will cause me to always remember him .
nicyo kintu kinza buri munsi kinza mu maso , mu bitekerezo byanjye buri kihae buri kihae buri kihae , niwe mpora ntekereza buri munsi buri munsi mu bantu bapfuye bose haba muri mukuibuka , ||| that is the thing i always see in front of my eyes , in my daily thoughts .
haba mu kuibuka mu kwa kane , nicyo kintu niwe muntu wa mbere mpita nshyira inberae niwe muntu wa mbere mpita nibuka nburi munsi buri munsi ntago hashobora kucaho n' iminsi igera no muri ibiri ntamutekereje , ||| he is the one i think about every day , or during commemoration time in april .

mbese ishusho , ye ntago ijya imva mu maso , kubera uburyo uburyo bw' agashinyaguro bamwishe turi kumwe nrimo mureba , uuh ||| his image is always in front of my eyes because of how awful he was killed , i was there seeing him .
uyu munsi n' itariki ya 23 ukwezi kwa gatatu , umwaka w' ibihumbi bibiri na karindwi . ||| today is 23rd of march 2007 .
aha turi ni ku kacyiru turi kumwe na padiri muzungu bernardin aho tugiye kuganira nawe ku mateka . ||| we are at kacyiru together with father muzungu bernardini where we are going to have a conversation on history .
padiri bernardin muzungu mwaba mugira ngo mutangira mutuibwira . ||| father bernardini muzungu can you start by introducing yourself .
nk' uko umaze kubivuga nitwa bernardini muzungu nkaba ndi umu padiri w' umudominikani nba hano ku kacyiru . ||| like you already said , i am called bernardin muzungu and i am a dominican father i live here in kacyiru .
aho nvuka iwacu ni ku musozi wa buhoro muri nyaruguru , nvutse muri mirongo itatu na kabiri . ||| i was born back home on a hill called buhoro in nyaruguru , i was born in 1932 .
ubwo rero nrinze ngera hano mu ba padiri b' abadominikani nciye mu nzira ndende y' amashuli kuhera i kibaeho , mu mashuli abanza i kabgayi , mu badominikani bitumye njya mu bihugu byo hanze , ubufaransa , ubusuwisi , ubwongereza , canada . ||| i got here amongst the dominican fathers through the lengthy journey of schooling starting from kibeho , in the elementary school in kabgayi , being part of the dominicans made me go to countries abroad , france , sweden , england , canada .
eh utangiye neza icyo n' ikibazo cy' ingenzi kirimo igisubizo cy' ibanze mubyo nza kuvuga byose , amateka y' isi n' amateka y' u rwanda nk' uko nza kubivuga ahangaha nrabikura mu bintu nsomye ariko mu magambo makeya kuko kenshi na kenshi iyo batubajije usanga umuntu apfa kuvuga kusa . ||| you have begun well , that is a very important question having the first point to what i am going to say , the history of the world and that of rwanda like i will talk about here , is got from things i read but in brief because often when we are asked you find someone just merely speak
nragira ngo nbwirae abashobora kuzanyumva ko ibyo nvuga biva mu bigega bitatu mu mateka y' u rwanda . ||| i want to tell those who will be able to hear me that what i am talking about comes from three chapters of the history of rwanda .
ikigega cya mbere ari nacyo nza kuheraho , ||| i will start from the first chapter , and what happened before that .
n' ibyabaye mbere yayo mateka y' u rwanda tuzi , mu gifaransa ni mate ni archeologie n' ibisigarataka abahanga basanze kw' isi bakamenya amateka n' inberae y' igihe cy' uko abantu bari bazi kuandika ngira ngo muesae mwarabyumvise . ||| the history of rwanda we know , in french it is math , archaeology and fossils that scholars found on earth that told them the history before man could write , i think that you all heard about it .
umuntu wa mbere uvutse kw' isi bibiriya imwita adamu ndetse na eva , bavuga ko bari muri afrika ndetse afrika ya hafi ahangaha iwacu , aho nraza kuhahera . ||| the first human on earth in the bible is called adam and also eva , they say that they were in africa , which is very close to here , our home , i will start from here .
ibyo rero ni n' ibintu tusanga muri ibyo bisa bisigarataka . ||| these therefore are the things we find in those fossils .
ikindi kigega tusangamo amateka cyane twebwe abanyarwanda n' ayo abakurambere batubwiye , tuesae ngirango turabizi tusanga imigani n' ibindi byinshi , n' amazina y' imisozi ariko cyane amasoko tusangamo iyo migani cyangwa se inzira tukuramo ibyo bitekerezo by' abanyarwanda n' amateka y' abanyarwanda by' ihame kandi byanditswe bifashe biri ubutatu . ||| and the other chapter in which we find history especially us rwandans is the one which our forefathers told us , i think we all know that we find stories and many other things , names of hills but usually the source of these stories or way through which we get these ideas of rwandans and their true history which is with evidence are three
icya mbere n' ibisigo ngira ngo muesae mwumvise ibisigo uko biriho bibayeho bitangiraanye n' umwamikazi nyirarumaga mu kinyejana cya 16 . ||| the first are poems , i think you have all heard that poems exist and that they existed starting with queen nyirarumaga in the 16th century .
hakabaho icya kabiri ubwiru , ubwiru nabyo n' ibintu bitangiye kera bitangiye ndetse na na kihanga . ||| then there is the second one , royal secrets , royal secrets also are things which started long ago with gihanga .
n' umwiru w' abasinga ba kera witwaga rubunga akaba nyina umwiru w' abasinga akaba ariwe uzanye ubwiru mu banyiginya akawubwira kihanga , ndetse bikamuvairmo kugira uwo muhango wo kuzagumya kubiigisha abiru bo ku ngoma y' abanyiginya . ||| the royal secret keeper of the ancient basinga clan who was called rubunga who was the one who brought royal secrets to the banyiginya clan and told them to gihanga , which resulted in that ritual of continuing to teach the royal secret keepers during the reign of the banyiginya clan .
uti mbere y' abami muri icyi gihugu ahangaha habaaga iki ? ||| what existed before kingdoms in this country ?
nsubiye muri abo bantu babanyabwenge babikesha kureba ibyasigaye mu butaka , iki gihugu cyacu , aka karerae kacu n' iyi afrika yacu kubera ko ariho abo bose bahamya nta kushidikanya k' umuntu wa mbere ariho yabonetse . ||| coming back to the scholars who base their research on fossil findings say our country , our region and africa is where they all claim without doubt that the first human being was discovered here .
bitumye bahashakisha kubera ibisigazwa bigaragaza abantu ba mbere uko bari bameze . ||| this made them explore this place because of the fossils which revealed how the first human beings were .
bije kugera igihe ndetse haza n' abanyabwenge baza no mu rwanda no mu burunri . ||| there reached a time when explorers came to rwanda and burundi .
kandi murabiumva kenshi aba kera ndetse n' umwami hari ikintu cyo kuhiga . hakaba rero nyine urebye ndetse aho ishyamba regabanukiye haje inka , ||| and you often hear that ancient human beings including the king used to hunt . there was also if you analyse the period when the forest reduced is when cattle came , like they say , when cattle graze .
niko bavuga inka zikarisha ishyamba rikarivunja riza maze kuhatazura . ||| the thick forest is destroyed and then demolished .
rero isuka irakurikira , iyo ubigenzuye rero nraza kaongera nbivugae eh niho bahereye babona bahimba ama amazina tumenyereye ubungubu ngo y' abahutu n' abatutsi n' abataw ukabona ko baise abataw n' abari bafite umwuga wo kuhiga . ||| then the hoe followed , if you observe , i will come back to it , is when they begun to come up with names we are used to now like hutu , tutsi and twa you see that those they called the twa were hunters .
abari bafite umwuga wo ku korora no kuragira inka baki babaise abatutsi , ||| those who bred and herded cattle were called the tutsi , those who were cultivators were called the hutu but you realize they were one people .
abari bafite umwuga wo kuhinga babaiga babaita abahutu ariko uraumva bari abaturage bamwe batandukanyaijew n' imyuga turaza kureba ukuntu ikosa rije kuza nyuma byo kubiita ngo ni amoko . ||| we shall later come to see how the error of calling it tribes came to be .
ehh ngabo abantu tuzi n' ibyari bihari mbere y' iki kihae tuvuga cy' abami , mu magambo make ni nk' ibyo umuntu yavuga kandi ngira ngo biba bihagije kugira ngo tukomezae urugendo rw' ibibazo wenda muza kunbaza . ||| those are the people we know of and what existed before the time of kings , in brief that is what one can say and i think that is enough so that we continue our journey of the questions you are going to ask me
nhita nbaza ikibazo , muratubwiye muti abahigaaga babaise abataw abandi babaita abahutu abandi babaita abatutsi . ||| let me quickly ask a question , you have told us that those who were hunters were called the batwa while others were called the hutu and others were called the tutsi .
ese n' iki kitumye nk' urugero nvuga nk' abantu ba ba bari baoroye babi bataitaaga abatutsi hari ikintu cyagenderewe kugirango ubwoko bwororaga buitwae abatutsi . ||| what made them for example the people who bred became called the tutsi , what was considered so as to call the tribe that bred cattle the tutsi ?
ibyo bihita binajyana no kuba uwahigaga nawe yaba umutaw ? ||| as well as one who hunted to be a twa ?
ese ko hari ibintu tuzi banavuga bati nabyo bishobora kuba wenda bitazwi neza cyangwa biraturutse ku mateka abantu batazi neza bavuga ngo ayo abo bantu utubwiye batatu ngo ntibagereye mu rwanda rimwe hari abavuga ngo abatutsi baje nyuma hari abavuga ngo abahutu bagezemo mbere . ||| there are things we know of which are also spoken of which may not be well known or came from the history which people do n't know well and say that those three groups of people you have told us about did not reach rwanda at the same time there are those who say that the tutsi came last and others who say that the hutu reached first .
ibyo nabyo mwaza kugira ikintu mubitubwiraho ariko muhereye kw' icyo kintu cyo kuita amazina , bigirairw bitewe n' iyihe mpamvu ? ||| is that right ? can you tell us something about that but starting with the question of naming , what was the reason behind it ?
ehh ii nraza kubigeraho turaza kubivuga hari umuntu witwa speek niwe uzanye iyo theorie y' amoko niwihangana rero turaza kubigeraho mu kanya kikora wenda ikibazo n' uko ara abahinzi ar' aborozi ari n' abahigi ukaba ubungubu babaita ngo n' amoko uu wihanganye rero nraza kubikaumvaish . ||| i will come to that , we shall talk about it . there is a man called speak who brought that theory of tribes , if you are patient we shall get to it in a little while , but rather the question is how the cultivators or the breeders or the hunters came to be called tribes , if you can be patient , i will explain it to you .
ubundi nvuze y' uko kusa ari abaturage bo ni archeologie ntawababonye . ||| i said that they were just natives , and it is archaeology because no one saw them .
ni archeologie tuvugae nk' urugero icyatumye babivuga mbese ibyo bavugaaga nk' ibi tu reba hano niba mugira hari tuvugae nk' aba abo bacukura basanze hari abacuzi . ||| it is archaeology giving an example as to why they say what they say like what we see here if we can maybe say like archaeologists who found blacksmiths .
hano muri iki gitabo harimo ibintu by' amafoto y' inyundo n' ubutare n' iki n' amabuye , ngirango niba bibonekaaga umuntu yabona hari inzitso hano n' utubindi . ||| here in this book , there are photos of hummers and small rocks , i think if it were visible one could see that there are small ropes here and pots .
iyo bavuze y' uko ehhee umuntu wa mbere avuka muri afrika ndetse afrika ya hafi ahangaha , kuzana igitekerezo cyo kuvuga ngo bavuye ahandi ibyo nu nu n' ukutumva ikibazo neza ; ntaho bavuye ndetse ahubwo bazava ino bajya n' ahandi n' abimukira bazaba bavuye iwacu . ||| when they say that the first human being was from africa , close to here , the assumption that they came from somewhere else is a misunderstanding , they did not come from anywhere , instead they came from here to other places and those who migrated were coming from here .
kuvuga rero ngo abahutu n' abatutsi n' abataw nubwo igitekerezo ki cy' ubwoko nraza kukisobanura mu kanya n' aho kiturutse , ubu tuvugae kusa aho bacukura basanze harimo amase bati bari batu baoroye inka , ||| to say therefore that the hutu , tutsi and twa are tribes , i will explain it to you in a while and where it came from , now let us only say that where archaeologists found cow dung were cattle keepers , the hoe was also discovered .
isuka na none iragaragara hari ibisuka babisangaaga mu bitaka kandi bakasanga atari amasuka y' ubu ari aya kera uhh kuhinga nabyo nyine , hari n' inka basanzemo hari na amandibiri y' inka basanze . ||| they were found in the ground and they found them not to be present day hoes but those of long ago , so there was also cultivation , there were cows , they also found jaws of cows .
uzarebae muri mu mu rugo rwa hariya rw' indangamurama , indangamurage i butare hari hari urwasaya rw' inka rw' icyo kihae bapimye . ||| try to look closely when you are in the national museum of butare , there is a jaw of a cow of that time which was measured .
uraumva rero n' ibintu n' ukuvuga ngo ngo ibyo bibazo rero by' amoko n' iki witonde nraza kubisubiza n' ibintu bije nyuma rwose , bije nyuma s' igihe cy' abantu batekereza ni ikinyejana cya karindwi mbere ya yezu kristu ni kera cyane , bari batarabwira nabo bavuga bavuga ko bari batuye muri ethiopia , niyo ethiopia icyo kihae yari itaragira abantu batembera . ||| you see then that things to do with the problem of tribes , which i will answer later if you can be patient , are things which honestly came later , they came later and not at the time which people think , it is in the 7th century bc , a long time ago , they too did not know yet , saying that they lived in ethiopia , which ethiopia at that time did not yet have people who travelled .
ikindi ahongaho nyine kuri abo bantu mutubwiye ko bahingaaga abandi bakorora abandi bakabumba , bahurairaga kuwuhae muco ? kugirango bamenye ko ari abaturage b' u rwanda ari abavandimwe icyo kihae . ||| in reference to those people you have told us who were cultivators while others were live stock keepers and others who were potters , what were their cultural similarities so as to know how the inhabitants of rwanda were related at that time .
ubwo uuragi u urabajije cyangwa uragira ngo ||| i beg your pardon ?
ku ngoma ya kihanga ubwo u rwanda ruri rumaze kubaho mwatubwira uko uvuga ku bierekeye imiterere y' umulyango nyarwanda . ||| during the reign of gihanga , the kingdom if rwanda had been established , what can you tell us about the way of life of the rwandan society ?
ehh buretse turaza kaongera icya kabiri turaza kukiongera nyuma . ||| we shall add the second one later .
reka tubanzae imiterere mu nyarwanda hanyuma ubutegetsi bwi bw' intuza . ||| let us start with the way of life in rwanda then the leadership of the settlement .
turi tumaze padiri yaramaze kutuganirair ku miterere yaha y' aka karerae tutuyemo mu kihae cya mbere y' amateka . ||| the father has just finished telling us about the way of life in this region we are living in , the time before history .
mu bisigo ariyo soko ya mbere rwose , mu bwiru abiru b' i ibwami , abiru b' ibwami cyane cyane bavugaaga uko imitegekere y' igihugu imeze , nraza kubisubiraho gatoya mu kanya nyine , hakabaho n' ubucurabwenge , ubucurabwenge n' uku n' ibisekuruza by' abami uko bagiye basimburaan n' uko abamikazi n' amoko yababyaraaga baitaaga ibaibanda nabo bagenda bakuraanw ku ngoma . ||| poems truly are the first source , in the royal secrets , the royal secret keepers especially speak of how the leadership of the country is , i will come back to it in a little while of course , there were also riddles and family lineages of the kings and how they succeeded each other like the queens and the tribes of rwanda which were called also went succeeding each other on the throne
bikitangira rero hatangira ku mu kanya tuvugaaga y' uko u rwanda aha tuhasanze kera mbere ya yezu hari abantu bahiga , baorora , bahinga . ||| it started therefore like we said a while ago that here in rwanda , they found a long time ago , before jesus , hunters , livestock keepers and cultivators .
biratinze rero baza kuigiraan baza kuba benshi baza kutegeka kushaka ukuntu babana , tuvugae umuntu abivuze neza yabanza kuhera ku mulyango ku mulyango w' abanyarwanda uko utangiye nza kungeraho ndetse ukuntu bije kubyara igihugu . ||| after some time they came together and became many , then they ruled so as to live together , if one is to explain it properly , one can start from how the society of rwanda started , i will also add on how it came to give birth to a kingdom .
ehh noneho bikunda . ||| that is ok .
uraumva rero umulyango uko tuwuzi ubundi n' umugabo n' umuhungu n' umukobwa bashakana bakabyara abana . ||| a family as we know it is a man or a boy and a girl who come together and give birth to children .
umu umulyango w' abanyarwanda igihe ukiri mutoya uba uko ari batatu umugabo n' umugore n' abana batarashaka witwa urugo ibyo murabizi . ||| while the rwandan family is still small , be it three people that is man , woman and children before they are married is called a home , that you know .
ingo iyo zimaze kuba nyinshi zikigera ku musekuruza basangiye babiitaaga inzu inzu , inzu iyo zamaraaga kuba nyinshi kandi iyo zamaraaga kuba zituwe umuntu yaragendaaga akatura hariya ku musozi . ||| after the homes have become many to the level of grandparents , they are called households after the households had become many and populated , one would go and live over there on the hill .
y' uko murabizi muesae ku musozi abana bakagenda bamutura impande , ||| you all know that the children , on the hill , would settle next to him as he went on taking over .
akagenda afata umusozi igihe yaba akishyira mu ntegae . ||| hills while he still had strength .
yaragendaaga akafata ukwe igikingi cye kianga ubukonde bwe . ||| and get his own portion of land .
igihe rero inzu zabaga nyinshi nazo bazaitaaga ubwoko ubwoko , bwa bwoko rero bukaba bufite igipande butuyeho ndetse butegeka bwicungaho ku butaka ku matungo kuki , biratinze rero babiita igihugu igihugu , n' uko igihugu kije . ||| when the houses become many , they were then called clans , those clans would have an area in which they lived and also ruled , protecting their land and property , later it came to be called a kingdom , that is how kingdoms came about .
biranatinda rero ibihugu bimaze kuba byinshi by' amoko , n' ibihugu by' amoko ngirango murabizi tujya tubiumva , tukabisanga rero cyane cyane muri aka gatabo ka padiri kagame niyo nagirango nbaerekae kaitwa inganji karinga , niho yatueretse aho abanyiginya batangiraiye kugira ingoma yabo kuri kihanga , niho muri aka gatabo batubwira ibihugu bibaga muri aka karerae kacu kaje kuitwa u rwanda nyuma . ||| later on after the kingdoms had become numerous with clans , i think you know about kingdoms made up of clans we hear about them , we find them especially in this book by father kagame , it is the one i wanted to show you called inganji karinga , it is where he showed us where the banyiginya clan begun their reign with gihanga , it is in this book that we are told the kingdoms which were in our region , which was later called rwanda .
ingoma zari zihari uhh nk' aho kihanga yatangiraiye , mubae mu bazigaba hari ubu ahitwaaga mu bubari ubungubu ni muri park national , hakaba ha hariya mu ndorwa , hakaba abashambo ingoma y' abashambo , uraumva ni ni n' igihugu cy' abashambo n' ingoma y' abashambo ; hakaba hariya za kibungo mu gisaka h' abagesair , ha mu nduga , hakaba ababanda aha tuicaye naho hakaba abandi ii ee n' ahandi henshi . ||| the kingdoms that existed around the time of gihanga , in the baziga clan which we now call bubari is in the nation park , also in ndowra was the reign of the bashambo , you realize that it is the kingdom of the bashambo it was over there in kibungo , gisaka , of the bagesera , here in nduga , there were the babanda and here where we are seated also were others and in many other places .
kihanga rero yatangiye ingoma yo kusa nk' aho yashyira hamwe utwo duhugu twose tw' ibihugu by' amoko , muby' ukuri nawe yatangiye afatanya n' abandi ariko uraumva batangiraiye ku ku rugo , ku nzu , ku bwoko , ||| gihanga begun his rule by trying to bring together all those small kingdoms made up of clans , he started by working together with others but you realize they begun from a home to household to clans , a clan does not mean what we term it as that is to say hutu and tutsi , tribe meant what is called clans , those were tribes .
ubwoko s' ukuvuga ibi bi tuihaye byo kuvuga ngo n' abahutu n' abatutsi , ubwoko n' ukuvuga abo baita les clans ibyo biri ubwoko ndetse nkaba bitumye nbaereka n' ikindi gitabo kivuga ibye neza . ||| this has led me to show you another book which talks about it clearly .
ng' uko uko biri bimeze . ubwoko rero nako umulyango ubaga ufite umutware , umubyeyi yagiraaga umutware , ||| that is how it was .
abo batwarae bose rero ba buri mulyango , umulyango n' ukuvuga inzu , ubwoko bama bakaba aribo bategekaw n' umukuru wabooo utegekaaa umulyango we wose akaitwa umwami , umwami n' ukuvuga uwa kuamamara kwama kera n' ikinyarwanda cya kera , ||| a family had a head , a parent those heads of every family , family in this case means household , in the clan they were ruled by their leader who headed the whole family and was called the king , the king is to say the popular one in ancient kinyarwanda , to be famous is like being popular .
kwama ni nko kwamama ni nko kuba ikiamamarae kuba ikirangirire . biratinze rero umwami w' abanyiginya witwaga mukobanya , kigeli mukobanya wa 1 . ||| later the king of the banyiginya who was called mukobanya , kigeli mukobanya the 1st .
yibuka ubwenge bwo kutongera gusangiza kusangira n' abana inberae baragendaaga bakigiraan bamwe bakaba tuvugae nka nk' abasinga cyangwa se nka tuvugae nka cyane cyane tuvugae nka ee nko mu gisaka , ||| he gained the wisdom of never again sharing with children , before they used to go together and they would be let 's say like the basinga or especially like in gisaka .
mu gisaka niho bitinze kutaba u rwanda rwose kuko bibaye u rwanda kuri rubukiri iii abagesair babazirankende iii . ||| in gisaka is where it took long to be part of rwanda because it became part of rwanda during the reign of rwabugiri the 3rd .
uwo mukobanya niwe wa utangiye ubwenge bwo kufata i gihugu akagiko akagikoroniza akashyiraho abategetsi be , akagenda noneho agira ibintu yegeranya n' utuntu twose nibyo bije kubyara u rwanda . ||| mukobanya is the one who started conquering countries and colonizing them by putting his own rulers , he went bringing things together , that is what gave birth to rwanda .
mbere hose turi uduhugu n' u rwanda rubaye u rwanda rwa rw' abanyiginya ariko rutari u rwanda rw' igihugu ki ki kifata ibindi , hakaba u rwanda ariko akabana n' abandi , akava inda imwe n' abandi , akaterana n' abandi . ||| before they were just small kingdoms , rwanda was only made up of the banyiginya but it was not a kingdom when it had just annexed others , rwanda existed but together with others relatives , and came together with others .
mukobanya niwe ukoranye ibya rusangizi nako ibyo kusangira n' abandi arabiiharira . ||| mukobanya is the one who worked together with others to get things for himself .
aho rero niho ijambo ryo kucika u rwanda ritangiraiye ashinga rero noneho n' u rwanda rwa gasabo ; ||| that is where the word to escape from rwanda originated from and he then established the rwanda of gasabo .
ubirebye rero uko nbifatanyaije umulyango n' igihugu shema tushyira hamwe ngo biri bimeze bite ? bitangiye ari umulyango , umulyango uvuye ku rugo bimaze kugenda bikuze biba igihugu cyose biba uduhugu twinshi , abanyiginya baraza ntaw duhugu twinshi baratuegeranya baratutsinda mu ntiambara batugira igihugu cya mugabo umwe . ||| when you see the way i put together a society and kingdom ... it begun as a society , society came from home and as it grew to become a large kingdom , it became many small kingdoms , the banyiginya came and brought together those small kingdoms after winning them in battle and made them a united kingdom .
mukobanya niwe uzanye iyo dini yo kuzana igihugu kimwe , ashyiraho ubutegetsi rero nyine , ubutegetsi ntinbisubiramo byose tu uretse umwami yariho akafatanya n' abo basangiye ubutegetsi ni bande ? hari abatware , ||| mukobana is the one who brought that ideology of one nation , he established a government of course , i can not go through the whole government except that there was a king who ruled together with those he shared with the leadership .
aba abatware b' ingabo bo rero bagacunga igihugu cyose . ||| there were the commanders of the army guarded the whole country .
ariko mubierekeye ubukungu bw' igihugu hakabaho abatware b' umukenke n' ukuvuga abategeka iby' ubutunzi babanri tuvuze , hakabaho n' abahinzi bo kutegeka abahinzi akaitwa umutware w' ubutaka . ||| but concerning the country 's wealth , there were heads of wealth , that is to say those who looked after the resources , there were also cultivators who headed all cultivators who was known as the head of the land .
inzego z' ubutegetsi zikaba eshatu uko ari eshatu , ntabwo bigeze bashyiraho ubutegetsi bw' abahigi iii abahigi kenshi ni cyane kuhiga bose barahigaaga cyane cyane i bwami niho bahigaaga kurusha n' abandi ee ababumbyi nabo barabumbaaga nyine bitari ibyo kuvuga ngo n' abatware . ||| there were three branches of government , they did not put a government for hunters , often they all were hunters especially in the royals who hunted more than others , potters also moulded of course but that did not mean that they were leaders .
n' aba vu babumbaaga nyine mujyae mubiumva . ||| and those who were potters . that was the government .
ubutegetsi rero bubaye ubwo nraza kuvuga ukuntu baje kubikuraho nyuma , nyuma aho abazungu aho bazaiye bakuyeho ubwo butegetsi uko ari batatu barabuvunja babuhindura kimwe , bihinduka aba chefs , aba sous chefs n' iki ariko ibyo biraza kuba ibindi . ||| i will talk about how it later came to be removed , later when white men came , they removed that government which was of three branches and made it one , they became chiefs , assistant chiefs and others but that is something else .
urebye rero n' uko nvuga ubutegetsi bw' icyo kihae uko buri bumeze habaaga ikintu rero kijya kusa na democratie kuko umwami aho bamaze kugira ubutegetsi bumwe aho abanyiginya bamaze kuganza niyo nganji karinga . ||| that is what i can say on how the government of that time was there was something similar to democracy because the king , after they had one government when the banyiginya clan had conquered , that is nganji karinga .
karinga ingoma yabo y' abanyiginya imaze kuganza izindi zahozeho nazo , zabo bami bose zabagaho , inganji karinga imaze kuganza izindi bashatse ukuntu bafatanya n' imilyango ikomeye , hari imilyango yitwa ibaibanda , ||| after the banyiginyahad conqured other kingdoms , of all those kings that existed , after inganji karinga had conqured others , they looked for a way of woking together with societies which were strong , there were societies called ibibanda , ibibanda are the ones who give birth to the royal family .
ibaibanda n' ababyara abami . ubwami bwa kera rero muby' ukuri umwami yavaaga mu banyiginya ariko akagira abamikazi basa , umwamikazi basangiye ubutegetsi wa mwamikazi nawe akagira amoko avamo . ||| in the ancient royal family to be honest , the king came from the banyiginya clan but had queens who resembled , the queen with whom he shared the throne had a clan from which she came from .
abega habaye icumi hanyuma hajyaho abakono , hajyaho abaha , hajyaho abagesair , hajyaho n' umuzigaba uwa mbere yari n' umuzigaba muby' ukuri , ee buri uburyo bwo bashyiramo akantu kameze nka democratie y' ubungubu . uraumva rero ni nk' uko ntinvuga mu magambo menshi ariko tuvugae ubutegetsi bwa kera ni nk' uko , harimo ikintu cya democratie , harimo ikintu cy' ubumwe , harimo ikintu cyo kushyiraho cyane cyane n' ubutegetsi bwa rusangae ubutegetsi bw' ingabo umuntu yabwita administratif iby' ubu ni nka leta y' ubu ariko hakaba n' ubutegetsi bwerekeye k' ubukungu bw' igihugu iii aborozi n' abahinzi . ||| from the bega clan there were 10 and after there came the bakono clan , then the baha clan , then the bagesere clan , then the first from the muzigaba clan was a true muzigaba , it was a way in which they included something similar to democracy of today . you see therefore , i can not say it in many words but the ancient rule had something similar to democracy , there was unity , there was especially in the general leadership of the army which one may call administration of today , it is like the government of today but there is a government concerning three resources of the country , livestock breeders and cultivators .
ibyo nibyo bije kubyara by' ukuri ayo magambo ngo n' amoko s' amoko kuko nta ntawabaga umuhinzi kusa nta n' uwabaga umworozi kusa nta nta n' umulyango ubagamo aborozi kusa undi ngo ubaemo abahinzi kusa ibyo n' ukubeshya , ubaga tubaga tuva inda imwe umwe akaba umuhinzi undi akaba umworozi . ||| that is what came to give birth to the words that clans are not calms because nobody was only a cultivator , nobody was only a livestock breeder , no society was only made up of livestock breeders and another made up of cultivators only , that is a lie , we were related and one would become a cultivator and another a livestock breeder .
ehh nraumva mu magambo make nagirango nhinair ahongaho wenda mwaza kuba mwagira icyo mwabaza muri ibyo . ||| in a few words i think i can stop there and maybe you can ask me anything on that .
ehh ubwo rero mumaze kutuganirair aa ku miterere y' umu y' umulyango nyarwanda ehh mwakomojeho mutangi muvuga gato no kubintu ku ehh mitegekere ho gatoya . ||| you have just finished telling us about the way of life in the rwandan society and you went on to tell us a bit about the governance . i want us to therefore go deeper into the way of governance of the country .
ngira ngo rero tusae nk' aba nk' abainjira cyane muri iyo mitegekere y' ubutegetsi bw' igihungu . ehh mwatubwiye ko ubutegetsi bukomotse , ukuntu abantu bagiye baegeranya bava havuye hari umulyango bikagera ku nzu , inzu zikaiegeranya ||| you told as that governance result from people coming together coming from families to the households which came together .
zikaba ubwoko . ||| and they became clans .
zikaba ubwoko , mutubwira mu ubwoko bw' abanyiginya kuko aribwo bwa bukomokaho u rwanda ariko aha muri aka karerae hakaba hari harimo andi moko , hari harimo n' ibindi bihugu byinshi ahangaha . ||| and they became clans , you told us that the banyiginya clan was the clan from which rwanda came from but there were other clans in this region , and many other kingdoms here .
nagirango mutubwirae ukuntu noneho abo banyi ee aa iyo iyo ngoma y' abanyiginya , icyo gihugu cy' abanyiginya kigiye kiubaka u rwanda . ||| i want you to tell us how that kingdom of the banyiginya , that kingdom of the banyiginya , how it went in building rwanda .
ubwo se kigiye kifata mu ii mu binri bihugu kigiye kibifata kutae ? ||| did it go capturing other kingdoms , how did they capture them ?
ese abafashwae bafatawaga mu buhae buryo ? ese babageneraaga iki abandi bafashwae bakashyiraw muri urwo rwanda ? ||| those who were captured , how were they captured ? what would those that were captured give to be part of rwanda ?
ehh ariko twe nti tujyae kubigira birebire ni mu magambo makeya yenda nvuze mu magambo makeya , ||| but we will not make it long , it is in brief .
nvuze ukuntu bagiye babigenza kenshi bibaga mu ntiambara uziko mu rwanda kera hari ikintu kaitwaaga ingabo , zaitwaaga ingabo nyine ziizi zaza mu bibazo by' intambara . ||| speaking in a few words , if i talk about how they went about with it , often they went to war , you know that long ago in rwanda , there was something called an army , they were called an army and they came times of war
abanyarwanda bose ba babaga bari mu mitwe y' ingabo , baumvise ko mu rwanda hahangaye ikintu cy' inberae cy' ubute byose biri bishingaiye ku ngabo . ||| all rwandans were part of the , army when they heard that rwanda had existed for long , the first weakness is that it all depended on the army .
ingabo rero zikaba zirimo imitwe y' ubutegetsi bw' igihugu buri munyarwanda wese yabaga afite umutwe w' ingabo arimo , ||| the army had heads of government .
ingabo rero zika zifite ibintu byinshi zikora ariko icy' ingezi akaba ari kurwanair igihugu ariko harimo n' ibindi bikorwa byinshi byinshi nko kuhamiriza , nko ku nko kukora n' indi mirimo y' ............. yose ariko hakabaho nyine no kuzarwanirira igihugu . ||| every rwandan belonged to a certain group of the army , therefore had many responsibilities but the most important was to fight for the country but there were many other things like dance , like doing all other duties , but they included fighting for the country .
ari ukukirengera ari no kujya kukiungura , kukirengera bakiteye no kukiungura uuhh . ||| be it to stand for it or save it when it has been attacked .
urebye rero abanyiginya icya icyo barushije abandi ahari n' uko babarushije ubwo buengae nyine bwo bwo nge bwo kumenya gutu gucunga igihugu bakabyi bakamenya kurwana . ||| if you take a close look what the banyiginya were better at than others was the wisdom of knowing how to safe guard the country and how to fight .
bagiye rero bafata ibihugu bito bito bagenda babiongera ku binri wenda babarusha n' ubutegetsi bwiza nk' uko kusangira nk' uko kuvanga , ehh kuvuga rero ngo ba ba babategekaaga batae kugirango babayoborae ? ||| they went therefore capturing small kingdoms while adding them to others and maybe they had better leadership like sharing and interacting , so how did they rule so as to govern them ?
icyambere n' uko babasangi baragendaaga bakabaaka ubutegetsi ariko bakabasangiza . ||| first of all is that they would go and remove them from leadership but share with them .
ikibazo gikurikiyeho rero tura turajya ku cyiciro cy' amateka mu kihae cy' ubukoroni ariko mbere mbere y' uko tujya mu kihae cy' ubukoroni hari akabazo nshakaaga kubaza numva kaba ka kasasair ikibazo tugiye kujyaho cy' ubukoroni . ||| the next question is on the history during the colonial time but before we go to the colonial time , there is a question i wanted to ask which i feel lays ground for the next question of the colonialists .
eh uko amateka atubwira atubwira ko u rwanda ruba ruratangiraiye . ||| history tells us that rwanda probably begun
hariya rwa rwagasabo ari agasozi kamwe . ako gasozi ki ka gasabo nako muri bugirae icyo mukatubwiraho , ||| from rwagasabo which was one hill . the hill of gasabo , is there something you can tell us about it .
abazungu bakaba barasanze u rwanda rugera ku kiyaga cya rwincanzizu , u rwanda rurabaye runini harimo rugera na za masisi ari hanini cyane . ||| the white man found extending to rwicanzizu , rwanda had grown big and extended to masisi , it was very large .
ubwo rero ngira ngo wenda mbere y' uko munakubita kuku tutangira ikibazo ki amateka y' u rwanda hageze igihe cy' abakoroni muwi 1897 . mwatubwira iyo miterere ukuntu u rwanda rugendaaga ruba u rwanda koko rutera inberae , abantu barwinjiramo bashyashya , ||| i therefore want that maybe we first answer the question of rwanda 's history , there reached a time of colonialists in 1897 .
u rwanda ruri rugeze mu bahunde , rugeze mu bantu ba bahae na kure icyo . ||| can you tell us how rwanda was changing and developing , as new people came , how far had rwanda reached ?
ariko ibiiza n' uko tuvuga ibibazo tu tubigira bikeya kuko ngira ngo urugendo ni rurerure . ||| i think it is better for us to have a few questions because we have a long way to go .
tuvugae nkabiriya byo kaungura u rwanda , programme yo kaungura u rwanda , programme n' ukuvuga ko ngomba kuhera ku kuko batangiye ko mu kinyeja uko bari bameze n' ibintu bijya bya bijya kure uraumva ? ||| let us talk about things like the conquests of rwanda , is to say that i had to start because they begun around ... how they were and things would be going too far ?
ehh urabona iki gitabo ndagirango wenda bibae na na n' impamvu yo kukibabwira , maze kubabwira ibitabo ngirango bitatu cy' amoko iki , urabona iki gitabo kii l' histoire du rwanda precolonial nkianditse hashize imyaka mikeya mirongo ibihumbi bibiri naka na gatatu , niho negeranyaije ibintu byinshi n' ibitari muri iki cya kagame ehh . ||| let this be an opportunity for mr to tell you about this book i have so far told you about three books about clans , this book ‘ l' histoire du rwanda precolonial ’ , i wrote it a few years ago in 2003 , that is where i compared many things which are not even in this one of kagame .
iyo ubigenzuye rero iyo ubonye umwanya umuntu akaba yareba burya ibyagiye , ha hari ukuntu abanyiginya bari bafite mu miterere yabo mu buengae bwabo biri mu mu mu byo baise ubwiru , ubwiru n' ikintu umuntu yakuita nk' ubungubu nka constitution , reba constitutionnel ; n' igitabo nriho nandika ubungubu kigiye kusohoka . muri icyo gitabo rero iyo ukisomye ubona amategeko bagendairagaho kugira ngo bacunge igihugu ari ukukirengera ari ukukiungura , kukiungura mu mu mu buryo bwo ku kukibonera ibindi bihugu , kukiungura mu buryo bwo kubona kukitunga , kukiungura no mbese no mu muco . ||| if you take time and look at what went on , there is a way the banyiginya clan had their way of life and their knowledge in what they called royal secrets , what you can call the constitution today , look at ‘ constitutionnel ’ , is a book i am writing now which is about to come out . if you read that book you find the laws they went by so as to safe guard , stand for and save the kingdom , to save in terms of capturing other kingdoms , in terms of supporting it and also culturally .
umwami yari afite ukuntu agira kugirango kikirae . ibyinshi rero biganaish ku bukirae bw' isi bw' u rwanda , ||| the king had a way of solving it .
tuvugae nku abami bari bafite , abami bari bafite ukuntu bakuramwa mu mazina no mushyingano . ||| let us talk about kings , kings had a way in which their names reflected their responsibilities .
hari abami babiri uwitwaga kigeli n' uwitwaga mibambwe akazi kabo cyane cyane kari ako kwa kugura u rwanda . ||| there were two kings , one was called kigeli and the other mibambwe , there duty mainly was to conquer for rwanda .
kigeli niko kazi ke iyo yimaaga ingoma yagombaaga kugura u rwanda n' umuhungu we mibambwe akazakurikiraw n' uwitwa yuhi , yuhi akaba uzana amahoro n' umutekano akaba ndetse uza mu bintu by' imihango n' ibindi byose bituma nko kuruhuka n' ibiki byose . ||| that was kigeli 's duty , whenever he was on the throne , he had to conquer for rwanda and his son too who was succeeded by the one called yuhi , yuhi was one who brought peace and security and he was also involved in thing to do with activities and all others which involved resting and others .
hakabaho na n' abandi rero ba b' amata uwitwa kiraima n' uwitwa mutara bazana uburumbukae mu gihugu n' icyo kituma nyine naho mutara nyine ni mutara h' inka niho ririya zina riturutse n' iki . ||| there were others for milk , the ones called kirima and mutara brought plenty to the kingdom , that is why mutara is place of cows , that is where that name came from .
uraumva rero bi bi biganaishije mu bintu bierekeye uko igihugu kigombaaga kujya mbere . ||| that leads us to things concerning how the kingdom had to move forward .
ubwo rero ubazaaga ukuntu ba abami bagiye tubigirae nka nko muri abo bami rero abagiye kure muri ibyo uvugaaga baunguye u rwanda ni ba mbere hari abaitwaaga izina rya ruganzu bari ku baba naryo ryari iry' abarwanyi ruganzu , ||| you were asking how kings let 's say amongst those kings who went far in what you were saying to benefited rwanda .
uwa mbere ruganzu mpimba na ruganzu ndori . ||| first there were those called ruganzu , they were to be fighters of ruganzu , the first was ruganzu mpimba and ruganzu ndoli .
iryo zina baje kuri kura mu mateka kuko rya abariiswe bose ba ribateye ubuvukasi , ||| that name was removed from the history because those who were named after it ... it made them lose their lives .
ritumye ba ba ba bagwa ku ku ku kahinga ii umwe yabaye mutabazi ruganzu mpimba undi baramwishe ruganzu ndoli babakura mu mubarae kuko ritewe n' ibyago ubuvukasi . ||| one was mutabazi ruganzu mpimba and another was killed , ruganzu ndoli and they were removed because it was cursed .
u rwanda , anda mu kinya , anda n' ukuvuga n' ukuvuga isi itagira imipaka , aanda ii . ||| anda in kinyarwanda means a world without boundaries .
ehh kigali n' ikigali n' igihugu nyine kigali kitagira imipaka nyine , ni kigali kimwe rwose niko bakaise . ||| kigali means large , without boundaries , it is one kigali , that is what they name it .
umunye y' uko gapi capital ya mbere ya yaba ni kigali nyine rwoya ishinze hariya mu mu bushorishori bwa kigali hariya hejuru mu bitaka mu biti hejuru hariya . ||| you have known that the first capital here was kigali , rwoya which was found in at the ends of kigali above in the ground in the woods above there .
gasabo nyine neni n' igisabo nyine kaicundair u rwanda uraumva nyine cy' amata nyine nabyo ni ukuvuga u rwanda nyine ; ni n' igicundira u rwanda , n' igisabo nyine , n' igisabo kaicundair u rwanda amata . ||| gasabo of course is a churn of rwanda , of milk , it 's like saying it charns rwanda , it 's what churns milk for rwanda .
hariya ha mu mu muhazi ureba n' umwaro wayo . ||| over there in muhazi you see that it is its tributaries .
eh murakoze , tukomeje mu kiganiro tugiraan na padiri muzungu eh turi turangije kuganira ku ntinvuga ngo turarangije nyine y' uko dukurikije gahunda tuihaye , ||| thank you , continuing with our conversation with father muzungu , we have finished talking about .
tuha noneho tusaga nk' abagira ganira ku rwanda mu kihae cy' ubukoroni . ||| i can not say that we have finished because were are following our program , we seemed to be talking about rwanda in the time of colonialists .
twagirango mutuganiraireho ku rwanda mu bukoroni mu kihae mbese u rwanda rugezawemo n' abazungu . ||| can you tell us about rwanda in colonization in the time white men reached rwanda .
eeye icyo n' ikibazo cyiza kirakurikira ibyo turi tumaze kuvuga , ni nka kwa kunri nagirango ngiraemo inzego ebyeri hari ibierekeye ii aa abaturage , abanyarwanda uko abakoroni babafashe n' ubutegetsi bw' abanyarwanda uko abakoroni babutwaye ngirango nibyo byiza . ||| that 's a good question , it 's in line with what we were saying , in the same way i will divide it into two parts , that concerning how locals of rwanda were colonised and how the colonialists took over power in rwanda , i think that 's better .
eh umuntu yahera ndetse ku baturagae b' u rwanda abakoroni bamaze kuhagera babafashe batae ? ||| let me start with the locals of rwanda , how were they colonized ?
eh aho niho hari umuzi w' ibyago tunyuzemo by' ukuri kubera ko abazungu baje hano mu rwanda bafite ibitekerezo bakuye ahandi . ||| that 's where our problems started because the white man came with foreign ideology
hari umuzungu witwa w' umwongereza witwa capitain john honing speek yaje muri afrika yacu yo muri aka karerae za ethiopia agerayo za buganda abona abantu b' abahaima , b' ababito , ageze ino abona n' abanyarwanda cyane cyane abona aba abatutsi basa nyine n' abo bahaima aba b' aborozi . ||| there was a british man called captain john honing speak who came to our africa around this area in ethiopia and even reached uganda , then saw people of the hima tribe , babito tribe and then reached here and saw the rwandans especially the tutsi who of course looked like the hima who were cattle keepers .
amaze kubibona atyo rero yibwira y' uko abatutsi atari abanyarwanda ari abantu baturutse aho nyine ruguru iyo muri za ethiopia , mu bagara , ngo abanya basa n' abagara mu by' ukuri ari aborozi , ari abantu banywa amata . ||| after seeing this he thought that the tutsi were not rwandans but from up there in ethiopia , from the bagara , that they looked like the bagara who were the cattle keepers and drunk milk
amata burya afite ikintu ashyira ku muntu uyanywa . ||| milk has an effect on one who takes it .
azana rero bya bitekerezo by' uko abanyarwanda atari bamwe atari bamwe ko abatutsi ari abantu baturutse iyo ruguru ko abandi bahutu ari nk' abandi bairabura baturutse hairyo iyo hose , azana n' icyo gitekerezo cy' uko bafite aho bavuye atari abaturage b' ino , niwe wadukanye icyo gitekerezo ubundi turi tu mu kanya ngirango nbabwiye y' uko ubundi abantu bose baturutse ino , adam n' umunyarwanda n' ako s' umuti n' umunyafurika wenda n' umukenya cyangwa n' umutanzaniya cyangwa se nu abisinya n' iki . ||| he brought about the mentality that rwandase were not the same , that some that is the tusti came from up there and that the hutu are like the other africans from around , he brought about that mentality they are not from around this area , he gave us that mentality , we all thought were from around here without discriminating that this is an african or a kenyan or tanzanian or abisinya
azana ibyo rero abikase atyo . ||| he brought that .
eh abandi bapadiri n' abandi bazungu bari kumwe ba ba babifatair hejuru , yani yasubiye iwabo yandika igitabo kierekeye amateka y' urwo rugendo yagiraiye muri afrika ndetse umutwe wa wa cyenda w' icyo gitabo cye amateka y' u rwa nako ya y' imiterere ye y' imigendere ye hano muri afrika abiita mu gifaransa au source du nil , igitabo kiandikaw mu bufaransa kaitwa au source du nil . ||| other priests and white men with whom he was believed him and when he went back to his home he wrote a book talking about that trip he took to africa and in the 9th chapter of that book talked about rwanda in other words his discoveries here in africa called aux sources du nil in french , a book was written in france called aux sources du nil
hano ntafite igitabo cy' umuzungu witwa alexandre arnord umupadiri wera , yanditse iki gitabo kaitwa les peres blancs au source du nil ; n' umwe mu bantu bafashe icyo gitekerezo cya speek nawe akigira nk' ihame ndetse speek yari yavuze ngo yavugaaga ati ntatekereza ko , kiri igitekerezo ariko abandi bose bakoporoye baje bagira bati si ukutekereza niko bimeze abatutsi s' abirabura b' ukuri n' abantu baturutse ruguru iriya . ||| here i have a book by a white man called alexander arnold , a white priest , he wrote this book called les peres blancs aux sources du nil ; he is one of the people who took on speak 's ideology and he made it a rule , speak said that it was just a thought but those that copied it believed that the tutsi were not real africans and that they came from up there
hari n' ikindi gitabo cy' uwitwa albert pages kiwa au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique , ||| there is another book by albert pages entitled ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique ’ , that is where they all support ‘ au royaume hamite au centre de l' afrique .

kije kuba umwanda kije kukurikizwa n' abantu bose . ||| it was followed by everyone else .
abakoroni rero baje , baje biraza kubyara n' ikindi kibazo kinavunaish rero uraumva , baje bafatanyaije abakoroni baje bari amoko abiri : hari abakoroni ba bo nita b' amapantalon n' ukuvuga baba basiviri ariko hari n' abakoroni b' amakanzu n' uko ari n' abapadiri , ||| when colonialists came , there came another problem , colonialist of two different kinds @: there came those whom i call of the trouser , that is to say civilians but there were also of the dress that is the priests .
baraje rero bafatanya n' abapadiri ndetse bashaka kugira bati mutufashe kutegeka iyi afrika neza mutubwira abantu , abirabura tukuifashaish . ||| they came in collaboration with the priests and wanted them to help the rule africa properly , tell us about these people and the african we can use .
maze ubwo aba abandi bati na hari ikiruhije se ? ||| and others said "@ is that what is difficult ?
turabazi . ||| we shall help you
hari abantu , abatutsi bamaze kuhamya ko ari ubwoko kandi byo umuntu ubihimbaye , mwifatanye n' abatutsi bazi kutegeka aribo mugira abafasha banyu . ||| there are people , the tustsi who have acknowleged that they are a tribe that was made up by someone , join hands with the tutsi , they know how to govern so asks them your helpers . @"
nibwo rero haje kuba ivugurura ry' ubutegetsi muri makumyabiri na karindwi na gatandatu na karindwi ry' umu resident wi umu resident witwaga mortohani , akuraho haho hariho aba sous chefs ba mbere bari batangiye nyine b' abadage a icyo kihae uwo mugabo yanyaze aba sous chefs b' abataw mirongo itatu , kera abategetsi ntibagombaaga ngo abahutu batu a e muri iyo reforme yanyaze aba aba aba sous chefs b' abataw liste yabo iriho na hariya i shyorongi hari umutaw barabanyaze . ||| that 's when there came a change in the leadership in 1926 and 1927 of a resident called mortohani , he removed the deputy chiefs of before who were the germans , that time that man dismissed 30 twa deputy chiefs , that time leaders were not supposed to be hutu or twa , so in that reform the twa chiefs were dismissed and their list can be found at shyorongi
banyaga abahutu bose uwitwa umuhutu wese n' abatutsi bagufi bose hasigaza abatutsi bo hejuru ; nibo baitwaaga ngo n' abantu bazi kutegeka bamenyereye kutegeka . ||| and dismissed all hutu and even tutsi who were short , and only the tall tutsi were left saying that they were the only ones who knew how to govern .
bashobora kufasha abazungu kubategekair bo bakaicara bakaryohairw bakamerairw neza . ||| and can help the white man to govern and they will be rewarded with wealth a live comfortably .
uraumva ibyo bintu rero , ibyo rero babifashwamo n' abapadiri ho gato kuberako abapadiri nibo bari bashizwe kuigisha abirabura mu mashuli , kuvura ndetse no ni nabo batangiye no kukora utuntu twa developpement nko kaubaka amazu ehh nkaza missioni baubakaaga nibo bazanye amatafari nibo batangiye no kaubaka imihanda n' iki . ||| they were helped in this by the priests because the priests were put in place to educate the africans , to treat them and they were the ones who initiated any form of development like building houses , they were the ones while building their quarters who brought bricks and they were the ones who started road construction .
abapadiri rero urabona rero impamvu banabafashe n' uko nyine baitwaaga ngo bazanye ubukrisitu baje kugira kutae , baraza rero batangira kuigisha imilyango batyo . ||| the priests were able to help because they were the ones who brought christianity and started teaching families about it .
ehh kwa kukoresha abaturage muri ibyo by' amashuli n' iki biganaish nyine no gusha n' amashuli abyara ubutegetsi , biza kugera igihe noneho ehh abakoroni baza no mu butegitsi kuko ba ba babupanze . ||| in their teachings they started up leadership schools , until it got to a time when the colonialists would take over leadership since they were always on the side lines
umva uko bagize abaturage aba abategetsi se bo abanyarwanda babafashe batae ? ||| how do you think they made the locals leaders and how did the rwandans react to this ?
nibyo ngira ngo nabyo ngirae . ||| that 's what i want to tell .
murabiumva baraje rero icyo bakoze n' iki cya mbere ? n' ukukuraho ubutegetsi nyine bwa kinyarwanda , umwami bamwita ubundi umwami niwe utegekaaga i gihugu noneho baramuhindura bamukuraho bati umwami hano tuvugaaga umwami w' abanyarwanda ahinduka leopard w' umuzungu , uwacu bamwita ngo ni mwami , ||| first of all they removed the rwandan form of governance , where by the king was the over all ruler of the country , they removed the king and replaced by leopold who was a white man , and they would continuously refer to him as the king ignoring our king .
bakaba bavuga le roi w' umuzungu et le mwami ariko uwacu nta akavugaw le mwami ehh . abategetsi baba baba abakozi ndetse kugira ngo nbigaragazae ko aribyo bitana n' uwashidikanya ntashidikanyae . ||| the leaders became servants so that they could show that it is that and those who were doubting stop doubting .
umwami uri uhari musinga atabiumvise neza baramwirukana agwa ku kahinga murabizi uko yapfuye yaguye i congo baramwirukanye ajya i kamembe ndetse basanze atari kure bihagije bamwohereza i kamembe nako i congo yaguye moba uwo n' umwami . ||| the king who was there was musinga and when he did not agree with them they chased him away and he died in congo where they sent him after they realised that kmememba where they had sent him at first was n't far enough and he died at moba
undi bashyizeho umuhungu we rutahigaw yagombye rero kuemera y' uko agiye kuyoboka abazungu ndetse abatizwa . ||| they replaced him with his son rudahigwa , who had to agree that he was to be governed by the white man and was thus baptised .
musenyeri classy yabigizemo ari ukuirukana musinga ari kushyiraho rutahigaw musenyeri classy yabigezemo uruhare cyane ndetse no kutonaish abatutsi icyo kihae abaitwa ngo n' aba cya ariko abatutsi bari aba aba bategetsi bo hejuru kusa . rubanda rugufi , abatutsi bagufi bahinga bagira batae ntibari ntibaitwaaga abatutsi ndetse noneho ibyo ari biri abantu biri imi imyuga babihi babishyiran' amategeko , babishyira no mu mpapuro . ||| the priest classy had a role to play in chasing away musinga and putting in place rudahigwa , he had a big role to play even in consoling the tutsi at that time who were only top officials .
nibwo bahimbaye impa , bashyiraho impapuro . ||| that is when they came up with identification papers .
uraumva rero ko ibyo kuvuga ngo n' ubwoko nabyo n' ukushakisha n' urugomo bashyiraho kusa rwo kugira kutae . ||| you see , to put in place the malice tribes was for what ?
uraumva abakoroni icyo bazanye rero n' icyo kintu cy' urugomo cyo kuhindura abanyarwanda bava inda imwe . ||| what the colonialists brought is that malice to change rwandans who were from the same womb .
bakavuga ngo n' amoko atagira icyo apfaan ndetse noneho biza no biza no kubyaraw mu ngoma , baranangana kuko aribo bazanye no no no kutasangira ubutegetsi ; ||| and they said that they were tribes that had no relation and then it came to exist on the royal throne , and they became enemies because they are the ones who brought not sharing of power .
mbere barabusangiraaga none babuharira bamwe , bizanabianditse turaza kubivuga mu kanya y' uko babanri ba ba babuhaye baza kubizira ba kuko baza kubizira kuko bazaaga bavuga ngo mwacuze abandi ii . ||| before they used to share but they gave it to some , it was written and we shall talk about it in a while that those they gave power came to reject it because they used to say that did not share with others .
n' ubutegetsi uko buri busanzwe bumeze hariho nk' abaza ku kugira nk' ibierekeye nk' uko ubutegetsi buri bumeze kera nk' uko abantu basangiraaga ibintu hariho nk' abantu bashoreza , hari nk' ikintu abantu baanga kenshi kandi batavuga nk' ibierekeye ubuhakae . ||| the way the ancient leadership was , they used to share things , there was something which people do not like called ubuhake .
ubuhakae n' ikintu abantu baiyamye nyuma eeh akazi n' ibintu bizanywae n' abazungu , ikiboko n' abazungu babizanye , uburoko n' abazungu babizanye kera nta buroko bubagaho kera nta kiboko kibagaho . ||| ubuhake is something people despised later on , work was introduced by the white man ; the whip and the prison too .
ikirekae ikindi rero ubuhakae bubagaho nabwo babwi babivangitiranya ubuhakae s' ikintu kiri kibi biri ibintu byu mbese ni nk' uko ubungubu umuntu ajya kusaba akazi , ||| ubuhake existed , it was not a bad thing , it was similar to how one goes to ask for a job today .
iyo ngiye kusaba akazi muri leta eeh n' ubuhakae ? ||| when you go to ask for a job in the government , is that serving ?
ugize imaan ndetse abona ubuhakae , ubuhakae ntibiri , ntibiri uku nta muntu wigeze akubitairw kuhakwa nta muntu n' umwe wigeze aza ngo ngwino ujyae kumpakwaho , umugaragu yagendaaga abishatse . ||| if you are lucky you get to be a servant , no one ever got beaten for it and neither did anyone ever say that come and serve me , a servant would do it if they wanted to .
kera rero mu kinyarwanda cya kera bitaraza muri urwo rw' ubungubu , ubuhakae buri nk' urwego umuntu yururiraho kugira ngo ashyikaire urwego rwo rw' abamuruta n' ukwisunga ukuruta . ||| long ago in ancient kinyarwanda , ubuhake was like a ladder one would climb so as to reach those who were superior to him .
ukuruta rero yakufashaishaga iki ? amafaranga ya kera yari inka , umu yakurushaaga iki ? ||| what would your superior help you with ? the money of that time was cows , what did he have that you did not ?
amafaranga ya kera yari inka , umu yakurushaaga iki ? yashoboraaga no kuku no kuku kukugarukair no kukurwanaho kera hari hatarabaho ubutegetsi buvuganair ku bantu bose , ||| he could support you and fight for you .
shobuja cyangwa umuntu ukuruta akakukiza kandi akaba yanakurwanaho urenganyae . ubuhakae rero kiri ikintu kiza icyo kihae ku buryo bw' icyo kihae nyine , ifaranga rwa kera ryari inka , urabiumva nta ndetse abantu nta n' umuntu utahakagwa rwose n' umwami yahakagwa na karinga niko bavugaaga , ||| long ago , there was not yet any kind of leadership that could speak for all people , your boss or superior would save you and could even fight for you when treated unfairly .
ndetse abakire nibo babaga bahaatswae kuko babaga bafite ibihakaiyew , rubanda rutatunze ntacyo ruhakwaaga . baravuga ngo hari intero bavuga ngo nibashaka kwiyenza bakavuga ngo ngo ngo ngo abantu bararenganyae ngo rubanda rugufi , ng' abahutu bakubaiswe ngo ngo ng' ubuhakae utatunze inka ntiiigeze aaa utashaka inka nta ntawe bigeze bakubita ngo jya kuhakwa utazishaka yarazirekaaga . ||| ubuhake therefore was a good thing at that time , the money of that time was cows and everyone including the king used to serve , even karinga , that is what they said , the rich were the ones who were befriended because they had what was worth serving for , if you do not own anything , you can not be served
ikindi rero umuntu uu ukize wese yagombaaga kuba afite akeneye urwego azamukairho umuntu wese aki aki nzungize , ngirumpatse umuntu mbese na rutahigaw yajyaaga yirahira rwabutogouhh , buri wese afite umuhatse . ni nk' uko tuvuga nyine umugaragu w' imaan , ||| another thing is every rich person was supposed to have a stepping stone even rudahigwa used in rwabutogo , everyone had someone to befriend .
umugaragu wu ukuruta umuntu wese aba afite uwo yisombe , mbese nk' ukunguku uzarebae uwabuze akazi , umushomeri uko aba ameze iii . icyo kintu rero cy' ubuhakae ni n' uko kusa nyine aba abazungu babishyizemo urugomo babiita uburetwa , ||| as we say a servant of god you 're a servant to one who is higher than you , everyone has a person who he is higher than , just like when one fails to get a job , a jobless person is like .
babigira itegeko bavenga n' ibya kazi nyine biravanga biba bibi rero . mu by' ukuri rero ubuhakae n' uburetwa n' ikiboko s' ibintu bimwe rwose uhh , n' uwaza kubibaza wenda azae kubibaza niba ashaka ariko ibintu rero abazungu bazanye mu magambo make n' ibyo , cyane icyavuyemo n' iki ? ||| honestly , ubuhake , dictatorship and whipping are not the same thing , you can ask about it if you wish but those are things the white man brought .
n' uko gusumbanya abantu icyo ni kimwe n' ukuitirair y' uko hari abaishe abandi ikindi cya ikindi n' ukuvuga ko hari n' amoko atagira aho ahuraiye ikindi n' ukuvuga nu , ||| and favouritism is one of the reasons as to why there are those who killed others , also it is to say that there are tribes that have nothing in common .
icya mbere cy' ingenzi nyine n' ukutugira abacakara babo , bakaza bakatuambura ubutegetsi bakatugira imbwa . ||| the first and most important thing is obviously to make us their slaves , they came and took our power and made us dogs .
umwami bakavuga ngo genda bakamwirukana abasigaye bakaba mbese niba bazanye no kuza n' umuntu kukubita umuntu ba aribyo baita kukura impuzu , barazaaga bakabarambika bakabakubita baku ba impuzu n' ukukura ku myenda baga bakakubita baambaye ubusa . ||| they sent away the king and those who remained would be whipped while they were naked , they would make them lie down and whip them with no clothes on , annoying humiliation .
agasuzuguro kateye umujinya sha yemwe abagore nibo bata batinya ariko nabo barababwiraaga ngo pfukama mugorae , pfukama bakukubitae inshi iii ibyo bintu n' ibintu . ||| they use to respect women but they would also tell them to kneel down and slap them , is that human ?
abakoroni rero n' icyo kintu ba nibyo umuntu yabavugaho . ||| that is what one can speak about the colonialists
nraza kuvuga aa ukuntu baje ku icyo bibyaye nyine , iby' imvururu yo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda nfite n' igitabo kibivuga kiri ahangaha niho tuza kugera . ||| i will talk about how they came and what resulted from it , the riots of 1959 i even have a book that talks about it here .
ehh mu magambo makeya wenda muzae kaongeraho ibibazo ariko n' uku nbivuga . ||| in a few words and maybe you can ask some questions but this is how i can say it .
n' uko nri ngiye nri nifuje kubabaza ikibazo , hari abantu benshi bagendair ku mateka eh adasobanutse cyangwa se nvuga atariho cyangwa se wenda bakajya bibeshya ibindi bintu bitewe no kutasobanukirwa . ||| i would like to ask you a question , there are many people who follow laws that are not comprehensive or that do not exist or they confuse themselves about certain things because they do not understand .
umwami musinga bamuciraiye i kamembe kubera impamvu , ntabwo yumvikanye n' abazungu bigeze aho nk' uko mwabitubwiye baza kumucira moba muri congo . ||| the king musinga was exiled in kamemba because he did not agree with the white man and after that as you told us they sent him into exile in moba in congo .
biragaragara ko hari ibyo bataumvikanyeho neza n' abazungu . ||| it 's clear that there were some things that they did not agree on .
ngo n' ajyae mu misa n' agirae atae , ||| and go to church , he could not understand that because it was not his faith and indeed that religion of god had no fault and they removed it and up to now it makes no sense .
ibyo nabyo ntiyari kumenya iyo idini atari idini ya ya kandi koko idini y' imaan ntacyo yari ibaye ba ba bayihinyuraagaho n' ubungubu n' ubusaw uhh nnjyae nd' umu padiri nbabwira nnjyae nd' umwe mu bantu barwanyaije bimwe . ||| even i as a preist i 'm one of the people who fought this .
baraje baravuga ngo idini yacu ngo abanyarwanda basenga ibigirwamana ibyo n' ikintu nanditse n' igitabo kiitwa le dieux est du notre pere kirwanya ibyo . ||| they came and said that our faith was based on idolatry and wrote about this in a book called "@ god is our father @" fighting this .
maze no kuandika icyo gitabo nyine le dieu est du notre pere aho nigishaaga muri universite y' i kinshasa nbajije abanyeshuli nigishaaga nsanga abirabura bose bo mu mu muri afrika cyane cyane yo mu bicae byo munsi ya sahara bose baemera ko hari ikintu kiremye isi n' ijuru bakakiha amazina menshi ariko twe tukakita imaan ibyo tukaba tubisangiye ; ntitusengaaga ibigirwamana . ||| after writting the book , "@ god is our father @" where at taught at the university in kinshasa , i asked the students and found out that all the blacks in africa especially in the sahara belive that there is something that created heaven and earth and they give several names but we called it god and we have this in common ; we did not worship idols .
ibyo rero musinga biramuvunaishaga kugira ngo baze bamutukae ngo n' umusenzi ngo na aa ibigirwamana agira koko bamuzizaaga ukuri ntiyabiemeraaga kandi umuntu ufite ubwenge nka musinga ntiyari kubiemera ii nri ngiye kuvuga ngo bamujijije ukuri , bamujijije ukuri kuko ntiyari kubiemera , n' umuhungu we ndetse yapfuye kuhendahenda kugira kuko yagize ati nintabigira nimbyemera barangira nka data . ||| that distressed musinga because they insulted him and told him that he worshiped idols but a wise man like musinga could not accept this , i wanted to say that they kept the truth from him because he could not accept this and even his son merely took it because he believed that if he did not accept it he would end up like his father
apfa kuemera icya mbere yakoze nyine n' ukuemera kubatizwa , yemera n' uko u rwanda rugira arutura yezu simvuga ngo nrabirwanya byo ariko musinga yazize icyo kintu cy' ingenzi , kumukura ku butegetsi no kumutoza idini y' abazungu atazi cyane bakamwita ko ari umusenzi ngo ni abashenzi , ntiyari umushenzi yari afite imaan ye kandi koko niy' ukuri na yezu siyaje ahubwo yaje kuvuga ngo ntinje kubikuraho ahubwo nje kubyemeza , ||| on merely accepting this , the first thing he did was to be baptised , and accepted that rwanda should worship jesus , i 'm not saying that i 'm against it but that was musinga 's biggest crime , his removal from power and forcing the white mans religion that he did n't understand on him and calling him a fool , he was n't a fool he had his own god and honestly it was a true god and jesus did not come , instead came saying that i have not come to remove but instead i have come to affirm it .
nanditse igitabo nyuma nyine , je ne suis pas venu abolir mais accomplir , je ne suis pas venu abolir ntinje kukuraho iby' imaan yari yarashyize mu mutaima n' abakurambere banyu ba bari bazi ahubwo nje kubiuzuza , ehhh . ||| i wrote a book later , "@ i did not come to abolish but to affirm @" i did not come to remove what god had put in the hearts of your fore fathers and what they knew but i have come to fulfill it .
uraumva rero musinga yazize ukuri yazize y' uko yari azi ubwenge kandi yari umugabo kandi yari akwaije umuco wa kihanga w' ukuri uhh , abakoroni bari bazanye kutu baje bavuga ko turi ibicucu nta buengae turi ingegera turi inyamaswa ibyo rero biramuvunaishaga kugira ngo abiemerae uraumva nicyo yazize cyane n' ikindi , njyae niko nreba rwose n' ibindi wenda by' impande by' uko bashakaaga uboroheye , ||| you see musinga was a victim of the truth , and that he was wise amd he was a man of honest character , colonialists came saying that we were stupid and had no brains , that we were animals and that was hard for him to accept and that was his crime .
ubatizwa akaiga iby' ikizungu undi yari ashaje wenda basanga atazabashobokair . ||| that 's what i think , other things maight have been because they wanted one who was easy going , baptized and willing to learn the white man 's things but he was old and they found that they could not get along with him .
noneho iyo ugiye kuitegereza muri afrika ntabwo u rwanda n' u burunri aribyo byakoronijwe byonyine n' ibindi bihugu bigiye bikoronizwa . ||| if you take a look at africa , rwanda and burundi were not the only countries that were colonised , other countries too were colonised .
noneho ariko mu rwanda n' i burunri cyane cyane usanga ariho hagiye haba ikibazo kuko nk' ubwo abazungu baraje basanga aa nko mu rwanda tuvugae abanyarwanda uko bari babayeho bari bafite uburyo bategekaan , bari bafite ukuntu babayeho noneho nkibaza ikibazo . n' iki kitumye abazungu bashobora kubasha kuteranya cyangwa kuhimba amoko mu banyarwanda kugira ngo babonae ukuntu babacamo ibicae cyangwa bifashaishe nk' uko ubivuze abatutsi kugira ngo babategekaire . ||| but you find that it was especially rwanda and burundi that had problems because even though the white man came , rwandans had away of ruling eachother , they had away of life and i ask myself , what made it possible for the white man to divide or to come up with with tribes amongst rwandans so as to divide them into pieces or like you said use the tutsi to rule for them .
noneho nkavuga nti kuki bahisemo abatutsi kuko iyo ugiye kuitegereza usanga ikibazo uyu munsi tufite kituruka muri kiriya kihae cy' ubukoroni kuko abazungu bafite ibintu bahimbaye kugira ngo bibafashe mu mugambi wabo ariko se kuki bibayeho muri bino bihugu byacu . ||| so why did they choose thetutsi because yuo realise that the most of the problems we have today are from the colonial time because the white man made up somethings to help them with their plans but why did it happen in our countries ?
urugero ntanga nk' u rwanda no mu burunri kusa n' uko araitwae turi tufite nk' imiyoborere myiza baje bakabona batazatuinjiramo kusa nko mu binri bihugu . ||| the example i can give on only rwanda and burundi is that we were the only ones who had good leadership and they saw that they could not just penetrate us like in other countries .
ehh ibyo nri kukikusubiza mu kanya iiyu uba uretse kuko turaza kugera ku bintu byo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda . ||| i would have answered that later because we shall come to things of 1939 .
nyine icyo tupfuye na n' ibyo bije kubamo ariko icyo kibazo umuntu araza kukisubiza mu kanya . ||| our misunderstandings are those things that came to be but i will come back to that problem in a while .
mu by' ukuri ubigenzuye wenda ngisubirize aho iby' amoko babihimbaye nk' uko ubivuze neza , mu by' ukuri n' ahandi barabihimbaye ariko ikibazo kije gukara cyane cyane igihe cyo cyo kushaka ubwigenge . ||| honestly , if you take a close look at where they came up with tribes like you have said clearly , they came up with these tribes elsewhere but the problem became more complicated in the time they wanted independence .
n' icyo kituma ngira iyo umuntu akivuga mu kanya niho biri kukunda kuko kuko naho mu by' ukuri hano bahimbaye iby' amoko ariko ahandi bahimbaye ibindi . ||| that is why i was proposing to talk about it later because they came up with tribes here but they came up with other things elsewhere .
ese icyo kintu cyo ariko noneho nyuma ureba ukasanga hagati hariya ntabwo ntinzi niba nvuga kiliziya katurika cyangwa niba nvuga abapadiri nabo ntabwo bitwaye neza kuko bagaragaje guhengama mu buryo bugaragara , iby' ari kuigisha abantu imaan bihinduka politique ukasanga noneho ibintu ntabwo bigenze neza . ||| if you look closely you realise that along the way the catholic church or should i say the priest did not behave propery because they evidently showed crookedness , what was meant to be teaching people the word of god became politics and things did not go well .
ntinzi ikintu mwatubwira ahongaho ku kintu kaerekeraanye n' aba padiri na kiliziya . ||| i do not know what you can tell us in regards to the priest and church .
eh kugira ngo tubyoroshye reka ibyo byose tubiganirae tuvugae ibyo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda bira birasa nk' aho bisubira muri ibyo byose kuko n' ubundi turavangavanga usangae biza no kuruhanya eh niho tuza ku ibyo by' abapadiri n' abakoroni icyo tupfa cy' ukuri kuko nibyo bya speek n' iki nk' ukuntu nbivuze mbere ku buhakae ariko icyo n' iki n' ikintu bari bakeneye kukikoresha . ||| so as to simplify things , let us talk about it all , let 's talk about thing in 1959 because it is like talking about all these things because we shall mix things up and you will find that it is tiring . that is where we come to the priests and colonialists and ourmiunderstandings with them , it is speak 's ideologies and what i said before about befriending but that is something they needed to use .
bari bazi ko babeshya ariko bari bakeneye kugira ngo mu by' ukuri bangaga kuva hano , bangaga kutanga ubwigenge , ibyo n' ibintu bikazae bakajije cyane cyane bagira ngo baimaane ubwigenge . ||| they knew that they were telling lies but they honestly did not want to leave this place , they did not want to grant us independance , those are the things that became difficult as they tried not to grant independence .
eh noneho ngirango uwavuga ikibazo kierekeye ni hari byinshi bishamikiyemo . ehehehe ||| i think if one is to talk about that , there are many thinga that are part of it .
icyo kihae cy' ubukoroni mutu mutubwiyeho incamake yacyo , icyo kihae cy' ubukoroni eh mwakitubwiyeho n' akabozo wenda muri butusubizaeho kajyanye na kiliziya katurika . ||| the little you have told us on the colonial period , there is a question we want you to answer on the catholic church .
turakubita ku mvururu zo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda imyivumbagatanyo abantu benshi ubungubu babiita kwishi @: ||| we shall talk about the riots of 1959 and the protests .
hari ababiita imvururu , hari ababiita revolution sociale , hari n' ababiita ukundi . ||| there are those who call it riots , others call it a social revolution while others call it something else .
ubwo rero muri bubitubwiraemo mutubwiraemo ababigizemo uruhare cyane , nonese bikozwe n' ande ? ese biganaishaga hehe ? ||| tell us about it and those who had an active role in it . who did it ? , what was their goal ?
bari bari bande ? ||| who were they ?
yego n' ikibazo giko ngirango mubyo tuvuze byose iki niwo muzi wa simvuga ngo niwo muzi wa byose ariko niyo niyo masanganiro y' ibibazo . ||| yes , this is the of end result of all the questions .
ikibazo kije gukara umunsi afrika irambairw ubucakara eeh n' aho ariko ihera nyine kubyari biyitangiraiye nicyo kitumye ngira ngo mbi nbibaze mbi nbanzae mbitazire ariko mu by' ukuri amasangano y' ibibazo n' ubwigenge by' afrika kuikura ubucakara , ||| the problem became evident the day that africa got tired of being a slave , the time it wanted independence and stop being slaves .
muri afrika rero amateka murayazi n' abantu benshi barayasoma ubungubu n' ibintu byoroshye ku kuvugaw . ||| many people now know the history of africa and even read about it , that is an easy thing to talk about today .
abazungu muri iyi confe conference de berlin niyo yatanze afrika ngw' ibae ubusitani bw' abazungu bikorerae ibyo bashaka cyane cyane bari bakeneye ii ibyo baita matiere premiere ibintu ba byo kuko mu nganda kugira ngo bacurae ibyuma n' ibindi byose bazakoresha , ||| in the berlin conference , that is where the white man claimed africa as their land to do with it what ever they wanted , they especially needed raw materials for their factories so as to make machines and every thing else that they would use .
basanga afrika rero ari ubutaka bwabo ariho hari n' ibintu byinshi ba ba bakuifashaish bagira inama rero bigira inama y' ukuntu bazaza kukabana isi , afrika ijyamo rero . ||| they found that africa had most of the things they could use and they decided on how they will share the world and africa was part of it .
ubwo rero aba baje ino abakoroni bazana n' abapadiri , bazana n' abandi bose babacukuzi bagira batae barakora amateka maremare murayazi y' ubukoroni . ||| so the colonialists came here with priests and all the archaeologists and wrote the lengthy history of the colonialist which you all know .
bigera igihe rero afrika isa nk' aho imaze kushira ubwoba igira iti birakabije , ||| there reached a time when africa seemed to be courageous and decided that enough was enough .
birakabije bari baragize bamwe rero ubwo hari ubukoroni busanzwe nkatawe ndetse twe baratworoheye ariko hari abo bajyanaaga bakabajyana mu mahanga hakurya wumvise z' amerika , aziya iki abo baita esclavage . ||| there was the ordinary colonisation like ours , where they were not harsh but there are those they would take abroad like to america , asia , what they call slavery .
twebwe tugize n' imaan hari umugabo witwaga rubukiri bamwise makare bwana mukare aragomair ararwana abuza abara ..... bigira bite , ariko biratinda nyine ba baraza . ||| we were lucky to have a man called rwabugiri who they named makare bwana mukare who resisted and fought , but later they came .
igihe rero cyo cyo muri za mirongo hafi ya za mirongo itangatu kuva muri za miro hafi bijya kuganaish muri za mirongo itandatu , ||| .
ibihugu bya mbere ngira ngo niza ghana nizo zabanje kugira independance . ||| in the period around 1960 , i think the first country to gain its independence was ghana .
abazungu bashatse ukuntu bakuimaan ubwigenge bashaka rero ukuntu bazibya abirabura bari bakomye induru y' ubwigenge , abaitabairaga ubwo buigengae rero batangira kuigiraan no kuhimba amashyaka ya po po politique bayita nationaliste abantu bashaka ubwigenge . ||| the white man tried to find away of not granting independance , those who wanted independence started coming together and forming political parties , they were called nationalists .
bon abenshi turabazi nyine barimo ba nkurmah , barimo ba kinyata hafi aha ni ba jomo ki ni ba njomo kimata nyine hari umwami wa ethiopia haile sellassie . ||| most of us know that they included nkrumah , jommo kenyatta , there was the king of ethiopia haile sellassie .
tuvugae n' ino rero nyine tuvugae tugae tugushae hano kwa rutahigaw iwacu tubigushae hafi na rumunba hafi aho na rwagasore hariya hepfo n' iki amazina yose murayazi . ||| close here we had rudahigwa , lumumba , rwagasore , you know all the names .
imigabane ibiri kuko iyo ugize amoko nk' ibi , tuvugae nk' amadini ntiushyira kw' idine hari amadini icumi kuko ntiubona uko ugabanyamo kabi , ||| into two parts because when you do this with tribes , for example if there are ten religions , there is no way you can divide them into two .
iteka bashaka ukuntu habonekamo imitwe ibiri ntabarwana ari imitwe myinshi . ||| they always looked for away of having two factions because no one can fight if they are many factions .
bashaka ikintu kikatamo aa abene gihugu mwo kabiri , babiita ii douel , ||| they looked for something to divide the country men into two , they call it dual .
douel . ||| here they found that it was easier to use tribes even though they are three .
hano rero basanze amoko aribyo byoroshye n' ubwo ari atatu muby' ukuri rimwe bariigaije iruhande bati ntacyo rivuze abataw barabaihorera , baho abahutu n' abatutsi umwe babaha ingabo ya so ngo murwanae eeh n' ahandi bisho , ||| they put one aside say that it meant nothing so they left the twa alone , they considered the hutu and tutsi and gave one side arms and told them to fight eachother .
hariho aho bashyizeho idini nko muri za sudani ngirango bashatse abirabura n' iki . ||| there are places where they used religion like in sudan .
iteka rero abira abazungu rero abakoroni bashakaaga ikintu kituma aba abene gihugu baba imitwe ibiri irwana bakafata igipande kibafasha rero . ||| the white man always wanted something that divided the country men into two opposing sides of which they would chose one side to help them .
iyi niyo mpamvu yatumye nyine bareba bahimba ubwoko kuko aribwo bworoshye kuko abahu abo baita abahutu n' ukuvuga ni majorite kuko majorite n' aba n' abakene n' abari hagati mubyu ubigenzuye kuko abahutu abatutsi abataw nyine na n' ibierekeye categorie ya ya y' ubukire , ||| that is the reason as to why they came up with tribes because it was easier .
abakene cyane bakaitwa abataw , abo hagati bakaba ari bafite bafite abakene ariko biringaniye nibo benshi cyane ku butegetsi bwose bakaitwa abahutu , abakire cyane ariko ba bakeye nyine bakaitwa abatutsi . ||| the hutu were the majority because the poor are always the majority , if you look closesly , the hutu , tutsi and twa were cartegories of wealth , and the very poor were the twa , and those who were average were mostly leaders and they were called the hutu , those who were very rich but few were the tutsi .
niko babigize rero bashaka ibyo ubundi iyo tuvugae basanga nk' idini ariyo yoroshye kukatamo kabiri niyo bari kufata , ||| that is what they did but if there had been an easier way of dividing them into two , they would have use it .
iyo bafata nko muri aa ahandi bakasanga uturere aritwo tworoshye niko bari kubigenza ; ||| if they had found that regions were easier , that is what they would have done .
nko muri a sudan niko bakase abirabura n' aba n' abarabu . ||| like in sudan that is how they divided blacks and arabs .
ugenzuye s' ukuvuga ko bakunda abahutu n' ugu sibyo n' uko basanze kukata abahutu n' abatutsi byoroshye iyo babona ikindi bari kukikoresha nacyo ibigaragara n' uko atari ukuba mbere nibo bakase mbere baraje bashaka mbere bashakaaga , ||| it is not that they prefered the hhhutu , it 's because it was easier to divide the tutsi and hutu .
bashakaaga ababafasha kutegeka . ||| it is evident that they came looking for those who could help then rule .
uraumva ba nibo bazanye rero kukatamo kabiri abazi kutegeka n' abatazi kutegeka abahutu bajya mu nbaw zitazi kutegeka ndetse babashyiraho n' ibicucu ntazi ubwenge ni babi n' ingurube byose n' iki n' ukurya kusa upfa kusukamo bakamira . ||| they are the ones who broght the division between those who know how to rule and those who do not .
abatutsi ni beza n' imfura bazi ubwenge bazi kutegeka ibintu nk' ibyo , ||| the hutu were cartegorised as dogs that did not know how to rule who were fools and had no brains , ugly and like pigs , they just ate what ever they were given . the tutsi were the good looking ones who had brains and knew how to rule .
hanyuma igihe babasenzi rero bahaye bashyize kw' ibere niryo kosa harimo na rutahigaw umwami wabo bagize n' umukristu yari yarifashe neza ntiyari yarakuraije se eeh bavuze ubwiyungu rutahigaw aba uwa mbere ahaguruka . ||| then those they had given power , including rudahigwa who had collaborated , was a christian and not been like his father , who was the first to arise among those who wanted independence .
ati yeyeyeyeye agiye n' iburayi amaze kubona nibyaho ashirika ubwoba ati eheeee nzajya no muri l' o.n.u nsabae igihugu cyanjye kigengae , yibutse ubwenge bwo kuigenga ? bati wa nbaw we sha tukushyize inberae n' ibyo ? ||| when he went abroad and saw what was there , the gained courage and decided that he would go to the u.n.o and ask that his country be given independance , when he gained the wisdom of seeking independance , they felt like , "@ you dog , we made you important and now this ? @"@
ati buretse rero tukuerekae ii buretse uko noneho araza avuga ati mwebwe abana b' abahutu mwarengana ye , ||| , "@ wait and see !
icya mbere ni mwebwe muzi ubwenge , ||| . @"
muranitonda , nimawe benegihugu erega nimawe benegihugu nimwebwe ba nyamwishi abandi ziriya nbaw zi si sin' abanyarwanda mu byukuri . ||| they came and said that the children of the hutu , were treated unjustly , first of all they are the knowledgable ones , they are well behaved , this country belong to them , they are the majority and that those dogs are not even true rwandans .
bibinri bya speek noneho barabikeneye kaga theorie speek yavuze agira ngo ariganirair ngo ni barebare barasa nin' inyobae ndetse ubanza , baraasa n' abagara . ||| they needed that theory of speak which said that they were tall , light skinned .
abazungu bati aaaaa ese ko aribyo ntubona se ? ||| the white men said that that is what they saw .
ab' ukuri dore mwebwe ni mwe bene gihugu , benegihugu n' abahutu aba aba abataw bara barabihoreza ntibanabavuga abataw bati nimubihorere bati noneho rero bibaye bite ? ||| they said that the county belonged to the hutu and they said nothing about the twa .
ubwo rero mushaka ubwigenge mwebwe abatutsi icya mbere ni koko na bati tujyae kuri abahutu igihugu n' icyanyu mwebwe muirukanae abakoroni ariko muherae kuba mbere abakoroni ba mbere n' abatutsi mubasubizae iwabo , nibwo banahimbaye bati inzira ngufi murayizi ni nyabarongo mwo kasenya mwe , dore inzira iri hariya hafi nyabarongo . abatutsi basubirae iwabo tuzaba tujyenda nyuma nibyo tubanzae ariko tu tubasubizae . ||| since they wanted independence , the white man said that the hutu should expel the colonialists starting with the first ones who were the tutsi , and they said that the river nyabarongo was a short cut to sending the tutsi back to where they came from , and that they would go after them .
nguko uko rero ukuntu ibyo bintu bigize bije kubyara ikibazo kibi cyane kirakara rero byose biza biirunda , hanyuma rero kugira ngo bikundae ntibiri byoroshye kugira ngo bikundae . ||| that gave birth to a very bad problem which got worse .
bimwe bavuga rero ngo ngo ngo kamparamaka ngo nako ngo ngo kuivumbura dore umugabo murebae iki gitabo mission au rwanda cyanditswe n' umuzungu witwa colonnel guy logest w' umu flamma nramuzi , nramuzi yari ari hariya i kigali . ||| there is a book called ‘ mission au rwanda , ’ which was written by a white man called colonel guy logest who was flemish , i know him , he was here in kigali .
yaraje muri cinquante neuf ( 59 ) aribwo bwa mbere avuye i congo araza bamuha ubutegetsi aba residence speciale , ||| he came from congo in 1959 for the first time , he was made the resident special .
ubutegetsi bwose arabwicaza buri busanzwe ari ubw' abakoroni n' iki ari njyewe ninjywe uhawe u rwanda kubutegeka butavuguruzaw . ||| he removed all the leadership that was there and was colonial .
nibwo aje rero bamubwiye bati maze rero ziriya nbaw z' abatutsi ndetse sin' abanyarwanda n' iki , bakuraeho ushyiraeho abahutu . ||| he came with orders to remove those dogs who were the tutsi and were not even rwandans from power and put the hutu .
araza rero abishyira itegeko abatutsi bose arabanyaga tout simplement nta ntarunri rubanza puuuu nbaw nbaesaire abicaza bose , bose ku murongo ku murongo ntarunri rubanza . ashyiraho abahutu kusa bityo atangira kutwika . ||| he therefore came and removed the tutsi without any reason and put the hutu nad he begun to burn
uyu muzungu yatwikiye njyae ubabwira yatwitse iwacu i buhoro , abazungu nta mwirabura urimo nibo baje kutwika iwacu barasa . ibyo bavuga ngo cinquante neuf .................. texte manque ................ ntajwi ........ makeya ibyo bababwira ngo imyuvumbagatanyo n' iki ibyo n' ukubeshya n' amagambo . basanze batatanga ubutegetsi bati noneho tukuraeho ababusa aba ................ texte manque ............... ntajwi ........ yeeee parmehutu rero ........... ntajwi ....... ku mbehe bati dore . ||| this white man burnt my home in buhoro , white men without any black are the ones who came to burn my home with shooting , what they say as 1959 ...
kandi ubundi nyine tubonye y' uko niyo biba ba tuvugae niyo bavuga ko abatutsi bari bafite ubutegetsi bubi bari baba barabukuyeho . ||| we saw that if the tutsi had had bad leadership , they would have removed them .
ikigaragaza n' uko bakuyeho umwami , umwami bashyizeho rutahigaw nibo bamwishyiriyeho ntibamushyizeho bakurikije ubutegetsi bwa kinyarwanda . ||| instead they removed the king and put their oun king , rudahigwa without following the rwandan way of leadership .
ntiyari umwami utegeka yari umukozi nk' abandi yategekawaga n' ab' administrateur n' izina ry' ubwami bamwise mwami , ||| he was not a king who ruled , he was a worker like others headed by the administration , the name they gave him was ‘ mwami ’ , and there was ‘ umwami ’ and ‘ mwami ’ .
hakabaho umwami na mwami ndetse n' aba na nkatawe tusengaaga mu kiliziya tuvugaaga tusengaaga tusabaire umwami wacu leoporidi . ||| in fact as we were praying in the church we would say that let us pray for our king leopord .
ntituvuga ngo tusabaire umwami wacu rutahigaw , turavugaaga tusabaire umwami wacu leoporidi ii uraumva rero igihe rero ubutegetsi buhindukiye kubera y' uko nyine abategetsi bashakaaga ubwigenge babuhaye utabusabaaga parmehutu biva rero kuby' amatora , ||| we did not say that let us pray for our king rudahigwa , we use to say that let 's pray for our king leopord the 2nd .
bahimba amatora amashyaka y' amatora baratora , baratora bahi bakaubaka rero repuburika kayibanda yaka repubulika . ||| when it reached the time that the leaders wanted independence , they gave it to those who were not asking for it , parmehutu , they forged elections for political parties and voted and built the republic of kayibanda .
leta ya mbere gouvernement ya mbere yashyizeho yari ya nkuko nbivugaaga mu kanya yari ikizawe n' abahu n' abatutsi na na n' abazungu n' aba parmehutu . ||| the first government which they put place was made up of hutu , tutsi and white men and parmehutu .
ngira ngo nrebye mu by' ingenzi cyane by' icyo kihae ni nk' ibyo icyari kisigaye n' uko ibizakurikira ni leta zikurikiye zagiye zifite uwo muragae w' uko igihugu kibaye icy' abantu bamwe baita aba parmehutu eeh n' ababakurikiza bose . ||| what followed in that period were governments which had the mentality that the country belonged to the hutu who were called parmehutu and their followers .
bibyaye y' uko abatutsi babaye babi babaye abakoroni bacaiyew . ||| it resulted in the tutsi being considered as bad and colonialists who should be killed .
aba abashoboye kuhunga bakahunga murabizi ni niho impunzi zatangiraiye , kutwika niho bitangiraiye , kuica niho bitangiraiye , mbese kuvuga ko umututsi atari igihugu ataarikae rwose ari kavantara ar' umunyamahanga . ||| those who were able to flee fled , you know that that is when refugees , burning and killing came into existence , saying that the tutsi were foreigners .
ehh birakurikiraan mu mashuli , birakurikiraan mu mirimo mbese hose umututsi usanga atakiri atakiri iwe . ||| it followed in schools and places of work and it resulted in the tutsi feeling as thoughthey were not at home .
ubwo rero umuntu akaba yavuga ko nta naho bigejeje wenda umuntu yaza na subira na kurikizaho izi leta za mbere za repubulika niba mushaka ko tukomeza . ||| one can say that this did not get them anywhere , one can go through all these early governments of the republic if you wish that we continue .
........... kuri ayo mateka mutubwiye , kuri ayo mateka mutubwiye yo muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda , umu hari undi mugabo ujya ukunda kuvugawmo cyane ubaye ngo ashobora kuba yaragizemo uruhare aah umugabo witwa pelode . ||| in the history of 1959 that you have told us , there is a man who is often talked about who maight have played a role called peraudin .
pelode yari umusenyeri wanjye nbaye padiri kwa niwe wampaye ubumuseseridoti padili pelode yari yabaye na padiri mukuru wanjye munyakibanda , nramuzi rero nicyo bishaka kuvuga . ||| peraudin was my bishop when i was a priest , he is the one who ordeined me . father peraudin was my superior in nyakibanda , what i mean is that i know him .
ehh ndetse nekuvuga pelode wenyine reka nvugae nagurae ikibazo nvugae ukuntu bavuga kiliziya gatorika . ||| let me not only talk about pedoli but the catholic church .
uruhare rwa kiliziya gatorika muri ibyo bintu byose by' ibikubara bibaye cyane cyane by' amacakubiri , by' inzangano zabaye mu banyarwanda baise amoko , ||| the role of the catholic church in all these things especially to with divisionism that happened amongst the rwandans which they called tribes .
ngira ngo nibyo byiza kuko kuvuga si pelode wenyine ni kuba ari kukabya ukavuga ngo ni pelode wenyine . ||| i think that is better because it would be an exageration if i only spoke of pelodi because he was not the only one involved .
ngira ngo nvuze mu kanya ukuntu igitekerezo cy' uko hari amoko atatu atandukanye cyane byanditswe mu bitabo byanditswe n' abapadiri ba mbere . ||| i told you a little while ago that the idea of there being three different tribes was written in books by the first priests .
nbibaeretse kimwe n' icya pages nkivuze ikindi n' icya arnold . ||| i showed them to you , one is by pages , another is by arnold .
ikindi n' icy' arasha n' icya ......... de l' axge . ||| the other is ... , the other i said is by father classe .
ikindi nvuze ni musenyeri classe uruhare yagize cyane cyane mu mu kuvuga kaogeza ko abatutsi bazi ubutegetsi no kuba yari yegereye ibyo musenyae umwami rutahigaw . ||| the major role he played is saying that the tutsi were good at leadership and the fact that he was close to king rudahigwa .
ndetse niwe utumye amuta niwe umutandukanyaije na n' umwamikazi kankazi . ||| he is the one who caused the king to leave queen kankazi .
rutahigaw aguma i nyanza ariko kugirango umwamikazi atazamugumaish mu bintu by' imitegekere by' iki by' umugabo we , bamuza bamwubakira ishyogwe hafi ya musenyeri classe ngo amuragirae amubuze kujya kuntuza umuhungu we , ibyo bitekerezo bishaje ehh . ||| rudahigwa remained in nyanza but in order for the queen not to stay involved in leadership of her husband , they built for her a palece in shyongwe close to father classe for him to guard her from infecting her son with old ideologies .
musenyeri classe rero bakavuga kera bavugaaga ndetse ko ari inshuti y' abatutsi . bikasa nkaho ari nkaho ehh aho bihindukiye rero abenshi bakavuga ngo pelode yabaye umwami yabaye mbese musenyeri w' abahutu niko bavuga cyane cyane . ||| they used to say that father classe was a friend of the tutsi while it seemed like peraudin was a father to the hutu
bakahera cyane cyane kw' ibaruwa yigeze kuandika yo ku y' igisibo yavugaaga ngo ................... ngo ibiganiro byose , urukundo ehh bakavuga n' ibindi byinshi ariko noneho iyo umuntu ajya kuvuga uruhare rw' umuntu agomba kuvuga ibintu biumvikana kandi by' ukuri iii ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| they based this in the letter he wrote during the fast saying that ... , love and many other things but when one is talking about the role of someone , he must speak things which are clear and honest .
njyae icyo nvuga muby' ukuri pelode ehh bamushyize muri urwo ruhande y' uko yagiye mugipa asa nkaho mbese yagiye mu gipande kidahuje n' icya musenyeri classe . ||| what i can honestly say is that pelodi was considered to be on that side because he opposed father classe .
habayeho musenyeri w' abatutsi habaho musenyeri w' abahutu niko bavuga ariko bakoze uko babiumvaaga niko nvuga na buri kihae . ||| they say that there was a priest for the tutsi and a priest for the hutu but they did what they felt like , that is what i always say .
ngira ngo igihe cya musenyeri pelode niko numvise bavuga ngo baramubwiye abakoroni bati wowe wa mugabo we dore hagiye kuba ubwigenge kandi abatutsi tubaciye , urabibona birangiye hitamo ufashe abatutsi nako ufashe abahutu kandi u u ufashe hasi abatutsi , ||| i heard them say that in the time of father peraudin , he was told by the colonialists that the rwandans were going to gain independence and the tutsi had been removed , like you see it 's over so chose to help tutsis , rather help the hutu and leave out the tutsi .
fasha hasi abatutsi ufashe abahutu wime ingoma ya gihutu utegekae u rwanda bikundae bi bikutunganaire . ||| he was told to help the hutu and not to give the leadersip of rwanda to the tutsi so as to make it suitable for you .
bamwe bakavu ngo ya yahisemo ibigezaweho wa mukani w' ikinyarwanda kiteye , icy' ingoma yimaan . ubwo rero hagati y' uko yabiemeye n' ibyo yakoze n' ibyo yakoze kumucira urubanza s' indi imaan . ||| some say that he chose what was on mode like the rwandans say ... that is what he did , i can not judge him because i 'm not god .
kikora icyo nbona cy' ukuri rero nvuga ntavugaiye pelode wenyine , n' uko bibaye koko hari abapadiri benshi bakoze bafatanyaije n' abakoroni bibwira bati nidutanga ubwi nihabaho ubwigenge bazairukana abakoroni ndetse bazairukana n' abapadiri ba missionnaire , urebye icyo gitekerezo barakigize buretse ko n' icyo kihae baranabivuze na henshi biraanditse . ||| however what i see that is true without deffending only peraudin , it 's the fact that it happened when they are many priests who were working together with colonialists thinking that if they grant them independence they will expel the colonialists as well as the missionaries , you see that had that ideology in that it was even said at that time and it is written .
kayibanda uretse no kuba umukristu yari n' umufratiri ye , yagiye yi yaragiye no ku yageze hafi yo kuba padiri . ||| kayibanda , besides being a christian , he was a brother , he was close to being a priest .
ubwo rero nabo ubashyira mu mu bantu bana ba kiliziya bakosheje . kayi , ||| so you can also include him amongst those members who wronged the church .
habyarimana nawe yabaye umuseminari ndetse yari afite na afite bashiki be ba babenebikira , ||| habyarimana was also a seminerian and he also had sisters who were nuns .
ise , ise yari ari umu catessiste yavuye , yavuye mu buganda i bufumbira azana n' abapadiri b' i rwaza baza no kushimira paroise ya rambura hanyuma aza mw' iseminari . ||| his father was a catechist , he was from uganda in bufumbira and he come with priests from rwaza , they even came to inaugurate the diocese of rambura and then he joined the seminary .
rero tuvuze ushyizemo kiliziya ko ye zu yagize ibintu bibi biri nawe arimo kuri urwo ruhande . ||| so if we said that the church wronged , jesus would be inclusive .
ntashaka kuvuga y' uko hari abana ba kiliziya rero babi koko bakoze ibintu by' amacakubiri ndetse bageza no muri genocide barabiteguye . ||| i just wanted to say that some members of the church are bad , indeed they did some things that brought divisions and they even got to a point of planning the genocide .
eh uraumva rero mu gipande cya cy' abaraique barimo n' abapadiri rero barimo . ||| so in the group of ... even priests are included .
tuvugae nkubwiye nk' urugero nkubu wenda ntanuwabitandukanya rwose n' ibi bya genocide ibi biri biratangiye genocide yari yaratangiye . ||| let 's say if i give you an example maybe you can n't differentiate it from the genocide , this had started way before the genocide .
ubungubu muzi ko hariho abapadiri nyine ba baciriwe n' urubanza by' ukuri arusha mwarabumvise bahamye n' icyaha cy' uko babigize . ||| you know that there are priests who were found guilty .
ndagirango nvugae amazina kuko ntinvuga amazina y' abantu batagize ruhamya kuko biba ari ugukosa . uraumva na pelode nanze kuerura rwose n' abapadiri nrabazi , nrabazi rwose nnjyae ubwanjye nzi rwose ariko ntawe nvuga nta nta kintu cya garagaye nravuga nk' ubu nyine nka arusha yemeje ko yaje akasenya kiliziya ye ari padiri mukuru akazaan ................... akagira atae . ||| i wanted to mention a few name because i can n't mention those who were not found guilty because it would be wrong .
mwumvise hariho ababikira bafungaiye mu bubirigi iii , hari abandi bafunzwe , hari abapadiri bafunzwe ntinmuhamya ariko hari abo nzi nnjyae ubwanjye hari nba uwari ugiye kunyicasha , kunyicisha njyewe ubwanjye . ||| you see i did n't want to sound sure about peraudin , and i even know other priests , i know them myself but i 'm not in position to mention any before evidence is revealed like before arusha confirms that he destroyed his church when he was the priest in charge ... you heard of nuns who are jailed in belgium , there are priests who are in jail , i can n't accuse him but there those i know myself who even wanted to have me killed .
ariko ntinvuga ngo muvugae kuko ntawaciye urubanza mwavuga muti urabeshya uhh . ||| but i can not mention him because he is not yet found guilty , you may say i 'm telling lies .
kuvuga rero y' uko ikindi rero tuvugae nko mu mu masengero mu kiliziya , uruhare rwa kiliziya nbabwira ru rugaragara ru ru runanbabaza njya nbivuga rwose , ||| let 's say like in churches , the role of the catholic church i 'm telling you that is obvious and makes me sad and i even say it .
nshi munbwirae n' uwabivuga akabisubiramo kandi nigeze kubivuga nrabasobanuraiye no muri kuri radio . ||| tell me , even if someone said it and repeated it , i mentioned it earlier and explained it on the radio .
tuvugae ibyabaye mu rwanda ahangaha tuvugae nk' igihe amategeko ya parmehutu yavugaaga kubyo baumvikana ko yanganaish abantu . ||| let 's talk about what happened in rwanda like during the time when the laws of parmehutu that talked about what agreed on .
tuvugae nk' igihe radio yavugaaga ikahamya y' uko hari umwanzi ufite izina . tuvugae nk' uko hari umusenyeri faucasse , ||| let 's talk about the time the radio gave confirmation that there is an enemy with a name .
mwaramwumvise nikwigize yavuze ngo mutu umututsi ni ni mubi muri kamere kandi azi ko kamere yaremye n' imaan , akaba nta muntu wigeze amuvuguruza muri abo basenyeri bose ngo agirae ati wo tusangiye imaan ntitusangiye ijambo ati ibyo birakabije . ||| let 's say like there is a bishop focas , you heard of him nikwize he said that a tutsi is naturally bad and he knows that character is created by god and no one disagreed amongst those bishops disagreed with him so that he says , one with whom we share god we do n't share a word , it 's exaggerating .
eh kaumva ko bashyizeho hariho nk' abanye hariho nk' impunzi zabayeho imyaka nnjyae nbayeho imya impunzi imyaka makumyabiri n' irindwi . ||| i was a refugee for 27 years , bishops used to write in books saying that there is no more room in rwanda , that those who left should look for room outside the country .
bakaandika abasenyeri mu mategeko baaka hari ibitabo bajya baandika bakavuga y' uko koko bemeza ko mu rwanda nta nta mwanya usigaye eh abagiye bakwaiye kubashakira imyanya hanze kandi urazi y' uko umuntu wese aba afite uburenganzira mu gihugu cye ahubwo iyo i gihugu kibuze aho kituza abantu kibashakira uko kibigenza . ||| you know that every has has right in his or her country , in fact if the country has nowhere to settle its people , it looks for a solution .
nko kaumva mbese nka radio rtlm yavugaaga abantu bayumva . ||| you would hear radio stations like rtlm saying such things like while people are listening .
ntibiigeze bibaho . nkanjyae rero nkavuga nti icyo ni ni ni n' ikintu kibi cyane kandi kirabahama . bande ? abantu ba kiliziya , ||| these things did not happen , like me saying that it is a bad thing or the church .
abantu kiliziya , abantu ba kiliziya . ariko uraumva ntabwo nvuze ngo kiliziya gatorika kusa nvuze abantu ba kiliziya nvuga ; abayivugair baba bakwaiye kuba barageze igihe bavuga bati ibi sibyo . ||| but you see that i have not said the catholic church only , i 'm saying the church as a whole , those who speak for the church should have , at a certain point said no.
iyo ubigenzuye rero n' ukuandika udupapurooo tuta ariko nta kintu kiumvikana kihamya kigira kiti twebwe aa kiliziya gatorika cyangwa se tuvugae mbese n' abakirisitu ngo tuvugae ngo ni missionni iyi n' iyi cyangwa se n' abapadiri bakoze inama , cyangwa se n' abakristu bakoze inama bageze uru uru mubya haru bwo bajya ba nka nka nka nk' ingendo zo kwamagana ikintu ngo wunvae ko abapadiri n' abakristu n' abantu bagize banri bagize mani manifeste , bagize ikintu cyo kujya kwamagana ahagaragara ibintu baraye baumvise muri radio , ntibiigeze bibaho . ||| when you take a close look , they were small writings but nothing solid reflecting that the catholic church or christians that a particular mission or that priests or christians had a meeting or a walk to show that priest , christians or other people manifested it , no one went and stood up against what they had previously heard on the radio .
ni bene nk' icyo kintu nicyo . naho nganaish rero y' uko kiliziya katurika wenda muri rusangae na no kubategetsi bayo . aho hantu habuze ikintu cy' ubutwari , cyo kuerura . ||| what i am saying is that the catholic church and their leadership were not brave .
yezu ya ya ya yajyaaga yaya yasangaaga baba bantuza hekaru akafata , akafata imigozi akakubita abantu ati insengero ry' imaan ; ahubwo biciye abantu mu masengero eh turaceceka turiruka kusa . uh turiruka kusa . ||| jesus would whip those who made the house of god unholy , in fact they killed people from churches and we simply kept quiet and run away .
simvuga ngo nt' abantu ba kiliziya babaya abatagatifu , simvuga ngo nt' abantu ba kilizi ; mbese bariho no mu basenyeri bariho , bariho babizize no mu byo nandika birimo . ||| i am not saying that there are no people in the church that were holy , they are there including amongst the bishops , there are those who rejected it and it 's there in what i write .
hari abavuze neza nka musenyeri bigirumwami turamuzi n' abandi benshi ariko muri rusangae nicyo ngaya ; ||| there are those who clearly said it like bishop bigirumwami and many others but in general that is what i despise .
tuvugae nko muri kiliziya katurika ikindi na hari abakosheje by' ukuri ariko bo n' abantu , n' abantu . aho rero hari ikintu nyine urebye tuba turebye mpora nbivuga tunaniwe . twebwe nrishyiramo kuko nnjyae ndi umuntu wa katurika kandi ndi umusaseridoti . ||| there are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where i always say we failed including myself because i am a catholic and a bishop .
uh tunaniwe ; tuba turagize nka petero mutagatifi tuti tukarira tuti tunaniwe umwanya wacu uh . ||| we failed , we could have been like saint peter and cried that we have failed in our place .
nigeze kuvuga muri radio hambaire batubaza , nravuga nti umva rero umuntu akushinze ubushyo nravuga kiliziya katurika , ||| i once spoke on the radio when we were being asked , i said that if someone ... meaning the catholic church ... they killed people while we were watching and what did we do ?
wishi akushinze ubushyo ikirura kikaza kikaburya , ikirura ni ni n' iki kibaye nyine . abo bose baishe abantu tureba tugira tutae . iyo unaniwe kukirwanya wenda ngo kinakuicae wa wunri ukusize inka iyo ukibonye ukirukira nta nta zinri yongera kukushinga . ||| if you fail to fight it until maybe it even kills you , the one who left you with his cow , whenever he sees you and you run away , will never leave with others again .
nibura avuga ko uri ikigwari twekuvuga ko , ||| at least he says you are useless , let 's not say anything more .
twekuvuga ibindi bikabije . aho niho nvuga ko yenda uruhare rwa kiliziya rubaye kandi hari ikintu cyagayitse mu by' ukuri biragaragara . ntinzi niba hari iki si ntakeka ko nta kintu nkaongera kirenze ibyo . ||| this is where i can say the role of the catholic church was and it was something which was openly rebuked .
bigendaaga bica abantu hirya no hino bihauriraan n' ukuntu nraza kubivuga no mu kanya nyine ; iby' inyenzi ziraje n' iki . ||| they used to go killing people here and there and there is a way they referred to them , i will talk about it in a few minutes , what did they mean by the cockroaches are coming ?
batangira kuica abantu hirya no hino ubona ko harimo kwimenyereza kugira ngo barebae niba ba bikunda niba hari uwabitinyuka , niba ntacyo bitwara , ||| they started killing people here and there and you could see that they are training to see it if can be possible , if there is someone who could do it without fear , if it would have no consequences or if it can actually happen .
niba bifata . uko nvuga mu magambo make rero , repubulika za mbere zombi zakurikije gahunda y' abakoroni ziranazuzuza zigenda zaiganaish muri genocide . ||| how i can say in few words then , at first both republicans followed the plan of colonialists and fulfilled it and went on towards genocide .
bivuga kuvangura k' umunya , umututsi atari umunyarwanda kandi ko akwaiye kupfa . ||| it means to separate rwandans , a tutsi is not rwandan and that he has to die .
kandi rero babishyiraho rero uburyo bamuvuga uko ameze , ko ari mubi , ku buryo bwose bamushyiraho ukuntu ari umuntu mubi cyane barabiigisha bijya mu nyigisho zose tuzi ariko zikaza zikaza zikaza zikaza zaumvaish ko atakwaiye kubaho . ||| and then they came up with a way of talking about him , the way he is , that he is bad , in all the ways they painted him to be a bad person and they taught it to others and it went into all kind of teachings that we know but they come to make it understandable that he does n't deserve to live .
mbese nvuga ko ari aho bigeze mu magambo nvuze mu magambo make cyane . ||| basically i can say that that 's where it reached in few words .
eh aho kuri za repubulika mpafite ikibazo . iyo urebye repubulika ya mbere n' iya kayibanda . ||| i have a question on the republics , when you look at the first republic and the one of kayibanda .
kayibana yahawe ubutegetsi urebye n' ababirigi b' abakoroni . kayibanda ntabwo yamazeho igihe habyarimana aramuhirika . ||| kayibanda was given power by the belgian colonialists . kyibanda was there for some time then habyarimana toppled him .
noneho njyae ikintu ahangaha nshaka kusa nk' umuntu uhoze ariko nrebye n' ibi n' ubuzima muri genocide icyenda na kane , hari ukuntu kayibanda yahawe ubutegetsi n' ababirigi akayoboraan n' ababirigi ariko habyarimana aje ageze ku butegetsi , ||| then the only thing i want here as someone who was there but when i look at this and the life in the genocide of 1994 , there is a way kayibanda was given the power but he would rule with them but when habyarimana come to power , when he toppled it .
aho abuhirikaiye we ubayeho umuntu ubanye n' abafaransa . ||| he had lived with french people .
n' ibintu bibiri ; ababirigi nibo basa n' abantu ba cree ikintu cyo cy' urwangano mu banyarwanda hazamo amacacubiri abantu batangira kuryana . ||| there are two things ; belgians look like the people who created that thing of hatred among rwandese , conflicts started and people started fighting each other .
noneho nyuma ya repubulika ya kayibanda hari ukuntu binacecetse ubona ko rwose ububiligi busa nkaho nta kintu bukoze mu rwanda ahubwo noneho habyarimana azana ubutegetsi nabwo burimo ibintu by' amayobera n' ubugome bwinshi ariko abanye n' abafaransa ari nabo baje kugira uruhare mu mu myiteguro ya genocide muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 94 ) . ||| then after the republic of kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in rwanda and then habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the french who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 .
kuburyo n' uyu munsi ubona ikintu cy' ubufaransa aricyo kihawe ubugome bwabo cyangwa se no kufatanya n' abantu kutegura genocide nibyo bihawe intebe cyane kurusha ababiligi kandi aribo bazanye ikintu nvuga ko aribo bazanye biriya bintu . ||| in a way , up to today you see how the french were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all .
ibyo nta kintu ubitubwiraho . ||| is there anything you can say about that ?
eh icyo n' iki n' ikibazo cyiza rwose kuko njyaaga nbitekereza cyane . ||| that 's really a good question because i used to think about it a lot .
koko ababiligi bamaze kutsindwa kubu ku bukoroni nyine babwambuwe , abazungu bagiye b' abategetsi . ||| it 's true after the belgians were defeated during colonialism ; it was taken away from them , the white leaders left .
abafaransa barabi bashaka kubiganzura . mbese bashaka ku kutabutanga bwose . ||| the french wanted to take over . basically they did n't want to give it all up .
naho abafaransa bafite amayeri y' uko na ibihugu byose bagiye ba bakoroniza , bayitanga batayitanze . barayitanga ariko rero bashyiraho ikintu kisa nk' ikityo cyabo , ||| even if the french have many tricks , all the countries they colonised they gave them up without truly giving them up .
kisa nk' ikiganza cyabo batajya kihora ; ||| they put something which seemed like their hand that was always there .
bakasanga nyine akomo . ||| they looked for something the belgians seemed to have failed at , that is how i view it .
urabona ibihugu byose byakoronijwe n' abafaransa , ||| but the french people worked together with habyarimana and even others .
barayitanga kandi bakayitanga batayitanze . bakashaka ikintu ababiligi bari bashushe nkaho batsinzwe niko nbiumva . ariko abafaransa bafatanya na habyarimana ndetse n' abandi mu by' ukuri abafaransa uko bimeze n' abanyabwenge batanga , ||| truly french people , the way it is , are wise who are generous .
ababiligi batanze independence basa nkaho bayitanze birangiye baragendakizatuma bahora bahari , bazayikoresha abategetsi b' abirabura cyangwa se bo muri asia kuko naho hari abategetsi ariko bahari . ||| when belgians granted independence it looked like they have given it out and nothing behind it but there would be something that would keep them around , they used the black leaders or the ones from asia because there are leaders but they were still there too .
hano rero mu rwanda no mu burunri no muri congo ndetse . ||| here and in burundi and in congo as well .
ababiligi kuko ari agahugu katoye bayitanze bayitanze ariko abafaransa bati a non non hoya ntabwo ushobora ku kugira ngo bagendae birangirae kandi congo irimo ibi irimo amafunguro . ||| because belgium is a small country when they granted it they meant it but the french were thought that you can n't just let them go just like that yet congo has riches .
baraza barabasimbura rero , abafaransa rero bashaka ukuntu basimbura ababiligi ahari ururimi rw' igifaransa kugira ngo babaomekae ku binri bihugu by' abafaransa nyine . ||| they came and replaced them , the french wanted a way of replacing belgians because of the french language so as to add them on other french countries .
noneho rero noneho tusubirae nyine mu tusae nk' aho tusanze n' abakoroni na n' ibihugu byo bya koronijwe n' abafaransa bya kera . ||| so let 's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by french long ago .
uraumva nu ni nk' akantu kuko basimbuye ababiligi ariko kugira ngo bekutureka ngo tugende . ||| it 's like they replaced belgians so that they do n't just let us go .
ni nk' aho mbese basimbuye kandi ntibabiumvikanyeho uuhh pardon !! ntibabiumvikanyeho n' ubungubu ndetse baracyahigitse . ||| it 's as if they replaced them yet they had n't agreed on it . they did n't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that .
iteka n' iyo tutaumvikana n' abafaransa burya ababiligi ntibabianze cyane , bituma bagaruka bati mwadutwaye imbehe . ||| actually whenever we disagree with the french , belgians do n't mind it , it makes them come back saying they got they took their place .
ngirango niko njyae nbiumva ntinbitekereje cyane . ||| i guess that 's how i understand , it i did n't really think much about it .
ababiligi baragiye ariko abafaransa baanga ku nk' uko bataigeze bagira iyo bajya rwose ariko bagira bati noneho ubwo ababiligi bagiye reka na kariya kantu tukasubizae mu mufuka wacu . ||| belgians left but the french refused since they did not go anywhere at all , instead they said this time since belgians are leaving . let 's put that little thing back in our pockets .
w' aba francophone mbese . ||| basically the francophone 's .
babwira habyarimana bati uu icya mbere wowe uri umwana muto , n' igifaransa wa mugabo we . ||| they told habyarimana that first all you are still young , it 's french language now .
baramwiyegereza baramuryoshyaryoshya baraza baramuha bati ngwino . ||| they got close to him and convienced himto come .
ikindi rero humura ni n' ubwenge bugiye kuza rero bagira bati ikindi rero n' ukurwanya abatutsi nibo bari kuanga kutanga independence nta kinri , biri byoroshye . ||| they told him not to worry that they were bringing wisdom and they were going to fight against the tutsi , they are the ones who do n't want to grant independence and there is nothing else , it was easy .
habyarimana nawe ya ya ntacyo yabarwanyaagaho kuko yagiraaga ati muri abantu beza , tuvuga igifaransa . ||| habyarimana as well had nothing against them because he used to say that you are nice people , we speak french .
ngirango n' uko abafaransa basimbuye ababiligi kugira kandi bakatutwara muri abo ba francophone habyarimana akabiishimira bakamuha amata ngira ngo niko nbiumva . uhh ||| i think it 's because french people replaced belgians and made us francophones . habyarimana was pleased with them and they would give him all he needed , that 's how i understand it .
hari ikindi kintu bakunda abantu bakunda kuvuga kuri kayibanda cyane kuba yarafatanyaije n' abazungu ko we atari umunyarwanda akaba kuica aba abanyarwanda ntacyo biri bimubwiye . ||| there is something else that people say so often about kayibanda . the fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not rwandese and killing rwandans meant nothing to him .
noneho yitwaza icyo kintu cyo kuteranya abahutu n' abatutsi afatanyaije n' abazungu . ||| then he used it to bring conflicts among the hutu and tutsi with the help of the white man .
kayibanda koko ntabwo yari umunyarwanda ? ||| kayibanda was really not rwandan .
ntiyari umututsi ntiyari n' umuhutu kuko atari umunyarwanda . ||| he was neither tutsi nor hutu because he was not rwandan .
kubateranya rero akabaryamishya afatanyaije n' abazungu , we numva ntacyo biba bimutwaye . ||| to start conficts among themselves , with help of white people , i think it was fine with him .
ntacyo biri bimutwaye ariko uraumva nti ntiyari kuvuga ko ntibiri byoroshye kugira ngo avugae ngo nd' umunyamahanga nje kuteranya wenda we niwe urikugira ati nawe nturi umunyarwanda ibyo byo , ||| it was fine with him but , he was n't going to say it because it would not be easy to say he was a foreigner and he is bringing conflicts .
yagombaaga kubihisha ngirango . ||| maybe he is the one who would be the one to say that you are not rwandan too however , he was supposed to hide that i think .
wenda nti ntiyarabianze nti yara ariko ntinzi niba kuba yaravuye i bukavu aribyo biri bimuhimbaje . ||| maybe he did n't mind it but i do n't think the fact that he was from bukavu was enough for him .
eh siho nvuga . ||| that 's what i 'm saying .
nravuga ko we yumvaaga ko icya mbere ntiyari umuhutu ntiyari n' umututsi . ||| i am saying that he felt like first of all he was not hutu neither was he tutsi .
kuteranya abanyarwanda afatanyaije n' abazungu , kuri we yumvaaga abanyarwanda bamaraanye ntacyo bimutwaye . biba ... ||| to create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him .
oya si wewe ushatse ubivuga ariko ngirango sicyo cy' ingenzi muby' ukuri , sicyo cy' ingenzi , sicyo cy' ingenzi . ||| no , it 's not him . if you want you can say it but i think it 's not the important thing really , it 's not important .
ngirango abatutsi , hinga nkubwirae impamvu cyane cyane abatutsi icyo yabangiye . ||| i guess tutsi , let me tell you the good reason especially why he disliked the tutsi .
ise yaraje ahakwa kwa birasa , wenda bamufashe nabi , birashoboka ko afite ikintu cyo kuvuga ko abatutsi bamusuzuguye . vuga uwo mututsi wenda umutwaye cyangwa se umuhatse simbizi . ||| his dad came and served birasa , maybe he was mistreated , it 's possible that he has something against the tutsi who disrespected him , maybe the tutsi who his chief or his master , i do n't know .
ikindi rero hari ikintu mu by' ukuri kayibanda yatumye yanga abatutsi n' uko mutabizi yarwaye ikintu , nrabizi yagize amateka mabi mw' ishuli yarwaraaga isundwe uraumva . kayiba nrabizi byo kayibanda yarwaraaga isundwe . ibyo kuanga abatutsi byo bifite ikintu biturukaho . ||| another thing , there is something that made kayibanda hate the tutsi , only that you do n't know but he suffered from something , i know he had bad background in the school , he suffered from ............... , you can imagine ...... the hatred of tutsis had it 's origin .
yarwaraaga isundwe , hanyuma rero isundwe ku mw' ishuli ariko ibyo ntinzi si byo si ntibiri bikwiriye kuvugaw ahangaha . ||| he was sick of ........ , then that sickness of ..... in school but that one i 'm not sure if it was supposed to be mentioned here .
yarwaraaga isundwe hanyuma baba bityo ntabwo ari byiza cyane . ||| he used to fall sick of ..... but then really it 's not something good .
icyo nzi n' uko mw' ishuli padiri , ba musenyeri pelode ndi padiri ii nramuzi nsa nkaho nmutegetse nnjyae kera . ||| what i know is that in school , the priest , the bishops , i am a priest so i know peraudin it 's like i was his boss some time back .
ikintu cyo kusuzugura yaracyangaga rero . ||| he really did n't like being disrespected .
kuvuga rero ng' abatutsi barasuzugura n' ikintu igihe cy' ubukoroni kiri kirakwaiye , barakikwaije ngo abatutsi barasuzura , icyo kintu yaracyangaga rero . ||| so to say that the tutsi used to be disrespectful is something that was common in the time of colonialism , they spread it all over that the tutsi were disrespectful , so he did n't like it .
kuvuga rero ngo yarabateranyaije ngo ni ni bene rubanda , ||| that 's why he created conflicts among them , saying he is not part of them and they are actually not even his brothers , so let them all die .
awa n' ubundi sibene mama barakashira . erega nago na habyarimana ubishatse ubivuga ibyo kibazo barakivuga . erega nawe n' umunyamahanga nimba utabizi , nawe n' umufumbira . ||| any way , if you want you can even say that with habyarimana , those issues are mentioned . he is also a foreigner if you do n't know , he is a mufumbira .
ese uri uziko a aba ijambo ubufumbira , a uziko abakozi bo mu gikoni b' abatetsi babaita abafumbira . ||| did you know the meaning of the word mufumbira , do you know that the kitchen helpers who are cooks are called the bafumbira .
byatuuruutseee ( araseka ) kuri se wa habyarimana . ||| it started with his father , he came from the bufumbira land and came as a cook of the priests , it went on and that 's how they called them bafumbira .
yavuye i bufumbira aza ari umukozi wo mu gikoni cy' abapadiri eh bi b' irambura ba babaita abafumbira batyo ni ba bakozi baitwa abafuuumbiiira ( araseka ) bib' ufumbira . ||| they are helpers called bafumbiras from bufumbira .
wa ushatse uvuga nawe ngo ngo yateranyaije abanyarwanda kuko atari umunyarwanda ariko ibyo n' ukukabya , n' ukukabya . ||| if you want you can also say that brought conflicts among rwandans because he 's not rwandan but that would be exaggerating .
yarabateranyaije mu by' ukuri kugirango abonae ubutegetsi , nta ntawabivuga ngo yabigize kuko ntiianze ko abanyarwanda bicana . ||| he actually brought conflicts so he can have the power , no one can say that he did because he did n't go against the killings among rwandans .
njyae ntinmenya ko iyo ariyo mpamvu y' ukuri . ||| i too can n't tell if that 's the true reason .
njyae simbyemeza rwose . eh ||| i can n't confirm that .
ngirango mwakomeza mutubwira ku bitero by' impunzi abazize kuitwa ibyitso byazo ese byo baje kugenda bite ? ||| i think you can go on telling us about the attacks of the refugees . the ones who died because of being called their agents , how did it go ?
ngirango nabyo biba biri mubyukuri jenocide nyirizina ya mirongo icyenda na kane .... ||| i think even that would be part of it , truly , the genocide of 1994 itself ...
ngirango naho rero habyarimana nabambari be n' amashyaka yanri bahuje umugambi wuko basangira ubutegetsi baciye mu mishyikirano ya arusha ngirango nuko arusha yaje ngirango nuko ibintu byo kutegura jenocide bije kuza nyine gato gato imbarutso yabyo kuko bigize igihe habyarimana yemera ariko ukabona yuko ataemeye bakabivuga nawe akabivuga akora ibipapuro abandi bakagenda bakabivuga bati tugiye kutegura jenocide ukabona barasinye ariko badasinye . ||| i think that that is when habyarimana and his followers and the other political parties that had the same ideology of sharing the power went to the peace talk of arusha , as whole planning of genocide went on slowly by slowly up to the time it was triggered , it reached a point where habyarimana accepted but you could see that he did n't really accept , they said it and he said it in writings , others said that they were going to plan a genocide and then you could see them sign papers without meaning it .
bagasinya badasinye usanga arusha mbese mubyukuri ariyo yasukumye imbarutso ............ indege ya habyarimana bahanuye urebye rero simbizi urebye ntinzi uwayihanuye niba yagaragara ariko nagirango aho kuanga tuvuze za mpunzi zashatse kusubira mugihugu bikananira zikashyiraho ingufu bakashaka ukuntu ingufu zitakora bakashyiraho imishyikirano nayo bikagera igihe imishyikirano bayanze bagira bati nti tusangira n' impunzi nti tusangira n' inkotanyi reka noneho tushakae ukuntu tuzinesha .... nbazifasha ibyitso byazo biri ariko imbarutso yabyo rero nuku nbazifasha banri naya mashyaka . ||| they signed without signing ; basically you find that arusha is the one that pushed the trigger ..... so the plane of habyarimana which was blown up i really do n't know who did it wish he could be known but i wanted that instead of the refugees that wanted to go back in the country and it could n't happen and they applied force then they looked for a way force should not be used and they started peace talk which also reached a point and they rejected it saying that they can n't share with refugees , we can n't share with inkotanyi so let 's look for a way of defeating them .... with those who help them and their agents . but its starting point then is cause even the others who help them are these political parties .
tudahuje ...... ariko imbarutso yabyo ni ugutikuramo iturufu y' indege ya habyarimana uwayigize rero simuzi ariko uwo muntu agombae kuba ariwe ushakaaga yuko kuturitsa isasu rya mbere rya jenocide yeeeeeeeeeeee . ||| .... but the trigger of it all is the pretext of the plane of habyarimana , i do n't know who did it but whoever it is must have been the one who wanted to bust the first bullet of the genocide ...
ngirango aho ngaho niba hari ikindi kibazo ngirango naho umuntu yaba ahinaiye niyo mpamvu ngirango ya jenocide yikubitiro wenda ukaza kuvuga abayishakaaga nabatayishakaga niki abayishakaaga rero murabaumva abayishakaaga nibandae ? ||| i think that there if there is any other problem , i think even if someone can be can be cutting short the reason for the beginning of genocide i think , maybe you come to talk about those who wanted it and those who did n't want it . so you can understand who wanted it .
abayishakaaga hehehe ni mrnd n' abantu be abantu be ni bande ? ni ba sdr mubyukuri nibo bashatse ibyo byose mubihae byose abari bamuri inyuma bamufashije nyine abakoroni . ||| who are those who wanted it ? they are sdr members , in real sense they are the ones who wanted all that in all times the ones who were behind him , who actually helped him were colonialists .
ubwo rero ngirango ............. ||| so i wanted to ...
bakavuga bati ni umu ethiopia bati inzira y' ubusamo ni nyabarongo ntihagirae induru ivuga bati ibyo bintu birakatsindwa ikisigaye nukureba niba bishoboka koko . ||| they would say that he is an ethiopian and the short cut is through the river nyabarongo , and no one made a sound . condemning things , what was left was to check if it 's really possible .
....... bagerageza bakakozaho ngo barebae koko niba bianga ubaw mbere barabanje kayibanda akitangira babakuye barabimuye ..... yatangiye agirango agirae zone tutsirande ... na huturande ntiyari aziko bikunda kubica kandi koko ntibiri kukunda iyo logista ataza n' abazungu ngo bahagurukae kuko bari baziko bishoboka bagiye rero bakora imyitozo buhoro buhoro n' abantu bari baziko bizira barabitinyuka burya niko bigenda icyo umuntu yatinye akagenda akitinyuka ukagirango ahari nugikora inkuba irakukubita ntikukubitae . ||| ..... they tried fighting back to see if really would n't work out the first time they started . when kayibanda had just started they got them out and made them shift .... he started by trying to make an area for the tutsi only .... and hutu , he did n't know that it would be possible to kill them and it 's true it would n't be possible if logist had n't come and white man had n't stood up because they knew that it was possible . they went on planning it slowly by slowly and even the people who thought it was horrible started doing it , actually that 's what happens ; what someone was terrified of goes on finding it normal and one could think that maybe when you do it you will be struck by thunder and when you do it nothing happens .
akizawe no kurangiza wa mukani mubi uko bagenda bakora amaraso bamenyera batinyuka iyo umuntu rero amaze kumenyera kuica amaraso ageraho akayamenyera akamera nk' igisimba bageze igihe .......... ||| like the ending to the other bad saying ; the more they shed blood , the more you get used to it and become fearless , when one gets so used to killing , it reaches a point where he is used to blood and he becomes like an animal , it 's high time .....
eeeeeeeeehhh gacaca ya kera ni yubu ntibishobora kuba kimwe kuberako ikintu cya jenocide nti kigeze kibaho kera ibyabagaho ibijya kusa nka gacaca habaaga inama ..... tuvugae nk' urubanza rw' imiryango . ||| traditional courts ( gacaca ) of long ago and the ones of today can n't be the same because genocide ideology never existed then . what existed similar to gacaca , there used to be a meeting .... let 's say like a judgement of the communities .
umuntu k' umuntu ariko habaaga iyo bagira imbabazi bakahora insina ni ukuvuga ............. bakayitema ikaba isimbuye umuntu ariko umuryango ubaishe usabaaga imbabazi ukatanga ikiru n' impongano hanyuma rero rya tegaeko ryo kuhora ryo kuica umuryango wishe bahorera uwabo bakahora insina uraumva rero kera harimo ibyo bintu byinshi kuhana icyaha nuwakoze icyaha n' imbabazi bibagaho ari ibyo ngibyo bibiri urebye no mubyubungubu nabyo birimo byombi birimo gacaca ifitemo icyambere cyuko batagomba kaorohair tuvugae mbese nukogeza nkuko babigiraaga hambaire . ||| one by one but there times they would have mercy and revenge on bananas meaning ... they would cut it down and then it replaces someone but the family that killed would ask for forgiveness and ... and then the other law if revenging by killing the family in the name of revenging for theirs , they take it to the bananas so you can understand that long time many of those things existed , to punish crime and the criminal and forgiveness existed and these two still exist up to today . gacaca firstly has a fact that they should not go easy on them as in not praising them like they used to do before .
birangiye bigeze igihe rero bavugako umututsi birangiye agomba kupfa ariko nibagiwe ..... harya tuvugaaga iki ? ||| it got a point and they said that it 's over for any tutsi , that he should die , i have forgotten ...... where were we ?
turi turi kuri gacaca turimo tuyigereranya na gacaca yahozeho niyubu niba koko mubyukuri gacaca ishobora kuzabyara umusaro ushobora kutuma umuryango nyarwanda wiyubaka nkuko biri biri ? ||| we were on gacaca comparing the gacaca before and that of today , if it 's true that gacaca will be productive and make the rwandan community rebuild itself
eeeeeeeehhhh naho ......... uraumva nyine ibya kera si kimwe ubu noneho tuvuga tuti ubu se bizakunda ? ||| yes .... you understand old time things are not the same so we can say that would it be possible ?
kaunga noneho tuvugae no kuhana icyambere no kuhana ubwabyo birimo bariya bantu mujya mubiumva harimo kuhana no kaunga ........ hari abantu bafite icyo kintu cyo kuvuga ngo gacaca nti ihana ababiteye ntibahanawe nicyo kibazo kaumva rero nvugaaga iby' inzego nibyo biri binshitse ko nri ndi no muba ...... inzego niko kantu kari kanshitse mu kanya nravuga nti ababiteye nicyo gacaca iruhijeho ...... abenshi ntibibageraho abahanaw cyane ni abakoreshaijew . ||| to reconcile then we can even say punishing first all even punishing itself involves those people you hear it sometimes , it includes punishing and reconciling ... there some people who have that thing of saying that gacaca does n't punish the ones who caused it are not punished that 's the problem , the fact that i was talking about . i had forgotten about the levels of leadership that i was actually part of the ..... levels of leadership is what i had forgotten just ... are the ones who were used .
ngo ababiteye ni bande nabo hejuru nyine .... habyarimana uwamuhannye ninde wenda uwamuhanuye niwe umuhannye ariko hari benshi babaicunze tuvugae ababafashije simbavuga amazina simvuga ngo nrabavumba ntacyo nbavumbaho ariko ...... ababafashije murabazi baravugaw mu binyamateka niki . ||| who are those who caused it they are the ones on top .... who punished habyarimana maybe whoever that warned him is the one who punished but they are many who followed it closely let 's say the ones who helped them i 'm not saying their names so they do n't think i need anything from them , i do n't need anything from them but .... those who helped them are known and they are mentioned in the news papers
abafashije interahamwe na baishe bose kuica baravugaw abenshi ntibahanaw bari kure bafite amaboko ujya wunva arusha abenshi abo irega ntibaboneka bakabuga n' abandi bari mubufaransa ntibashyikairw nibo babizanye kandi baigishije ya madini hari abo nhoze nvuga ..... ababiigishije nnabavuze bamwe babianditse mubitabo babaitoje abana mu mashuri bavuga ko umututsi ari mubi abo bose nibo bakwaiye kuhanaw kurusha abandi bazabakura he ? ||| those who helped interahamwe and the ones who helped in the killings are known many are not punished they are far they have means sometimes you hear arusha many of those are not even seen kabuga and the others are in france and they can n't be reached they are the ones who started it and they even sensitized the churches they some of them that i 've mentioned .... those who sensitized it that i 've mentioned some of them even wrote it in the books they taught it to children in schools saying that a tutsi is bad all those are the ones who deserve to be punished more than the others where will they get from ?
nicyo uraumva rero biraruhije ariko rero ibyo aribyo byose ibibi birarutaan . ||| but you understand that it 's hard whatever the case i will chose the lesser evil .
gacaca niwo muti ushobotse kandi mwiza nako kaunga byo biraumvikana ....... kuvuga rero ni ukuvuga ngo iyo uvuze ngo abahutu bose baraishe nangae rimwe na rimwe hari ubwo nbivuga nkekako ari nkibyo ukagira uti ...... twe tugiye hariya turahagurutse turemezako turi abahutu kandi turanzeko batusiga icyaha twebwe tugiye kugiye kugira agatsiko kabahutu kemezako ibyo tutabiemera tubiitandukanije kandi turabirwanya abantu batuhemukaiye bantuza izina ryacu ....... ||| gacaca is the only possible and good solution rather to reconcile is understandable .... then to say something is to say that when you say that all hutus killed even me sometimes i say it once in while there are times i say it thinking it 's just a saying .... us who are going there we stand up confessing that we are hutus and we refuse to be painted black us we are going to have a group of hutus that confesses that they do n't agree with that and we separate ourselves from it and we are against it the people who betrayed us messed up our name
hariho abantu bitazavamo icyabiteye rero ntintakimenya kuki hari abantu umuhutu batoje ko ineza ye ariko umututsi atabaho . ||| there are those it will n't come out of , i do not know yet what caused it , why is there a hutu who was made to feel that his purpose is that a tutsi should not live ?
mwarimo mutubwira ibintu bya gacaca . ||| you were telling us about gacaca
ibintu bya gacaca nbona bizarushya mubyukuri ibyinshi izabigeraho . ||| gacaca will be better and it will arrive at the desired goal
mubyukuri gacaca niyo nvuze ko ariwo muti urushobotse . ||| honestly gacaca was the best prescription
kandi nkeka ko ari nawo mwiza rwose hari ibitazashoboka ngirango bizaruhanya . ||| and it 's the best , they are some things that will not be possible or that will be difficult
ngirango nayo itazashora ngirango bizashoboraw n' igihe no kugumya kuigisha . ||| but this will be solved with time continues to teach .
no kuzaumva nyine ko ntacyo imaze nbabifite bakazabifamo nicyo kintu cy' urwango ubwo burozi . ||| and to feel that it 's not important as even to those who have will die in it , that 's where the hatred and the poison
kuko atazamara yasiga ari umwe nta jenocide yumva izabaho icyo kintu kizamuhoramwo . ||| because he feels that the genocide can not happen , and that feeling remains in him
uwo muti ngirango niwo gacaca itazabona vuba uzatangaw nibihae n' abantu niki ......... ||| that state of heart will not be attained very soon by the gacaca , it will come with time , people and so on
noneho rero nringiye nti kumukani nkuko mwabivuze ngo uzatangaw n' ibihe . ||| like the story goes , that he who time leaves behind ...
izo generation zagiye zihura n' ikibazo cyo kuigishwa ubwicanyi igihe kirekire . ||| those generations were taught to kill for a long time
ngirango ziri kugenda zivaho niko nvuga kuko ubu abavuka uyu munsi barimo baraigishwa ibintu byiza abandi nabo baigishijwe ibintu bibi barimo barasaza . ||| i think it changing because now those that are being born today are being taught good things and those that were taught bad things are growing old
ubwo noneho nboneraeho nbaze ikibazo cya nyuma tunasoza ibyo aribyo byose tukeneyeko nyuma ya jenocide . ||| i would thus like to ask the last question then we shall wind up , that 's all we will need . after the genocide
y' igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda na mirongo icyenda na kane buri muntu uwo ari we wese uyibayemo . ||| of 1994 , everyone who was present
kugeza uyu munsi ukiriho yifuza ko yaba murwanda noneho rubanye neza rutarimo amacakubiri . ||| who is alive today wishes to live in a rwanda that is harmonious without any divisionism
kuzaubaka cyangwa kuzaba mu rwanda rumeze neza rutarimo amacakubiri niyihe message mwaha abo bana . ||| will develop or become a rwanda that 's doing well without any segregation . what message can you give those children
ko aribo rwanda rwejo kuburyo izabasha kaubaka u rwanda rutarangawmo amacakubiri ? ||| since they are the future of rwanda on how they will be able to build a rwanda that is not characterised by any form of segregation
uraumva nta messaga yakatangaza nba nfite nawe utazi tuesae tutazi icyo nreba nugukurikiza icyo nreba nugukurikiza inyigisho tuhabwa . ||| there is no message i can give that you do not know about , what i see is that we should follow what we are taught
n' ubutegetsi buriho ubungubu buvugako tuva inda imwe tugomba kutahairiza kumugozi umwe . ||| by our leaders that says that we have the same origin and are related so we should be one
kandi tukabona ifunguro ridukawiye tuesae kenshi na kenshi bya binri byamacakubiri bavuga ngo abasangira ubusa . ||| and we get the satisfaction that we deserve , most of the time that stuff about segregation was said those who did not share
bitana ibisambo bikakubitairho nyine ko amadiri tuyayobotse yose . ||| and called each other greedy
mubyukuri byose nugufiritira ngo tuvae inda imwe turemye n' imaan imwe cyane n' abakirisitu nibo benshi nhoze nbivuga . ||| honestly , it is all just talk that we are related and al created by one god , especially the christians who are many like i was saying
abakosheje benshi barimo nbaemera imaan intaho nimawe n' imaan tuzasanga . ||| many of those that believed in god committed crimes ,
ni amashuri nirwo ruhongore urebye ni naho abantu bagomba kwigishiriza bakomeje ubumwe . ||| it 's education that most important and that 's where people are taught unity
hanyuma utanbiumva bakamufasha kubiumva , abatabyumva neza ..... nge niko nbiita . ||| and whoever does n't understand , they help him understand , those that do not understand ... that 's what i can call it
murakoze . ||| thank you
twagirango tukubaze uko genocide yatangiye , uko mwahamagawe , uko mwitabiriye , uko ugiye mu bitero cyangwa se uwo uba urabashije kukubita akapfa mbese ukatusobanurair uko ubibonye ||| we would like to ask you what happened during the genocide ; how you were called , how you responded , how you joined the attackers troops or if there is some one you strungled to death , generally tell us how you saw it .
nitwa bamporiki emmanuel , nkaba ntuye mu karerae ka nyamata , mu murengae wa kibungo mu ntara ya kigali ngari . ||| my name is bamporiki emmanuel i live in nyamata district in kibungo sector in the province of kigali rural .
nkaba ndi umugabo wubaatse ufite umwana umwe n' umudamu umwe , nkaba nfite imyaka 31 y' amavuko . ||| i am married and i have one child , and i am 31 years old .
nk' umuntu uri utuye ku murengae wa kibungo mbere ... mu ntiambara ya 1994 , ntinri nrwaye , ||| i witnessed every thing that took place in kibungo .
nri muzima ni ukuvuga ko ibyahabaye byose ... hafi ya byose nabikurikiranaga nkamenya ku ijoro n' umunsi uko bimeze . iriya ntiambara yabayeho koko , ||| i followed up whatever happened during the day and in the night in that area in 1994 .
ndetse nza kuyigiramo uruhare , ndetse yitabairw n' abantu benshi ; yibasair ubwoko bumwe bw' abatutsi turi tuturanye . ijya kutangira ariko hakaba harabayeho isansilizwa ( sensibiliser ) ku buyobozi buri ku murengae , ||| it is true that there was a war in 1994 and i must admit that i participated in this war with other different people with the object of killing tutsis and finishing them completely .
ndetse haza kuifashaishw inzego za gisirikare , kuko hari abasirikare bagize uruhare mu kubwira abaturage ngo baitabaire ubwicanyi . ndetse n' inzego za gipolisi kuko hari bamwe na bamwe bari abapolisi z' ikiitwaaga commune icyo kihae bagaragaye muri ubwo bwicanyi . ||| but before that , the local leaders had sensitized the locals to participate in the killing together with the help of the soldiers , who were later joined by the policemen in the sensitisaton .
ndetse bagaragaye mu gusansibiliza mu baturagae , ko umututsi agomba kupfa ndetse biba ngombaw n' ibyo atunze bikaribwa , ||| all those leaders tried to persuade citizens to kill tutsis .
kuko nta yinri nkurikizi yari kuzabaho cyangwa ngo bibae bikurikiraanw . ku ruhande rwanjye ngarukae inyuma gatoya rero . ||| and if anything , to destruct all their properties and they assured us that no one would accuse us or follow up their cases . i will start by telling you what happened in that area .
nk' umunyarwanda uri utuye hafi aho ngaho , ku itariki ya 09/04/1994 kuri uyu murengae wa kibungo ahanini niho ubwicanyi butangiye , ||| generally the massacre started on the 9th .
kuko nibuka ko umugabo umwe uri utuye hafi ahangaha , niho yasenyewe amazu yitwaaga ndengeyinka icyo kihae aranatotezaw . ||| if i remember well it is when ndengeyeinka 's house was destroyed . they even tortured him .
noneho ku itariki ya 10/04/1994 birakomeza , ||| on the 10th the massacre continued .
ubwo abaturage bo kuri uyu murengae bamwe na bamwe babifashijwemo n' abo bayobozi bari bafite intwaro za gisirikare nvuze haruguru , bagabye ... tugabye igitero , ahantu kuri centre ya nyarunazi . ||| some villagers from this area , together with the help of soldiers , attacked a certain centre called nyarunazi .
icyo gitero kigwamo abantu benshi , ||| so many people lost their lives in that attack .
ndetse nraibukamo amazina ya bamwe , ||| i can remember some of their names .
harimo umuturage uri uhatuye witwa ndekezi , uwitwa bikino , uwitwa sango ; n' uwitwa rubangisa . ||| there was ndekezi , bikino , sango and rubangiza .
bigaragarae rero ko abaturage bari bamaze kucengeraw n' ubwicanyi koko by' ukuri ; ndetse bazi ikibajyanye , kuko bagendaaga bazi ikibajyanye ko kuri ukuhiga umututsi . ||| in that time you could see that people knew what they were doing and they did it with all their efforts .
ntibiciraiye aho rero , ku itariki 14/04/1994 nibwo i ntiarama ku kiliziya , tugabyeyo igitero kikomeye cyane . ariko mbere yo kugira ngo kigabaweyo habanje kuba ihauriraan ry' masegiteri yari agose ntiarama ; ||| it did not stop there , on the14th april in 1994 .
n' ukuvuga kibungo , kanyenze , rurindo na musenyi . ||| that was when we attacked ntarama at the church .
ndetse yemwe n' abavuye mu nkengero z' aka karerae , ndetse yemwe n' abavuye mu zinri ntara . nvuga nk' abaturage bavaaga mu ntara ya kitaarama , abavuye mu kihoze ari commune kanombe , ||| but before we went there , we held a meeting with people who lived in the sectors that surrounded ntarama that is ; kibungo , kanzenze , rurindo , musenyi , people from other neighbouring districts like ; gitarama district , kanombe and butamwa commune plus so many other people from here and there .
mu kihoze ari commune butamwa nkiri kigali ngari , n' abandi benshi baturutse hirya no hino . bibaye ngombaw rero ko dukusanyirizwa hafi ya ntiarama , duyobowe n' umu ajida witwaga sebuhindo uri utuye ahantu ku kanyenze . ||| we had to meet in one place near ntarama , led by a policeman called subuhindo who used to live in kanzenze .
tugezeyo rero i ntiarama kuri izo tariki cumi n' enye , nraumva nbiibuka neza nk' umuntu uri uhaibereye , cumi n' enye z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| i remember very well that we arrived there on the14th .
abantu , abacitse ku icumu ... abaitwa abacitse ku icumu iki kihae , n' ukuvuga abari abatutsi icyo kihae ari nabo bahigawaga , benshi bari bauzuye muri iyo kiliziya arimo bahungiye . ||| most of the tutsi who were being hunted had fled to that church .
bamwe mu bapolisi bari barimo muri icyo gitero tugabye yo , ndetse n' abasirikari turi kumwe bari bafite intwaro zikomeye ; barabanje bazishinga hafi y' ahaegereye kiliziya imbunda zirasa kure , babanza kuteramo ibisasu . ||| most of the soldiers and policemen we were with started planting bombs around the church and throwing grenades in the church .
ntibiciraiye aho rero turamanutse kuri uwo munsi tugerayo , tugera i ntiarama ku kiliziya , ||| we did not stop there , but we also went and entered the church .
biumvikana ko ibyo bisasu biri biishe bamwe muri bo bari barahungiyemo . batangiye kutatana bavuyemo bamwe bari hepfo abandi haruguru abandi biruka biraumvikana bari batewe . turahageze abatapfuye tukabica , ||| we found that some had already died because of the bombs .
abandi bagatemagurwa abandi bakakubitaw ubuhairi , ||| so we started killing others using machetes , clubs . honestly one has to say that .
mbese muri rusangae abanyarwanda bari bihishe muri icyo kihae b' abatutsi baraishwe ku buryo bugaragara , ku buryo bitari ibanga . nnjyae rero nk' umunyarwanda uri uhageze nitabairiye ubwicanyi , nta kinri kiri kinjyanye biumvikanae . ||| that time the tutsis were killed very harshly and the truth must be said .
n' ubwo hariho ubuyobozi buri bunjyanye , ariko bigaragara ko ngezeyo , ||| i was also there with the intension of killing and i should say that i also participated and i killed an old man using a club .
ndetse nkagira uruhare kugeza ubwo nbifungaiyew imyaka itandatu . nfungaiyew ko aho ngaho i ntiarama nhishe umuntu w' umusaza mukubise ubuhairi muri icyo gitero ngiyemo . ||| for that reason i was imprisoned for six years .
noneho birangiye intambara ibaye nk' ihagaze ho gatoya habaho ihunga , ||| after all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile .
tuhungutse ubuyobozi tusanze mu gihugu buranfunga , banyagiriza ko nri nragiye ahongaho i ntiarama . ||| when we returned the country i was imprisoned by the current government because i had participated in the massacre that took place in murambi .
nbiemera nk' umunyarwanda ugiye yo koko , ngaragaza ukuri kw' icyaha nkoze ntakiciye ku ruhande , ndetse ngaragaza n' abo tukifatanyaije . ngamije kugirango ukuri kugaragarae , ||| later , i admitted and i said the truth on what i did in murambi and the people i was with .
kuko kuba abantu barapfuye baraishwe kandi baicwa n' abandi banyarwanda , biri ngombaw rero ko ngaragaza uruhare rwanjye . nk' ubu rero nicaye ahangaha nk' umuntu uciye inberae y' ubutabera , ariko nbuca inberae nirega nemera icyaha cyanjye nkoze , ||| i had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow rwandans , so i felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it .
ndetse ngaragaza n' abo tukifatanyaije . nza kuca inberae y' urukiko rumpa igahano cy' imyaka irindwi , kugeza kuri iyi saha nrakirangije ; nfunguwe na ririya tangazo rya perezida wa repubulika , ||| i was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but i had already admitted and i had said the truth on what happened and the people i was with and i was released after that rule that was given by the president .
ariko nfungurwa n' igihano nrakirangije . kusa bitavuze y' uko nibagiwe icyaha nkoze cy' uko nba nkubise impiri umusaza umwe mu gitondo nri nrimo i ntiarama ahongaho . ||| but it does not mean that i have forgotten what i did .
nkamwica , nkabifungairw nkabisabair imbabazi . nkaba niteguye isaha n' isaha kugaragaza ukuri kw' icyaha nkoze . kuko ahanini nta kinri nmarair ubutabera uretse kubwereka ukuri ku bibaye nk' umunyarwanda uri uhaibereye . ||| i remember very well that i killed that old man on that morning when i was in ntarama and i am always ready to say the truth of what happened in ntarama .
uretse icyo gitero cy' i ntiarama nta binri bitero uba uraigeze witabira ? ||| besides the ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ?
uretse icyo gitero cy' i ntiarama ntabwo aricyo cyonyine ubwo ni bibiri , hari ikindi gitero nbanje kuvuga cy' i nyarunazi centre nbanje kuvuga kiguyemo bari bantu nvuze inberae , haruguru ; n' icyo gitero cy' i ntiarama ku kiliziya . ||| that centre , but i participated by giving them support like bringing back people who were trying to escape and others would kill them .
ubwo ni ibitero bibiri ngaragayemo . mu by' ukuri mu gitero cy' i nyarunazi nta ruharae ngize mu kuica umuntu , ariko ngize uruhare mu bufatanyacyaha bwa sensibilisation , ||| but i believe that i would also have killed them myself if the people i sent them to had not killed them .
ni ukuvuga ngo kutera ingufu abandi . ni ukuvuga ngo niba umuntu aciye hariya nkaba nramuhize undi akamukubita ubuhairi , ahanini ninjye uba waramwishe . ibyo rero kubiirega ni byiza kuko wenda iyo ntahagarara hariya , ||| i should admit i did terrible things by stopping these people maybe if i had not stopped them they would have escaped and be able to survive .
yari kuhamenair akahita akahunga . ariko kuba nri mpahagaze bigaragara nk' umwicanyi . kusa uruhare rwanjye nrugize i ntiarama kumugaragaro , ubwo nicaaga uwo muntu mukubise ubuhairi . ||| i still admit that i participated in the genocide in public and killed someone using a club .
bigaragara y' uko ibyo ari byo byose ibitero bibaye byinshi , ariko wemera ko ... ko witabiriye ibitero bibiri kusa , icy' i ntiarama ni icy' i nyarunazi kubera iki ibindi utabiitabairaga ? ||| it 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . but you participated in only two ; that of ntarama and nyarunazi . why did n't you participate in several others ?
mu byukuri i ntiarama ... ntabwo nmenye uwo ari we . ||| sincerely speaking in ntarama ... i never knew who it was .
impamvu ntamenye uwo ari we , i ntiarama hahungiye abantu benshi cyane . ||| and the reason why i did know him , in ntarama several people gathered there ... to be sincere , they were very many and i guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there identity cards for one to tell who was who .
kandi mu by' ukuri abantu bari bahari ntabwo nbashije kuba wenda ... ntinzi ko hari n' uwahunganaga indangamuntu kuburyo umukora mu mufuka wenda umaze no kumwica . ||| well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the id to know who was who or where he was coming from .
yenda ushobora no kuishakira udufaranga . ushobora kumwica umara kumwica ukaba ukora mu mufuka ugirango urebae ikikutunga birashoboka . ariko ibyo ntibibayeho wenda ngo mbe nramenye ; ||| the main theem was killing .
ni naka w' i bunaka habaagaho kuica kusa . kubera ko intego yari ukumaraho ntabwo .... kushaka ibyangombwa ntabwo biri bifite agaciro , agaciro biri ukuica umuntu tu . ||| and our motto was to finish the ethenic of tutsi ... looking for ids by then , was nosense .
kubera ko uri wo mugambi . ||| point was in killing only because that was the deal .
nta mpamvu wunva yaba yarabaye mbere ya genocide , ukurikije y' uko ubutegetsi buri buriho bwashishikarizaga abantu ikintu cy' amacakubiri , ||| do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations .
ku buryo nawe uba uri ufite akantu gato k' urwango ku bwoko bw' abatutsi igihe ... ? ||| to the extend that , if one had a bias in the tutsi would ... ?
ubundi nkurikije iriya ntiambara nk' umuntu wabikurikiye kandi narinshiye akengae nri mukuru . ||| if i consider that war ... as a person who followed up everything yet i was mature by then .
abantu turi tuturanye tubanaaga mu mahoro nta rwango nri mfitiye abatutsi , kuko turi tumaraanye imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe y' amavuko , turi tubanye mu mahoro . ||| we live in peace with our neighbours . i did not have any hatred for tutsis because i had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years .
kusa bijya kukomera intandaro urebye yo kugirango abantu bapfae aha ahantu tutuye , igihe havugawaga ko habyarimana yaba yapfuye inzangano zahereye kuri uwo munsi cyane cyane . ||| but the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of habyarimana .
ukasanga bari udututsiko ubundi abandi mbese akoba kaje mu baturagae . ||| we sensed segregation among people that particular day .
noneho kubera ko abanyarwanda benshi baumvaaga ko bakunze umubyeyi wabo , ndetse n' ubuyobozi bukabigiramo uruhare bakaumvikanaish ngo perezida wanyu yapfuye kandi yishwe n' abatutsi ni ukuhaguruka rero namwe mukamurengera . kubw' ibyo rero njyae nta rwango nri mfitiye abatutsi , kusa intandaro yabaye igihe gito cyane kijyanye n' iryo hanuka ry' indege ya habyarimana bavuga ko yapfuye . ||| people started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at tutsis as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the tutsis .
urebye niho kupfa kwabo kugize ingufu , gusansibilizwa kwabo kugirango baicwae abayobozi babigizemo ingufu cyae cyane aho habyarimana apfairiye ||| and so you should stand up and defend him .
utubwiye ko ubu ufite imyaka 31 bishaka kuvuga yuko mu kihae cya genocide uri ufite imyaka 21 kuko imyaka 10 irashize . ||| you have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . that means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed .
ese mu kihae cya mbere ya genocide haigeze kubaho ibihe by' amashyaka ; ||| well before the genocide there used to be several political parties .
uba uri uri murihae shyaka ? ||| can you tell us the one you belonged to ?
iby' amashyaka ubiumvise kutae nk' umuntu w' umusore uri ukifite imbaraga wunvaaga ushobora kuitabair ibintu nk' ibyo biri bifite imbaraga mu gihugu ? ||| how did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ?
ubundi nk' umuntu w' umusore icyo kihae nri nfite uburenganzira busesuye , ndetse nraumva nta n' itegeko rinbuzaaga kujya mu ishyaka nk' umunyarwanda . ||| yes i was old enough to join any party i wanted to join and by then i was a member of mdr . i was there as any other rwandan , and because i was illiterate ; i could not get any good post .
uraumva ? kusa haruguru nbanje kukubwira ko nta rwango nri mfitiye abatutsi , ariko cya kihae cy' amashyaka ari nayo ntandaro y' intambara , ||| but what i know is , that party disliked the tutsis so much . i had told you that i did not have any hatred for tutsis .
amashyaka amwe n' amwe yagendaaga yigisha abayoboke bayo ko umwanzi ari umututsi aho ava akagera . ||| but most of these parties always taught us that the only enemy we had was a tutsi .
nonese ku bw' umwihariko m.d.r ako kantu kaba karasaga nkakutera ku mutaima wenda ko nubwo utanze umututsi ariko umututsi atari mwiza , ||| though you did not have any hatred for the tutsis .
hari ako yaba yaraigeze ku kuigisha mu buryo buziguye cyangwa butaziguye ? ||| when mdr was teaching you how tutsis were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ?
kusa ntabwo m.d.r ntabwo nigeze njya mu manama yayo menshi cyane . ||| i did not attend most of mdr meetings .
kusa nibuka ko uwari uyihagarariye witwaga sebuningo oswald uri utuye hano muri uyu murengae wa kibungo , ||| but i remember some time when sebuningo oswald ; he was the representative of the party in kibungo sector .
yigeze kukoresha meeting hano kuri centre ya kibungo , atuigisha amatwara y' ishyaka atubwira intego zaryo n' umugambi w' ishyaka n' iki byose . ariko bigaragara yuko bianze bikunze hari uruhande ribogamiyemo kuko rigushaaga ku kintu baita ngo hutu . iyo hutu iyo habayeho kuvangura ubwoko ubu n' ubu , ||| he held a meeting at kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto .
uraumva ko hari ubundi buhaejwe butafite ijambo muri icyo kihae . ||| but one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . and the whole meeting was about the "@ hutu . @" therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights .
bigaragara ko bianze bikunze amashyaka yaba yaragize uruhare mu kutegura iriya intambara , no mu kuyigisha mu bari abayoboke bayo . ||| thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide .
mu kihae cya genocide se icyo kintu cy' amashyaka mwakibonaga mutae ? ||| during the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ?
nsubiye haruguru gatoya kiriya gitero cy' i ntiarama cyo ku itariki 15/04/1994 kiri igitero kikomeye kandi kiri igitero kiguyemo abanyarwanda ... abantu benshi cyane . abanyarwanda bose bari barimo bihishe muri icyo kiliziya nraumva nta uvuyemo . ||| the troop that attacked ntarama was very big and so powerful and i should say many people died in that attack .
ahari n' uvuyemo ni ku bwa nyagasani ntinzi uburyo yaba yararokotsemo , kiguyemo abantu benshi cyane kaitabairw n' abantu benshi . ||| i do n't even think that there was anyone who survived .
nk' aha ntuye nk' umuntu uhavukaiye ntawe nyobewe izina , ||| in case there is one , it would have been through god 's mercy .
benshi mubo tugiye tujyana ngenda ngaragaza nk' amazina yabo . abo nibuka nk' uwo nshinjae witwa sehene sylivestre tuburanaiye rimwe mu idosiye nfite nburanaiyeho , ubu nawe yaraburanye yarakataiyew . ||| i remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking ntarama .
nraibuka uwitwa sindikubwabo gilbert , uwo nawe turi kumwe nawe yiemerair ibyaha bye yakoreye aho ngaho . nraibuka uwitwa karangaw charles uwo nawe turi turi kumwe n' abandi banyarwanda benshi batuye hafi ahangaha baiemerair icyaha , ||| i accused sehene siriveste , sindikubwabo gilbert , karangwa charles , they all admit that they killed .
uretse ko wenda batabonye umwanya wo kugira icyo bavuga . ||| plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something .
ariko nshinjae benshi kandi noneho icyaha barakiemera kuko bageze aho ngaho ndetse bagaragaza uruhare rwabo . ku bw' ibyo rero ntabwo icyaha nka kiriya nba nrakikoze njyenyine , ||| but i accused so many people and that shows that i was not alone .
kandi niyo nba nrinri kumwe n' abandi si ngombaw kugirango nbahishaire . ikigamijwe n' ukuri uwo baishe nta wunri musanzu ntanga uretse kugaragaza ukuri k' ukuntu yishwe n' uko nbigenje . ||| and i realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing i can do to pay the fine of what i did .
kuko igihe cy' intambara ntinhigawaga nri nfite uburenganzira bwose nk' umunyarwanda w' icyo kihae . ||| during the war i was not being hunted . so , i was free as a rwandan .
kuvuga ukuri rero ku bibaye ni ngombaw , ||| therefore , i witnessed whatever happened and i feel that i should say the truth about what happened .
dore ko abanyarwanda bari muri iki gihugu abenshi ni abari ba ... abarokotse nabo nta kuri kuhagije bafite kuko icyo kihae barahigawaga . ||| because the majority of rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . and survivors do not know everything because they were hunted .
abandi n' abanyarwanda agiye baturuka hanze y' igihugu . nabo bakeneye amakuru kandi nta hanri bayakura uretse kuyabwiraw ntawe abanyarwanda turi mu gihugu icyo kihae . ||| others are rwandans who came from exile .
ndetse amahirwe akaboneka mu kihae hari uwiyemereye icyaha nkanjyae uzi ukuri koko ku bibaye . ||| they were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . the only alternative is us who were free by then .
nkababwira ukuri ku byo nkoze , ku byo nemera , ku bo tufatanije ndetse no kubinri byose bijyanye n' itsembabwoko ribaye kuri uyu murengae . ||| and fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector .
hariho ikintu cyo kusaba imbabazi no kuemera icyaha nyine . ||| there is some thing we call ; "@ asking for forgiveness @" and what we call "@ admitting what you did . @"
none nagirango nkubaze , kuko hari abantu bicaiyew abantu ariko batazi ababaishe . icyo kintu mwaba mutekereza kutae uko kikorwa mu buryo bwo kusaba imbabazi nk' abantu barokotse mu mwanya .... kuko nabo barahemukaiyew muri icyo kintu ; ||| therefore , i would like to ask you about the survivor ; there are some survivors who do not know those who killed their relatives , and though they survived , they are always hurt about what happened to their people .
wowe hari icyo uba uragerageje kukora wenda kusaba imiryango y' abarokotse baba bari muri aka kacae imbabazi . ||| i would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? have you ever asked them to forgive you ?
abantu barokotse bahuye na ririya tsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba bakarirokoka bahuye n' ibibazo bikomeye cyane . barahaizawe bikomeye cyane , ndetse bicirwa ababo , ku buryo biteye agahinda . ||| it is true that those people faced horrible things and they lost their people , which is very sad .
nk' umunyarwanda rero ugize uruhare mu itsembabwoko ; umuntu nishe mubyukuri simuzi n' umuryango we sinywuzi . ariko yari umunyarwanda , kandi umunyarwanda wese ahagarariraw na leta . ||| personally i do not know the family of the person i killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families i decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general .
bibaye ngombaw ko nsaba imbabazi nrirega nsaba imbabazi ubutabera , n' abanyarwanda bose muri rusangae . ariko by' umwihariko ngendaaga mpura n' abanyarwanda bamwe n' abamwe aho nri nfungaiye bazaaga kutusura mu magereza . barimo uwitwa rwililiza innocent nraumva ahari mu muzi . ||| but we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like rwiheza innocent .
gutyo akagaragara nk' uhagarariye abacitse ku icumu ku murengae , ||| he was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector .
ntawe tukamubwira ibitekerezo byacu ko tutufite umugambi wo kusaba imbabazi abo tuhemukaiye , tufunzwe tuemera icyaha , tusaba n' imbabazi . ||| we would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise .
ariko noneho gahunda ya leta iriho kuri ubungubu n' ubwo ntashoboye kubona umuryango w' uwo muntu nba nraishe hari icyo baita gacaca . gacaca rero tuteganya yuko mu kihae kiri inberae gitoya aho leta izapangira gahunda y' uko igiye kutangira , ||| but the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ gacaca level . @"
ko tuzaicara , tukafata imiryango y' ingo zahigwagwa ituye ku murengae , ||| in gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ i am sure we know family per family ] .
nta na umwe tutazi urugo ku rundi . ||| then we will count .
tuvuga ngo abantu bari muri uru rugo bagiye hehe ? tukakora ikintu kimeze nk' ibarura nta rugo rusigaye . ||| it would be more or less like a census .
ababashije kuboneka muri bo tukagenda tubabwira uko tugiye tubakorera ibyaha . uko abana babo bagiye bapfa ; ||| then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies .
abo tugiye tuba ... nvuga ko ari nko kubajugunya kuko nta uhambwaaga icyo kihae . ||| well i can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried .
tuhagaragaza bakashobora kushyinguraw mu cyubahiro , ||| hence they exhume and rebury them officially .
bityo bikatuma nibura nubwo umuntu we yapfuye , ariko akaumva yuko koko ufite ubushake bwo kumubwira uko ibintu bigenze utamukinze . ||| in that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything .
agira agahinda ko kuba yarapfushije umuntu , noneho yagira agahinda ko kuba yarabuze irengero rye akarushaho kugira agahinda . ||| on behalf of the servivors , it is agony to loss their beloved ones .
tuiteguye tutashidikanya ko muri gacaca ejo bunri , ||| and when they add on not knowing where those people died , it hurts a lot .
tuzaicara nk' abanyarwanda ahanini tuburanye n' ubwo tushyize ukuri ahagaragara . ||| in the gacaca corts that are going to take place in the next few months , we planned to come together as rwandans and say the whole truth about what happened .
tuzagaragaza ukuri ku bibaye , tukabibwira abantu barokotse tukabasaba imbabazi zibaho zose , ||| we will tell the truth to the survivors and we will pread for forgiveness as much as we can .
ko icyaha kibaye tutashobora kaongera kukikora no kukitekereza . ||| the crime we committed we will never do it or think about it again .
tubagaragariza ukuri ku bantu babo ukuntu baishwe , ||| we will tell them the truth about all the people we killed and how they were killed .
abashoboye kumenyekana aho bashyizwe tuka habaereka . ||| those whom we still remember where they were dumped , we will show them to those who survived . and those that we do n't remember ; because they are some who died from here and there . but we shall use "@ saying the truth @" as our weapon to calm them .
abo tutazi ubu nyine ... wenda hari benshi bagiye bagwa hirya no hino , ariko biibura tukabahumuriza tuifashaishije ukuri . ||| saying the truth is nothing much rather than showing people what we did and put everything in open .
ukuri nta kunri rero n' ukugenda tugaragaza ibyo bintu tukoze bikajya ahagaragara ntibibae ubwiru ngo babae barafunguye umuntu bavuga ngo urireze n' ugera hanze kubera ko wibereye ... utangirae kuigirair umunezero wo hanze ngo wibagirwe ikintu kitumye ufungurwa . ||| we have to avoid keeping it as a secrete believing that once you are released from prison , you are going to enjoy out there forgetting the main reason why you were released .
turi tayari rero kuzagaragaza ukuri muri gacaca . ||| we are ready to say the truth in gacaca .
ubona kutae abantu basa n' aho bapfobya genocide yabaye , ||| what do you feel about people who criticise the genocide .
bahakana ibyaha cyangwa se basa n' abanakina no ku mubyimba ku bantu ba ... barokotse genocide ? ||| people who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of genocide ?
kugera kuri uyu munsi hariho abanyarwanda bafata itsembabwoko nk' aho ari imirwano isanzwe , imwe ihuza umuntu n' undi wenda bamaze kunywa , bakarwana wenda bakaba bakuicana . ||| up to this moment , some rwandans believe that genocide is just a simple fight . a fight like that between two drunkards who start it up and maybe one of them dies .
bakaripfobya bakavuga ko ritanabayeho . ||| the same people say that there was no genocide .
njyae rero nk' umunyarwanda uri mu gihugu itsembabwoko nriemera nk' iryabayeho . ||| i as a rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , i admit that there was genocide in rwanda .
ntabwo nrisubiza inyuma . ||| i do n't deny it .
bariho rero ubwira uti @: ' nyamuneka dore abantu barapfuye , ' bakaba bavuga ngo ni ukusubiraanmo . ||| yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" and they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @"
abanyarwanda barahaizawe , noneho biongeye hahigaw ubwoko bumwe baraicwa buratotezaw . ||| one group of rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed .
kugera kuri uyu munsi abayobozi bakomeye bariho icyo kihae babigiramo uruhare . ||| up to this day leaders in the former government are behind it .
bamaze kubigiramo uruhare na n' uyu munsi ntibabiemera ko bibayeho . kandi twebwe abo bayoboraaga babajyanye hairyo no hino aho ngaho tubiemera nk' ukuri , ||| yet those of us they were leading in different places by then , admit it as a truth that genocide happened here .
tubifitiye inyandiko mvugo tukoze zigaragaza ko itsembabwoko ribaye . ||| we have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was genocide .
abantu bapfobya rero itsembabwoko n' ukusubiza igihugu inyuma , ||| those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country .
nta wunri musanzu bamarair igihugu , uretse kukisubiza inyuma . ||| there is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her .
twe tuemera ko itsembabwoko ribaye , ndetse bamwe turigiramo uruhare ku mugaragaro . ||| we admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light .
nkaba numva ku bwanjye abo bantu bakina abacitse ku icumu ku mubyimba bavuga ko ibyabaye ntacyo bimaze , abo ngabo rwose ni abashinyaguzi . nibasigeho kuko ibyabaye biteye agahinda . ||| as a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful .
ahubwo bafatae ingamba , barebae ukuntu bakuegera abandi banyarwanda bavuga ukuri , ||| instead they should unit together with the rwandans who are ready to say the truth .
bagendae babacengezaemo ukuri kw' ibyabaye n' ukuntu bigiye bigenda . ||| and together tell people what happened and how it happened .
baumvae ko umuntu ataibeshyera niba urireze wireze ibyo ukoze ntabwo ... nta munyarwanda ufite umugambi wo kuibeshyera ngo bigirae icyo bimugezaho . ||| they should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime .
ni ukuvuga ngo rero itsembabwoko rirabaye . ||| this means that , there was genocide .
ahasigaye tushyirae ukuri ahagaragara , kandi tubwirae n' abo bose bavuga ko ritabayeho ko ribaye . ||| then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there .
tubaigishae uko rigenze , tubisubiraemo twe kubiceceka , tubivugae hose , buri wese yumvae ko itsembabwoko ari ribi , ||| preach them how it took place repeatedly . but not keeping quiet about it .
ko icyo cyaha kitakwaiye kuzaongera kubaho mu gihugu cyacu . ||| until when everyone will learn that genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country .
urakoze hari ikindi kintu numva nshaka kukubaza , ||| thanks a lot .
ku bantu bashobora kuba barakoze itsembabwoko kandi bakaba bakiri hanze . ||| i would like to ask you about those who participated in the genocide yet they are not imprisoned .
wenda ushobora we ku giti cyawe kuba ntabo uzi , ariko ntabo uba uzi wenda bashinjwa ubungubu bakaba bakidegembya ndetse hano hanze muri iki gihugu ? ||| you may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ?
eeh nk' ubungubu mpagaze ahangaha , nko ku idosiye yanjye nfatae urugero hari abanyarwanda benshi .... abantu benshi tugiye tufatanya , bataigeze bagera muri gereza ngo bafungairwe icyaha bakoze . ||| yes there are there . up to this moment in my document i mentioned so many rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed .
bari hanze koko bamwe na bamwe , nraumva nbaibuka . ||| some of them are out there and i remember them .
iyo anbonye koko ubona agize akantu kuko araibuka . ||| when they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily .
akavuga ati @: « uriya muntu nubwo agenda bwose tukoranye icyaha kandi we yarakifungaiyew , ||| "@ though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did .
yagize n' amahirwe yenda arafungurwa . » ||| he is lucky he was released . @"
ukabona ko afite akantu ko kutinya yuko bianze bikunze igihe kizagera , igihe cye nawe kikagera akavuga akashyiraw ahagaragara ; ||| that is what they say . one can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . and it is true their time will come and they will be put in open .
kuko ntinzamuhishair niyo yaba ari papa nta mugambi nfite wo kuhishair itsembabwoko . ku bw' ibyo rero abo bantu bakiri hanze bidegembya , ||| because i will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . i do n't intend to hide the genocide .
urukiko gacaca rugiyeho mu gihugu cyose , kandi rutanga uburenganzira bw' uko uwaba wiyiziho icyaha nk' icyo yagombye kukigaragaza hakiri kare . ||| therefore , those who are still out there , i would like to remind them that gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime .
kugirango urukiko nirutangira ruzamugiraire imbabazi rukurikije ko yabivuze mbere , nabo bagombye kugira ikintu k' ishyaka , ||| those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . but they should also have the courage to say the truth .
bakaumva ko kuvuga ukuri bitavuga ngo n' ukuica umuntu . ||| saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed .
iyaba aribyo iyi leta y' ubumwe iriho yari kufata uwishe nawe akaicwa , ||| if it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true .
ariko siko bigenze ahubwo bibaye ngombaw ko uzi ikintu akivuga akakitangaho n' ubuhamya . ||| instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did .
kuvuga rero genocide ntabwo ari ukuvuga ngo umuntu yaraishe kusa , ||| therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only .
tukeneye byinshi , tukeneye ubuhamya , tukeneye ukuri . ||| there is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth .
kuba rero uraishe umuntu ugomba kubigaragaza , ||| so , you killed some one you better say it .
ariko no kuba waramwishe ukaba ukidegembya mu gihugu kandi ubizi neza ko hari abo mwakoranye icyaha , nabyo bigaragaza ko ukishyigikiye itsembabwoko . ||| because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the genocide .
ubu arafunze ? ||| was he arrested ?
oya ntawe uzi iyo yahungiye . ||| no , nobody knows where he fled .
uwo nrinzi wunri ... abandi bagiye bapfa , ||| the other people that i knew died .
undi uriho ukidegembya tusangiye n' idosiye , nvuga ko ari nk' umuyobozi w' akagari muri iki kihae we ari hanze . ||| but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area .
uwo turahura tukaganira ariko iwe yarahahunze ntahaba aho amaraiye kufungurwa . ||| we normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released .
afunguwe yahise agenda ? ||| after being released he disappeared ?
yego , yahise ajyenda . ||| yes , he disappeared .
ubu yahungiye he ? ||| where did he flee ?
aba hakurya ahantu ... ahahoze muri commune kanombe . ||| he lives up there ... in the former kanombe commune .
ariko ubu inbona nkubonae ku buryo isaha nmushakira nmubona , kuko niba ubuyobozi bumukeneye ngenda nkamuzana , nkaba namwerekana adresse ze nrazizi . ||| in case he is needed by the authorities i can get him face to face . i know his adresses .
ni ukuvuga ko witeguye kuba wa ... kuzatanga ubuhamya , ku bantu bose bashobora kuba ... kuko jyewe impamvu nkubajije abantu b' abayobozi ndetse nkubazamo n' abantu bize , n' abantu uba uvuga uti bagiraaga n' uruhare mu kukangurair abantu genocide , ||| does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why i asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide .
abo bantu ushobora kuba ubabona nabo babateraaga inkunga kandi bari hanze ahangaha bakidegembya . ||| can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy .
abashobora kuboneka nk' ubu leta ifite umugambi wo kushakisha abo bose bakoze itsembabwoko bakiri hanze y' igihugu . ||| it would be possible to find them , since the government is putting in a lot of efort in getting those people who participated in the genocide hidding out of the country .
nk' ubu numvise ngo yafashwae yenda ngo yajyanywe arusha , ||| for example if i had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to arusha it is better .
naho njyayo kuko ukuri kwanjye ntabwo kugarukaiye ahangaha . ||| if it means to go and witness in arusha i can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond rwanda .
abandi bo bari hafi yanjye , nk' uwo muyobozi bizimungu isaac ari i riraima ni ukuvuga ngo aramutse ashatse kuhakana , ||| lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called issac . he lives in ririma .
ubutabera bukankenera naho nkuihutair kujyayo . mweraka iki ? mubwira nti ibuka wa munsi cya kihae turi aha n' aha ufite imbunda utubwira ngo tujyae inberae tutsembae umututsi nta kinri amaze n' ukumwica . ibyo bikamwumvisha y' uko , ||| if he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , i can hurry to go there and convict him .
nubwo akwepakwepa ariko hari abo bafatanyaije icyaha . ubu rero nriteguye , ||| i would remind him whatever he did while i was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period .
ahubwo ku bwanjye numva ahubwo leta iri kuntindair . bibaye ngombaw ni isaha ku isaha ubuhamya bwanjye bugera no kuri abo ngabo nyine nramutse nbabonye nkabaumvaish . wenda ahari nabo bahindukira nabo bakavuga ukuri . ||| i feel that even the government is delaying me because i am very ready to say the truth on what happened and i feel that i should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too .
mu kuanzura nagirango ugirae icyo ubwira abanyarwanda , cyangwa undi muntu wese utekereza ushobora kuzareba ubu buhamya ndetse harimo n' abongabo bakoze genocide , ndetse unabishobora ukagira icyo ubwira abacitse ku icumu . ||| in conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors .
icyo nbwira abanyarwanda muri rusangae n' uko koko itsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba ribaye muri iki gihugu cyacu . ||| what i can tell rwandans in general , is that "@ it is true there was genocide in our country . @"
rihitaanye abanyarwanda benshi , basaga miliyoni ( 1000000 ) nk' uko imibare ibigaragaza haruguru . ||| and so many people died ; more than one million people died as it is shown in the statistics .
kandi ibyo byose bikozwe n' abandi banyarwanda , ||| and all those people were killed by their fellow rwandans .
bikorwa ku manywa y' ihangu , ||| which was done in broad daylight .
nraumva abanyamahanga babigizemo uruhare wenda ari bakeya , ariko ku bwanjye mpamya abanyarwanda aribo bahemukaiye abandi banyarwanda . ||| i believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the rwandans .
nkaba nbasabaaga rero abanyarwanda , cyane cyane abagitsimbaraye ku mutaima wo kutagaragaza ukuri , ||| therefore i believe that rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ rwandans ] .
ko bagombye kuvugaish ukuri ku bibaye , kuko nta yinri nkaunga tukeneye ku munyarwanda uri muri iki gihugu , uretse kugaragaza ukuri ku bibaye . abanyarwanda baraishwe izuba riva , ||| so , i am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it .
ni ngombaw ko tukagaragaza na none izuba riva uko bigiye bigenda . abantu bagitsimbaraye rero nibave ku izima , ||| because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . people were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open .
baumvae yuko ukuri gukenewe , kandi ko bianze bikunze umusanzu we ari ukugaragaza ukuri . ||| therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth .
abacitse ku icumu nabo , nagirango mbe nbabwira yuko tubasabye imbabazi tuivuye ku mutaima . ||| to the genocide survivors i would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible .
kuko icyaha tukoze n' icyaha kitasanzwe niko nbiita mu mateka y' isi , ||| which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history .

ubonye umwanya wo kumwitegereza , ngo umenye ko ari umututsi ? ||| did you get time to properly identify whether he was a tutsi or not ?
ni umututsi , kuko nta muhutu uri uhari . ||| i believe he was a tutsi because there was no hutu among them .
naho ukurikiyeho wamwishe ryari ? wamwishe saa nkahae ? ||| and when did you kill the second one ?
uku ... bose ni igihe kimwe . ||| like this ... i killed both of them at the same time .
ubaishe mu minota mikeya ikurikiraan ? ||| did you kill them in a few minutes interval ?
nbaishe mu minota mikeya ikurikiraan . ||| i killed both of them in a few minutes interval .
tuvugae niba uwo muntu ... aah , yarabayeho nyuma , ushobora kuba uragize ngo yapfuye ariko akaza kubaho . umubonye umumenya ? ||| what if that person did n't die , would you recognize him today if you met him ?
mubonye kuko hari hahungiye ingeri nyinshi , ||| i do n't think i would recognize him because there were people of all kinds .

ntabwo uzi aho abo bantu bavaaga ? ||| did you know where they came from ?
abo bantu ntabwo nzi aho bavaaga . bari bahunze . bahungiye i murambi ||| i did n't know where they came from ; they had fled to murambi .
none ku bwawe nk' icyo kihae wamwicaga wunvaaga umwiciye iki ? ||| did you have any reason for killing them ?
numvaaga ku bwanjye bitewe na ... bitewe ... na leta mbi , yari ya ... n' abategetsi ubutegetsi bubi buri buri bwa ... butushutse ngo tuicanae , niyo mpamvu yabinteye , ntabwo ubundi nri kubica . ||| it was just because of the bad leadership that forced us to kill but otherwise i would not have killed them .

icyo kihae iyo umenya ko ari bubi ntabwo uba urabaishe . ||| i believe if you had known before that it was a bad leadership you would not have killed them .
hari impamvu yinri y' icyo kihae utari umenya ko ubwo butegetsi ari bubi yatumye ubica . ni iyihe mpamvu ? ||| therefore there should be other reasons that forced you to kill ; would you tell us some of those reasons that might have forced you to kill .
impamvu yatumye nbica icyo kihae . impamvu yatumye nbica icyo kihae , ni uko icyo kihae bavugaaga bati @: "@ nimu ... hariho ubwicanyi , bavuga ngo @: umwanzi n' umwe . @" kandi tubitewe n' abategetsi , bati @: " utamwica , utaica abatutsi . ati @: nawe turamwica . @" ||| the reason i killed them is because the authorities ordered us to . they said , "@ there is only one enemy and you must kill him or her , and if you do n't , you yourself shall be killed . @"
nonese ku bwawe abo bantu uri uraigeze ubabona ari abanzi ? ||| from your personal point of view , did they appear like your enemies ?

urashaka kuvuga yuko iyo icyo kihae , abo bantu utabica , uri kuhita wicwa ako kanya ? hari uwakugiye inyuma aravuga ngo @: ||| are you trying to say that if you had refused to kill then , you would have been immediately killed ?

abo bantu iyo ntabi ... abo bantu ... niyo mpamvu nnjyae numvise ibyo bintu ari bibi nkabiirega , ||| that is why i realized that what i did was very bad and reported myself .
abo bantu nbaishe nta kintu na kimwe bankoshereje , nta na kimwe , ku buryo nnjyae binteye agahinda yuko nishe bagenzi banjye , nbahoye ubusa . ||| i killed innocent people who had n't done any thing wrong to me . that is why whenever i think about it , i become very miserable because i killed my fellow people yet they had n't done anything to me .
ni ukuvuga yuko iyo abo bantu baza kuza , ntubaturae impiri yawe , ukayireka aho uyifite bakatambuka , bari kubaho . ||| so if you had let them pass and you had not hacked them they might have been alive up to now ?
bari kubaho , ||| yes they would be alive .
iyo ntabica bari kubaho . ||| if i had n't killed them , they would be alive today .
iyo nbareka banguye ho simbakubite impiri , yenda bari kubaho ... kuko iyo nbareka bari kubaho ... bari kurokoka , kubw' imaan yabo . ||| maybe they would have survived through god 's mercy .
ni ukuvuga ko ni wowe ubaiiciye , ntabwo ari ukuvuga yuko ari undi ukushyizeho agahato ngo bicae ? ||| so that means that you did it voluntarily and no one forced you ?
abo bantu ... nica abo bantu , nri nje mu ... aho ngaho nyine twahu ... nahurujwe nzanye n' abongabo , hanyuma bitewe n' umutima wanjye , w' ubunyamaswa mpita nica abo bavandimwe . ||| i was convinced by those people to go to that place . when i reached there my savagery led me to killing those innocent people .
ni ubushake bwawe ntabwo ari undi ... ? ||| so it was out of your own will ?
ibyo bintu nta muntu ubintegetse , ni ubushake bwanjye , niyo mpamvu nbisabair imbabazi . ||| no one forced me , it was out of my own will and that is why i apologize for what i did .

uratubwira ko hari abandi bamuroshye mu ruzi . bamuhambiriye n' ishingae , kandi mukanya utubwiye ko wamwishe ... ||| you told us that other people drowned him ; they tied him with grass made out of ropes but in no time you are telling us that you killed him ...

kuko iyo batamwica , nnjyae ubwo nri kumwica . ||| which means that if they never killed him , i would have killed him myself .

uko nri mubonye , turi tugiye kureba ise ... ise . ise tumubuze , ||| we were looking for his father and failed to get him .
nbonye umwana ndamwica . ||| but i saw the son . therefore i decided to kill the son .

mu bikorwa byanjye icyo kihae uko biri bimeze ... kumwica ku giti cyanjye , numvaaga umutima wanjye , uri umeze nk' umutima w' inyamaswa . ari ... uvuga ngo ... barahiga ... ahari umututsi ... nicae . ||| at the time when i was doing it , i had wild thoughts that made me think we were hunting ... wherever i saw a tutsi i would kill .

umaze kutubwira ko wishe abatutsi , bimwe ari abategetsi ubibabwiye . ubundi nkawe umuntu witwa umututsi umubonaaga utae mbere ya jenoside ? ||| you have told us that you killed the tusti because your leaders forced you to . so personally what did you think of the tutsi before the genocide ?
mbere ya jenoside , abategetsi babishishikarizaga cyane , ngo @: umwanzi ngo @: ||| before the genocide , the bad leadership of that time influenced us . they used to convince us that our only enemy was the tutsi .
ni umwe , tukabibona ko abo bantu ari abanzi bacu , kandi ari nta kintu tupfa , tubitewe n' ubutegetsi burimo bubidushishikariza buri kanya . ||| so we were forced to believe it and yet it was not true . simply because the government was sensitizing us all the time .
ibyo batangiye kubibabwira ryari ? ||| when did they start telling you that ?
ibyo batangiye kubitubwira habyarimana amaze kupfa . ||| they started telling us that after habyarimana 's death .
noneho turi ku kubaza , mbere ya habyarimana . wowe ubonaaga umututsi kutae ? ||| we are asking you how you used to find the tutsi before habyarimana 's death .
intambara itaraba . intambara itaraba , turi turashyingiraanye , turahanye abageni , ||| before the genocide we would intermarry , i even have a sister who got married in that ethnic group .
nfite na mushiki wanjye uri urahashatse . turaganiraaga . ||| we were friendly .
none ... ubabonaaga nk' abavandimwe biza kuhinduka . nkeka intambara ya za mirongo icyenda [ 1990 ] urayizi , cyangwa urayumvaaga itangira . wigeze ubiumva ? ||| so you used to look at them as if they were your relatives but later on you changed your attitude towards them ... i guess you know something about the war that took place in 1990 , is n't it ?
nrabiumvise . ||| yes i heard about it .
muri kiriya kihae . nta bintu by' ibimenyetso wigeze ubona , ko jenoside ishobora kuzaba mu rwanda ? ||| during that time , did n't you see signs , which showed that in the future there would be genocide in rwanda ?
muri icyo kihae muri za mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] , numvaaga bavuga bati @: "@ hepfo iriya za kibungo , ngo @: hari mirwano ... imirwano bari kurwana . @" hanyuma icyo kihae tuumva ngo @: bari kurwana bitaragera ino . tusangira nabo tusabana amazi , bavuga bati @: " ni abanyarwanda bari kutaha iwabo , bari kurwana n' abandi . @"@ ino ku gikongoro , intambara yari itarahagera . ||| we could hear that there was a war going on towards kibungo . that there were people coming from exile who were fighting against the people they found in the country . but for us in gikongoro it was peaceful .
ku buryo nta bimenyetso wigeze ubona ko jenoside ishobora kuzaba ? ||| therefore , you never saw any signs of the genocide ?
ibimenyetso ... ntangiye kubona ko jenoside igiye kuba , habyarimana amaze kupfa . ||| i started seeing those signs after habyarimana 's death .
niho ubibonye ? ||| is that the time you saw signs ?
niho nbibonye . ||| yes , that 's when i saw some signs
hari icyo nkubaza . uvuze ko byose bihise bihinduka habyarimana akimara kupfa . ||| let me ask you ... you have just said that all changed after habyarimana 's death .
ni iki ubona kihise kihinduka cyane kuri wowe , habyarimana akimara kupfa . ||| which changes did you experience after habyarimana 's death ?
mbese uba urabiifashemo utae ? ||| and how did you handle those changes ?
habyarimana akimara kupfa , hari ahantu nraraga izamu ry' umugabo nrariraga , noneho nzakuza ... nzakubona ahantu bari kutwika amazu , ||| after habyarimana 's death , i was at a place where i was working as a watchman .
nvuye mu mutasomaw kugura ibirayi . nraza nyura ku mugorae w' umututsi , aranbwira ati @: "@ ese gaspard , ||| as i was coming from mudasomwa to buy irish potatoes , i met a tutsi woman who asked me , "@ gaspard , how come those houses across are burning ?
ati @: ko nruzi hariya batwitse amazu , ati @: bimeze bite ... kandi ukaba wiruka ? ||| what is happening and why are you running ? @"
nramubwira nti @: nvuye kugura ibirayi ku kahair , ||| then i told her i was from buying irish potatoes from gasharu .
nsize amazu ari gushya hariya haruguru , nti @: ||| but i told her that i had left houses being burnt up there .
mpuye n' abagabo bikoreye inyama z' inka , nti @: hariya mu mushishito . ||| i told her how i met some men taking cow 's there in mushishito .
nti @: ariko bitewe yuko nkuzi uri umuturanyi wanjye , nti @: ||| then i told her , "@ since you are my neighbour i will tell you what is going on .
ngiye kubikubwira ariko uyu munsi ntinongera kurara izamu . ||| from now on , i will never work as a watchman anymore .
nti nbonye ari abatutsi barimo bica ! yee nti @: ni abatutsi barimo bica . ati @: ||| they are killing the tutsi ! @"
"@ urakoze . @" nti @: nibo ... nti nibo barimo bica . ubwo yahise afumyamo ntiiongeye kurara ahongaho . ||| then she thanked me and immediately left ; she never slept there in her home .
ubwo nnjyae , nhise ntaha njya imuhair nva ku zamu , njya imuhair . ||| i also went home and stopped moving around . i stayed at home .
none ukimara kubimenya se nta gitekerezo ... ko wunvaishe ko abatutsi baicwa , nta gitekerezo uba uragize , cyo kurwana kubo mwari muturanye ? ko unavuze ko hari abo mwari mwarashyingiranywe ? ||| after realizing what was about to take place , did n't you at least think of what you should do to help your neighbours since you had even intermarried ?
igitekerezo cyabo turi tuturanye , bamaze kaumva ibyo ngibyo , bahita bahunga . bamwe bahungira hano ... bahungiye hano i murambi . ||| my neighbours ... when they heard about it , they all fled . some came here to murambi .
utubwiye ko hano i murambi habaye ubwicanyi buhaambaye . nyuma yuko ubwo bwicanyi buba hari ibindi bintu uzi byakurikiyeho ? mu kituragae iwanyu ... ||| you told us that here in murambi was a horrible massacre . after the killings do you know of something else that followed in your home village ?
nyuma y' intambara y' i murambi , nta bunri bwicanyi bubayeho , ||| after the murambi battle , no more killings took place .
hahise haza abafaransa , bahita babuhosha . ||| the french troops intervened and stopped it .
abafaransa basanze hari abatutsi bakiriho ? ||| did the french find any tutsi around ?
abafaransa basanze abatutsi barapfuye . ||| they found all the tutsi already dead .
ni ukuvuga ko abo bafaransa icyo bakoze ari ukugirango ... bakingaiye ikibaba abantu bahunze ? ||| it sounds like the french came to cover up the deeds of those who went to exile ?
yee , bakingaiye ikibaba abantu bahunze , ariko abatutsi barapfuye . ||| yes they just wanted to cover up on what those people had done but the tutsi had already died .
hagati abatutsi ... bambe abafaransa wibuka igihe bagereye ino ? ||| do you remember when the french reached here ?
ntabwo nkaibuka , ntinkaibuka . ||| i do n't remember ...
ariko hari igihe kihise mo i murambi hamaze kubera ishyano ? ||| maybe it was within a short time after the catastrophe that happened in murambi ...
basanze abatutsi b' i murambi barapfuye . ||| they found when all tutsi from murambi had already died .
ugereranyaije ni nk' igihe kingana iki ? ||| when you estimate , what time do you think it was ?
ngereranyaije ... ngereranije abatutsi barapfuye ... abafaransa numvaishe ngo bigeze ku kibuye , ngiye kaumva numva ngo na hano ku gikongoro bahaje , ||| if i estimate ... the tutsi died ... i heard that the french had reached kibuye and within a short time i heard that they had reached gikongoro .
ariko nta kihae cy' ukwezi kishize , abatutsi bamaze kupfa . ||| but that was less than a month time after the tutsi had been murdered .
oya , ntinkubaza ko ubaye umuntu mwiza ibyo nrabiemera . ||| that is not what i was asking . i know you 've changed and you are a good person .
ntakubaza uraibuka ibyo ukoze ... ikintu kikubabaza ... ||| but i was asking whether you remember what you did ... what 's the most painful souvenir ... ?
ikintu kibi kinbabaje cyane , nibuka abantu bapfuye bazize akarengaane , bazize ubusa . ||| what i remember that always hurts me are the innocent people who were killed .
bose bazize akarengaane bazize akarengaane . ||| well , those who died were all innocent .
ariko turaibuka hano nk' umuntu uri uri i murambi . ikintu utazaibagirwa , ||| but as a person who was in murambi , what would be the souvenir that you will never forget ?
wenda se n' amaraso yakuguyeho ... ||| something you ever think about , maybe blood that dropped on you ...
ikintu ntazaibagirwa , ni abantu baguye hano , baishwe n' abantu b' abakizi ba nabi . ||| what i can never forget are the people who died here , killed by wrong doers .
kuri wowe reka tukuhae urugero . ||| i mean you personally . let me give you an example .
ushobora kuba ubana n' umugore wawe , mukajya mutongana , rimwe , kabiri , ||| let 's say you have a wife and you quarrel frequently ; you quarrel once , twice , three times and finally you fight .
gatatu . mukazarwana , ariko noneho rmwe ukazibuka yakuteye ikishirair cyangwa wowe ukimuteye . akaba ari cyo kikubabaza . ||| and maybe she hits you with a burning charcoal or you hit her toot . that can stick in your mind maybe because it is what hurts you the most in the whole fight . now , comparing that example to this situation .
na hano i murambi urahageze . ||| you came to murambi , is n't it ?
sibyo ? nbwira mu bikorwa bibi byose ukoze , cyangwa n' abandi n' icyo ubonye . icyo ujya wunva kikusigara mu mutawe ujya ubona . ||| so tell me among all the horrible things you did or saw , what do you remember ... something that stuck in your head ?
wenda se ni umuntu utemye , ni uwo ugize ni uwo se ubonye ashibukanwa na gerenade ... nicyo tushaka kumenye . ||| maybe a memory about hacking somebody or somebody you saw being crushed by a grenade . that is all we need to know .
icyo utazaibagirwa wowe ... ||| an incident that you will never forget .
ikintu ntazaibagirwa , ni abantu nbonye batera grenade bakabica . ||| the thing i will never forget is seeing people being crushed by grenades .
ikintu ntazaibagirwa ... ||| i will never forget that .
bigenze kutae iyo grenade ? ||| what happened ?
barayibateye barapfa . ||| a grenade was thrown to them and they died .
bayifunguye kutae ... ubonye imipfire yabo bapfuye kutae ... ||| how did they open the grenade ... ? how did you see them dying ?
imipfire yabo nbonye bikubita hasi , bazana urufuro . ||| what i saw about their death , they fell down and died slobbering .
nicyo nbonye . ||| that is all i saw .
ikintu nicyo wunva ... nicyo wunva ubonye kibi ... kibi ... nko mu munota umwe ... ? ||| is that all you saw ? i mean the worst thing you saw ... it might be an event that took place in the twinkling of an eye ?
ikintu nbonye kibi ... kibi cyane ku munota umwe . ni abo bagabo babiri niiciye . ||| the two men i killed myself is the worst thing i saw happening in the twinkling of an eye .
ntizaibagirwa ku isi , ||| i will never forget that , in my whole lifetime .
kandi mbajijije ubusa . ||| yet they were innocent .
icyo ubiibukaho ni iki kihora kigaruka ... ||| what do you remember about that event , which always comes back to your mind ?
icyo nbiibukaho ni uko nbaishe , ||| what i recall ... is the fact that i killed them .
nbaicishije ubuhairi , bakahita bapfa . ||| i killed them with clubs and they died right away .
nrabiibuka nkagira agahinda kanini cyane , nbica nbarenganyaije ari bagenzi banjye . ||| whenever i recall it , i feel so sad .
ntabahishe nkabica , ||| they were my people but i killed them . instead of hiding them i killed them .
njya nbiibuka nkagira agahinda kanini , yuko nbaishe , nkaba nbisabair imaan imbabazi . ||| whenever i think about it i feel so sad . whenever i remember that i killed them ... that is why i ask god to forgive me . i always ask for forgiveness because i killed my comrades yet they were innocent .
yuko bagenzi banjye nbaishe nta kintu nbaziza , mbajijije ibitekerezo bibi biriho buri kihae ... icyogihe . ||| i killed them because of the wrong mentality we were fed then .
ujya ubitekerezaho buri munsi ... ? ||| do you think about it often ?
nrabitekereza buri munsi cyane , nkagira agahinda cyane , kubw' abo bagabo nishe mbajijije ubusa . ||| yes i often think about it and it fills me with misery . because of those two men i killed yet they were innocent .
ku bwawe utubwiye ko wishe , ||| you personally told us that you killed .
hari n' ibyo wibuka neza . uzi ko wemeye icyaha nk' ubu ibyo bakurega ... icyo cyaha wunva ... ubifata utae , iyo bakubwiye ko ukoze jenoside ? ||| there are some events that you still remember clearly and you admitted what you were accused of . how do you look at that crime especially when people accuse you to have participated in the genocide ?
ibyo biha , ni jyewe ubiireze bitewe n' umutima wanjye yuko nkoze ibintu bibi . nta muntu wabimpase ni jyewe ubiireze . ||| no one forced me to pleade guilty . i reported myself as my conscience did n't leave at peace because i knew what i did was very wrong . no one forced me i did it willingly .
nza kubiirega ibyo muri selire , nza no kuvuga ibya hano i murambi , ||| i reported myself in my home area and talked about what i did in murambi .
bitewe n' uko nhabonye abantu bapfuye bazize akarengaane . ||| i saw so many innocent people dying in murambi .
baishwe n' abakizi ba nabi , babahoye ubusa bahahungiye . ||| wrong doers killed them although they had not done anything wrong . those people had fled to murambi .
nza kuhairega nta muntu uhanreze ni jyewe uhaireze . ||| i reported myself about it before anybody reported me .
ku giti cyawe se , kuba urakoze jenoside , cyangwa bakuita ko ukoze jenoside , wunva ko ipfunwe bikuteye ? ||| having participated in the genocide or being called a genocidaire , does it make you feel embarrassed ?
kuba nrakoze jenoside , numva ku giti cyanjye , nrakoze nabi , ||| having participated in the genocide ... personally i feel that , i did wrong .
bitewe n' umutima mubi nri nfite . nyuma leta , iza kuvuga iti @: ||| and , it was due to the bad heart i had .
"@ mwarishe , ni muvugae ukuntu mwishe , tubabarirae . @" ||| later the government said , "@ you killed , tell us how you killed then we shall forgive you . @"
nza kuibaza nravuga nti @: ngiye kuvuga ukuntu nishe , nzababarirwae ... ... banbabarirae n' imaan inbabarirae . ||| then i thought about it and decided was going to say how i killed and then be pardoned by the government and by god . @"
ku bwawe se , ubu uzi ko hariho ikintu kiitwa ubutabera . cyane n' imanza nyinshi ziba mu rwanda ni izijyanye n' ibya jenoside ubona ubutabera bwo mu rwanda , ||| you know there is something called ‘ justice ’ that is being practiced in rwanda , concerning the genocide that happened .
bugombye kukora iki ? ||| so how do you think justice should be done ?
kuri iki ... , ku bwawe . wunva bugombye kukora kutae ? ||| how should they go about it ?
ubutabera bwo mu rwanda kuri njyewe , bitewe ko nvugaish ukuri , nkashinja abantu bataemera ibyabaye hano . ||| on my behalf , justice in rwanda ... i suggest that the government forgives me because i always try to simplify its work by confessing and convicting those who do n't admit their participation in murambi killings .
nkabivugaishmo ukuri , nkafasha leta ntinyirushye nkavuga ibyabaye , ||| i say everything truthfully and i help the government by telling what happened here and what i personally got involved into .
n' ibyo nkoze @: nraumva , yanbabarira . ||| therefore the government should forgive me .
yuko nvugaish ukuri ibyabaye , ntayiruhije . ||| because i say the truth about what happened without giving them a hard time .
usibye kuvuga ngo @: uzababarirwa ku giti cyawe . ariko se , ubutabera wifuza nyuma y' ibyabaye mu rwanda , wunva buba ari ubuhe ? ||| besides being forgiven , personally after all that happened in rwanda , what kind of justice should be done ?
ni ubutabera bwunga abanyarwanda , ||| it is ‘ justice ’ that unites all rwandans .
tukaubaka igihugu cyacu , ibyabaye nibyongere kuba . ||| so that we can build our nation and stop what happened from happening again .
tukakiubaka kikamera nk' uko kiri kimeze , na mbere abantu batarapfa . ||| we should build our nation and make it look like it was before people died .
kuri wowe ... uvuze ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . ||| you have just talked about unity and reconciliation .
ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ubuumva utae ? ||| what do you think about unity and reconciliation ?
wunva bukora kutae ? ||| how do you expect it to work ?
ubumwe n' ubwiyunge nuko bwa kaunga abanyarwanda , bukabasubiza ... bukabasubiza ... bu ... ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ni uko bukaunga abanyarwanda , bakasubira bakabana nk' uko biri mbere , ||| i think unity and reconciliation should unite the rwandans so that they live in harmony the way they lived before .
bakabana n' abo bahemukaiye , bakabasaba imbabazi . ||| people should live with those they betrayed and ask for forgiveness .
wunva se nyuma y' ibyabaye byoroshye kugira ngo ubumwe n' ubwiyunge buzageraweho ? ||| do you think that unity and reconciliation are possible after all that happened in rwanda ?
ibyabaye , ntabwo biri byoroshye , ||| i know it 's hard to unite and reconcile after what happened in rwanda .
ariko leta y' u rwanda ntishaka kukora nk' ibyabaye , irashaka kaunga aba ... kaunga ababikoze , ngo bagaragazae ibyabaye ... ukuri . ||| but again , the government is working hard so that people may say the truth about what happened in order to reconcile .
ese ku bwawe ko wireze ukaemera icyaha ... utubwiye ko hari bamwe ukoreye icyaha , bamwe baba bararokotse uzi . urabaegereye ? ||| you have told us that you confessed ; now we want to ask you whether you asked for forgiveness to the people you hurt . did you go to them , especially the survivors ?
yee , hari umugore negereye mubwira ukuri , mubwira nabo niciye , aravuga ngo @: ||| yes , there is a woman to whom i asked for forgiveness ; she was happy and she thanked me for having told her about the people i killed , she said she did n't know them .
ntiyari abazi , kuba ... mugaragariza imiryango ye yapfuye ati @: " rwose ati @: nta kibazo . @" ||| and then she said there was no problem with her ... i told her about who killed her family members and she said she did not know them .
kuvuga ngo ntakibazo , bisobanuye iki ? ||| what does it mean when one says there is no problem ?
ati @: "@ ntinri nzi abanyiciye , ||| she said to me , "@ i did n't know those who killed my relatives .
nune urabagaragaza turaturanye , ati @: ||| now you have told them to me and in fact we are neighbours . @"
ubwo ngubwo ... ati @: kandi babihakana ukaba ugaragaza ababaishe , ati @: ||| she told me that they always deny that they did n't kill them .
nraumva uvugaish ukuri . ati @: uzakomezae uvugae nk' uko uvuga , iyo miryango yanjye yapfuye . @" ||| she appreciated me and said , "@ you say the truth , keep it up and do n't change . @" she told me to keep saying the truth like i had said about her family .
ariko ntakubaza urabona byoroshye ? ||| but i am asking you if you think it is easy ?
kaoroha kugirango abantu batangae imbabazi z' abantu babiciye , kuko ari benshi bazaitanga , ||| being easy ... people should forgive those who did wrong to them since the majority is ready to forgive .
abaanga kuemera ibyaha by' ibyo bakoze kandi bibahama bakabahana , kuko baba baanga kugaragaza ukuri . ||| maybe those who do n't accept their roles in the genocide yet there are evidences should be punished because they do n't want to expose the truth .
kuri wowe umaze kuvuga ibyabaye unagize mo uruhare . urimo uvuga ko ubungubu bikukoma ku mutaima ukabyicuza , ||| you have admitted the crimes you committed and always regret what you did .
ubundi u rwanda urubona utae , mu kihae kizaza ? ||| now according to you , how do you find the future of rwanda ?
u rwanda ntubona ko rwa ... rutari nka mbere , abana b' u rwanda bashaka kurwubaka , ||| rwanda is no more like the former rwanda . children of rwanda today think about building their nation .
batashaka kukora nk' ibyabaye . ||| they do n't think about doing things like what happened in the past .
mu kihae kizaza abana barimo bavuka barimo babaigisha kubaan n' abandi , bakabaigisha kukora , nrabona nta tsembatsemba rizagaruka . ||| the government is teaching the children how to live in peace with one another , how to work ... i do n't see genocide happening again .
nk' ubu ubwawe uzi u rwanda rutakaje abantu , rutakaza n' ibintu . ||| you know very well that rwanda lost so many things and very many people .
nk' ubu uramutse ufunguwe , uruhare rwawe utanga , haba mu bumwe n' ubwiyunge , haba mu bikorwa by' amajyambere ni uruhe ? ||| so in case you were released , what would be your contribution as far as unity and reconciliation or development in rwanda is concerned ?
uruhare ntanga ni uko nkuegera abo nhemukaiye , kuko ndi umuhinzi yenda tukaguzanya ; tukasangira nk' uko tusangiraaga ; nkabasaba imbabazi ; tugahingirana ; tukatuererana nk' uko biri bisanzwe . ||| i think i would go and try to live in peace with the people i tormented and since i 'm a farmer , i would try to work with them as we try to help one another .
ukurikije se ibyabaye , ujya wiyumva ko uri umunyarwanda ? ... ntakubaza . ujya wiyumva ko uri umunyarwanda . ||| when you consider what happened , do you feel like you are a rwandan ?
nrabiumva . ||| yes , i feel i 'm a rwandan .
urakoze . harya ushobora kaongera kutuibutsa amazina yawe . ||| thank you , would you please remind us your name ?
nitwa ayirwanda gaspard . ||| my name is ayirwanda gaspard .
ubundi umaze igihe kingana iki .... ||| how long have you been in prison ?
nfite imyaka itanu n' amezi umunani . ||| i have been in prison for five years and eight months
urakoze ||| thank you .
namwe murakoze . ||| thank you too .
ayirwanda . ||| ayirwanda ?
karamae . ||| yes please ?
umva nkubwirae . tuesae turize tugiye tuigisha ubumwe n' ubwiyunge , ||| listen , we all learnt ... all of us were taught about unity and reconciliation .
turanabiumva tunabishyira mu bikorwa , ||| we understood and even practiced it .
ni nacyo turimo kukora . ||| in fact this is what we are doing right now .
ariko tugira umutima n' ubwenge . ||| but as human beings we have hearts and brains .
ntinkubaza ibyo bakuigishije , ||| therefore , i am not asking you about what you were taught .
ntakubaza amarangamutima yawe . ntakubaza uko ubiumva . wowe ubwawe , ||| i am asking you according to your conscience and beliefs .
umuntu akuiciye umwana , bamubwiye bati tuga ... tukarurae uriya muntu ukuiciye umwana , ||| on your behalf , if one said that they are going to bring someone who killed your child , would you be that kind to him ?
wunva ushobora kumugirair izo nbabazi ? cyangwa uvuga uti @: "@ uyu muntu njyae ukwe simushaka @"@ . ||| or would you say that you do n't even want to see him ?
uwo muntu abenshi bamwe barazitanga , abandi bakazimana . ||| such a person ... the majority forgives and others do n't .
wowe ubwawe , nkubajije wowe ubwawe , simvuga abandi . wowe ubwawe ari ibyakubayeho , ||| i 'm asking you personally , i 'm not asking you about others .
utaha ukasanga umwana wawe bamwishe . uwamwishe umubabarira ? ||| if it was a true story that happened to you , let us say one time you went home and found your child 's body lying there dead . can you forgive that person who may have killed your child ?
njyewe ubwanjye , nigeze nokuzitanga hari umuntu unyiciye umugore , nramubabarira ubu ari hanze . ||| personally there is a time i forgave someone who killed my wife . now he has been released .
ariko si muri jenoside , ni uburozi yamuhaye , arapfa . ||| but it was n't during genocide , that person used poison and she died .
ariko ubu turasangiraaga tukaan ... tukasangira tukatumiraan . ||| but later we reconciled and started sharing everything ; we would invite each other for events .
nnjyae nzimuha . ||| therefore i would forgive him .
bitewe n' umutima wanjye uba ugarutse , nzimuha . ||| my heart would be at ease to forgive him .
yee , ni icyo nagirango unbwirae . ||| well that is all i wanted you to tell me .
hanyuma , mu magambo make nragira ngo unbwirae imibereho yawe ... utubwiye ko hashize imyaka itanu n' amezi umunani ufunze , ni ukuvuga ko ufunzwe nko muri mirongo cyenda n' icyenda [ 1999 ] . ||| now would you tell us in brief , your life experience ; you told us that you have been in prison for 5 years and 8 month , which means you were arrested in 1999 .
nfunzwe icyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] , itariki 26 z' ukwa karindwi . ||| i was arrested on the 26th july 1998 .
mbere y' aho kuva muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , aho ubwicanyi buhagarariye , utubwira ubuzima uciyemo mu magambo make ? ||| after the genocide stopped in 1994 , what kind of life did you go through ? please tell us in brief .
muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] intambara imaze kuba abatutsi barapfuye , abantu turi tufite umutima nk' uw' bisimba . ||| in 1994 after the war when all tutsi had died , people were wild .
turi tufite umutima ... kuko abantu bari muri gikongoro usibye njyewe , ntabwo bari bameze neza . ||| everyone in gikongoro was bad except me .
ntashaka kukubaza . wigeze uhunga ? ||| i want to know if you fled .
ntinhunze . ||| no i did n't flee .
noneho nbabazaw n' abaturanyi turi tuturanye , ||| what hurt me were the neighbours i had whom i would no longer see .
bikatuma nnjyae binbabaza ntabwo nri meze neza mu mutaima wanjye . ||| that caused me a lot of pain in my heart .
ukomeje kubaho ubuzima busanzwe bw' umuturage wo mu kituragae ? ||| did you continue to live your life in the village like any other villager ?
yee . nkomeje kubaho ariko umutima wanjye ... nkaumva umutima urarya , nnjyae umutima wanjye ntiuri umeze neza , bitewe n' abantu bapfuye turi tuturanye . ||| yes i lived a normal life but i was n't happy at all because of the innocent people who had died .
nk' aho uri utuye ubonaaga nk' amatongo angahe ? ||| in the place where you lived , how many ruined houses were there ?
aho nri ntuye nbonaaga nk' amatongo ageze kuri atandatu . ||| where i lived , there were about six houses in ruin .
iyo uyabonaaga se , hari icyo bikuibutsaaga ? ||| whenever you would see them , would n't they remind you of something ?
byarakinyibutsaga , iyo nahataramiraga , iyo noherezaaga abana kujya kuharahura no kusaba amazi . nkabura aho njya kuyasaba , nkabura n' uwo tuganira , kandi twaranaguzanyaga no kuhinga , numvaaga muri njyewe umutima wanjye utameze neza . agahinda karanyicaaga , kubera kubura abo bavandimwe . ||| yes they would remind me of something because whenever i would like to send my children to my neighbours for some water , i could not because they were no longer there and yet there used to be people whom we would talk . it would really hurt me .
hagati aho utubwiye ko usa nk' uwafunzwe bitinze . ||| meanwhile , according to what you have said , it seems like it took long before you were arrested . but you are not telling us your life during all that period .
icyo kihae nabwo utubwirae kuva icyanda na kane [ 1994 ] kugera icyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] , ukuntu bije kugera aho urafungwa . ||| from 1994 to 1998 ... until you were arrested .
ukuntu bigezeho ... ukuntu bigezeho , uwo niciye umwana yari umuhutukazi uri ushatse ku mututsi aza kunrega . ||| what happened is that , the lady whose child i killed was a hutu but she had married a tutsi . so she reported me to the authorities and then i ran away from my home .
noneho nanga ... ntahunga nkazajya nrara mu bihuru ndaraguza . nta urugo rwanjye . ||| i let my home and i would sleep in bushes .
yakureze ryari ? ||| when did she report you ?
yanreze icyo kihae muri mirongo cyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] . baza kunfata bakaambura . ||| she reported me in 1998 but whenever they would come for me , i would run away .
ubaga mu gihuru ? ||| were you hiding in the bush ?
nbaga mu gihuru ||| yes i was hiding in the bush .
hafi y' iwawe ? ||| near your home ?
hafi y' i ... njyaaga za rukondo , nkatembera nkapagasa , nza nkaza ninjoro atareba . ||| near my ... i would go to a place called rukondo and then i would come back at night while no one was seeing .
bukacya nkamara nko mu nzu nihishe , ubundi nkagenda ntawe ubizi . ||| i would stay in the house for the whole day , and then go back when no one was aware .
nabo baje kufataw se ? ||| were they arrested too ?
ntibafashe bari hanze . ||| they were not arrested .
bagarutse iwabo , ||| they are out there in their homes .
ni njyae bafashe njyenyine . tufatanyaije kuica . ||| i am the only one who is in jail among all people we collaborated in the killings .
uje kufataw utae ? ||| how were you arrested ?
uko nfashwae , nri nrimo mpinga imuhair , ||| how the arrested me ... they got me from home where i was digging .
baza kunfata ubwo bahita banjyana kuri komine . bahita banfunga , ||| when they took me to the commune and imprisoned me .
mpageze mpita nemera ko nishe . ||| and when i reached there , i immediately i admitted that i committed the genocide .
ni nde ukufashe ? ||| who arrested you ?
nfashwae na konseye uwo nguwo , utuzanye hano i murambi , ||| the counselor arrested me ; the one who brought us here in murambi .
nfataw na banyumbakumi , nfataw n' uwo mututsi na none nici ... ucyuye ... ucitse ku icumu , ucyuye uwo mugorae wabo . ||| together with the local leaders they arrested me . and that tutsi survivor who married a hutu lady .
utubwiye ngo @: konseye uwo nguwo ni umukonseye wigeze kubazana mu kihae cy' ubwicanyi ? ||| you have told us that you were arrested by the counselor , is it the one who brought you during the time of killing ?
yee , niwe unfashe . ||| yes he is the one .
wigeze mu buhamya bwawe ... ||| did you talk about it in the testimony you gave ?
mu buhamya bwanjye no kuri dossier yanjye hose ariho . no mu kianika nrabuvuze ku kibuga . ||| in my testimonies and in my documents he is there . even in the testimony i testified in cyanika i mentioned him .
kuri dossier yanjye , abo bose bariho . ||| that was in kibuye . in my document all of them are mentioned .
nonese nk' mpamvu ubona bo batafataw , unatubwiye ko harimo umuyobozi ni iyihe ? ||| what could be the reason why they are not arrested and you have told us that some are leaders ?
nrabivuze igihe kinini , baravuga ngo @: bazabafatair ... bazabafata muri gacaca niko numva bavuga . nrabivuze baanga kubafata simbizi . ||| i said it for a long time and they said that they will arrest them in gacaca but i do n't know why they do n't arrest them .
hanyuma se nkawe , nk' umuntu uri muri gereza , iyo wunva hari ... umuyobozi uyoboye umurenge w' iwawe , ubwo ni ukuvuga ko ariwe utanga amabwiriza niwe ugombye kugaragariza ibibi . ||| you as a person who s in jail , when you hear about such ... a leader in your sector ... it means that he is the one who gives orders yet he is supposed to be the one revealing the wrong things .
uzi neza ko mwakoranye ikibi . ||| you are very sure that you all participated in the genocide .
ubwo ni iki uba utekereza kuri uwo murengae wawe ? ||| what do you thing about your sector ?
ntekereza kuri uwo murengae wanjye , ni uko nzahagera nkahagarara mu ruhamae rw' abantu , njyenda mpagurutsa umuntu tugiye tuica ... tufatanyaije ubwicanyi . n' iyo na konseye yaba ayoboye iyo nama , nawe namu ... nmuvuga ... nmuvugaho . ||| if i were given the opportunity to go back to my area , i would go pointing out the people we were with and even though that leader is among , i would name him too .
nyine nshatse kukubaza ubu , ku miyoborere y' umurenge wawe , ubungubu utahari . ||| i just wanted to know how you feel about the leadership in your sector in this time of your absence .
nk' umurenge wanjye uyoboraw n' umuntu uba yaraishe , nbibonamo yuko uwo muntu bamufata . ||| well , a place like my home sector , which is lead by a genocidaire , i suggest that person should be arrested .
ndi kukubaza uko ubitekereza ? ||| i am just asking you what you think about it .
icyo ntekereza nk' umuntu uyobora yaraishe . akayobora , ku bwanjye numva nta kintu ari kukora . ||| what i think about someone who is leading my home sector yet he killed , i guess he is doing nothing .
keretse uwamucisha mu ngando , akikuramo ibibi yakoze . kuko yakoze byinshi . ||| i think he should first go to solidarity camps and try to forget what he did because he did many things .
kuri wowe uraumva agiye mu ngando uri kaumva agiye mu ngando hari icyo yahindura ? cyangwa yanagiyemo ntabwo ubizi . ||| so you think if he went to solidarity camps he may change ? or maybe he went there but you are not informed ?
nta ngando arajyamo kuko ... yajya mu ngando se atae , ||| he has not yet gone there .
kandi atafunze , ari hanze ? ||| how can he go there yet he was not arrested ?
hari ingando zijya zibaho z' abayobozi . ||| but there are camps purposely for leaders .
ibyo yakoze arabiirengagiza ntiyabiemera , keretse ukuri kugiye ahagaragara ibyaha bikamufata . ||| he ignored and never admitted what he did , unless the truth is revealed and then his crimes will get him to jail .
kubyo umaze kuvuga se ubungubu ni ikihae cyifuzo cyawe utanga ? ||| of all what you have just said what would you suggest ?
kubyo maze kuvuga , ikifuzo ntanga ; ni uko ibyo nkoze biri bibi muri leta ya mbere . ||| based on all i have said , my wish is to let people know that all the bad deeds i did were of the past government .
none kuri leta y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ikaba ... na ... nshaka kugaragaza ukuri kw' ibyabaye . ||| and , now in this government of unity and reconciliation , i would like to testify what happened .
nkaba ukuri ngaragaza ni uko nkarura umutima ... umutima wanjye ubaye muzima , ku buryo nbana n' abantu . ||| and the truth i would like to show is how my heart was renewed and now i am human and i can live with other people .
tukabana tukaubaka u rwanda rutubyaye , ||| together we can build our motherland rwanda .
tukagaragaza ukuri ku bibaye tukabana n' abo tuiciye . ||| we should reveal the truth about what happened and live with those whose beloved ones we killed .
kabomboki ni nde ? ||| who is kabombeki ... ?
ni perezida yari yahaje perezida wo muri zambiya , ntinzi ... hari haje umuperezida ntinzi uwo ariwe . ||| he is the zambian ... anyway i do n't remember well which country he is the president of ...
ni thabo mbeki ? ||| is it thabo mbeki ?
yee , ||| yes , the president came while i was there .
ariko aha haje umuperezida nri mpari . icyo kihae perezida uri uhari yari bizimungu pasteur . turahaje turi abaturage nri ntarafungwa . nibuka ibibi nhakoreye , ||| by then bizimungu pasteur was the president of rwanda . i remember all of us came here and by then i was not yet imprisoned . and when we came here , i remembered all the bad deeds that i did here .
ariko baje kureba amagufwa , n' ibiki byose ... ariko umutima wanjye unkomanga , nti nnjyae nrahaje . ||| they had come to see the remains of people and several other things . but my heart was haunting me . deep down in my heart something was telling me , "@ you too came to attack here ! @"
nti banfata nzirega , ||| and i knew that once they get me i would say the truth .
nhise nbiirega ntawe ubinbwiye . ||| and indeed i admitted everything willingly .
iyo ntabivuga nta uri kubimenya , ||| of course if i had denied no one would have known what happened .
ni njyae ubiivugaiye ku giti cyanjye , kugira ngo na bariya bantu twa ... ||| therefore , i admitted everything personally so that even those people whom we ...
baza kukufata se uri urabivuze ? ||| had you ever confessed before they came to arrest you ?
baza kunfata ngeze kuri komini mpita nbivuga . ||| no i had n't , but i confessed immediately after i had reached the commune .
ariko iyo batakufata ntabwo uri kuzabivuga ? ||| but if you had not been arrested , would you have confessed ?
iyo batanfata , kuirega no kuemera icyaha ... iyo batanfata iyo hagira ubinshi ... uza kuvuga ati @: "@ nawe turi kumwe nri kuhita nbiemera . @" ||| i they had n't arrested me , reporting and admitting my deeds ... if they had n't got me ... if someone convicted me saying , "@ you were with us during those acts of killings . @" i would immediately have accepted it .
iyo ataza kubimenya se ? ||| what if she had n't known ?
uri ufite umutima wo kuzirega wowe ubwawe ? ||| did you want to report yourself ?
iyo ataza kubimenya , kubera ko nri nzi hari ahantu nri ngiye kwa responsable , kwa konseye hariya ... mwene wacu hariya kuko nvukaiye hano ku gikongoro . ||| if she did n't know , there is a place i went to ... at the local leader 's ... there at the counselor 's place . he was my relative because i was born there in gikongoro .
aranbwira ati @: "@ uzajyae kuirega bazakugabanyiriza . ati @: "@ uzavugae ibyo ukoze byose , ||| therefore , he advised me to go and report myself that they would reduce my punishment in case i did so . he told me that i should say all the roles i played in the genocide and stop living in the bushes .
ati @: uvae mu gihuru dore umaze kuzana amaga nk' ayo igikeri ati @: ||| i had started developing scale like those of a frog .
ujyae kuirega bazakugabanyiriza . @" ||| therefore i assured myself that if i report myself , my punishment would be reduced .
nri nfite imigambi yo kuirega , kuko nri maze kubona merewe nabi . ||| so in my plans i knew i would report myself because i had noticed that things had become worse in my life .
imirambo y' abantu bari aha urayibonye ? ||| have you ever seen people 's corpses that are lying here ?
yari myinshi cyane , nrayibonye . ||| i saw them ; they were very many .
uyibonye ryari ? ||| when did you see them ?
nyibonye ... nyibonye mu gitondo bamaze kupfa . babarashe . ||| i saw them in the morning when they had just died .
igihe ba perezida baza ahangaha ugiye kureba nawe imirambo ? ||| that time when the presidents came here , did you also go to see the corpses ?
igihe ba perezida baza ahangaha ntibatumye abaturage bajya yo . ||| when the presidents came , no citizen was allowed to go there .
nibo bagiye kureba . ||| it was only the presidents .
hari inkuru zivuga yuko bamaze kuica abantu bahise bajya ku bahamba . ||| but there is a rumor around that , after they had killed those people , did they rush to bury them ?
bahise bajya ku bahamba . ||| yes they buried them immediately .
bakoresha n' ibyuma ntinzi ... ||| what were they using ?
yee , bya torotoro . ||| tractors .
ntacyo ugizemo uruhare muri ibyongibyo ntabwo wigeze ufasha abandi kuhamba ? ||| did you play any role there ? did n't you come to help others ?
oya . ||| no .
ariko ayo makuru urayazi . ||| but you got that information ?
yee ayo makuru nrayazi . ||| yes , i got that news .
ayo makuru babataburura niyo nzi . aho bari barabahambye hariya . ||| i only know that information of how they were exhuming them from that place where they had buried them .
abaturage bari banzae kaubaha ... kuza kubataburura babahemba amafaranga leta ... iyi leta y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . ||| the citizens had refused to ... exhume and rebury the remains . therefore , the current government ; this government of unity and reconciliation had to pay them to do so .
ok , urakoze ||| okay , thanks .

ariko nyine iyo amateka agenda igihe yagiye aba wenda hari icyo bari kukora kugira ibyo babikingirire ? ||| but in history as time goes on they could have done something to stop it .
iii samateka nri kukora nkuko nabo bayakora , nuko batutabaye , n' icyo nbashimaiye , baratutabaye , n' ubu bakomezae batutabarae , batabarae abategetsi , batabarae abo basumba , batabarae nkuku , nkuku banfashe amafoto , bavugae bati uyu mukecuru arashingaanye ! banshingaane , ||| yeah , it 's history i also could have done like they can do , just like they saved us that 's what i can thank them , they saved us let them keep on saving us , save the leaders , save those that they are above , save like this , like they took my picture , they say that this old woman is insured
hanyuma ntakubaza inama muri rusangae yo kugirango nk' ibi ibyabaye bitazaongera kubaho n' iyihe nama uha abantu ||| so i ask you another , what is your message for this not to ever happen again , what can you tell the people ?
ni ukusenga imaan . ||| just to pray to god
nta kinri ubona mu mibanire ... ||| nothing else in the standard of living ........
n' ukusenga imaan ntaho njyewe ntinzabana nabo kuko banyiciye umwana ejobundi umuhungu , banyicira n' umugabo . ||| it 's just to pray but for me i will n't live with them because they killed my child and later my husband .
ntabwo se wunva ubwiyunge bwo ko bukenewe ? ||| so do n't you think reconciliation is required ?
nibiyunge , nibasohoke babashyirae hanze , nibamara kubasohora , bose babashyirae hanze , uwibye bakamufata bamurasaire aho . ||| let them reconcile , let them bring them out and after bringing them out , those who steal they catch him and shot him on spot .
wowe wunva ko uwakongera kukora ikintu nk' iki ngiki ari ukuicwa ? ||| you think someone who does something again like that should be killed ?
n' ukuicwa ! kuko aravuga ati ko nzaica , nkafungurwa , nzaba iki ? ||| his to be killed because he says that i will kill and i will later be freed from prison , what will happen to me ?
ni niba ukoze ikintu bakaba bakufashe , nibakwice , ||| if you do something and your caught let them kill you .
nibyo ubona mbese ubona ko hakwaiye kubaho ibihano bikomeye ? ||| that 's what you think ; you think there should be tough punishments ?
n' ibihano bikomeye bikazae , uwo hakurya avugae ati kanaka yishe none ibyo bakoze , nitubikora bakatufata ntawe baratuica ! ||| very tough punishments , some aside then says that somebody was killed , what he did we should n't do the same .
hanyuma se nkawe wa kera wigeze wunva ibi bintu bya amoko igihe yagiraiyeho , ||| so someone like of long ago did you ever hear the racism things when they started ?
jyewe ? ||| me ?
bigenze kutae bayashyiraho ? ||| how did it happen when they were starting racism ?
uwarutaga undi bara , uwarutaga undi baramu baramuryaniranaga bakavuga bati uriya mututsi ntakwaiye kubaho ||| someone who was greater than the other they would , they would talk about him and say that , that tutsi should n't live .
mbese uwo babonaaga yifite bamwitaga umututsi ? ||| so those who were rich were called tutsis ?
yiiiii , ubonaaga yifite ? babona uri umuhinzi ukora babona uri umuhinzi ukora ? bati uriya n' umututsi , ||| yeah , he would be wealthy .
atunze inka , bati nimumwice , tumwibe , tugirae tutae tujyae mu bye ||| when they could see you as a cultivator doing that kind of work ... then that one is a tutsi with cows , kill him and we still his belongings , then take over his .
mbese ubundi uraumva ko ibintu by' amoko bigiye bijyaho bikurikije nu nuko umuntu yari akize ? ||| so you can tell that this thing of racisms went according to how rich one was ?
uko yari afite , uko yari ameze ubundi bose bavaaga indi imwe , ukagira mwene nyoko ukavuka wamukibita amaso . ubona akuruta agiye kwa she agiye hariya yakorera uriya akamuhereza inka ati shyuuu ati wa mututsi baramuhaye ati umwice , nta kunri ||| it was according to what you had , in other words they were all like brothers and sisters and you had your sister and when you saw them being greater than you and doing something for that person and they gave them a cow and you like that tutsi is being granted that you should kill them .
bituma noneho ushaka kutubwira uko cyane abantu bagendaaga bapfa ibintu ? ||| then that can make you tell us how people killed each other because of property .
bapfaaga ibintu , uuu bapfaaga ibintu , ||| according to the property ... how they were ... you would set your eyes on your brother .
umuntu nkuwo mwana muri kumwe babona uko asa , babyara undi mwana ba batasa , bati uriya bamubyaraanye n' umututsi kandi ise wabo ari umwe , ||| when he become bigger than you and he worked for a someone that rewarded him with a cow , you say the tutsi has been rewarded . kill him . no other alternative
mbese ubwo n' ukuvuga wowe ibintu ubona bibaye mu rwanda ||| so to you see things that happened in rwanda
ibyabaye mu rwanda ni bya kera ||| what happened in rwanda is from long ago
birakurenze ? ||| it 's beyond your imagination .
biranrenze , uuuh ||| it 's beyond my imagination .
ariko se na none uru rwanda ko rukeneye kubaho ||| but still rwanda needs to live .
tukeneye kubaho , ua uzakukunda ? ubu ngubu bira biraruhije , nibabafungure kusa , ||| we need to live , who likes you ?
baze bagae iwabo bakorae uwo basenyeye bamwubakire , uwo basenyeye bamwubakire , nibamara kumwubakira nibyo babanae , uwa uwiteye hejuru bamufatae bamusubizaemo ntazavamo azavamo ntabwo azavamo . ||| now it 's difficulty , let them free them from prison , let them come home and build for those that they destroyed for and after that they live and anyone who put his head up they put him back to jail and never let him out .
naho nko se kubierekeye gacaca unayizi yakera , iyubu ubona yakorwa itae ? ||| so what about the gacaca courts you know it since long ago ? how do you think it should work now days ?
iyubu , iyubu , umva , gacaca y' ubu abenshi baishe barapfuye ! ||| the one of today , listen many of those who killed are already dead !
bagiye baiahura , yewe n' abanjye banteraaga no hirya aha kuru uyu muhanda bahambyemo abantu hano ku muharuro , ku muharuro wanjye hano babonye ko bapfuye baravuga bati uriya mukecuru ubwo asigaye aratuvuga bahita baiahura . ||| some of them committed suicide even mine just near here on that street they buried them here on the yard they saw that they were left and said that his old woman is going to report us and they committed suicide
ariko se nk' impanuro utuha kugirango gacaca igendae neza abanyarwanda baongerae babae abanyarwanda ni mpanuro ki ? ||| but what can you really tell us so that our gacaca can go accordingly and people live together ?
cyane tushaka kumenya nko kubierekeye ukuri ||| mostly we want o know about he truth
ukuri , ukuri n' ukugirango bazanae cya kiuma ||| truth , the truth is for them to bring the other machine
kimeze kutae ? ||| how is it like ?
kirahari , kirahari mwimpisha , we ntubizi jyae nrabwira abarimo hariya muri kiriya kigo babazaane babafungurae bazanae icyuma babashyirae icyuma hirya no hino uwakoze icyaha wese azazamo , nnjyae bazampamagare , nnjyae bazampamagare ||| it 's there do n't hide it from me , you do n't know that i am telling those who are in that camp bring them , free them and the put the machine on both sides and those who participated will be seen , and they should call me also .
ubwo cg urashaka kutubwira ko ibintu byo kaunga harimo harimo ababibonaaga , ||| really or you want to tell us in reconciling there those who were watching ?
eee , harimwo aba n' ababibonaaga , ||| there are those who were watching ,
n' ukuvuga ngo abo babibonaaga bashobora kugira umuganda batanga bakasobanura uko ibintu bigenze ? ||| or you want to tell us that the things of reconciliation there those who were observing it
eee bakabivuga , uuuh ||| there those who saw it .
hanyuma se nka wowe ubona cyane icyatumye iyi genocide iba abantu baaka ......... ||| on your behalf what do you think was the cause of the genocide to the people ... ?
n' inda nini , n' inda nini no kujya kuzaungura , bakavuga bati uyu ntitumushaka , uriya yarize , ||| selfishness , selfishness and wanting to have other people 's belongings , they could say , we do n't want this one , he is educated , he 's been to europe , my brother mussa twagirimana is stuck in europe .
agira amashuri agira kujya iburayi agira ku hari na da na musaza wanjye uheze iburayi , witwa mussa twagirimana yaheze iyo yagiye ku bwa kera bashaka kumwica ubu niyo ari . ||| where he went long ago when they wanted to kill him and now he is still there .
urabona ibyinshi bishingaiye noneho ku mururumba inda nini ||| so you think most of it is based on greediness ?
n' umururumba ! ||| it 's greediness
hanyuma se kugirango ibyo bitazaongera ingamba zafataw n' inki izihe ? ||| so for that not to happen again what can be done ?
nibaze bahingae , baze bakorae , ugize nabi ugize impanuka imutwarae , ugira kuvuga ati ntashaka ibi n' ibi no kuanga undi agendae bamujyanae . ||| let them come and cultivate , let them come and work those who do bad things ... have accidents , he who says that i want this or i hate this is should be taken
hanyuma se nkawe nk' inama ubwo utuha ya nyuma ||| what advice can you give us ?
iya nyuma nimufungurae ba bariya ba ba banzae kuvuga bati ntago tuise , none ubwo tutaishe wenda muturekerae ibyo kandi koko harimo aba abataishe bavuga bati ntituishe , harimo uwarebaga , ||| the last one , free those who say that they did n't kill , since we did n't kill let us free .
harimo n' umuhungu wanjye uriya uri ahantu iririma mwene bekerinka , witwa nta kabanyura , we yazize ngo yuko uwo yari yarahishe mbere nyuma asubiyeyo baongeye bagarutse bica uwunri baramubaza bati ngaho , tubwirae abaje iwawe bari baje kuica wa muntu arihae ? ||| there some people who say that they did n't kill , and indeed they did n't kill , some were watching there is also my son who is in ririma son of bekerinka , also called kabanyura , he had hidden a person and later he was killed , so he was asked , people came to your home came and killed him where were you ?
umuhungu ati ntabwo nbizi ko aribo bamwishe , ati tubwirae abo aribo ? nicyo kimuhejejemo . ||| he said , i do n't know it 's them who killed him , tell us who were they ? that is what has gotten him stuck in there .
n' abandi n' abandi n' abandi , naho abaishe koko bavuga bati twaraishe baraishe , ||| and many others but those who say we did kill when they did .
ariko akantu ka gaci kaciye bugufi ka kantu ka ka nyamuherairw , kakaba kafunze , ||| but the simple like him in prison .
bariya bakomeye bavuga bati twaraishe kariya nigaheremo , ntabwo kaishe . ||| the great say we killed but he did n't let him stay in prison .
ubundi ahangaha , utubwiye ko uhishe abantu benshi babagaho kutae ? ubonaaga ibyo kubagaburira kutae ? ||| you told us that you managed to hide many people , how did they survive ? where did you get what to feed them ?

mbese ntabwo wigeze wiyambaza abaturanyi ? ||| so you never asked for help from you neighbors ?
reka da ! uwo niambaje nuwo umwe njyanaagayo umuntu ||| no , only one to whom i took people to .

baravuga bati ngaho rero kubita umurambo , ||| at that time when he left they caught him and he gave them a bull for them to let him go so he was told to bet up a corpse .
ngo akubita umurambo nicyo bamufungaiye , ntawe yishe , ariko akaba afunze . ||| he ran off but now his in jail yet never killed .
ubwo afungaiye nyine ibyo ngibyo yemeye kukora . ||| so his in prison only for what he accepted to do ?

bavuga ko abakozi babo bavuga baumvise ukuntu bari bumwice , w' umupasiteri , mbese yari omoniye ishyogwe hariya kwa musenyeri musabyimana , ubwo bavuze uko bari bumwice , ||| i thought of hiding him and i looked for trees and dug this hole four meters deep five meter wide , and i dragged the ground like this and then i took off the ceiling of the house and i took it to the hole and covered it .

bakasanga inzu mbese nta kintu kirimo , nta muntu urimo nta nicyo barya kirimo ariko bibereye hariya muri uriya mwobo . ||| no one was in there and there was nothing to eat for them yet the people were out there in the hole .
ubwo bujene nawe tukaba turi tuziraanye aza kubinsaba kubera ubwoba icyo kihae umuntu bafataaga yarahishe abatutsi barabicanaaga , ||| then bugene with whom we went way back came of fear at to ask for refuge for his people .
noneho nnjyae nbona amaze nk' umuntu ungenza nramuhakanair , ||| at that time people who they found hiding tutsis they would kill them all , i did n't believe him i thought he was a spy .
kugeza ubwo yaje kubinbwira mbese numva nawe ko afite abantu yabuze uko agira nbwira ngo bari buze kumusenyair , ni hakurya aha , ||| i said no up to when he told me that he had people and he did n't know what to do with them . he told me that they were about to come and demolish his house .
nramubwira nti niba ubyiyemeje , mbese kuko uraumva nta kurobanura umuntu n' undi byose yari umuntu kandi kupfa byose ni kimwe , jyae nravugaaga nti uko bansangaan bano batanu nuko bansangaan cumin na bane niko bigenda , ubwo nramubwiye araza anfasha kucukura uno mwobo wa hano twa ||| i said ok if you are willing , there is no making choices on one person to another and dying was all the same if they found me with five or sixteen it 's all the same , i told him that and he helped me digging some more

ubwo tutangiye kuwucukura satanu z' ijoro irondo ritashye , tuwurangiza samunani turatindaho , ||| we started digging at eleven when they had stopped the patrol and we finished at two in the morning .
kabisa ubwo nvanaho plafond , ||| i removed my ceiling and we used it to cover the trench .
tushyiraho , tumaze kushyiraho turasiba , nri nfite ibiti hano by' imivumu na siple nrazana ntasasair hano hari insina kuko umwenge uri uri mu nkuni hano y' insina tumaze kuhasasair mbese abantu bajya baza ntibagirae ikintu babona , ||| we ceiled it with soil and i had many .... trees and the charismas trees there i brought them used them to prepare it and then we covered it since the hole was towards that banana tree .
nbaje gusaka hano munzu hano ntibagirae umuntu basangamo bibereye mu myobo , ||| those who came in for searching could n't see a thing . the people were in the holes outside .
usibye ko imvura iyo yagwaaga nbavanaagamo nkabashyira munzu mbese abaturage bakababona ariko imvura igaw ariko hariya hakurya , ariko imvura yahita nnjyae ngatanguranwa nkabazanamo , kuburyo nta muntu wigeze arabukwa , ||| at times when it used to rain i would get them out and put them into my house even the other residences could see them but it would be raining and when the rain is almost over , i would hurry up and get them back into the holes so that no one ever saw them .
ubwo igihe kiza kugera intambara irarangira , inkotanyi zaigeze ino nibwo bavuyemo , tuhita tujyana tuca muri iriya zone inkotanyi zari zafashe nuko , ||| a time came when the war ended and the inkotanyi arrived they got them out and we went to the part which they had conquered .
ngaruka inaha mu kwezi kwa karindwi , intambara irangiye . ||| i came back in july after the war .
ariko ubwo kukukubita hari nkababaga batanze udukuru ||| in beating they must have been people spreading rumors ?
eeee , n' abantu babaga batanze amakuru babaga babonye bavamo bagiye kaugama noneho bakavuga bati abantu bajya kaugama hariya imvura yahita tujya kubareba ntitubabonae , niho ikibazo kivaaga , ||| people would have said it those who saw them going for shelter , and they would say that people go for shelter in there yet after we look for them we do n't find them , that was the puzzle .
hari ibyo bavuga hari igihe hari igihe hari abigeze kuvumurwa , noneho abaturanyi murafatanya , ||| people say that some were found in there hiding , and neighbors helped you .
ntinzi icyo ubitubwiraho ||| what can you tell us about that ?

abavumbuwe bari ahagana he ? ||| where were those whom they discovered ?
bari muri uyu mwobo wa hano ||| they were in this hole right here .
bavumbuwe bigenze kutae ? ||| what caused them to be discovered ?

noneho abaturage bahita bahabona hari nko mu masaa mu ma sa saba , abaturage bakabonye rero bahita baza babikurho , ||| the people then saw her it was like at 1 pm , they came and removed the cover .
ariko fpr yari yageze inahangaha bifata ubusa nta numawe wigeze agira icyo aba , bose uko ari cumi na bane bose bariho . ||| the rpf had arrived in this area so nothing happened and no one was hurt . all the fourteen are still alive .

bazize jenocide kuko nziko icyo kihae nubwo ubundi biitwaaga kuhorera bucyaan ariko bucyaan yari sdr . ||| they were victims of genocide because i know that despite the fact that they called it revenging bucyana , but bucyana was a sdr
sdr ryari ishyaka riikoma abatutsi kumugaragaro rivangura icyo kihae baishe abatutsi . ||| cdr was a political party that openly hated tutsis with divisionism , they killed tutsis then

ati bite nti indege barayihanuye ati none tuhungae tuhungirae he nti nraumva tuca ibutamwa tukagera mubugesair . ||| that the plane was shot down , "@ we should we flee to ? @" he asked and i said we could pass butamwa up to bugesera
kubera iki nfite isambu hariya numvaaga abaturage batwambutsa mu mazi . ||| because i have a land there and i felt the locals could help us cross over the lake
niko nibazaaga icyo kihae ati muri ikigicuku aribaza ati tujyae kureba kayije . ||| that 's what i thought at that time and he wondered whether we should go and see kayije in the middle of the night
turazamuka tubyutsa kayije turavuga tunanirwa kufata icyemezo mugitondo nibwo radio yatanze itegeko ngo nta muntu ugomba kuva ahari . ||| i climbed up and woke kayije up and talked but failed to come to a decision . in the morning there was a law passed on radio that no one should leave where he is
tuhera mu mazu dutyo tumaze kuhera mu mazu rero mu ma saa tanu itariki indwi umudamu w' inrera araza . ||| we stayed in the house and at 11 o'clock on the 7th a woman from ndera came

....... umugore aranbwira ati turajya kwa kayije ni kure urabona kuca inberae y' iwanjye ukagera inberae yo kwa kayije . ||| ...... the woman told me "@ going to kayije 's , is far you see passing in front of my place up to in front of kayije 's
..... ho ntinharota ..... cloture yari ihari nawe yarahigawaga ntinshoboraaga kuba njyayo . ||| i can not dream of it @"@ ... the fence was there and he was also being sought after and i could not go there
kugeza ubwo nkaumva abo numva duhuje ibibazo aribo nhungiraho . ||| up to when i felt those with whom we shared a problem were the ones i could flee to
ntekereza noneho kujya kwa mucyo nshoboraaga kujya kwa twagiramungu turi tuturanye . ||| i decided to go to mucyo , i could go twagiramungu 's with whom we were neighbours
ariko ntinigeze nbitekereza noneho niko kuhungira rero kwa mucyo ngezeyo rero baje kurasa . ||| but i never thought about it , and that 's when i fled to mucyo 's
nrabiibuka icyo kihae aterefona i nyamirambo amarira amubunga mu maso . ||| i remember he the time he called nyamirambo tears filling his eyes
hari nubundi bigeze kuza iwange kumanywa n' abasirikari nabwo kunyica barambura . ||| there is another time when they came to my place during the day with soldiers to kill me but did not find me there
nibwo nuriraaga nyine nragenda tuihisha murubingo ngirango nba oscar ariko ntabwo tuhungaanye . ||| that 's when i climbed while hiding in bushes , i think with the oscars but we did not flee together
ariko ntabwo tubunze hamwe bamwe babunraga ukwabo abandi ukwabo . ||| but we did not flee to the same place , some gathered together and others did the same
babunze murubingo .......... wose mbunda murubingo abana baraza barankurikira baraza turabunda . ||| they fled to the bushes ..... they gathered in the bushes and the children followed me and we gathered there
noneho bigeze mu kabwibwi nbona umuntu uvanyeho rideau . ||| in the evening i saw someone draw the curtain
niwe wamwana yahoze avuga umuzungu avanaho rideau nragenda ni .... n' abana umuzungu ati ....... nti ntabwo tuva munzu . ||| that 's what the other youngster said , a white man drew the curtain and i went ... and the children and the white man said that we should not leave the house
aterefona musenyeri ati witwa nde ndamwibwira ati hari umuntu witwa safari uje kuihisha hano nbigenze ntae ? ||| he called the msgr and asked "@ what 's your name ? @" i told him and he said "@ there is someone called safari who has come to seek refuge here what should i do ? @"
ruhumuriza ati baramuka bamenyeko yahageze byo byonyine barakuica . ||| ruhumuriza said that if they find out that he is a round they will kill you
ahubwo kera n' imaan ya nyoboyeyo ........ agacupa na murenzi tukamanuka tuganira umutima ukanbwira . ||| i think it was god who led me there .... a bag , and murenzi sloping conversing and my heart told me
uzihishe hariya nbonaaga ikizu kinini kiri inyuma ye ariko siho nihishe nihishe kuri uwo . ||| you should hide there , i could see a big house behind but that 's not where i hid , i had at that one 's place
kugeza rero ubwo npakiraiye mubyukuri nuko bigenze icyo njyaaga kusobanura nuko le 07 . ||| up to when i survived , honestly that is what happened , what i want to explain is that on the 7th
itariki makumyabiri nebyiri ......... mbese nratunguwe saa yine ngo urapfa saa tanu kandi ni wowe uri bupfae . ||| the 12th .... i was surprised at 10 that you are going to be killed
icyo kihae baraje batera isahinda ariko nta muntu baishe muri quartier . ||| they attacked at another time but no one in the area was killed
ngirango iyo banbona bari kunyica niyo babona karipoforo bari kumwica . ||| i think if they had seen me they would have killed even if they had seen karipoforo they would have killed him
nicyo bari bagambairiye uwo ku itariki 22/02 nyuma yizo tariki byo biri ibindi rero . ||| that what they had planned on the 22nd of february , after that date was a whole different story
ntabwo barobanuraaga baricaaga k' umurongo nibyo nshakaaga kaongeraho kusa . ||| they did not discriminate they killed in row , that all i wanted to add
rw' abametodiste bigeze nijoro bateramo grenade . ||| for the methodists and when night fell they threw a grenade in it
abantu bapfairmo nrambaije muri korodoro aranbwira ati wicare muri korodoro urambye . ||| people died in it while i was lying in the corridor and he told me to sit in the corridor with my legs straight
nraicara ndarambya araza aranbwira ati hahanri unzae kujya ufite ukuri barimo barahaicira abantu . ||| and i sat and he came and told me that where you refused to go , you were right they are killing people there
nibyo nshakaaga kusa kaongera kubuhamya bwerekeranye n' itariki makumyabiri nebyiri . ||| that 's all i wanted , to add on the testimony concerning the date 22nd
n' itariki indwi yonyine y' ukuakaane muw' igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| and the 7th only of april of 1994
nagirango usubiramo usubiramo ibyo ku itariki makumyabiri n' ebyiri . ||| i would like you to repeat what happened on the 22nd
hari aho mwavuze muti ubwambere nshatse kuhungira kwa kayije ariko nbona ari kure . ||| there is a point where you said "@ at first you wanted to flee to kayije 's but it was far
nuko nerekeza kwa mucyo wongeraho uti nri nturanye n' umugabo twagiramungu . ||| and i went to mucyo 's @" and you added "@ i was neighbours with a man called twagiramungu
ese nimpamvu ki zabikuteye ? ||| what made you do this ?
umva yari kumwe na mugenzi none se uraumva nri kuhungira k' umuntu uri kumwe na mugenzi nziko mugenzi tutakivuga rumwe . ||| listen , he was with mugezi so do you think i could seek refuge from a man who was with mugenzi knowing that we did not agree
nuko nta kaizerae narimufitiye kuko nrinziko ari muri ..... tutavuga rumwe . ||| did not trust him because he was amongst .... people with whom we did not agree
kandi rero sicyo kusa n' igihe cya bucyaan baza kunsenyair . ||| that 's not all , even the time of bucyana they destroyed my house
igihe cya bucyaan turi tufite amarembo afatanyae . ||| during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected
baza kuntera irye yararifunze ntinmenya n' impamvu . ||| during the time of bucyana we had gates that were connected
umva nribajije nti ese none si ukugirango abazaza kunyica batazayobera iwe . ||| i wondered could n't it be that when they come to kill the do not mistake his place for mine
niko ntekereje . ||| that 's what i thought
itariki indwi ibyo byo nri ndi kwa cyo ubanza twabacunze ntaho mbese n' itariki ya karindwi z' ukuakaane muri mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| on the 7th , i was at ..... it 's like we were watching them , it was the 7th of april 1994
hari mu ma saa saba wa mukani kuko nyakaubahaw mucyo yari afite abantu bacunga . ||| it was around 1 o'clock because honourable mucyo had people keeping watch
kuko muterefonnye nti ngiye kuhungira iwawe yaranbwiye ati ntucae inberae . ||| because when i called him that i 'm coming to seek refuge at your place and he told that "@ do n't come forward @"
ati hari abantu bari gucunga noneho impamvu kutwika bari baziko ngo tukiri mu mazu . ||| that there are people watching
kuko baducungaga ngo bari baziko ntaho tugiye turi mu mazu kuko baducungaga . ||| because they watched us they thought we had n't gone anywhere and were still in our houses .
ejobundi niho nbimenye ngiye mukigarama mukutangayo ubuhamya . ||| the day before yesterday is when i came to know this when i went to kigarama to testify .
muri gacaca ya kigarama niho nmenyeko twagiramungu barinaba mugenzi wanjye tuturanye . ||| in the gacaca court of kagarama i found out that twagiramungu who was my colleague who was my neighbour
ngo bantwikiye ngo baziko ndi muri prafo nge nri ntarabimenya kugeza uwo munsi . ||| burnt my house because they thought that i was in the ceiling but i did not know that up that day .

aho abanyarwanda bajyaaga basanga imaan niho bagiye bahungira mu bihae bya genocide . ||| during the genocide , rwandans often went to hide in places where they used to go to pray god
baziko basangayo ya mana yajyaaga ibafasha siko bibaye ahenshi bicaiyewmo ||| thinking they would find the very god who used to help them . however it was not the case ; most of time they were killed there .

unatubwirae icyo abajandarume mwayoboraga bari barinze aho ngaho kandi abantu barapfa buri munsi ? ||| you shall explain to us the above relationship and tell us the importance of your gendarmes considering that people died every single day .

ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi z' ukwezi kwa gatandatu nbonye nbonye mu binyamakuru baraanditse ngo nijyae uri uyoboye icyo gitero cy' interahamwe zateye kuri eglise kuris t famille , ||| on june 17th , i read in newspapers that i headed the interahamwe 's attack to sainte @-@ famille .
ibyo ntago bishobokaicyo kihae fpr yakoze operation yo kukura abaturage muri centre st paul interahamwe bararakara bavuga ko bagiye kutera ibigo byose , ||| it is impossible @: at that time , rpf had carried out an operation and took people from saint @-@ paul . the interahamwe became angry and decided to attack all institutions .
bateye hotel mille collines , batera eglise st famille bagerageza no kujya kutera cathedrale st michel . ||| they attacked hotel de mille collines , sainte @-@ famille church and tried even to attack saint @-@ michel cathedral .
jyae nka commanda rero nkubwiye uko nkoze baranbwiye ngo kuri hotel mille colline barangije kusatura inzugi , bagejeje abntu kuri reception , ||| as a commander , i already told you what i did . i was told that the doors of hotel de mille collines had just been broken and that people had already been taken up to the reception desk .

uraumva ko jyewe icyo gitero bavuga nri nyoboye barabeshya kuko nri muri hotel mille collines nbanbonye barahari hari uwimana hari abo bose niho nri ndi icyo gitero ntago nri nkirimo kuko nri niberae muri hotel mille collines . ||| you can see well that saying i headed the attack is pure lies because i was at hotel de mille collines . here are even people who saw me . i can see them here . there is uwimana and others . i was not part of that attack ; i was at hotel de mille collines .
nyakaubahaw turagirango tukubaze , ||| we would like to ask you a question sir !

uwo muntu yarahaguye , . ||| the man died there .

jyewe nkubwiye yuko abajandarume nohereje kuri abajandarume nohereje kuri abajandarume bari bari kuri hotel mille collines , eglise st famille , centre st paul bari aba compagnie territoriale yari nyarugengae ya groupement kigali . ||| i told you that the gendarmes i sent to mille collinnes , sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul belonged to the nyarugenge territory company of kigali formation .

bacecekae tugiye kugera turabaha ijambo , ||| keep quiet ! we are about to give them the floor .
mukanya nako kantu nagirango usobanurae . ||| we only want you to explain that minor issue .
abantu baravuze ngo abantu muri ubwo buhamya bakuhaye baravuze ngo nijyae uri uyoye icyo gitero , ||| in the testimonies you received people said that i headed the attack !
jyae nkubwiye ko ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi y' ukwezi kwa gatandatu jyae nri kuri hotel mille collines tuirirwa turwana n' interahamw zo kuri hotel mille collines nhavuye njyana na padiri uwimana kujya kuzana abantu bari bari muri kwa padiri veneche kwa musenyeri veneche nbatwara inshuro ebyiri muri cammionet , ||| i told you that on june 17th i was at hotel de mille collines . we had been fighting the interahamwe there all along the day . from there i went with father uwimana to pick people from father veneche 's .... bishop veneche 's . i carried them in two rounds in my pickup .
ariko depite rugema yavugaaga ngo ntwaye abantu muri cammionet ngo ngiye kubica . ||| surprisingly , mp rugema said that i was going to kill them .
hari abajandarume bawe ||| there were your gendarmes
natago nbimenye ||| i did n't know it
eeh uwo muntu yarahaguye n' umuryango we kandi yari atuye iruhande rwa st michel ||| eeh ... i got it ! the man and his family died . he lived near saint @-@ michel
na rapport nbonye abapadiri bampaye banbwiye ko abantu bahungiye muri cathedrale st michel nta muntu uhaguye niko njyae abapadiri banbwiye . ||| according to the report i had from the priests , no one of the people who had escaped to saint @-@ michel cathedral died . i was told that .
reka tukomezae , ||| let 's go on !
tutangae ijambo ku baturagae tuumvae icyo babivugaho ubundi ibindi byo inteko yo ibyinshi ugiye ubivaagaho ariko nonehoi reka tuhae ijambo abaturage kugirango wunvae . ||| let 's give the floor to the audience and listen to their views . you have actually talked about everything . let 's now listen to the population ; you will get their views as well
buretse nongerae ngirae icyo nvuga ||| allow me to add something !
ariko muri makeya ? ||| try to be brief
muri makeya , ngirango ibi bintu mubikurikirane neza , ||| in a word , i would like to ask you to carefully investigate this case .
ejobundi mu kwezi kwa karindwi 2004 , abacitse ku icumu bose bari bari muri iriya zone ku isabukuru y' imyaka icumi bashimaiye abayobozi b' igihu ko babatabaye , ||| some days earlier , at the tenth anniversary july 2004 , all the survivors who were living in that area praised the government authorities for having saved them .
uwari ubahagarariye yaravuze ati mushimirae na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ututabaye ntabwo nbeshya nimushaka musakuzae commanda wa division uri uhari yabagejejeho ubwo butumaw ari hano abibasobanuraire , ||| their representative said @: "@ you should also thank also lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi who came to us for help @"@ . you may make noise yes , but i am not lying ! the division commander who delivered the message is here himself ; he might explain it to you .
n' urubanza kukourimo kunbaza ngo ugiye kubwira abantu ngo banzae banshinjae kandi ejobundi nibo banshimiraaga ||| it is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . the very people who were praising me just some days ago !
nyakaubahaw ntabwo nvuze ko bakushinja ||| i did not mean to accuse you , sir !
ejobundi nibwo banshimaiye kumugaragaro banantumaho ngo baranshimira . ||| they have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me .
ibyo ngibyo ni byiza ni ngombaw , ||| that is a good thing . any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it .
k' umuntu ukoze neza baramushimira ibyo rwose ntago nvuze ngo abantu bakushinjae n' ukuvuga ngo tugomba kutanga ijambo kumpande zose ngiye kubanza mu ntaeko kugirango tuumvae nabo icyo bavuga . ||| i have not said that people must accuse you . we only have to let the two sides speak . we go to the court panel first and listen to their views .
uvuze ko utanze amategeko , ||| you said that you gave orders .
utanze amategeko ntiwayakurikirana ? ||| did you give orders and did not follow them up ?
aho hantu harimo ikibazo hapfuye abantu barenga ijana na mirongo inani ntimubimenye mutuye muri kigali kandi umuntu wo muri quartier apfuye imodoka imugonze tukahurura nk' umunyarwanda uri ukomeye mu buyobozi bw' icyo kihae mwagombaga kuba mwarabimenye ? ||| the problem arises there . more than 180 people died but you did n't know it . however , we know that when a person dies of a car accident in an area , we all come to see .
mwagombaga kumenya ibyo bene wanyu bakoze , ||| as a high @-@ ranked rwandan in the time , you should have known that .
nubwo iyo compagne territoriale yari iyobowe n' undi arko mwari mufite ubushobozi bukomeye aho rero ntago uvuga ngo tusobanukiwe . ||| you should have known what your colleagues were doing . tough the territory company was commanded by someone else , you had enough power yourself . you can see that we did not get the point well .
ngirango yagirango akufatae mu mugongo akwreke ko nta gahunda tushyizeho yo kukushinja . ||| i think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you .
kandi akuibutsa kugirango wibuke neza anakuereka niba abo bantu ubajijwe baranapfuye nk' umuyobozi ugombaaga kumenya imipfire yabo bantu nibyo yakubwiraaga , ||| he also reminded you that , as a leader , you should have known the death of the people you have been asked about . that is his point .
reka tuongerae tutangae ijambo ahubwo . ||| we go over to someone else
murakoze president w' inteko twagirango tubaze bwana munyakazi mu makuru tufite hari umugororaw witwa rutabana uri utuhaye amakuru ko ibihe byinshi mwakundaga kuba muri kuri st famille muri kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka kandi ko ibintu uwo mugororaw yakoraaga byose mwabaga mubizi ayo makuru ntimwaba mwayibagiwe tukaba tuyabaibukije ? ||| thank you mister president . according to the information we have ... there is a prisoner called rutabana who told us that you usually used to come to sainte @-@ famille with father munyeshyaka and that you were aware of all the things the prisoner could do . i want to ask you mister munyakazi ; do n't you think you might have forgotten that information and that you have just been reminded ?
murakoze ko hari n' imirambo mwaba mwarajyanye bataba baramenye aho mwayijyanye ? nabyo mwabitubwira ? ||| it is also said that you might have taken some bodies and that the place where you took them is still unknown . you may also tell us about that . thank you !
murakoze , ||| thank you .
iyo bus y' umutuku ntayo ngendaagamo rwose ngendaaga muri hilux y' umweru . ||| i never drove that red bus .
iy' umutuku ntabwo nigeze nyigendamo n' umushoferi wanwaye wanwaraga ari muri police nationale ntabwo ngenze muri bus y' umutuku ubwo uraumva ko hari undi muntu bavuga utari lieutenant colonel munyakazi . ||| i had a white hilux pickup . even my driver belonged to the national gendarmerie . i never travelled in the red bus . you can see it is someone else they are talking about not lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
icyo ngicyo tukikuraeho iyo bus y' umutuku ntabwo yagendaagamo lieutenant colonel ||| let 's forget about that ; the red bus never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
turimo kuburana niho bigeze rwose ubu ngubu ||| no this is a trial . it is being proceeded right now !
ntago ari ukubaraan wenda uretse ko ikibazo kibajije uburyo bwe ariko si ukuburana ||| it is not a trial . he has just asked his question in his own way but this is not a trial .
icyo kibazo kikuraeho byose na confusion zose iyo camionnet y' umutu babonye ntabwo yigeze igendawmo na lieutenant colonel munyakazi , ||| that question must remove all confusions . the red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
ikindi cya kabiri ntakubwiye ba nyakaubahaw mugize urukiko gacaca nrimo kubona bahimba ibintu ngo babingerekaeho kandi nrakoze uko nshoboye ngo nbatabarae . ||| the second thing i did n't mention , i guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , is that i see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas i did my best to protect them .
ikindi igihe bombe zagwaaga kuri eglise st famille nraje ubwanjye njya muri eglise st famille njya kuhumuriza abaturage ngiyeyo tufata abarwayi croix rouge yategekawaga na kayiranga bajya kubavuza muri croix rouge , ||| once saint @-@ famille church was being fired at . i myself went to sainte @-@ famille church to console the population . we took sick people and they went to be treated in red cross infirmary . red cross was chaired by kayiranga in the time .
iyo modoka y' umutuku rwose bababwiye ubwo icyo kirego mukinvanaeho kivaeho ntinigeze nyigendamo . ||| i never travelled in the red car . remove that accusation completely .
nyakaubahaw icyo n' ikirego uzaburana niba kinahari , ||| that is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , sir ! of course if it is one .
ariko wunvae ko ntakuburana n' ukugirango tumenye kusa tusobanukirwae ntagobwo tuje tuje kuca urubanza tuje kukira ubuhamya bwawe nkuko wabwisabiye . ||| we have not come for trial . you should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself .
ariko murimo kunbaza ibyo babwiye ||| you are asking me what you 've been told though .
yeah , barakubaza bagirango basobanukirwae kusa ariko si ukuburana , ||| of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial .
reka mpe undi mugenzi wanjye akubaze . ||| i go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well .
na rutabana uri ushinzwe kutanga ibiryo mu nkambi y' impunzi gira icyo utubwira ||| court panel according to rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp
ntabwo kiri ikirego yagirango amenye , ||| it was not an accusation . he just wanted to know .
uraumva ibiryo byo atri ikirego kuko ntawe utarya . ||| food can not be an accusation because everyone eats .
aravuga ko nkoranye niyo nterahamwe kutanga ibiryo kandi lietenant colonel uri mu ntiambara ntabwo yabona igihe cyo kujya kutanga ibiryo mu mpunzi . ||| he is saying i and the interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people .
nagirango mabze ikibazo kikaubahaw colonel munyakazi yatanze ingero muri mille collines , muri st famille , no muri st paul , ahantu hose yagiye agerageza kugirair neza abanyarwanda , ||| court panel i want to ask a question . mister colonel munyakazi has just examples such as mille collines , sainte @-@ famille , and saint @-@ paul and he tried to help rwandans everywhere .
yabikoraaga ku manywaibyo aribyo byose nagirango mubaze niba hari abantu babanyamakuru baba barabonye icyo kikorwa cyiza yakoze . ||| probably he was doing that during the day . i would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action .
murakoze ||| thank you !
eeh , ||| right !
abanyamakuru bo mu rwanda cg bo mu mahanga kuri icyo kibazo , ||| about that question ... do you mean rwandan journalists or foreign ones ?
kuri icyo kibazo , kuva muri 1992 , ||| about that question ... about that question ... from 1992 ... from 1994 ... if you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people .
kuva muri 1994 niba mwarabonye ibitabo biandikawaga byose abantu bakundaaga kuvugawmo abajandarume bagize uruhare mukutabara abantu tuitwaaga nabo bose bangag kubivuga kubera ibihe turi turimo , ||| all of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living .
ariko iyo usomye igitabo cya auteur le drpoit survivre cyanditswe na hibert cyo kierekana yuko kuri hotel mille colline harinzawe n' abajandarume muri za enquete bakoze akaba ariyo mpamvu hatapfuye abantu niko icyo gitabo kibianditse muri za enquete zabo . ||| however if you read the book le droit de vivre by hibert , you can see that book shows well that hotel de mille collines was protected by gendarmes according to the investigations . that is why people did not die there . that is what the book says
kuri cathedrale st michel hari umunyamerika uri hamwe na ziriya mpunzi zo kwa gisimba nawe tumuvanye inyamirambo tumuzana muri cathedrale st michel , ||| there was an american who was with gisimba 's displaced people in saint @-@ michel cathedral . we had taken him from nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral .
no kwa gisimba na gisimba uriya aziko abajandarume major karangaw ariwe ziriya mpfubyi zose uzigejeje muri position zanjye , ||| even gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major karangwa
ariko ibyo ntabwo babivuga , ||| unfortunately this is not evoked .
ariko ubu nibura abantu bamenye ko icyo kikorwa kibayeho noneho rero bageze hariya bamwe baranababwiraaga ngo ntibazavugae yuko bakijijwe na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ngo kuko bazamushinja ubwicanyi , ||| for the time being , however , people should know the action took place . when people arrived there , some were even told not to say they had been saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi because he would be charged of killings later . fortunately there are gacaca courts ; you have given me the opportunity to tell you that i had given orders to the gendarmes of hotel de mille coliines .
ariko inkiko gacaca zirahari mu mpaye uburyo bwo kubabwira yuko abo bajandarume bari bari kuri hotel mille collines nri nbahaye anbwiriza mpa amabwiriza abantu bo kuri cathedrale st michel mpa amabwiriza abajandarume yo kuvoma amazi no kuzana ibiryoniba nibyo murabimenye ubwo murabona yuko nta mugambi wo kugambanair abatutsi nri nfite . ||| i had given orders to people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . i also gave orders to gendarmes to go and fetch water and bring food . you have known that too . you can see that i did not intend to plot against tutsis
nyakaubahaw ibyo nibyiza ibyo ukoze kuri mille collines ni byiza urabishimwa , n' ibintu ukoze nabyo urabishimwa , ||| yes sir , that was perfect . what you did at mille collines was perfect ! what you did is also recognized .
kusa hari impungenge tuba tufite ku kintu kuko tuumva ko uri ufite ubushobozi bwo kukimenya tuka kikubaza , ||| just because of the power you had in the time , we get curious and worried and we are obliged to ask you questions in order to know .
turakusaba ko kubera igitinyiro cyawe uravuga abantu bakagira ubwoba bakatinya no kukubaza wifate neza inberae y' urukiko , ||| we would also like to ask you to stand appropriately in front of the court panel . this is because people fear even to ask due to your dignity .
kuifata neza ntabwo ari ibyo byo kugira gutyo uvugae utuje , ||| no , by standing appropriately i do not mean standing that way .
abantu bataikanga batafite ubwoba cyane ko bavuze ko uri umuntu ukomeye n' icyubahiro cyawe . , ||| ; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity . they have said you are an important person so they have much respect for you .
n' igitinyiro ufite niba unarushye ushobora kuba wicaye gatoya bakakubaza ||| if you feel tired you may even sit down so that they may ask you .
nyakaubahaw muri uyu mujyi wa kigali nuko wenda mutanyemereye urukiko rutanyemereye ariko wenda murza kumpa uruhushya nzae kubibabwira kuko nabyo nri nbiteguye , ||| you know sir ... may the court panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in kigali . however , i had prepared it . i hope you will allow me that .
iyo urebye uko unity zari zimeze hano mumujyi wa kigali ukareba ukuntu nkoze ukuntu nshoboye ngo nshoborae kutabara bariya bantu bari bari muri kariya kacae ||| when you check well that structure and see how i did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area .....
kuko si ukuburana kandi uriya we yabitiranyije kusa tukubwiraaga ngo ujyae utumara impungenge kuko hari ibyo tutazi cyane cyane ko uri umuntu ugenda ahantu hose uzi ibintu byinshi bigiye biba ||| this is not a trial . the other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened .
noneho ubitusobanuraire ntago ari ukuburana nta nubwo ari inzira tushatse kugirango uburanae twebwe urukiko rw' umurenge nta nubushobozi tufite bwo kukuburanaish ntabwo tufite ubushobozi bwo kukuburanaish na butoya kubera icyubahiro cyawe ntabwo twebwe tufite ubwo bushobozi reka tutangae ijambo kumuntu umwe mubagize inteko hanyuma tujyae ku banri . ||| so , we want you to provide us with explanations . this is not a trial . it is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . we are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . we give the floor to someone else
murakoze kumpa ijambo nagirango nkwibarize utubazo duatatu tw' amatsiko cyane cyane tuumvise utsindagira ishyaka mrnd ushobora kutubwira ishyaka uri urimo ? ||| court panel thank you . just out of curiosity tell me about three questions @: you have been evoking mrnd a bit a lot ; would you please let us know which political party you belonged to ?
icya kabiri utuibwiraiye ko utanze rapport zihinyuza ibyo babeshyeraaga abtutsi reak nkwibarize nk' umuntu uri ufite ubushobozi ujyaaga no hanze uganiraaga n' abantu utuha nk' abatutsi nkabangahe uba uraburiye ? ||| second @: you told us that you drew reports denying the accusations brought against tutsis . so i want to ask you ; as a high @-@ ranked personality of then who could go abroad at times , how many tutsis have you warned ?
icya gatatu nagirango nkwibarize utubwiye umugabo witwa ntirukiribambae ese tumukura he ? ||| third @: you told us about a man called ntirugiribambe . where can we find him ?
ese yari ashinzwe iki ? ||| what was his responsibility ?
murakoze ||| thank you .
munyakazi icya mbere unbajije ngo ishyaka nri nrimo , ||| the first question concerns the political party i belonged to .
kugera ku itariki ya cumi . 06.1991 hari hariho iegeko nshinga abanyarwanda bose nawe uri muri mrnd nawe niko biri bimeze abantu bose bari bari muri mrnd , ||| according to the rwandan constitution in force till june 10th 1991 , all rwandans including you adhered to mrnd . surely it was the same for you .
nawe uri urimo kuko umunyarwanda wese yari muri mrnd , ||| all people adhered to mrnd . even you because any rwandan did .
nyuma yo ku itariki ya 10.06.1991 hagiyeho itegeko rishyiraho amashyaka menshi , abasirikare nta shyaka bajyaagamo , ||| after june 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . soldiers did not adhere to any political party .
icya kabiri unbwiye ngo uri unbajije uti izo rapports ukoze ngo nvuga abatutsi nburiye . ||| the second question you asked is about reports i drew and how many tutsis i might have warned .
izo rapport yuko barimo kubahimbair nzikoze kuturuka ku itariki ya mbere igihe batangiraaga kufata ibyitso banbwiye ngo nkorae verification , ||| i drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . i was told to verify .
kandi nraemeye n' umutima wanjye nvugaish ukuri nkora uko nshoboye kugirango ba extremiste batajya kukoresha izindi rangamuntu muzinri imprimerie ngo bazitiraire sisi evariste ||| i committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . i did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at sisi evariste 's .
kandi izo rapport nkoze nubwo tubivuganaaga n' abakozi bo muri embassade bazaaga kutubaza uko situation imeze niyo yatumye bashyiraho pression president habyarimana kugirango uriya mugambi wo kurimbura abatutsi utakorwa , ||| i also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . that is why they started putting pressure on habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating tutsis and start releasing people .
batangirae bafungurae n' abantu , ||| people were released .
n' abantu batangiye kufungurwa n' abafunguwe barahari president habyarimana yaravuganga ngo nimuongerae kufungura mujyae mureba abafunguwe ||| there are even people who were released . habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore you should check those who are being released @"@ .
mukwezi kwa kane . 1991 ariko iyo tutakora izo rapport tukajya muri uwo mugambi wo kufunga abatutsi tubahimbair turi kuba tukoze nabi , ||| in april 1991 ... it would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing tutsis for fake accusations .
jyae nkubwiye ko iyo rapport yagize akamaro kuko nbwiye abanyamahanga nti ntawe tukoze verification tusanze barabeshyera abatutsi . ||| i am telling you ; the report served a lot because i told foreigners that we had verified and found out that tutsis were innocent .
icya gatatu n' ikihae ? ||| what was the third question again ?
uwo ntrugiribambe yari commanda wa territoriale ya nyarugengae yarahunze yagiye muri zairae ntabwo aho ari mpazi . ||| ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of nyarugenge . he exiled to zaire . i do not know where he might be right now .
murakoze . ||| thank you !

ikindi abantu benshi muri stade hariya regionale baramutakambiye kuko yari afite ububsah buhaambaye , ||| second . at nyamirambo regional stadium , many people called upon him for help because he was in a vey good position for that .

ikindi igitugu cy' amahanga muesae murakizi nabatari ino mwasomye ibinyamakuru nicyo cyabokeje kugirango barekurae abo baitaaga ibyitso none we ko atatueretse uwari ari kufata abantu akaba yatubwiye ko yakijije abapadiri n' ababikira abaturage ijana na mirongo inani nabangahe bakagwa kuris t famille akatubwira ko atabibonye atanabiumvise ubwo murabona koko uyu nyakaubahaw ko yarahiye ko azavugaish ukuri murabona hari ukuri azavugaish ? ||| third . you all know the international pressure . even those who were not in the country might have read newspapers . that pressure made them release those they called accomplices .
nawe abitusubizae kuko bitangiye kugaragara . ||| why did n't he show us who was arresting people but only told us that he saved priests and nuns and did neither see nor hear of the death of more than 180 people at sainte @-@ famille ? do you really think this gentleman will tell the truth as he swore ? he should spare our worries because the situation has already started worrying us !

eeh niba ubizi bitubwirae ||| eeh ! tell us if you do know
ku itariki ya cumi na karindwi bakunze kuyivuga nkuko nkubwiye , interahamwe zateye centre st paul , eglise st famille , hotel mille collines , ||| as i told you , interahamwe attacked saint @-@ paul center , sainte @-@ famille church , and hotel de mille collines .
zihateye jyae nkubwiye yuko nri muri hotel mille collines ||| i was at hotel de mille collines .
interahamwe zirainjiye zikura abantu muri eglise st famille zibarasair hagati ya procule na eglise st famille imirambo yabo nkuko abapadiri babinbwiye nbonye hari n' umupadiri uri hano ||| interahamwe entered sainte @-@ famille church , took people form the church and shot at them between procure and the church . as i was told by some priests .... i saw one here by the way !
wenda azae kuza kubibasobanuri , ||| he might explain it to you .
babajyana kuri economat generale ibyo birabaye ariko nkuko nkubwiye icyo gitero cy' interahamwe bangerekaho ||| ... their bodies were taken to the steward general 's office buildings . that took place yes but as i told you i did not head that attack
abapadiri banbwiye ko imirambo barayifashe bayivana aho ngaho babarasaiye hagati ya procule na kiriziya n' amazu y' abapadiri ||| i was told by priests that the bodies were taken from where they had been shot at , between the church , procure and priests ' buildings
muri ako kacae niho babarasaiye babavanyemo kuko interahmwe zaje ari nyinshi icyo kihae jyewe nri kuri hotel mille collines . ||| people were shot at there . there were many interahamwe ; that is true . i was at hotel de mille collines
ntabwo nyoboye icyo bitero uretse ko mu birego byose biri bihari mwahawe baeretse urukiko ko icyo gitero arijyae uri ukiyoboye na colonel renzaho na ngelina na odette ||| i never headed those attacks though i have just been accused of it together with colonel renzaho , angelina and odette
jyae nri kuri hotel mille collines nrimo kutabara abantu bose bari kuri hotel mille collines ngirango nibwo padiri uwimana yabonye yuko nrangije kutabara abantu ||| i was at hotel de mille collines helping all people who were there . i think it was that time when father uwimana saw that i had just helped people

ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri ||| that what i am going to say is true
ko ibyo ngiye kuvuga ari ukuri ||| that what i am going to say is true
turaumva koko ko padiri ari butubwize ukuri cyane cyane ko uri uhari , ibintu byose ubiitegereje ||| we are expecting father to tell us the truth given you were there and watched the whole scenario
hanyuma mama akaba kamanazi charlotte ||| my mother is kamanazi charlotte

eeh nagirango nbabwirae yuko iriya minota mwatanze kugirango umuntu ababwirae ibyabereye kuris t famille na st paul ari mikeya ||| i would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
kandi itsindo ry' ikibazo ariho riri , ||| whereas it is the center of the problem .
abantu nraumva baba bafite imformations ziba zitandukanye kuko uko ibintu biri bimeze ntago abantu babibonaaga kimwe . ||| people have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way
twebwe rero nk' abapadiri bari bashinzwe kureba abantu bari bahungiye kuri st famille no kuris t paul ariko tutiyibagije ko hari abandi bantu bari hanze ||| we , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @:
ku kibuga cy' amashuri ya st famille abo ngabo bari ku kibuga cya st famille n' abantu bari barahunze imirwano batafite ikibazo cy' interahamwe ||| on sainte @-@ famille primary school playground , on sainte @-@ famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by interahamwe
abari st paul no muri st famille ndetse no mu ntangiro muri cela n' abantu bahungaaga ahubwo interahamwe . ||| those who were at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul even at cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from interahamwe
eeeh twebwe rero , ||| right !
kubera ko abntu bazaaga batuhungiraho ntabwo turi tuzi abo bantu abo aribo ngo tuvugae ngo wowe urahunga interamwe eeh wowe nta nterahamwe uhunga ||| we did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from interahamwe
ariko ibyo ngibyo tubikoreraaga kubera umutekano wa bose nukuvuga rero yuko ubwacu nk' abapadiri mu ibanga tukoraaga inama nimugoroba ||| we did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . that means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings
kugirango tukusaanye ibyo tugiye tubwiraw hirya no hino kigirango tumenye uko tushobora tukomeza kumenya kufasha abantu bari barahahungiye ||| in order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there
uwaduhaga information ntabwo tuvugaaga ngo umuntu yatuhaye information twagirango tubabwirae ko informations tubonaaga z' ibitero bigombaaga kuza muri st paul no muri st famille . ||| we did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against sainte @-@ famille
harimo n' abantu bakoranaaga inama nabo , ||| there were even people who held meetings among them .
habaaga harimo abasaveri , bakaza bakatubwira abti muitondae ejo cg ejobundi barimo kutegura igitero . ||| there were xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack .
ubwo tukabimenya ||| the information could be got that way
hanyuma rero kubera ko nkuwo munsi utabaga uzi iziri kukorana n' interahamwe ntawari kubimenya niyo mpamvu tuirindaaga kugira ibintu tusohora bimenyekana . ||| since we could not know those who were connected to interahamwe , we did not reveal anything .
kuko ushoboraaga kubisohora ugasnag nibo bagiye kututanga , nuko nguko rero muri rusangae tukoraaga . ||| one could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . that is the way it worked
na munyeshyaka batinyaaga kuvuga ntinzi impamvu batinya kumuvuga ntabwo yakoze , nta na rimwe yigeze ashaka no kuicisha abo bantu bavuga . ||| i do not even know why people have not evoked munyeshyaka . munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . he never intended to betray people .
ubuhamya bwo , nibyo nbabwiraaga ngo abantu tufite ukuntu tubiumva kuburyo butandukanye twebwe rero nk' abapadiri , ari muri st paul ari muri st famille ||| that is why i was telling you people understand things in differently . we , as priests either in sainte @-@ famille or
muri st paul hari hashinzwe padiri celestin ariwe uri uhinzwe izo mpunzi ntinzi impamvu bataigeze bavuga yuko n' interahamwe naho zahageze zatwaye abantu nabo bapfuye ||| saint @-@ paul ... we had appointed father celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ paul . i do n't know why people did not mention that interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies
nkuko muri st famille abntu baje bakabatwara bakabica icyo kugirango nagirango nvugae kubierekeye na munyakazi ||| as they came to sainte @-@ famille to take and kill people . this leads me to talking about munyakazi now
ibyo ngibyo rero ngiye kubabwira nrababwira n ukuri n' ubuhamya ariko na none ikindi nagirango nbabwirae nuko hari abasirikare baje kurinda kuris t famille no kuri st paul ||| what i am telling you is a true testimony . i would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
abasirikare turi twitabaje ministiri aloys padiri munyeshyaka akamubwira yuko ibitero biri biraye bihaje , akmubwira yuko interamwe irmo kuza kuica abantu . ||| we had resorted to minister aloys . munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and interahamwe were coming to kill people
niwe uvuze ati tugiye kureba ukuntu tufasha ubwo nyuma yaho jyae nkoranye na munyeshyaka tugiye kubona tubona abajandarume baraje . ||| he said he was going to handle the situation . i worked with munyeshyaka . then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day .
hari abajandarume bari ku muryango winjiraga kuri procule kubera yuko abantu bari barahungiye kuri st famille bari mu kiriziya inzugi zo z' inyuma zari zifunze . ||| gendarmes settled at procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed .
kaereka nyine ubwo haigeze kuza igitero kikomeye noneho rero tusaba kubera yuko interahamwe kubera ko zainjiraaga uko zibonye zije kutwara abntu muri st famille ||| once a very strong attack came to take people from sainte @-@ famille and because interahamwe entered in disorder ,
tugeze naho tusaba tuti abajandarume bahari ngo nizizajya ziza imbunda bajyae bazibambura bazisigae ku muryango aho bainjirairaga , ||| we asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance .
bagiye babikora . ||| they did it .
ariko rero iyo hazaaga igitero kikomeye nkuko nigeze kubivuga igitero kikomeye cy' interahamwe nta kihae abo bajandarume bigeze babihagarika . ||| however as i said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks
bibarushaaga ingufu pe ndetse wenda na munyakazi yaza kugera aho avuga ko nawe hari ibyo atashoboye . ||| they were stronger than them till munyakazi himself some were stronger than him
murekae tuumvikanae ||| please , listen !
nracyakomeza kuko niba tushaka kuvugaish ukuri tujyae tuvuga ukuntu ibintu bigenze ||| i still have the floor . if we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things
reka tuze kumubaza , ||| we shall ask him questions .
aratusobanurair murekae tuumvikanae , aravuga wenda ibyo azi n' undi aravuga ibyo azi , ||| he will explain . listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his .
mucecekae tuumvikanae . ||| please , stop shouting
eeh ikindi rero na none nbabwira , mu bajandarume bari baratuhaye kugirango barindae abantu harimo bamwe b' umutima mubi bashakaaga koko ko abo bantu babica . ||| what i can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed .
ndetse harimo bamwe bisabye ko babahindura kubera yuko bazaaga bakavuga bati turairirwa turinze inyenzi abasirikare bacu barimo kupfair ku rugamba baicwa nazo ? ||| it became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield
muri abo ngabo harimo abo tusabye barabatuhindurair ubundi mu ntangiriro babanri babaga bari ku kibuga ngirango murabizi bajyaaga kuvoma ubundi bakaza kugurisha n' abantu bari mu kiriziya batashoboraaga kusohoka ||| we asked that some might be transferred . you can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out .
bigeze aho ahubwo za nterahamwe bavugaaga zari ziri aho ngaho hafi kuri st famille zaje kushyiraho bariyeri kuko bavugaaga ngo barazanira amazi inyenzi ||| after that , the interahamwe talked about who were at sainte @-@ famille set a barrier saying inyenzi were being given water .
izo bariyeri rero zimaze kujyaho tuiambaje abajandarume ngo bajyae batufasha no kujya bajya kutuzanira amazi barabikoze . ||| after the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . they did it .
muri paroisse nbagamo yitwa yuhi njyanye numu na major nsanzimfura jean batiste nmaze kumutaba za ko ababikira bagiye ababikira ba basomption bagiye kubicira aho bari babasize nramubwira nti irukae iwanyu bahakorae genocide ||| in the parish yuhi where i lived , i went with major nsanzimfura jean baptiste after having called him for help that that the assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . i told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place
aranbwira ati reka tujyende tujyae kubazana nbanza no kugira ubwoba nti jyae ntinrenga hariya hepfo aranbwira ati ngwino tugende niba uri buze kupfa turapfaan . ||| he told me to go and take them . i first feared to go far and he ensured me that if i was to die we would both die .
nibwo tugiye turajyana , ||| so , we went together .
bon ubwo nimugoroba wicyo kihae byaranudafashije kuburyo bumwe kuko kuturuka ku giti cy' inyoni kugera kuri st famille ||| okay ! that evening we were facilitated from gitikinyoni to sainte @-@ famille by one thing ;
inkotanyi zarimo kurasa amasasu menshi kugirango zibonae uko ziza kutwara abntu muri st paul . ||| inkotanyi were shooting and bombarding a lot in order to come and take people from saint @-@ paul .
ubwo ngubwo turaje tuhageze nka sasita z' ijoro kubera ko imodoka yaje kutupfumukairho nriko kuturukayo ntabwo tugize amahoro kuko baratubwiraaga bati ||| we came and arrived around midnight because our tyre deflated . we had never been at ease all along the journey . at any time we could be told @:
muhitae mutaturashisha kuko imodoka yagendaaga gahoro bakavuga ngo muhitae mutaturashisha ||| "@ speed up ! we may get shot at @" because the car was slow .
ubwo tugeze kuri st famille eeh jyewe nrara muri procule nri kumwe na padiri munyeshyaka kubera ko imfunguzo zacaaga muri economat zijya muri st paul nri nzaibagiwe . ||| arrived at sainte @-@ famille , i spent the night in procure with father munyeshyaka because i had forgotten the keys of the door from the steward 's office to saint @-@ paul .
hanyuma icyo kihae nibwo tuumvise igitero hirya muri st paul barasa amasasu menshi ||| then we heard a lot of bullet shots in saint @-@ paul
hanyuma nrabiibuka ubwo padiri munyeshyaka niwe ubwiye umusirikare witwa murekezi ati telephone kuri minadef ubabwirae ko interahamwe zirimo kuica abantu bari basigaye muri st paul . ||| i remember that father munyeshyaka told a soldier called murekezi to call minadef and tell them that interahamwe were killing people left at saint @-@ paul
uwo musirikare yarabikoze ahita amubwira ati ngwino ....... ati inkotanyi zagezemo ubwo bari bamaze kumenya yuko atari byo . ||| the soldier did then told him @: "@ inkotanyi are already there @"@ . they had just known what we thought was wrong .
hanyuma nshatse kugenda nibwo nbabwiye nti nijoro ntabwo umenya ko baambaye ziriya za anti bar isasu barimukubita , ||| i wanted to leave then and i told them that at night one can not recognize that another wears a bulletproof .
ibyo bavugaaga byo nibyo yari yambaye anti bar . ||| what they said is true he wore a bulletproof .
bon , noneho rero icyo kihae bucyeye bawho kubera ko jyewe nri nraye muri procule babantu nbabwiraaga bari ku mashuri ya primaire batatinyaaga eeh eeh interahamwe . ||| the following morning -@ i had already spent the night in procure @- the intrepid people i talked about ... i mean interahamwe

ubwo bamaze kuvuga gutyo jyewe nibwo nnyarutse mpita njya kuihisha muri st paul . ||| no sooner had they said so than i quickly ran to hide in saint @-@ paul .
icyo kihae rero nkuko nvugaaga abo bantu barahapfairiye , bapfairiye mu busitani bwo mu mazu ya bapadiri ||| as i was saying , those people really died in the yard of priests ' buildings .
hanyuma koko abo bantu bamaze kubica imirambo baje kuyishyira muri fosse yo mu igaraje rya economat generale ||| after they were killed , the bodies were thrown in the grave that was in the steward general 's office garage
ariko rero ntinvuga tuumvaaga ukuntu barimo kubica jyewe muri icyo kihae n' abandi bari muri st paul turi ntawe turimo kuihisha . ||| i can n't say that ... i with others wo were in saint @-@ paul only heard they were being killed . we ourselves were hiding
nyuma rero nimugoroba nka sakumi n' imwe niho generale munyakazi koko yaje kututwara atujyana muri archeveche . ||| in the afternoon , around 5 p.m. general munyakazi came to take us . he took us to the archbishop 's palace .
niho tugiye icyo kihae na nyuma yaho nibwo tuje kubona uriya bernard couchener w' ubufaransa atusanzeyo turamubwira tuti kugirango urebae amarorerwa barimo kukora ||| we went there . some time after the french bernard couchner met us there . we told him @: "@ so to verify the scandals ,

imirambo yahamaze iminsi itangiye kunuka baje kubatwara bajy kubashyingura ariko aho bajyaiye kubashyingura ||| after some time after the bodies went stinking and people came and went to bury them . but where they were buried ....

bayivanye muri iyo fosse se baraongera barayitwara ? ||| were they taken from the graves and taken away ?
bayikuye muri iyo fosse baraongera abarayitwara ndetse intambara inarangiye nizo fosse zari zikinuka . ||| they were taken from the graves and taken away ? the graves were still stinking even after war .
utubwiye ko munyeshyaka yari afite anti bar na pistori ? ||| have you said munyeshyaka had a bullet @-@ proof and a pistol ?

yarampamagaye arantelephona ati ubu jyewe maze kubona imbunda nragenda njya kumureba hariya kuri st famille nramubwira nti imbunda uyishyira kurutugu uri padiri ukayitwara ? ||| he once phoned me and told me that he had just had a gun . i went and joined him at sainte @-@ famille . i asked him whether he could dare bear a gun on his shoulders and walk .
aranbwira ati koko iraremereye . ||| he told me that it was of course heavy .
ati ngiye kuaka pistole , ||| he told me that he was going to ask for a pistol .
pistole yarayatse arayibona nragenda nramubwira nti iyo pistole uzayirashisha umuntu ? yabanje kutebeza akayishyira hano ||| he asked for it and he got it . i asked him whether he would shoot at person with it . he slipped on his shirt and put it here .
hanyuma rero nragenda nramubwira nti pistole uzayikoresha iki ? ||| then i told him @: "@ what will you do with a pistol ? @"
aranbwira ati jyewe ntabwo nshobora kutinyuka kurasa umuntu ||| he answered @: "@ i can not dare kill .
ati nukugirango interahamwe zinbonae zibonae yuko ndi uwazo zintinye , ||| it is just to make the interahamwe believe that i am one of them and then fear me @"@ .
ibyo nibyo yanbwiraaga , ||| that is what he told me .

hari ahantu hari aka kiosque kera aho hantu hari bariyeri y' interahamwe . ||| there was a barrier set by the interahamwe near a kiosk that was there .
nizo zarimo kushaka niho zari zirimo kushaka kunbagira ariko numva umutima urankomeje nravuga nti uwatakira uyu mugabo . ||| they wanted to kill me there . i felt some courage and thought to beg this man 's help ;

lycee notre dame de citeau itariki mugabo avuze itariki ya mirongo itatu ukwezi kwa kane . ||| lycee notre dame de citeaux @: on april 30th 1994 , the day this man has just evoked .
igihumbi kimwe magana acyenda mirongo icyenda na kane koko nibyo abasirikari bari hano muri etat major b' interahamwe bagiye muri lycee notre dame de citeau . ||| it is true that extremist soldiers who were in staff headquarters went to lycee notre dame de citeaux
kuko aribo bari suppose yo kuharinda abasirikari ..... hari batayo yari iri hariya bakuramo abantu nkuko yabivuze bajya kubica ibyo yavuze kuri tariki koko nibyo ababikira bahise baterefona padiri karibushi . ||| because they were supposed to control the area . a battalion was appointed to control the area . what he said , that nuns called father karibushi on phone is true as well ;
bababwira ibyakogo bagize padiri karibushi yaraterefonnye kuko ningewe urindaaga cadredral saint paul . ||| they told him what was taking place . karibushi called me because i controlled the area of saint @-@ paul cathedral .
ariko nyakaubahaw ujyae utubwira nbaba baragiye muri ibyo bitero bakica ||| you should also tell us who participated in those attacks and killed people , sir !
nkubwiyeko ari abasirikari bari bavuye hano muri etat majoro n' interahamwe nibo bagiye kuzaana abantu bari bari hano ku itariki ya mirongo itatu y' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| i told you they were soldiers from staff headquarters as well as the interahamwe . they went to take people who were here on april 30th ,
mugihumbi kimwe maganacyenda mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| 1994
bariya babikira bari muri ...... ko abasirikari batangiye kubatera nkuko kare nbivuze koko nvuye k' umuhaima . ||| those nuns were actually attacked by soldiers as i said it . i left muhima
nza muri lycee notre dame de citeau kuri iyo tariki nbonaan n' ababikira nbashyira abajandarume . ||| to lycee notre dame de citeaux . on that day , i met the nuns and i gave gendarmes to them
nbwira kapiteni ...... ngo ahatangae abajandarume bo kurinda lycee notre dame de citeau . ||| i ordered captain ... to appoint gendarmes to protect lycee notre dame de citeaux .
aranbabajije rero ati abo basirikari babajyanye hehe nizo nterahamwe ntago mpazi . ||| i was just asked where those soldiers and interahamwe took them . i do n't know .
kuko baranyitabaje nrabatabara ngirango aho ntacyaha nkoze . ||| they called me for help and i helped them . i guess there is nothing bad in it .
kubierekeye igitero cyo muri sela bavuzeko kibaye ku itariki ya karindwi hari icyatanzwe ku itariki ya karindwi . ||| as far as the attack at cela is concerned , i think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ?
uwo yavugaaga kubierekeraanye no kuhunga igihe yagereye muri sela we yavuzeko yahageze ku itariki zirindwi z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| he just said that he arrived at cela on april 7th .
igitero rero cyo ku itari makumyabiri nebyiri z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| what about the attack of april 22nd ?
abaturage bari bari muri sela bahungiye muri centre saint paul aba ariho tubarindira . ||| people who were at cela moved to saint @-@ paul center and we protected them there .
uremerako hari abacitse ku icumu bari bari aho muri sela bahungiye muri saint famille mukabarindirayo . ||| do you agree that there are those who survived at cela and moved to saint @-@ paul where you protected them ?
nrabiemera ko hari abantu bahungiye muri sela basimbuka inkuta bajya muri centre saint paul ariko ntago bigeze ariko ntago nigeze nyobora kiriya gitero cy' interahamye nicyo nakurengerezaho . ||| yes i do agree that there were people who escaped from cela by jumping over walls . however , i did not head that interahamwe 's attack . that is all i can add .
ku kibazo abantu bose baibanzeho kiriya modoka y' umutuku . ||| what do i think about the red car all people have been insisting on ?
ngirango nicyo nnatangiraiyemo nbwira abagize urukiko ko iyo modoka ntayigenzemo . ||| i think i even started with it , saying that i never travelled in that car !
ntinigeze nyigendamo rwose iyo modoka rero nkuko babivuga . ||| i never travelled in that car at all as people are saying .
............ hari imodoka y' umutuku ugendaagamo nrayihakana iyo modoka koko y' umutuku ntago nigeze nyikoresha . ||| i absolutely reject that i travelled in that red car . never !
kaereka niba hari umuntu ugendaaga avuga ko yitwa koroneli munyakazi ari muri iyo modoka . ||| maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel munyakazi !
mukihae cya jenocide yatwaraaga abantu itwawe n' abandi ariko nawe indi . ||| during genocide it was used by others but
ugendamo . ||| you had yours somewhere not far !
ntabwo iyo modoka yigeze ijya muri ..... ntabwo iyo modoka nigeze ngenda iruhande rwayo . ||| the car never got to ... i never travelled near it .
ntago nigeze ngenda muri iyo modoka kubierekeye ikibazo kiza groupe zaicaaga abantu muri kigali . ||| never ! concerning the groups that killed people in kigali ;
izo groupe zari nyinshi hari interahamwe nkuko tukunze kubivuga uwanyuma aravuze ngo hari abajepe bazaaga . ||| they were many . there were interahamwe as we 've been saying . the last one has just evoked republican guards who used to come where he was .
hari abantu bari muri za intelligence zinyuraanye bicaaga abantu bayoboraw n' abandi bayobozi . ||| there were even many intelligence agents employed by other authorities .
ntabwo rero ibyo ngibyo babishyira k' umutwe wa munyakzi . ||| so munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes !
mwazabibaza iyo mitwe yicaaga abantu ariko ntabwo mwabigereka k' umutwe wa liyetona koroneli munyakazi . ||| you should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel !
iyo iyo mitwe yinjira muri katedrale saint michel nri kubabwira nti nikanaka na kanaka . ||| had the groups entered saint @-@ michel cathedral , i would tell you their names .
ariko hariya nkuko nbibwiye urukiko hari compagnie .... ya nyarugengae iyo mitwe inyuraanye yari mrnd , sdr za etat majoro . ||| but the other area was controlled by nyarugenge territory company as i have already told the court . the groups were mrnd , cdr under the staff command
baza kutwara abantu ibyo bigomba kubazaw iyo mitwe yicaaga abantu ntabwo nge liyetona koroneli munyakazi nyoboraaga iyo mitwe . ||| who abducted people ? those groups of killers must be responsible for it . i , lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi , was not commanding those groups .
ku kibazo cya saint andre ibyo banvuze byose barimo kunbeshyera . ||| the accusations about what happened at saint @-@ andre brought against me are all wrong as well .
muri saint andre .... kuri saint andre baranbeshyera ntinigeze ngerayo ngeze kwa padiri ..... nrihamawe na major ngirabatware . ||| the accusations are wrong ones . i never arrived there . i only arrived at father 's house . i was with major ngirabatware .
padiri blanshari bakimara kuica aba furaire 8 yaterefonnye ngirabatware asaba yuko abafuraire ari kumwe nabo i nyamirambo tujya kubazana . ||| after the killing of eight brothers , father blanchal called ngirabatware asking him that we might go to carry brothers who were with him .
tukabazana muri katedrale saint michel tugiyeyo igice kinberae turakizana tukishyira muri katedrale saint michel . ||| we first went to saint @-@ michel cathedral . we then went to carry them . we brought the first group to saint @-@ michel cathedral .
muzabaze padiri blanchal nba furaire baba ... tufite . ||| you may ask father blanchal and those brothers .
nta gitero nigeze nyobora kuri saint michel no kuri paroise yayoboraaga . ||| i never headed any attack against saint @-@ michel or his parish
ariko nyakaubahaw mu nshingano zanyu zari kurinda cyane cyane abaturage kandi nrabona mwaribanze cyane cyane kuba padiri nba furaire . ||| please sir , remember your duty was to protect the population and i can realize that you mainly concentrated your efforts on priests and brothers .
abaturage bo mwari mwabaretse ? abaturage baicwaaga nukuvuga baziraaga ubwoko bwabo . ||| why did you forget other people who were being killed because of their ethnic group ?
tukijije abantu benshi ikibitera ubungubu nuwo ntwaye mu modoka ashobora kugera hano akabihakana . ||| we actually saved many people . the only problem is that even someone i carried in my car denies it when he arrives here !
ariko nge abo bapadiri nvuga bose bari muri za corelasiyo ...... kurasa kuri arishoveki . ||| however , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned .
nrababwirako abapadiri bose bo muri kigali bariho , ||| i am telling you that all priests who were in kigali are alive .
abapadiri bose n' abafuraire bari muri zone yose yo kuri plateau bariho . ||| all priests and brothers who were in the area of plateau are alive
ntabantu bapfuye kandi bakijijwe na liyetona koroneli munyakazi ariko umuturage naho umukiza ashobora kuza nkubu ngubu akakubeshyera akavuga ngo nkuko mbese nbibonye . ||| no one died and all were saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi but once you save man and he comes here to accuse you as i have just seen it here .
nyakaubahaw ubonye abantu bafite icyo barimo kuvuga ntago rwose urukiko arirwo rushyizeho abantu baanga gutya nta nubwo tunabazi twebwe . ||| please sir , you have seen yourself people who have been here to say something . they have not been appointed by the court . we do not even now them .
kandi ni wowe wisabiyeko uzaza kutanga ubuhamya ahangaha nukuvuga ngo urabiisabaiye ubuyobozi butumira abantu . ||| in addition , you asked to come and give the testimony on your own initiative and the administration only convened people
twe tuje nk' urukiko kugirango tukirae ubuhamya bwawe ibyo tukubaza rero turashingair kubyo abantu bavuze . ||| we have come just as court agents to listen to your testimony . our questions are based on what people have said .
...... aho ngaho turagirango tukumarae impungenge . ||| we want to ensure you about that .
hari ibintu byiinshi bakuvugaaga bierekeraanye n' inama zakorwa tusubiye muri rugengae ubwo ngubwo . ||| there are a lot of things about the meetings you held in rugenge . so , ...
inama zakorwaaga aho ugeraaga ku mihanda uti se iyi myanda ko ntayo nbona ukatanga ibikoresho nk' umuntu koko uri uyoboye ufite .... ufite abajandarume ufite ibi ...... ||| the meetings , going outside and say there was no shit , supplying killers ... can you imagine as an authority having gendarmes under your command ! ...
kuri icyo kibazo cyo kusenya amazu muri kigali ngirango nawe iyo urebye aho abajandarume bari barinze katedrale saint michel ntabwo yigeze isenyaw . ||| concerning destroying houses in kigali , i think you can see it yourself that areas controlled by gendarmes were safe . saint @-@ michel cathedral was not destroyed ,
kuri saint famille ntabwo yigeze isenyaw centre saint paul ntabwo yigeze isenyaw . ||| sainte @-@ famille was not , saint @-@ paul was not
hotel mille colline ntago yashenywe kuvuga ngo ngiye kukoresha inama zo kusenya amazu ntabwo aribyo . ||| hotel mille collines was not as well . saying i sensitized about destroying houses is just a lie .
............ saint paul , saint famille ngirango nawe urabizi ngirango abantu bose barabizi muri sela nuko none se abo bantu mwayoboraga mwashyize hariya mwari mwarahabashyiriye iki ? ||| those of saint @-@ paul , sainte @-@ famille ... you know it yourself and all people do . why did you deploy your men there ?
mwari mwarahabashyiriye se kugirango barindae amazu niba abantu batari bashoboye kurindaw nagirango tusobanurairwe ibyo bintu . ||| was it to protect houses after having failed to protect people ? i would like you to explain it to us .
groupe ....... nyoboraaga yari irinze abantu kuri katedrale saint michel niba hari ibibazo bibaye kuri katedrale saint paul , eglise saint famille nkubwiyeko abajandarume bari bahari . ||| the group under my command protected people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . you should ask me to explain what happened there if any problem arose at saint @-@ paul cathedral or sainte @-@ famille church controlled by gendarmes as i told you .
groupement electorale ya nyarugengae groupement kigali bagiye .... ingufu n' interahamwe zateraaga biriya bigo . ||| nyarugenge territory company , kigali formation and interahamwe attacked the institutions .
uwavuze urupfu rwa kabera nta hantu nigeze ngira uruhare mu kuica kabera nagirango nbibwirae urukiko ntago nigeze ngira uruhare mu kuica kabera . ||| someone also o evoked kabera 's death . i did never participate in his killing .
ikitumye ntari nvuze kabera nuko ku itariki ya mbere y' ukwezi kwa gatatu igihmbi kimwe maganacyenda mirongo icyenda na gatanu . ||| i did not evoke him before because on march 1st 1995 ,

yo kureba ibyo abo bagabo bavuga niho nbibasobanuraiye ariko urupfu rwa kabera abamurashe ntabwo ndi mubantu barashe kabera . ||| which had to investigate about those men 's rumors . i already explained it . but i tell you that i am not among people who shot at kabera .

ariko yanavuzeko yahaye amabwiriza abari bari muri saint famille na saint paul nhanri . ||| he also said gave some orders to gendarmes who were at sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and elsewhere .
bari bari muri compagnie ......... yavuze ko ariwe uhaye amabwiriza yo kurinda abantu kubera yuko umujandarume uri uhashinzwe yari yabaye broque . ||| he said that he gave orders to territory company men because their commander could not be there .
e umuturage nukuvugako bariya aribo bahabwaaga amabwiriza ibyo baba barakoze rero ngirango jeneral munyakazi afite uruhare yabigiramo kandi yafashe responsabilite yo kaubaha amabwiriza . ||| e member of audience this means that those men were just executing orders . i think that general munyakazi should be responsible for everything they might have done since he had taken the responsibility to gave orders to them .
ikindi mu makuru yabanje kutanga nta kintu yigeze avuga kuri ibyo bicae bya rugengae na muhaima ? ||| furthermore , in his testimony he did not say anything about the areas of rugenge and muhima .
yivuygiye cathedral saint michel na hotel mille colline ......... nkibanza impamvu yari yanze kuvuga saint famille na saint paul na sela . ||| he only talked about saint @-@ michel and hotel de mille collines . i have wondered why he has avoided talking about sainte @-@ famille , saint @-@ paul and cela .
ku ma sitoke ya karitasi ariko se nta nicyo yamufashije kubitero bibaye muri saint paul . ||| from caritas ' stores . however , why did n't he help him when saint @-@ paul was attacked ?
n' uruhare yaba yaragize kufasha uwo mupadiri kuko niwe tubonaaga abandi ntabo tubonaaga bari bihishe . ||| he should have helped the only priest we could find because others were hiding .
icyo yaba yaratufashije kandi anatubwirae igihe yajyaaga muri saint paul muri ibyo byo kuzana ibiribwa niki . ||| he would have helped us more like that . i would also like to ask him to tell us what he did when he went to saint @-@ paul @: to get food or whatever ...
yabaga agiye kukorayo iki ibitero bihabaye n' abantu bahaguye abajandarume bari bahari hari amakuru bamuhaye ? ||| what he went there for ? did n't he get any information from gendarmes who were there about people who had been killed there ?
baramutabaje se ko numva hari n' igihe yahaje kandi ari uko baishe abantu ku itariki ya cumi na kane z' ukwagatandatu . ||| he was called for help but i heard that he arrived after people were already killed .
muri mirongo icyenda na kane batwaye abasore benshi babatoranije mu ma sale aho abantu bari bahungiye . ||| in 1994 , young men were taken from rooms where they had escaped .
abo basore bagera kuri za mirongo itandatu n' abandi bicaiyew hariya hafi riyetona koroneli munyakazi ibyo arabizi ko ntacyo yabwiye urukiko . ||| the young men were about 60 . they were killed near the place . lieutenant @-@ colonel knows it but he did not tell the court .
ese yabivuzho iki nk' umuntu uri uhaye amabwirirza abo bajndarume ? ||| how did he consider that , as someone who had given orders to gendarmes ?
ibindi nyakaubahaw perezida namwe nyangamugayo . ||| mister president , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca panel ,
yabikozeho iki murakoze nyakaubahaw perezida . ||| what did he do mister president ? thank you !
ntabwo tuba turi mubyishimo ngo tukomae amashyi ahubwo umuntu tumushimira ibiiza bye . ||| remember that this is not a party so that we rejoice and clap our hands ! we only thank one for his good deeds .
........... abantu benshi bo muri saint paul batapfa ........ kandi ngirango namwe ibyo murabizi . ||| many people died at saint @-@ paul and i think you already know that

bazi kukumira ibintu kibyo by' ibitero by' abantu babaturagae bahaye imbunda cyane cyane ko utanatubwiye ...... umuturage n' imbunda ibyo nabyo ubikaomozaeho ubitubwirae . ||| as far as preventing such catastrophes and lay people having been accidently armed ! you should also tell us about arming the population by the way !
ngirango hari za unitae nyinshi ngiye kuzisobanura muri ubwo buryo hari etat major ya arme rwandaise yari ifite ...... general aha hirya ahangaha . ||| there were many unities . i am going to pass through them as follows @: rwandan army staff with generals here and then ;
hari etat major ya jandarumori ariyo yari mu mugi hari commandement ops commandement operationnel ya kigali . ||| gendarmerie staff which was in kigali city ; kigali operation command ;
ariko bafite nza ............ nyinshi ....... ariko kugirango ngewe nshoborae kutabara bariya baturagae . ||| there were also .... a lot of ... as far as helping those people is concerned ,
nyakaubahaw reka ntinkuciye mu ijambo ariko nagirango ibyo abajije ubiumvise kubierekeraanye no muri saint paul . ||| sorry to interrupt sir ! the question was about saint @-@ paul attacks
ibierekeraanye n' inshingano zanyu kuri saint famle ... uko uri umuyobozi mukuri uko ushoboraaga kukumira ibitero kugirango abasiviri batapfa . ||| and sainte @-@ famille . among your responsibilities as an authority , you had the ability to stop the attacks and save lives of civilians
bahungiye hariya bazira ubwoko bwabo turagirango ukanishe aho ngaho cyane cyane . ||| who had escaped there because of their ethnic groups . we want you to tackle that issue .
aho niho ngiye kugera nubundi hari abajandarume bagera kuri cumi n' ababiri kuri centre saint paul n' abajandarume cumi na babiri bari kuri saint famille . ||| i am almost on it . there were twelve gendarmes at saint @-@ paul and twelve at sainte @-@ famille .
uriya yavuzeko ibitero byo kuri saint paul abantu ko bavaagamo kandi abajandarume bahari bari bashinzwe iki ? ||| there is one who said that people were abducted from saint @-@ paul in the eyes of gendarmes . what were they doing then ?
nbabwiyeko ari iza .... zajyaaga kufatamo abantu ababikoze aba bafashe muri saint paul cyangwa muri saint famille . ||| i told you that the .... entered to abduct people .
numva mwazababza kugiti cyabo kuko ntago bigeze babwira ngo kanaka na kanaka baje kufatamo abantu . ||| i think that the abductors of people from saint @-@ paul and sainte @-@ famille should be asked questions on their own because i was never told that such @-@ and @-@ such went to abduct people .
iyo babikora muri hariya saint michel mwabonyeko aho nrinrinze nta kibazo ngize . ||| i would know it if they did it at saint @-@ michel . you have realized that the areas i controlled never experienced such problems .

mu bwana bwanjye ikintu nkuibuka , ndi kumwe n' umuryango wanjye , nraibuka ukuntu tubanaaga , nraibuka rimwe na rimwe iyo tubaga turi hamwe tuesae tuganira . ||| the thing i would remember is maybe the way we would all be together , chatting .
rimwe na rimwe papa yakundaaga kutusetsa cyane , ||| my father used to make us laugh very much .
kuko yari umuntu uganira cyane kandi usetsa . ||| he was very funny .
akakunda kutushimaish , kudutembereza . ||| he used take us for a ride .
na mukuru wanjye nawe yari umuntu usetsa nawe iyo tubaga twiherereye turi abana kusa , yari umuntu ukunda kutushyushya akatuganiriza cyane akatushimaish . ||| my big brother also used to make us laugh so much when we would be just the children .
nbwira ku mibanire yawe nawe ... ubusabane mwagiranaga , ||| how would you describe your relationship with her ?
n' ibyo mwajyaga mufatanya kukora . ||| what did you do together ?
mama twa ... yakundaaga kunganiriza cyane rimwe na rimwe , yajyaaga anyihererana akanshyira nko mu cyumba , akanbwira ibintu bigendanye n' ubuzima . ||| she used to pull me aside in the bedroom and give me plenty of advice about life in general .
ndetse na mbere y' uko jenoside iba yajyaaga atubwira ati @: "@ mushobora kuba imfubyi nta umenya , nshobora kugira accident cyangwa nshobora kugira ikindi kintu kinbaho , ababyeyi banyu bose bakapfa , ||| even before the genocide she used to tell us that anything could happen , we could find ourselves orphans as they could both die in a car accident , or something could happen to them .
njyewe na papa wanyu tukapfa . ariko mugomba kumenya ntimukabae abantu b' abatesi , " turimo yenda kukora ibintu akatubwira ngo @: "@ mujyae mugeragreza kukora cyane , ||| so she would tell us how we needed to stop being childish and grow up , to be hardworking and to be able to take care of ourselves in case we were forced to .
kuko hari igihe tushobora kuzaba tutakihari mukirwanaho . @" yakundaaga kunyiegereza akangair inama zo mu buzima kugirango nzakurae ndi umwana mwiza nzamukae ndi umugabo . ||| she would give me advice so i can become a man .
nbwira kuri papa wawe . ||| tell us about your father .
yari muntu ki ? ||| you said he was a funny man . what things made him funny ?
papa yari umuntu ukundaaga kuganira cyane . ||| he was very talkative .

akatuha wenda nk' ibintu akatuha nk' amafaranga akavuga ati @: "@ nimujya mu misa muzagurae nk' akabombo , cyangwa utuntu nk' utwo ngutwo . @" ||| he used to promise us to take us for a ride or give us gifts or money to buy sweets on our way to church .
noneho tuesae tukamurindira tukaryama ari uko atashye . ||| we always waited for him to come home before going to bed .
turara tutamubonye mu gitondo tukazinduka cyane tugiye kukomanga ku muryango ngo tumurebae . ||| if we went to sleep without seeing him , we would find him in his bedroom very early the next morning .
nbwira kuri mukuru wawe . ||| tell me about your big brother .
mukuru wanjye we yari umuntu ucecetse . ||| my big brother was very quiet .
nta n' ubwo abantu bari bazi ko avuga . ||| people did not even believe he could talk .
ariko iyo ... ariko ntiyavugaaga iyo yabaga ari mu rugo , papa ahari cyangwa se mama , ||| he never used to talk when my dad or my mom were there because he feared them .
kuko yarabatinyaaga akitwara nk' umuntu ucecetse cyane , cyangwa se hari ari umuntu mukuru . ||| so he would act like a very quiet person or a grown up in their presence .
ariko iyo tubaga twiherereye turi abana kusa , cyangwa turi nk' abana ... tuturanye cyangwa haba ari ku ishuri , yari umuntu usetsa . ||| but whenever we would be on our own , with maybe other children in the neighbourhood or from our school , he used to be so funny .
yakundaaga amafilime cyane , akakunda indirimbo zigezaweho , icyo kihae tuzaitaaga ngo za funk , azikunda cyane , ||| he loved funk music , dancing and movies very much .
akakunda kubyina . no ku ishuri akaba ari umuntu abantu bakundaaga cyane , kuko yari umuntu witonda , kandi ukunda abantu . ||| in school he was liked very much because he was calm and he loved people .
haba hari igihe mwajyaga mwishimishiriza hamwe mu muziki ? ||| did you all enjoy music together ?
yee , kuko yaranyigishaaga . niwe unbwiraaga ibigezaweho . kuko njyae ntabwo nbaga ... niwe ubaga yabikurikiye mu bitabo . ||| yes because he used to teach me and tell me what was on fashion .
akunda kusoma ibitabo akunda kaumva radio , ||| he loved to read and to listen to the radio .
noneho yaza aka nyigisha tukaiga turi mu cyumba , aka nyigisha kubyina nnjyae aka nyerekera ... ||| he used to teach me how to dance in the bedroom . he would show me how to dance and i would imitate him .
nbwira ikintu kikomeye wibukiraho umuryango wawe ? ||| tell me , when you look back and remember your family , what is it that you remember ?
ese n' ibihe by' ibyishimo , ||| happiness ?
ese ni amagambo mwaganiraga ... ni iki kikuibutsa umuryango wawe ku buryo bw' umwihariko ? ||| warmth ? fun ? what is the strongest memory that you have ? love , care ?
nbivuga nko mubicae bibiri . ||| i would say there are two things .
nk' icyo nibuka cyane nko kuri mama , ni uko mbere yuko jenoside itangira yigeze kunfata rimwe arantwara tujya ahantu mu cyumba . aranbwira ati @: "@ intambara irimo kuba ntawamenya , ||| as far as my mother is concerned , i remember very well that even before the war she was once took me to the bedroom and told me that there was a war going on and no one knew what was going to happen .
tushobora kupfa cyangwa tukagira ikintu kitubaho . ati @: ariko muzaihanganae ... asa nk' unbwira ko agiye kupfa . ||| she told me that they might die or anything could happen to them , that we needed to be strong . it was as though she knew she was going to die .

ariko nbonaaga ari njyewe ashaka kubwira cyane buri kihae . ||| she would always want to talk to me .
akantu kose kaba kabaye akampamagara ati @: ||| she used to advise me on how to behave , to love people .
"@ yves ujyae ugira gutya na gutya jya ukunda abantu ... @" naho kuri papa we , rwose nrabiibuka hari igihe yajyaaga akunda kunjyana akanjyana nko ... yaba agiye nko mu banri bagabo , akanbwira ati @: "@ ngwino njyae kukugurair brochettes ... @" akaba arijyae yihererana nnjyae akanjyana . ||| as far as my father is concerned i remember how he used to take me out with other men and buy me ‘ brochettes ’ .
noneho ... ku buryo mama bijyaaga binamurakaza , akamubwira ati @: "@ ariko se kuki unjyanair umwana , ukamutindaan ninjoro ? @" ||| my mother even used to get angry with him about it and she would ask me why he was taking her child out at night .
ariko jyae bikanshimaish kuko nbaga ndi kumwe na papa , nkaumva meze neza nkaumva nta muntu unkoraho rwose . ariko nawe akakunda kunbwira ati @: ||| i myself liked it very much , being with my father made me feel invincible .
"@ ujyae umenyera ibintu , ujyae umenya barumuna bawe , ujyae umenya bashiki bawe . @" ||| he also used to tell me to take interest in his things and to take care of my sisters .
ni ibihe bintu bikomeye wibuka bibaye muri jenoside ? ni iki kikugoye cyane ? ||| during the genocide , what is the memory , which is the strongest , the most difficult for you to recall ?
ikintu muri ... nvuga nko muri jenoside kinbabaje cyane ku babyeyi banjye , nvuga nk' ukuntu bapfuye . mbere y' uko bapfa uko babinbwiye n' uko baje kubafata aho bari bari , icyambabaje cyane ni uko mama yari arwaye . ||| the thing that hurts the most as far as my parents are concerned is the way they died .
yari arwaye malaliya , ngo yari yiriwe ... yari yaraye ameze nabi ahinda umushyitsi ; aruka ... kubera malaliya , nta n' imiti yabonye , ||| i was told that when they came to get them , my mother had been sick with malaria , she did n't have medication and she had been shivering and throwing up the whole night and they came that morning .
icyo gitondo nicyo baje kumubyutsamo . baramufata kuko ngo yari ameze nabi . ngo yari arwaye , afite imbeho ataitira . ||| my big brother was moping the floor and listening to the radio even though they were hiding .
mukuru wanjye we ngo yari arimo akora isuku aho bari bihishe , hari mu gitondo barimo bakoropa ... arimo akoropa nawe , yumva radio atazi ibyo aribyo , uraumva yari umuntu w' umwana . ||| what hurts the most about my father is that they shot him five bullets and he was there agonizing for two days with no medication .
wenda nvuga ko we , icyambabaje cyane kuri we , ni ukuntu ... ni iminsi yamaze atarapfa . baramurashe amasasu agera kuri atanu , ||| he was just there and there was no enough medication .
akiryamye nta miti afite yo kumuvura , ari aho kusa nta muti . n' imiti babonye ikaba itahagije . icyo kihae kimaze kushira atangiye kukira baraongera baragaruka . ||| two days later when he started to feel better , they came back and finished him .
nibaza ko icyo kihae yamaze ... njya nvuga nti @: "@ iyaba yarahise apfa . @" kubera ko igihe yamaze atarapfa , nicyo nbona kimubabaje cyane kuko yakimaze nta kintu ... ababaye . ||| it hurts me and i always feel like it would have been better if he had died right away without going through so much pain .
ibyo bintu buri kihae iyo nbitekereje biranbabaza cyane . ||| those are the two most painful things .
icyo kihae wowe uri uri he ? ||| where were you at that time ?
njyewe bijya kuba turi tugiye kwa nyogokuru , ||| we had gone to my grandmother 's place before it started .
tugenda bavuga bati @: "@ ino ahangaha hari umutekano mukeya , ||| they said that here in kigali there was no security and the best thing to do was to split into two and maybe some of us would survive .
reka ibiiza tutandukanae , kuko bashobora ... twebwe tushobora kusigara . @" noneho tujyayo , nri ndi i kitaarama kwa nyogokuru wanjye aho baita i taba . ||| i was in gitarama at my grandmother 's place ; it is called igitwe .
umenye utae uburyo umuryango wawe wishwe ? ||| how did you find out about the way in which your family was killed ?
uko nbiumva , uko nbibona baishwe ... baishwe nabi . ||| they killed them very badly .
kubera ko mbere yuko bapfa , babanje kujya babajyana hirya no hino , bakabashorera bakabajyana nk' ibirometero nka bitanu ari nk' abantu bagera ku ijana ... abantu babavugiriza induru babakubita ... babakubita amahiri ... ubwo buryo bapfuyemo nibwo ... nabyo biranbabaza . muri ubwo buryo , ||| before then , they 'd make them walk around for maybe five kilometres , they were about a hundred people and they were shouting at them and beating them up .
mbere y' uko banapfa , numva njyae baraishwe nabi cyane . ||| the way they died is also something that hurts me a lot .
kugirango ... bageze n' umunsi wo kupfa mbere y' aho babanje kujya bairukanka , bakabavumbura mu bihuru aho bari bari . bakabakubita , bakabatuka , ||| even the day they killed them , they still run after them , beat them up and insulted them .
bakabasabair imbabazi , nabo ubwabo bagatakamba baaka ... bakainginga ... nbona ko icyo kihae cyose , ||| they pleaded with them to let them live but they refused .
birutaw n' uko bari kupfa ku munsi wa mbere . ||| i think it would have been better for them to die straight away , on the first day .
papa wawe n' abasirikare bari babanye kutae ? ||| what was the relationship between your dad and that soldier ?
ese bari inshuti ... ? ||| were they good friends ?
icyo nvuga ni uko papa nta banzi nzi yari afite . ||| all i can say is that my dad did not have any enemies .
baba abasirikare , nta kibazo yagiraanaga nabo . ||| he did not have any problems even with the soldiers .
ku buryo n' abantu bo muri kano kacae baramukundaaga . kuko bamukundiraaga ko ibibazo bamubwiraaga yarabibakemuriraga , yaba abasanze ku muhanda afite i modoka akabatwara , nta modoka afite bakazamukaan n' amaguru baganira kugera kuri taxi . ||| people in this area liked him because he used to help them out with the problems they 'd submit to him , he used to give them a ride the days he 'd have a car and they days he did not have one they would walk up to the taxi together .
yaba afite amafaranga bakamusaba bati @: "@ tusengeraire akabasengerair . @" ||| he used to buy them a drink when he 'd have money .
n' abasirikare nabo nta kibazo yari afitanye nabo . ahubwo yari afite n' abasirikare bamwe na bamwe b' inshuti ze . ku buryo numva nta kibazo yarafitanye n' abasirikare , uretse n' abasirikare nta n' undi bari bafitanye ikibazo . ||| even soldiers did not have any problems with him ; in fact some of them were his friends . he was in good terms with not just the soldiers but with everyone else .
iyo ubonaanaga papa wawe n' uwo mugabo w' umwicanyi ubonaaga bameze batae ? ||| if you saw your dad with that particular man , what would their relationship have been ?
ese ubonaaga ari inshuti nziza ... ese babaga baganira neza ... ? ubonaaga basabanye kutae n' iyo nshuti ye , ||| friendly ? would they drink beer together ? would they work together ? would they sit and talk ?
iyo nterahamwe ? ||| what was that relationship like ?
papa abagabo b' inshuti ze bose bari abantu bahuraaga . hari abo bahurairaga mu kazi ... hari abo bahurairaga mu kazi , hari n' abo bahurairaga mu kabari , hari n' abo bahurairaga mu nzira . ||| all my dad 's friends were people he used to meet with ; he met some of them at work or some in bars or on the streets .
abo ngabo bose nko mu kazi papa yari umuntu ukora cyane kandi yari umuntu uzi ubwenge . ku buryo nk' abo bakoranaaga mu kazi , benshi baramukundaaga kuko yabaga abishoboye . kuko benshi baramushakaaga cyane . ||| he worked very hard and he was very intelligent and the people he used to work with liked him .
abo mu kabari nabo barahuraaga basengeranira . akabasetsa ibiganiro bimeze neza , ||| his friends in bars were people they used to buy each other a drink and he used to make jokes together .
ndetse n' uwo mugabo wunri umugambanaiye nawe yari umuntu w' inshuti ye cyane . ||| even the man who betrayed him was his very good friend .
kuko bahurairaga ahongaho hose . baba n' abo batakoranaaga bahurairaga mu nzira , baramukundaaga kuko ntacyo atabakoreraaga . ||| even the people he used to meet elsewhere liked him because he was always ready to help .
ndetse n' abantu bo mu muryango wacu bazaaga mu rugo , baza kumusura , abaza kumusaba amafaranga , abaza kumusaba conseille [ bamugisha inama ] , ||| our family members used to always come home to visit him or ask him for money or to simply seek advice from him .
abo bose bazaaga hano buri kihae , hahoraaga abantu bazaaga buri kihae . ||| there were always people here in our house .
uba uzi uko mama wawe yishwe ? ||| do you know how your mother died precisely ? did somebody tell you ?
wowe ubwawe uba urabonye aho bica abantu ? tuvugae nk' aho uri uri i kitaarama , wigeze ubona ahantu hakorerwa ubwicanyi ? nbwira ibyo ubonye muri icyo kihae . ||| from where you were in gitarama , did you see the killings taking place , not of your family but ... ? if so , what did you see ? how did the killers go about doing their work ?
uburyo nbonye bica abantu , nbonye abantu benshi . ||| i saw many people being killed .
ariko nk' ibyo nibuka hari umugabo rwose nbonye interahamwe ziramuvumbuye ahantu yari yihishe bari bafite ubuhairi , ||| i remember in particular this man who was found by the interahamwes from his hiding place .
bari bafite imihoro , baramwirukankana . nramubonye yirukanse agerageza kubasiga ariko bamwirukankanye nk' iminota igera kuri itanu bataramufata . ||| some had clubs , others machetes , they run after him for about five minutes before they caught him .
ariko bagiye kumushyikair umuntu yamuturutse inyuma amukubita ubuhairi mu mutawe nrabirebaaga , ||| someone beat him on his head with a club as i was watching .
umugabo nta n' ikindi kintu yakoze , yahise yikubita hasi arapfa . ||| he did not do anything ; he just fell down and died right away .
ibindi nbonye hari umukobwa nbonye baishe , uwo mukobwa bamwishe nabi . ||| the other thing i saw is this girl who was also killed very badly .
nawe babanje kumuvumbura baramwirukankana , ||| they found the place where she was hiding also and run after her .
kujya kumwica yabanje kutaka yamaze nk' iminota nka mrongo itatu [ 30 ] atarapfa , ||| she was left there agonizing for about thirty minutes and i was hearing everything .
akiboroga nrabiumvaaga . ariko nbonye apfa ariko ntinigeze ngira ingufu zo kumwegera ngo nrebae aho yari ari . kuko hari hakiri abantu baseka bishimye bavuga bati @: "@ tuvumbuye umuntu . @" ||| i saw her dying but i did not have the strength to approach her , as they were still standing next to her , laughing , happy to have found a prey .
wowe muri wowe inberae mu mutaima wawe wunvaaga umeze utae ? ||| how did you feel ? what was your predominant emotion at that time ? what was your main feeling at that time yves ? how were you feeling inside ?
mu mutaima wanjye numvaaga ... nri nkiri umwana ariko muri njyae numvaaga ... nbaga nbabaye cyane . ||| i was still a child but inside of me i was very sad .
uretse no kuba nri nfite ubwoba , ubwoba bwo bugeze aho burashira . ||| i was also scared but it reached a point where all the fear went .
ariko noneho ngera aho biranyobera . nkaumva ntinzi ibyo nrimo , nk' umva ntinzi n' aho ndi . ||| i reached a point where i felt like i did not know what was going on , or where i was .
kubona umuntu yica undi , kubona umuntu yirukankaan undi , ||| seeing a human being killing another one or running after him or her .
niyo wenda atabaga yapfuye ukabona arimo kusamba cyangwa ukabona bamutemye afite ibikomere umubiri wose , n' ibintu ntiumvaaga ntanabashaaga no kusobanukirwa . ||| seeing them agonizing or having wounds all over their bodies because they cut them down is something i was not capable of grasping or fully understanding .
nbaga nfite agahinda kenshi cyane . ||| i was so miserable ! there 's a day i kept feeling very sad without really knowing why .
ndetse hari n' igihe nje no kumenya ... mbere y' uko ... ariko ntinri ndi mu rugo , ariko hari iminsi yigeze kugera numva ntekereje mu rugo cyane . nkaumva nrababaye , nkaumva ntahangayitse . ||| i felt very uncomfortable , very confused despite the fact that it had been a good day as no one was chasing after me .
icyo kihae nfashe agapapuro nandika itariki . iyo tariki nje kusanga ari nayo yahuye muri iyo minsi mu rugo bapfuyemo . ||| i wrote down the date and i later on found out that it was around that time that my family was murdered .
kuko icyo kihae niriwe ndira , ||| i had spent the whole day crying without really knowing why .
umunsi wose biranyobera . kandi icyo kihae niwo munsi turi tubonye akahaengae kuko nta bantu babaga bahari baje kutuvumbura . ||| it was quite a peaceful day as no one had come where we were hiding on that day .
noneho uwo munsi biranyobera nkaumva nta mahoro nfite nirirwa ndira nkatekereza mu rugo cyane ntekereza mukuru wanjye ; ||| but on that day i was not at peace at all , i kept thinking about home , about my brother .
icyo nfashe agapapuro nrabiandika . agapapuro ntakabika itariki nyifata mu mutawe . ||| i wrote down the date and kept the peace of paper and memorized the date .
icyo kihae niho nje no kubaza neza nsanga ibyongibyo niho bibereye . ||| later on i found out that it was the time it happened .
ni ryari umenye ko ababyeyi bawe baishwe ? ||| when did you find out about your parents and brother ?
umenye ryari ibyabaye ? ||| when did you find out what had happened ?
nje kubimenya nyuma ya jenoside . ||| i was told about it after the genocide .
kuko njyae numvaaga batapfuye . nri nishyizemo yuko wenda bashobora kuba bakihari . ||| i was so convinced they were still alive ; i had convinced myself that they were not dead .
nyuma nbimenye nko mu ... nbabimenye banzae kubitubwira kuko baumvaaga nibabitubwira se turabigenza tutae ? nje kubimenya nko mu kwa munani , ||| i learnt about it later on in august . the people who knew what had happened did not know how to tell us , as they did not know how we were going to handle it .
jenoside yararangiye nibwo nje kubimenya ... mushiki wanjye nibwo tuganiriye neza , abinbwira neza anbwira uko bigenze ... hari mu kwa munani jenoside yararangiye . ||| one day my sister and i had a long conversation and she told me what had happened . it was in august , when the genocide was over .
kuko ntabwo nri nzi aho bari , kuko nmaze amezi angahe tuba twenyine , nta muntu wo muri famille [ mu muryango ] tubana niho nbimenye . ||| i did not know where they were and we spent some months living on our own without any family members .
ushobora kugerageza kunbwira ikintu ubonye muri jenoside kitajya kikuvamo ? ikintu uhora wibuka . ||| could you describe for me something that you saw during the genocide that really stays in your mind that you can not get out of your mind ?
ikintu cyo muri jenoside kitashobora kaumvamo , ikintu kinberae nibuka ni ngomaw ugomba kumenya ko ababyeyi bawe bapfuye . icyo kintu ntikishobora kaumvamo . ||| the thing about the genocide that i can never forget is first of all the fact that my parents were killed .
kuibuka ukuntu abantu baishwe , ukuntu baicwaaga nabi kandi bari abana beza , ari abakobwa beza cyangwa ababyeyi beza . ||| the ways in which people were killed , and yet they were innocent children , innocent women , innocent parents , is also something i can never forget .
ibyo bintu byo muri jenoside , kubona imirambo cyangwa kugenda usimbuka imirambo . kuba ushaka kuryama nturyamae ahubwo ushaka nk' ikoti ukariambura umuntu upfuye wowe ukarifata , n' ibintu bitashobora kaumvamo . ||| jumping over dead bodies , not being able to sleep , having to steal a jacket from the dead all these are things i can never forget .
ntinshobora kujya kuryama ntatekereje ukuntu mu rugo bapfuye , ||| i can never forget .
cyangwa se ntatekereje ukuntu abana bapfuye . cyangwa se abantu bapfuye nba nri nzi n' ukuntu bapfuye n' ibintu bitashobora kaumvamo na rimwe . ||| i can not go to bed without thinking about them and remembering how they were killed , or without thinking about other children who died or other people i knew . it is not something that i can ever forget .
kuri wowe kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu wunva bivuze iki ? ||| what does it mean to be a survivor ?
ni izihe ngaruka zo kurokoka jenoside ? ||| what is the consequence for you as a person ?
jyewe kurokoka , iyo umuntu arokotse nibwo umenya ... nibwo nje kusanga agaciro k' ubuzima . ||| surviving taught me the value of life .
kuko kurokoka n' ikintu baita ... iyo umuntu agiye kupfa akarokoka . niba uri ugiye kutemaw ukagira imaan ukabona ako kanya ntutemawe ukabona ufite umunsi w' ejo . niho koko uhita ubona ko ubuzima bw' umuntu ari ikintu kihenze ; niho koko uhita umenya ko ubuzima bw' umuntu atari ikintu cyo kukinisha . ||| when you escape death , when maybe someone was about to cut you down and does not do it and you 're still alive the next day , that is when you appreciate life .
ubuzima bw' undi cyangwa se ubwawe . ||| you then realize that your life or other people 's lives are of great value .
kuko nawe ikiba kikubayeho ni nako kiba kibaye ... ninako kinaba no ku wunri muntu iyo ugiye kumukorera ibintu nk' ibyo ngibyo ugiye kukorerwa . ni nayo mpamvu iyo ngiye kukora ikintu nbanza kutekereza jyewe uyu muntu akinkoreye bigenda bite . ||| you understand that everyone gets affected by things just like you do .
iyo ngiye kukorera umuntu ikintu nribaza nti ese ari njyewe akikoreye nbifata ntae ? ||| i now think twice before i do something bad to others because i know it hurts others as much as it could hurt me .
kuko iyo umuntu acitse ku icumu niho hantu wunva ko ubuzima ari bwiza , kandi ubuzima ari ikintu umuntu agomba kaubaha , buba ubwawe cyangwa buba ubw' abandi ||| it taught me respect for both my life and for other people 's lives .
utubwira uburyo ababyeyi bawe bashyinguwe ? ||| how were your parents buried yves ?
nvuga ko uburyo bahambwemo ntabwo bunshimaishije . ||| i would say that they way they buried them did not please me .
kuko nko mu muco wa kinyarwanda iyo umuntu apfuye , haba hari abantu . ||| in the rwandan culture , when someone dies , people come and mourn with you .
abantu baraza bakagira ikiriyo ... ariko bo baraishwe barabafata babajugunya ahantu mu myanda ... hatameze neza , bon ... kuri njyae numva batarahambwe . ||| they killed them and threw them into some garbage , so to me they were not buried .
ni nacyo kintu nabyo mu binbabaza bya jenoside icyo kintu nacyo kiranbabaza cyane . kuko nbabazaw n' uko ntabashije kuba biibuze mu rugo , ||| that is actually one of the things that really hurt about the genocide .
kubona umurambo wabo cyangwa kuba ntarabihambaiye cyangwa kuba tutarabahambye nk' umuryango , ||| i wish we had at least buried them as a family .
ibyo bintu biranbabaza cyane . nvuga ko batahambwe kuko iyo ufashe umuntu ukamujugunya , ukamujugunya aho ubonye , kandi yari umuntu wiyubashye , ||| i would n't say that they were buried because getting somebody 's body and throwing it anywhere and yet they were some respectable and innocent person is not a burial .
ukundaaga abantu nta kintu kibi yakoze , nibaza ko ari ibintu ... si ukuhamba ni ibintu bibi . ||| it is so wrong !
ibyo ubimenye utae ? wabimenyeye he ? ese ubibawiyew ni iki ? ||| can you tell me where you found them and when you found them and how you found them ?
ku bababonye ubundi bari bari kubaturanyi , ||| people had seen them as they were at the neighbours .
hari hari na mushiki wanjye nawe uri kumwe nabo , unababonye babica . yarahatueretse ati @: "@ ni ahangaha babahambye . @" ||| even my sister who was with them saw the way they killed them .
ntahagera ntahareba , noneho nyuma tubona hararengeraanye ibyatsi hari ibihuru , niho tugize igitekerezo turavuga tuti @: "@ reka noneho tuzabashyingurae neza . ||| he showed me the place and we decided to exhume them as the grass was growing over it in order for us to bury them in a better way no matter how hard that was .
tugeragezae biibuze n' ubwo bwose bikomeye . @" turabataburura tubashyira aho tuumva biibuze bahambwe nk' abantu nk' uko bari bariho , kandi baiyubashye , kandi nk' uko n' abandi bantu bose bahambwa . ||| at least we buried them the way everyone else is buried , in a way that honours them .
none se yves utekereza ko ushobora kubabarira abantu bakuiciye ababyeyi ? ubona bishoboka ? ||| yves , do you think you can forgive the people who killed your parents and your brother ?
kuri njyae birakomeye cyane . ||| it is very hard .
kubabarira ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye . ntabwo nvuga ngo @: mpite nbivuga aka kanya ngo @: ||| forgiveness is not easy .
nvugae ngo nbabarira umuntu ungize gutya , utumye ntagira ababyeyi , nta mera nk' abandi bana . ntagira affection [ urukundo ] y' ababyeyi , ||| i can not just say that i can forgive the person who took my parents away , the person who made me the way i am , who made me to be different from other children , without the affection and the presence of my parents .
ntabasha kubaan nabo . ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye . ntabwo ari ibintu nakwishoboza ngo nvugae ngo nbabarira umuntu unyiciye . ||| forgiveness is not easy and it is not something i could do on my own .
n' utaranyiciye yariciye abandi , nba numva nawe ntapfa kumubabarira . noneho rero nk' uwanyiciye nba numva atari ibintu byoroshye . yewe n' uwishe n' umuntu ntazi , ||| it is already hard enough to forgive the person who killed other people apart from my parents .
ariko ari umuntu ntabwo byoroshye kumubabarira . nnjyae uwanyiciye , uwanyiciye nk' ababyeyi aho ho birakomeye ntabwo ari ibintu byoroshye . ni ibintu bisaba nk' igihe kirekire cyane . ||| forgiving my parents ' murderer is a lot more difficult ; it is something that would require that i think about it for a long time .
ubona hari icyo ubutabera bukorwa cyangwa bukoze mu kukurengera cyangwa kurengera umuryango wawe ? ||| do you feel that justice has been done for you and your family ?
nvuga ko ubutabera , ||| justice ?
kuva uwanyiciye ntazi naho ari . wenda ashobora kuba ari muri prison ahantu . ubutabera numva kuri njyae , numva nta kirakorwa kuri njyae . ||| since i do not even know where the person who killed my family is ; maybe he is somewhere in jail ... to me , it is like nothing has been done as far as justice is concerned .
kuko iyo ubonye umuntu wenda ukuiciye akatairw imyaka itanu , ||| when you see someone who killed your family members being condemned for something like five years , you know that , sooner or later , the five years will be over and then he will be released .
ubwo ni ukuvuga ngo nimara kushira azafungurwa .. kufungwa kusa n' igihano ariko nbona jyae ubwo butabera butarangairho kuko ntarabubona , ||| being imprisoned is a punishment yes , but personally justice has not yet come my way because i have never seen it .
nta rubanza baracira umuntu unyiciye ngo nvugae ngo wenda bamukataiye urupfu cyangwa se kufungwa burundu . ibyo nabyo numva atari igihano , ||| they have never judged the people who killed my family , so that i maybe say that they were condemned to death or to life imprisonment .
numva ubwo butabera ntazi ubwo ari bwo , ||| therefore , i do n't consider that as a punishment , actually i wonder which type of justice that is .
ntintatekereza ubwo ari bwo ngo numvae ndenganuwe . ||| neither have i ever analysed it to see if it [ justice ] has been done to me .
yee , hari umuntu umwe nigeze kubona , nubwo ataishe ariko nawe yari ari mu bantu bari bari aho ngaho babiishimaiye . nramubonye . ||| i once saw one of the people who were present and who were happy about it even though he is not the one who killed them .
umubonye se uvuze iki ... ukoze iki ... ubiitwayemo utae ? ||| what did you say ? what did you do ? how did you react ?
ntabwo nigeze ngira imbaraga zo kaongera kumuvugaish , ||| i did not have the strength to talk to him .
kusa nramubonye numva ... biranrenze numva nta n' ikintu nmuvugaish . ||| i saw him and i was so overwhelmed that i did not know what to say .
kuko numvaishe ntacyo nmukorera , kuko numvaishe ngiye kumuvugaish ngira umujinya nkaba ngira ikintu kibi nkora . ||| i felt like maybe if i had talked to him , i could have said or done something wrong out of anger .
nhisemo kumuhunga nraigendera , kuko yari afunze ari kumwe n' aba ... abari bagiye kumucira urubanza muri bino bya gacacabagiye kumubaza ibintu . ||| i chose to leave . he was going to be questioned in gacaca court .
ntabwo nigeze ngira imbaraga zo kumwegera cyangwa ngo mbe ngira ikintu nvugana nawe . kuko numvaaga nta kintu nfite cyo kumubaza . ||| i did not have the strength to even approach him and ask him something .
kuko yari anzi nnjyae nri muzi , kumuvugaish numvaaga ntabona icyo muvugaish , ||| there was nothing to talk about , he knew who i was and i also knew him .
ntinmusuhuza , sina ... biranyobeye nramureka . ||| should i have greeted him ? i did not know what to do so i left it there .
ubona hari isomo tukura muri jenoside ? ||| do you think we learn anything from the genocide ? is the genocide useful in any way ?
jenoside njyae nbona hari icyo yatuigishije . ku giti cyanjye jenocide yanyigishije kumenya agaciro k' ubuzima . jenoside yanyigishije kumenya ko burya iyo umuntu afite ababyeyi ari ikintu kikomeye . kuba utabafite nibyo bikuha kumenya ... kumenya koko ko ababyeyi b' umuntu ari ingirakamaro . ||| personally the genocide taught me the value of life , it taught me to appreciate having parents .
jenoside yanyigishije byinshi . ||| loosing them is what makes you realize the importance of having them .
yanyigishije kaubaha ubuzima bw' abandi . jenoside nvuga ko yatumye menya nk' uko nbivuze kaubaha ubuzima bw' abandi , ituma menya y' uko ubuzima bwanjye ngomba kubufata neza nkabwubaha , ||| the genocide taught me respect for other people 's lives as well as respect for my own life .
kandi n' ubwabandi ... nraumva ari ibyo . ||| that 's it !
yves utekereza yuko jenoside ishobora kaongera kuba mu rwanda ? ||| yves do you think the genocide is possible again here ?
nraumva ... njyae numva bitashoboka . ||| i think it is impossible .
njyae numva ntabiizeye nkurikije ibyo nbona nbona ntabiizeye . kubera ko numva jenoside itakaongera kubaho , nbona itazanongera . ||| from what i see i believe it can never happen again .
kubera ko iyo nbona nk' urubyiruko tungana ingufu bashyiramo barwanya ibyo bintu byose tugarageza no kaongera kubiibuka , kandi bitubabaje , kandi tubona ingaruka bitugizeho , ||| when i look at the way today 's youth really fights against it all and the way they really want to fight it and remember it no matter how hard it is , and when we look at the consequences it had on us , i do n't think it is possible !
nbona bitashoboka . ||| i think it is impossible !
kandi nbona nk' uko tujya tubiganira tukora n' ibishoboka byose kugirango wenda ntiiongerae . ||| and as we were saying , we need to do all we can for it not to happen again .
uraumva ufite ibyiringiro ? ||| are you just being hopeful , or do you believe it ?
numva ubuzima bw' ejo hazaza bwanjye numva buzaba bwiza . kandi numva nifuza kuba umuntu ushobora kugira icyo yimarair , nnjyae nkagira umwuga nk' abandi , nk' uko turi tumeze mbere . ||| i believe my future will be good ; my desire is to be responsible for my life and to be able to help others the way we used to be before .
ibyo kuiga byo ni ngombaw kugirango ugirae ubuzima bwiza . kandi numva ndi umuntu ubaho nfasha abandi bafite ubuzima bubi , ||| it will take a good education , which is a must for one to be able to have a good life and to be able to help out others .
bagenzi banjye wenda tungana ntanshobora kuba nfite icyo nrusha , ||| others who are poor and whose lives are worse than mine .
numva mu minsi irimbaire nzagerageza kugira icyo nnjyae nbafasha , muri bike nba nfite numva ngerageza kugira icyo nbafasha . ||| i believe i will soon be able to help them out with the little i will be having .
numva ubuzima bw' ejo hazaza buzaba bwiza . kurenza ubwashize uko buri bumeze mu myaka cumi ishize . ||| i believe the future will be better than the last ten years have been .
ubona u rwanda nk' igihugu rukwaiye kukura somo ki ku bibaye ? ||| what do you think rwanda has to learn as a country ? and how is the best way to do it ?
jyae nbona isomo u rwanda ruvanamo ... ... nbona bibaye mu rwanda kuko u rwanda n' igihugu gitoya kandi cyiza , nbona abanyarwanda riba isomo y' uko bagomba kukundana , gufashanya nicyo kintu kituma u rwanda ... kandi no kutaibagirwa ... kutaibagirwa ibyahise . ||| rwanda is a small , beautiful country and i believe all rwandans should learn to love each other and to help each other out .
kuhora baibuka kandi bakatekereza gufashanya . ||| they also need to always remember what happened and to try and love each other and to help each other out .
kuko ibingibi byose kugirango bibae n' uko abantu batakundanaaga . ||| because for all this to happen , people did not love or respect each other .
kandi abantu bata ... basuzuguraanye nta muntu wubashaye ubuzima bw' undi . kandi kubikora nabyo kugirango babigeraeho birakomeye . ||| nobody respected other people 's loves .
kuko buri muntu wese aba afite ibibazo bye , aba afite ibimuhangayikaishije . iyaba abantu bashoboraaga kumenya ko ibibazo by' undi ugomba kubiumva , nawe ukamubwira ibyawe niho abantu bafashanya . ||| it will take a lot to make it happen as each rwandan has his or her own problems ; if people were understanding what challenges we go through individually , we would be able to help each other more effectively .
ni izihe ngoraane zikomeye ubona zikomoka ku kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu ? ||| what 's the most difficult aspect of being a survivor ?
ikintu nbona kikomeye nk' umuntu ucitse ku icumu ... kigora cy' umuntu ucitse ku icumu n' ukuibuka ibyakubayeho . ||| the thing that constitutes a challenge in being a survivor is remembering what happened to you .
kuko iyo wibutse ibyakubayeho hari igihe bishobora kutuma ubuzima bwawe bupfa . iyo ucitse ku icumu hari ibintu uba ufite wibuka bibi bishobora kuba bikubuza kugira ikindi kintu ukora . bishobora no kuba bikuhindura mu mutaima wawe , ||| sometimes as a survivor you can remember so many bad things that it destroys your life , it stops you from doing anything .
ukaba uhinduka umugome , kubera ibyo uhuye nabyo , cyangwa ibyo ubonye . ||| you can change to become a very wicked person because of the things you saw or the things you went through .
kucika ku icumu ikintu ... ingaruka ... nvuga nk' ingaruka mbi y' ikintu kituma ubuzima bukomera nk' uko nbivuze nk' ibyo ubonye , ||| being a survivor can make life very hard as i said because of what you saw .
ibyo uhuye nabyo bishobora kuba bikuhindura , uko ureba abantu bikaba bituma nta muntu ukunda . kubera ko uhuye n' ubuzima bubi . ||| what you saw might change the way you look at people and it can even stop you from loving anyone .
bikaba bituma rwa rukundo uri ufite rushobora no guhungabana ku bantu . ||| your love for people can be completely destroyed . you get to see so much evil that you do not fear anything anymore .
kuko utinyuka ibintu byinshi . ubona ibintu byinshi bibi . nyuma yaho rero ubuzima bukakukomerair bukatuma nta kintu ugeraho . ||| even afterwards , life becomes so challenging that you can not achieve anything in life .
uryama ugashiguka , kubera ya mihoro ubonye abantu bakuri hejuru ... kubona uko umwana yicwa . ||| you sleep and you 're woken up by nightmares of people with machetes who want to kill . or you remember the child you saw being killed .
icyo n' icyo kintu nbona kikomerair abantu bacitse ku icumu . ||| that 's the thing that i think can be such a challenge for the survivors .
ni ibyababayeho kandi bikibagiraho ingaruka , mu buzima bwabo . ||| it affects them for the rest of their lives .
uvuze ko mama wawe yajyaaga akugira inama y' uko ugomba kuitwara . none se ubu atakiriho ugerageje utae kubishyira mu bikorwa ? ||| you said that your mother gave you advice on how to behave when she is no longer here . how have you done that ? what 's the advice that she gave you and how have you done that ?
nvuga nk' ibyo yanbwiye by' ukuntu ngomba kuitwara igihe atazaba ahari , ||| maybe i can talk about how she told me how i should behave in her absence .
yaravugaaga ati @: "@ ujyae ukunda abantu , kandi ujyae utekereza kubaan n' abantu neza . @" ||| she told me , "@ you should love people and always think of living with people peacefully . @"
ibyo yarabinbwiye kandi akibinbwira nibajije impamvu abinbwiye . ariko nyuma nje kubitekerezaho nibaza ... atakihari nbona koko ko ibyo bintu ngomba kubikurikiza . ||| then i wondered why she told me that but later on ; when she was no longer there , i thought about it again and i realized how important it is .
nyuma yaho ubungubu ibyo bintu nbaigenderaho , ni ibintu mpora nibuka cyane . ngerageza kubaan na buri muntu wese neza . ||| i always think about it and try my best to live in good terms with everybody .
n' iyo umuntu yaba akugiraiye nabi ugerageza kubiirengagiza . kuko burya nta muntu utagira nabi nawe bishobora kukubaho . ||| even when somebody hurts me , i try not to focus on that , as it is something that has to be there .
ngerageza kukunda abantu ... kaumva ikibazo cya mugenzi wanjye . ibyo nibyo ngendairho kubera ko yabinbwiye . kandi nkagerageza kuvuga nti @: yabinbwiye azi impamvu kandi yabinbwiye ariwe muntu unkundaaga bwa mbere . ||| i try to love people and to understand people and what kind of challenges they face in life .
ni ibintu mpora ngerageza kukora . ||| it is something i try my best to be able to put into practice .
hashize iminsi ukora ku mushinga wo kaubaka urwibutso rwa gisozi . ||| you 've been working on the project in gisozi .
utubwira impamvu ? ||| why ... ?
kuku ... numva biriya bintu byo ku gisozi , nbona ari ibintu bitureba kandi tugomba kukora . ||| because the gisozi project is ours and we need to be the ones to do it .
kuko nbona umuntu atabikoze nbona nta wunri muntu ubikora . ||| if i do not do it , who else will do it ?
kuko nbabishobora ni bake . ||| not everyone is capable of doing it .
kuhora buri kihae wunva ubuzima bw' abantu bapfuye , kuhora buri kihae ureba amafoto y' abantu bapfuye , ni ibintu biteye agahinda cyane . ||| spending all your time looking into the lives of people who died and looking at their pictures is very sad .
ariko impamvu njyewe nbikoramo nkabishyiramo ingufu ni uko jyewe nbona ari ibintu bigomba kubaho . ||| but i do so and i do it with all my strength because it needs to be done .
kugirango n' abashaka ko byibagirana babiburae . ||| so that even the people who want them to be forgotten will have failed .
nbona ko umunsi biriya bintu byo ku gisozi umunsi birangiye , nbona ari ibintu bizaba bifite ingufu cyane . kuko bizafasha abantu benshi cyane . ||| i think the day the project is completed it will have a lot of impact .
ntawe ubwacu biratufasha . ||| it is very helpful even to us .
igihe uzajya ushaka kuibukair ababyeyi bawe , cyangwa n' inshuti zawe , cyangwa n' umuryango wawe . ||| the day you will want to remember your friends or your family , you will be able to go there .
nbona ari ahantu tuzajya , tukajya tuhajya hakatufasha . niyo mpamvu ku giti cyanjye nbona ari ibintu ngomba kushyiramo ingufu zishoboka . ||| that 's why i give myself fully to that project because it will be of great help .
kandi nbona ari ibintu by' ingirakamaro bizaereka n' amahanga ko koko jenoside yabaye . ||| it will even show the international community that the genocide actually happened .
urakoze . ||| thank you !
ariko haba hari ikindi kintu ushakaaga kuvuga utavuze ukivuga . ||| is there anything that you feel you should say that i have n't asked ?
ntacyo narenzaho , kusa icyo nvuga ni uko ubuzima bwanjye nyuma y' imyaka icumi ni ubuzima bukomeye kandi butoroshye . ||| i do not have much to add but the only thing i can say is that life after ten years is a very difficult life .
abantu bazi ko jenoside yarangiye ibintu byose birangiye nta kibazo . ||| some people think that the genocide is over and there 's absolutely no problem .
ariko ahubwo nyuma y' imyaka icumi nibwo abantu benshi batangiye kubona ingaruka za jenoside . ||| in fact it is now after ten years that some people are starting to realise the consequences of the genocide .
ni nabwo batangiye kumenya jenoside icyo ari cyo kuko hari abantu bakibabaye . ||| some people are getting to understand what genocide is . people are still hurting .
kuko iyo wunva umuntu akubwira ati @: "@ maze imyaka icumi ntishima , " ntaba akubeshya . kuko burya aba amaze imyaka icumi ataishima . ||| when someone tells you that they have been unhappy for ten years , they mean it .
ubuzima bwa nyuma y' imyaka icumi ni ubuzima butoroshye . kandi n' ubungubu bukikomeye kuko haracyari kare . nbona inzira ndende ikihari , kandi tuzagerageza kuyi ... tukagerageza ku ... kujya mbere , ||| life ten years later is a tough one and this is still too soon , we still have a long way to go and despite the fact that those who did it do not want us to progress , we will try and move forward .
kuko ababikoze bashaka ko tubaho nabi . niyo mpamvu tugomba kugerageza ntitubaeho nabi . kandi nziko imaan izatufasha tukabaho neza . ||| and i believe god will help us to do so and to be able to help one another .
kandi tukanafashanya kuko abacitse ku icumu bose ntabwo ariko bameze neza , imfubyi zihari ntabwo ari ko zimeze neza . zikeneye abacitse ku icumu bagenzi bazo kugirango babahumurizae . bababwirae nabo uko babigenza kugirango ubwo buzima bubi baburengae . ||| the survivors do not live in good conditions , the orphans have a difficult life and they need other survivors to be able to share the challenges they go through and also the victories , the way out .
nbona ko abacitse ku icumu turakeneraanye , kandi tugomba gufashanya . ||| i think us survivors need each other .
kuko imfubyi ntabwo zishobora , ||| very few people who are not survivors can actually be able to help out a survivor .
nta muntu ... ni abantu bake bashobora ... yahumuriza undi ucitse ku icumu we ataracitse ku icumu . ||| whereas a survivor can encourage another one better , as he or she is the one who can relate to what they are going through and who can show them that is it actually possible to overcome .
kuko niwe uzi ubuzima yahuye nabwo , kuko niwe uzi ko ubwo buzima yaburenga kuko burya iyo umuntu akubwiye ibibazo bye nibwo wunva ko ibyawe nta kibazo wowe ufite , ||| sometimes hearing about the challenges other people go through makes you feel like yours are less important .
ahubwo ukaumva ugize imbaraga kuko hari undi muntu umeze nkawe . ||| it instils some strength in you ! that 's my opinion !
izina ryanjye ni murengezi wilbeforce , ||| my name is murengezi wilberforce .
nkaba nfite imyaka mirogo itanu n' umunani . ||| i am 58 years old .
wilbeforce , umuryango wawe uri ukizawe n' abantu bangahe , mbere ya jenoside ? ||| wilberforce perhaps you could just tell me , how many people were in your family before the genocide ?
nri nfite ... jyewe n' umugore wanjye n' abana batanu . ||| there was my wife and i and our five children .
none se hasigaye bangahe bakiriho nyuma ya jenoside ? ||| and how many of your family are left after the genocide ?
eh , umugore wanjye tumenyaanye kera , turi abanyeshuri muri ecole secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] . ||| i met my wife a long time ago when we were still in secondary school ; we went to the same school .
turiganyae , niho tutangiraiye kauzura . kandi tumaze kuiga ecole secondaire tumaze imyaka ine tutararongoraan turi aba fiances , ||| we fell in love then . after high school , we were engaged for four other years before we got married .
hanyuma muri 1971 turarongoraan . ||| then in 1971 , we got married .
ntabwo rero yari umukobwa tupfuye kuhora kusa , ariko n' umuntu tubanye igihe kirekire tutararongoraan , ||| therefore , she was not a girl i just met and married but we were together for a long time before marriage .
kandi n' ababyeyi bacu bari baraziraanye , kuko bose bari abapasitori muri eglise episcopale mu rwanda . ||| even our parents knew each other because they were both pastors in the episcopal church in rwanda .
tubanye ... uraumva tumaraanye imyaka mirongo itatu n' itatu ... eh ... hari ibyo nbeshye gatoya kuko tumaraanye imyaka ... kugeza muri 1994 , ||| so we spent thirty @-@ three years together .
ubwo turi tumaraanye imyaka makumyabiri n' itatu turongoraanye . ||| sorry that was n't true ; by 1994 , we had been married for twenty @-@ three years .
muri iyo myaka makumyabiri n' itatu , niyo tubyayemo abahungu babiri n' abakobwa batatu . ||| we had two sons and three daughters together in those twenty @-@ three years .
nbwira noneho ku mwana wawe wa kabiri [ cyangwa ku buheta bwawe ] . ||| tell me about your second child .
eh , umwana wanjye wa kabiri yitwaaga jean claude . ||| my second born was called jean @-@ claude .
yari umuhungu muremure cyane , ||| he was a very tall guy .
uri ugeze muri 6 eme secondaire [ muwa gatandatu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] , ||| he was in his 6th year of secondary school , almost finishing high school .
agiye kurangiza humanite , kandi yari umuhungu ukunda kuceceka cyane , ||| he was a very quiet guy .
ariko yakundaaga kaumva amakuru ya radio . nbonaaga ari umuntu uzaba umunyamakuru , cyangwa umupoliticien [ umunyapolitike ] niko nibaza . ||| he liked listening to the radio news , which used to make me predict that maybe in the future he would become a journalist or a politician .
nta kinri kikomeye nmuvugaho ubungubu kuko ntiyakundaaga kuvuga cyane , ||| there 's nothing much i can say about him because he was not very talkative .
ahubwo yakundaaga kaumva ibyo abantu bavuga . ||| but he loved to listen to others talking .
ngirango nta ... ntacyo narenzaho kuvuga kuko ... njya kugenda , ||| there 's nothing more i can say .
nsize mubwiye ko agomba kufasha nyina , kutwara imokoka kujya ahantu bari bagiye kujya . ||| when i was leaving , i called him and told him to be the one to drive the car when they go to a place where they were planning to go with his mother .
kandi nramuhamagaye nranbwira nti ... @: niryo jambo rya nyuma nmubwiye nti : jya ujyenda buhoro mu muhanda kandi witonde . ngirango nta kinri narenzaho ki ... ||| the last thing i told him was not to drive too fast and to be careful on the road . that 's all i can say .
nbwira nanone ku mwana wawe wa gatatu [ ubuheture ] . ||| tell me about your third child .
eh , yari umwana w' umukobwa witwaga kayitesi clodette . ||| she was a girl called kayitesi claudette .
nawe yari ageze mu mwaka unyuma wa secondaire . ||| she was also in her last year of secondary school .
yari umukobwa ufite amagara mato , ariko w' umunyabwenge cyane mu ishuri . ||| she was not very healthy but she was very bright in school . i thought she would have a very good future .
kandi yari umwana na ... nbonaaga inberae ... uko umubyeyi aba yifuriza umwana , numvaaga nbona ko ... kubera ko yari azi ibintu bya science cyane nbonaaga ko ashobora kuzaba umuganga [ docteur en medicine ] . ||| as any parent i wanted the best for her and since she was very good in science , i thought she was going to be a medical doctor .
naho umwana wa kane ? ||| what about the fourth born ?
... umwana wa kane , ni francine inkabirae , ||| my fourth child was francine ingabire .
mufite kuri ariya mafoto yanyu , ||| you have her on your photos .
yari umwana ukunda mukuru cyane , clodette . kandi yari umwana ukunda kaoga , kujya kaoga [ natation ] . ||| she loved her sister claudette very much ; she loved to swim .
yari umwana ukunda kuza tuvuye ku kazi , akaza kutuganiriza , kutubaza icyo tushaka , ||| she was always there to talk to us after work , she would chat with us and ask her what we needed .
akenshi abana benshi ntibakunda kubigira . ariko we abaza @: ||| not many children do that but she would come and ask us if we wanted a drink or some water or tea .
"@ nkuhae fanta ... nkuhae amazi ... nkuhae icyayi ... @" ubonaaga ko ari umwana witaye no ku babyeyi cyane , ||| she was a child who cared a lot about her parents .
ahari kurenza bakuru be . ||| perhaps more than her older brothers and sisters did .
ni ikihae kintu cy' umwihariko wibuka kuri we ? ||| what is your special memory of her ?
yego . nizera imaan kandi nracyayikorera kugeza n' ubu , ||| yes i do believe in god and i still work for him until this day .
ntinri pasteur nka data , ||| i am not a pastor like my father but i do what i can .
ariko ibyo nshoboye kukora ... ubundi nkunda kuririmba . nrabikora nfite abana nyobora mu makwaya [ choir cyangwa chorale ] kuko numva ko , ||| i love to sing and i lead some children in a choir .
n' aho ibyo bibaye , ariko imaan ifite icyo yansigaraije kugirango nyikorerae mu buzima bwanjye buri busigaye . ||| i do it because i guess there is a mission that god left me to complete in my remaining lifetime .
ushobora lkumbwira uburyo umugore n' abana bawe bapfuye ? ||| can you tell me how your wife and your children died ?
uko bapfuye ... nk' uko nbabwiye ntinri mpari , ||| i was n't there like i told you before .
ariko uwo mukobwa wanjye usigaye , celine . hari ibyo yanbwiye , ||| but celine my daughter who survived told me some of the things .
kandi hari abaturanyi bashoboye kuihisha , bashoboye gutoroka ntibapfa . nabo baranbwiye . ||| also some neighbours who escaped death by hiding and fleeing told me about it .
ubundi turi tutuye ku kicukiro , kandi umunsi wa mbere baje kumubaza , ||| we were living in kicukiro .
itariki zirindwi baje kumubaza , babaza mu muryango wanjye , bati @: "@ murengezi ni uwuhe ? @" ||| on the first day they came to ask my family , "@ who is murengezi ? @"
undi nawe ababwira ko ntahari . ||| they told them i was not there .
hanyuma umugore wanjye bamurashe ku kirengae bamubwira bati @: "@ turagaruka tusangae umubonye . @" ||| they shot my wife on the feet and said , "@ we shall come back . find him ! @"
ariko ntabwo bagarutse . kugeza ku itariki umunani , bahungira mu babikira , ||| they did not come back until the 8th when my family went to hide in a convent which was in the neighbourhood .
bari hafi bose , ku itariki ya cumi , baraza bababwira ngo mumanukae muesae . tugiye gukontorora ... tugiye kureba identite zanyu , ||| on the 10th , they came and told them that everybody should go down , as they wanted to check their identity cards .
kandi babashyira kuri bariyeri yari hepfo y' urugo . batangira kugenda bajyana umwe umwe , umwe , ahantu hari icyobo hepfo y' umuhanda . ||| they stood next to a roadblock and took them to a hole nearby , one by one .
bamwe baaka ... bakabarasa abandi bakabakubita inyundo abandi bakabatema . ||| some were shot dead , others were killed with a hammer , and some others were hacked .
ariko mu kuvuga ukuri , umuntu umwe yanbwiye kuko kuko umugore wanjye yacumbagiraga bamujyanye hanyuma , bamurasair aho abandi bari bari muri uwo mwobo , barunda aho , ||| in fact , someone told me that my wife was last taken as she was limping and they shot her inside the hole where the others were .
muri uwo mwobo . uwo mwobo n' ubu turawubaakaiye , ||| the hole is still there ; we have constructed it .
hapfuye abantu muri ako kagari k' iwacu bageze ku ijana . kandi bose tubashyize mu mwobo umwe turawufunga , turabubakira . ||| about a hundred people in our neighbourhood died and we buried them all together in the same grave , which we built up .
ariko mu rugo rwanjye ntabwo harimo abana banjye kusa n' umugore , ||| there were other people in my house apart from my wife and my children .
harimo n' abakozi . ||| the people who were working for us were also there .
hari umukobwa umwe w' inshuti yacu ... uri umukozi wacu , ariko hanyuma yari yaragiye turamushakiye akazi ahandi . ||| there was a lady , a friend of ours who used to work for us . she had stopped working for us as we got for her another job , she happened to be at home on that day .
we barebye mu identite [ indangamuntu ] basanga ari umuhutukazi , kandi baramubwira bati @: "@ we va aho ntacyo tukushakira . @" ||| they checked her id and found out she was a hutu and they told her to leave .
kandi kuko yari asindagije umugore wanjye yari yakomeretse , we yaravuze ati @: "@ jyewe ntabwo muva iruhande , nimunyica munyicanae nawe . @" ||| she was helping out my wife who was wounded and she told them she was n't going to leave and they could kill her if they wanted .
yanze kumuva iruhande kandi bamwiciye hamwe n' umugore wanjye . ||| so they murdered her right there next to my wife .
claude kuko ari muremure , ibyo ni mushiki we ubinbwiye . bamukubise agafuni mu mutawe hanyuma yitura hasi hanyuma bamanukaan mu mwobo . ||| because he was tall , claude , according to what his sister told me , was beaten with a club on his head and they threw him inside the hole .
ariko ahongaho icyo bakoraaga iyo bamaraaga kukukubita inyundo cyangwa ikindi bakurikizaagaho kukurasa isasu kugirango we kukomeza kusakuza . ||| after hitting you with a hammer or with something else , then they would shoot you in order to stop people from making noise .
kandi hari umusirikare umwe uhaje ntinzi izina rye ariko n' abamumbwiye . abo bakize , ko yaje akababwira ati @: "@ mwe kutuma basakuza . ||| some of the survivors told me about a soldier , i do n't know his name , who came and told the interahamwe to make sure they [ victims ] do not make too much noise . @"
mubigirae buhoro be kutaka , mubakubitae inyundo nimurangizae mubarase , mujyae mumurasa birangirae . ||| do it as fast as possible , do n't give them time to beg you to stop ; after beating them with a club just shoot them .
kandi mugirae vuba hano mu muhanda hano ntitushaka abantu bahaguma , za satelite ziratureba . @" ||| we do not want people 's bodies on the street as satellites are watching us . @"
ibyo ni ibyo nbwiye n' umuturanyi wanjye turi tuturanye , we ushoboye kuihisha , ariko nawe umugore we yarapfuye . ariko we yashoboye kuihisha ntiyagira icyo aba . ||| i was told this by my neighbour who managed to hide , his wife was also killed .
mu kuvuga ukuri rero , ntabyo nbonye uretse uwo mwana mutoya celine uwineza , ||| the truth is that i did not see any of this ; it is my young daughter celine who told me about it .
we ntinzi niba ari imaan yohereje umuntu ariko haje umusirikare aravuga ati @: "@ abana bato bose ... muesae muzamukae . ||| i do n't know if it is god who sent somebody but a soldier came and said that all the young children should go back to the nuns ' home .
kandi na celine yari umwana muto w' imyaka icyenda nawe arazamuka basubira mu babikira . ni uko yakize kubera ko uwo muntu yaje akavuga ati @: "@ abana bato muzamukae musubirae mu kibikira . @" ||| celine was only nine years old then and so she went back to the nuns ' home because that man told them to do so .
kandi ikintu kibaye ni uko yaramubwiye ... nyina yaramurembuje , amuha imfunguzo z' imodoka ati @: "@ uzazihae papa numubona . @" ||| the other thing that happened is that her mother gave her the car keys and told her to give them to her dad [ me ] in case she would be lucky to see him again .
ntabwo yashoboye kuzimpa kuko bairukanse kandi icyabaye ikikomeye n' uko n' iyo modoka ntabwo bashoboye ... ||| but she never gave them to me because they were running and even the car was ...
francine se we ibye bigenze bite ? ||| what happened to francine ?
ku bya francine rwose ntacyo nmenya , ||| about francine ... i do n't know anything about what happened to her .
kuko na murumuna we ntacyo avuga . yabonye byinshi ariko avuga bike cyane . ||| her younger sister does not say anything about her although she saw many things happen .
ariko mu magambo avuga yanbwiye , yanbwiye ko bamutemye n' umupanga . ||| but she just told me that they hacked her with a machete .
ntabwo nkunda kumubaza byinshi kuko iyo ntangiye kumuganiriza nbona ko nawe nta kunda kubivuga cyane . ||| i do n't like to ask her too many questions , because i know she does not like to talk about it .
akunda kuicecekair . ariko rimwe na rimwe iyo mubajije akantu arakanbwira ariko kuganira umwanya munini akutekerereza ntabwo bimukundira . ||| sometimes when i ask her something she answers , but she is unable to have a long conversation about it .
wunva usobanura utae , kuba uri umubyeyi ukapfusha abana n' umugore mu bintu nk' ibi ? ||| what does it mean to be a parent who has lost his wife and his children ?
mbere , umuntu yumvaaga ko ahari yari inzozi , ahari arimo kurota . ariko iminsi ikashira indi ikataha , ||| at first , it felt like it was a nightmare but as time goes you get to realize that it has actually happened because you do not get to see them anymore !
kuko ukaumva ko ari ibintu bibaye , kuko utababona . kandi rimwe na rimwe [ ntinzi niba n' abandi bijya bibabaho ] ariko jyae rimwe na rimwe hariho igihe nganira n' umwe muri bo . nijoro , ||| sometimes i talk to them at night as if they were still around !
ukaumva muraganiriye , ariko biba ikibazo kuko ntibikushiramo . ||| it is a big problem because it can never disappear completely .
kuko nkanjyae imaan yampaye umugisha nbona undi mugorae , ndetse nongera no kubyara abandi bana babiri batoya . ||| god blessed me with another wife and two more children .
ariko ntabwo bikushiramo iteka cyane cyane iyo bigeze muri iki kihae , utangira kubaibuka , kubatekereza ndetse no muri kamere yawe , mu nbaraga zawe , ||| you can never completely forget , especially at this time of the year you think about them and remember them .
uri usanganywe hari ikintu kigabanuka cyane ... kigabanuka cyane . ntabwo umuntu ashobora kaongera kumera nk' uko yari ameze ntabwo bikunda . kuko famille uba urabayemo ... famille yawe , ||| you can never be the same person again , your character and your whole being change . you can never forget ; it is impossible !
mukamara imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu , noneho nvuye ku mugorae wanjye we kuko tumenyaanye kera tukiri abana . uraumva ni souvenir zo mu bwana zirakura , zirakura kugeza igihe mubaye ... mwubatse urugo mukabana neza , ||| after living the family you lived with for twenty @-@ five years , i have told you that i met my wife in my childhood and we grew up together , we got married and we got kids and suddenly it was all gone .
mukabyara abana , hanyuma bikashira . wunva usa n' aho usigaye ... utari ... ukibaza ndetse rimwe na rimwe impamvu usigaye . ||| sometimes you wonder why you survived !
ni ... ni ikibazo kikomeye . ||| it is a very tough question .
kuko kubabarira umuntu , ubaw mbere na mbere ugomba kubanza ukamenya uwo ari we . kuko ntiubabarira umuntu utakusabye imbabazi . cyangwa se utamenye uwo ari we ngo umurebae uti @: ||| because , for one to be able to forgive , you first of all need to know whom you 're forgiving , you can not forgive if no one asks you to forgive him or her or when you do n't know who it is you 're forgiving .
uriya yari yabaye umusazi reka muihorerae . ||| or maybe when nobody has come to ask for forgiveness so that you can at least acknowledge that they were going through some sort of madness .
birakomeye rero kuvuga ijambo ryo kubabarira . ||| the word "@ forgiveness @" is a tough one .
ariko mpamya ko umuntu aje akanbwira ati @: " nrakuhemukaiye nkuiciye umugore , nkuiciye abana , " nmubarira . ||| but i believe if someone would come to me and say , "@ i betrayed you , i murdered your wife , i murdered your kids @"@ , i would forgive them .
kuko mwishe nnjyae nba nbaye umwicanyi . ||| i 'd also become a murderer if i killed them .
nmubabarira rwose . ariko ikibazo kihari ni ukumenya ahubwo uwo ubabarira uwo ari we , ||| i would truly forgive them but the question is who to forgive .
ni inde ? ||| who is it ?
kuko abahutu bose ntabwo baishe , ||| not all hutus killed .
ntabwo rero uvuga ngo urababarira abahutu . ||| therefore you can not say that you 're forgiving the hutus .
ugomba kumenya umuntu ku izina rye uti kanaka yankoreye ibi ariko nramubabariye . ||| you need to know who did it and then be able to say that , so and so did this to me but i forgive him or her .
kandi nk' umukristo nnjyae nzi ko bavuga ngo mujyae mubabarira abantu ibyaha babakorera kuko nnjyae ubyo munkorera nrabibabarira . ||| as a christian i know it is written , "@ forgive others as i forgive you . @"
nk' umukristo rero nemera ko umuntu ashobora kubabarira umuntu , ariko cyane cyane agomba kumenya uwo ababarira uwo ari we . ||| therefore , as a believer i truly believe it is possible to forgive but you ought to know whom you are forgiving .
aje inberae yanjye rero akansaba imbabazi , nmubabarira . ||| so if they came before me and asked me to forgive them , i could do it .
njyae numva ari uko nbivuga ariko yabivuze . ||| that 's the way i can put it . but the condition is that they would say it .
kuko ntabwo utanga imbabazi ngo uvugae ngo nrababariye bande se ? ||| you can not forgive in general . who is it you 're forgiving ?
mpanya ndetse ko aricyo kintu tubura muri iki gihugu cyacu cyo mu rwanda . ni uko umuntu ashobora kuvuga ati @: " jyewe nrakuhemukaiye . ||| i think that is what we lack here in rwanda , that someone would come and acknowledge that they betrayed you , that they killed your people .
ngize gutya , nishe abantu bawe , none nbabarira . @" icyo kihae umuntu yababarira , ||| if it were the case , people would forgive .
ariko igihe abantu bose ... benshi babihakana ko ntabyo bakoze , ukibaza niba abo bantu baraiishe , barapfuye kusa . ||| very few people acknowledge what they did and you wonder if these people killed themselves , if they just happened to die .
kuko abantu babiemera nibake cyane ; ugereranyaije n' umubare w' abantu bapfuye . ||| it is so obvious when you compare the number of the victims to the number of those who acknowledge being the perpetrators of the genocide .
abo tuturanye ... turi tuturanye , ||| the same people who were our neighbours .
nkubwira urugero rumwe rw' umugabo turi tuturanye witwa simbizi . hagati ye n' iwanjye hari haciyemo inzu imwe . ||| i 'll give you the example of one of my neighbours called simbizi , there was one house between his and mine .
turi tuziraanye kuva kera . ||| we had known each other for a long time .
kandi bamufashe baje kunbaza kugirango nrebae niba muzi . ||| when they arrested him they asked me to come and identify him .
kandi mugeze inberae baramubajije bati @: "@ uyu muntu uramuzi ? @" yaravuze ati @: "@ oya ntabwo muzi . @" ||| when i got there they asked him if he knew me , he said no !
umh ! uraumva icyo kintu kirakomeye noneho kugirango umuntu avugae ngo ntakuzi , ||| you see how difficult it is !
umuntu tuiraraanwaga , mwasangiraga , umwana we yajyaaga aza iwanjye akasangira n' abanjye rwose . umh ! ||| someone we used to live with and spend a lot of time with , his child used to come home and share meals with mine and he said he does n't know me and yet we were neighbours !
ariko yaravuze ngo ntabwo anzi , kandi turi tuturanye . ||| despite the fact that we were neighbours , he said he did n't know me .
ibyo rero bigaragaza ko abanyarwanda igihe bataravugaish ukuri , no kuemera ikintu bakoze , kutanga imbabazi bizaruhanya . ariko ubundi nibyo biri byiza . ||| that shows how much forgiveness will be difficult as long as rwandans will not tell the truth about what they did . otherwise , forgiveness is for sure the ideal thing to do .
none se ubwo wunva ubutabera bushoboka ? cyangwa usanga butashoboka ? ||| so is justice possible or not ?
wowe wunva ubutabera burakoze ku biha bikorewe abana bawe ? ||| do you feel justice has been done for your children ?
kugeza ubu ntabwo irakorwa . kugeza ubu nta justice [ ubutabera ] irakorwa , eeh ... nvuga kuri jyae ntayo irakorwa , ||| so far , no ! no justice has been done so far !
kandi mpamya ko no kubanri ari uko . ||| in my opinion , not yet and i believe even others feel the same way .
kuko justice y' umuntu ukumaze umuryango , ukumazeho abana , ni iyihe ? ||| because what justice can be done to somebody who wiped out your children , all your family ?
kufungwa imyaka itanu , cyangwa itandatu , cyangwa icumi bakamufungura uba ubonye iki ? ||| what do you gain when they are imprisoned for five , or six or ten years ?
aba ahanawe iki ? ||| what punishment is that ?
justice ... ubutabera buzakorwa abantu bazakiraw imanza bakurikije amategeko uko avugaw , ariko abenshi ntibazamenyekana . abenshi ntabwo bazamenyekana . niho ikibazo gikomereye . ||| justice will be done according to the laws of the country , but many will never be known and that is a very big issue because many have fled from where their former residence .
kuko abenshi bahunze n' aho biciye , bakajya kutura ahandi batabazi . ||| they now live in places where they are not known .
ahandi ndetse nbagira abo bamenya bakatinya kubavuga , kuko babagirair nabi hanyuma . ||| or maybe they are known but nobody has the courage to report them for fear that they might take revenge afterwards .
ni ... mu rwanda n' ikibazo kikomeye cyane kugirango hatabaye kusaba imbabazi , no kuirega kw' abantu , no kuemera icyaha bakoze , bizaruhanya cyane . ||| it is a very big issue in rwanda . it will be very difficult unless they ask for forgiveness and confess their sin and acknowledge them .
wiyumvise kutae , igihe uri ugiye hanyuma ukaumva ko umuryango wawe bawishe ? wumvise umerewe utae ... ? ||| how does it make you feel personally that you were n't there when your family died ?
eeh , nrarwaye . eeh ... , nrwaye indwara ntazi , ||| i got sick , with a weird sickness i had never heard of before .
buri bwo bwa mbere ingeraho , ariko nrwaye kuishima [ ahita yishima mu mutawe no ku maboko ] , umubiri wose . ||| my whole body was itching and i was scratching myself all over .
nkishima cyane kumara igihe kandi njya kwa muganga ntibanbonerae umuti . ||| i went to see a doctor and they could n't give me any medication .
kandi umuganga yaranbwiye umwe ngiye kureba ureba ibierekeye iby' ihahamuka cyangwa ibindi ... aranbwira ati @: " nuwumva ushaka kurair jya urira cyane . ||| the psychologist told me that it 's ok to cry when i feel like it and that i could do it as much as i wanted maybe when i am alone .
wiherereye urirae . @" icyo kihae nri jyenyine nri nrashoboye kugera muri kenya i nairobi , ||| i was in nairobi , kenya then , all by myself .
kandi hafi ninjoro buri kihae ... uraumva ku manywa uratemberaaga ukajya kureba abandi bahunze mukaganira , ||| during the day i used to walk around and spend time with others who were in the same situation .
ariko ninjoro uryamye nibwo wibuka ibintu byose , ukaumva aho usigaye , ukaumva utazi ibyo ari byo . ||| but almost every night , i would remember everything and i would feel like i did not know where i was .
kuko uretse abo mu muryango wanjye no mu muryango wo hirya , ||| in reality , apart from my close family , i lost many other relatives .
hari mukuru wanjye turi tuturanye , n' umugore we , n' abana bamwe bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] urabizi familles [ imiryango ] zo muri afrika , na data . ||| my big brother who was also my neighbour , his wife and my father , some children who were living with them , you know the way the african family is , were also all killed .
nabo bari bamaze kupfa . hari ... muramu wanjye musaza w' umugore wanjye n' umugore we n' abana be batandatu , bose bari bamaze kupfa . ||| there was my brother @-@ in @-@ law and his wife and their six children who had also died .
hari databukwe na mabukwe , bose bari bamaze kupfa . ||| my father @-@ in @-@ law and my mother @-@ in @-@ law also died .
uraumva rero wunvaaga ko uruhande rwawe rwose nta kisigaye . ||| it felt like you were left completely on your own .
na john ... john niwe nri nzi ko ariho kuko yarigaga , yarigaga mu mahanga hanze , we nri nzi ko ariho we turavuganaaga . ||| john is the only one i knew who was still alive because he was studying abroad and we used to talk on phone .
ariko na celine ntinmenye ko yariho nawe nri nzi ko yapfuye . ||| at that time i did n't know that celine survived , i thought she also died .
ubwo rero numva ko umuryango wose @: ari umuryango w' umugore wanjye ; ari umuryango wanjye ; nta kisigaye . ||| so i felt like there was no one left , either on my side , or on my wife 's side .
ariko by' amahirwe tuje kugira amahirwe kubona abandi bavandimwe babiri basigaye , batagize icyo baba bashoboye kujya muri mille collines [ hoteli yihishemo abantu ] . ||| we were lucky to later on find out that two of our relatives survived as they took refuge at mille collines hotel .
hanyuma hari na murumuna ... na barumuna b' umugore wanjye babiri . ||| also two of my wife 's sisters survived .
ubwo uraumva rero nyuma wongeye kubona ko hari abandi bantu bakiriho , bikakuhumuriza . bikakutera kaongera kushaka kubaho , ||| so after the war , being able to find out that some people were still alive was very encouraging and motivated us to want to continue to live and give your best .
kandi cyane cyane no kureba abo bana usigaraanye , ukaumva ko ugomba kubaho no kugirango babaeho nk' uko imaan yabakuhaye kandi basigaye . usanga rero ari ngombaw kukora icyo ushoboye cyose kugirango n' abo basigaye bazashoborae kubaho no kuiga no kugira icyo bageraho . ||| especially because somebody needed to look after the children who survived so that they could study and live a good life and achieve something .
wunva wifuza ko bakuibukaw kutae ? ||| how would you like them to be remembered ?
eeh , cyane cyane nk' iyi minsi bashyiraho yo kuibuka , itariki ya karindwi ni umunsi umuntu yongera akabaibuka cyane . n' ubwo n' ubundi umuntu abaibuka , ||| especially on the days that were made for remembrance , on the 7th , the day of commemoration is a day one gets to remember them a lot .
ariko uba umunsi usangiraho n' abandi banyarwanda kuibuka abanyu . ||| even though we remember them anyway , that day is a day you share with other rwandans in doing so and it helps us to think together and look for a way for this never to happen again in rwanda .
bikatuma mutekereza ikintu kikorwa kugirango ibi bintu bibayeho ... iri tsebwabwoko ribayeho , ritazaongera kubaho . yewe ritazagira n' undi ribaho mu isi . kuko ni ikintu kiteye ubwoba . ||| and that it should not happen to anybody else worldwide because it is terrible !
kandi cyane cyane nkunda kureba amafoto yabo , ||| i also enjoy looking at their photos .
kuko nri nfite mushiki wanjye ubaga i kinshasa . hari amafoto menshi yari afite n' amwe nbaeretse niwe wayampaye , ||| my sister who was living in kinshasa , congo drc had many of their photos .
kuko inzu barayitwitse yose n' ibyarimo byose ntacyo tubonye . ariko yashoboye kutuha amafoto amwe , ||| she is the one who gave me even the photos i showed you since the house and everything in it was burnt up .
nkunda rero kuicara rimwe na rimwe nkayareba , kandi bituma nibuka ... nbaibuka . mbese n' ubu nkibaza nti @: ||| so i sometimes sit down and look at them and i remember !
"@ ubu baba bameze batae ? aba bana baba bameze batae ? nyina wabo aba ameze atae ? @" ni ibintu rero nibuka cyane . ||| i think about them and wonder how the children would be today , how their mother would be ... it is something i remember very much .
kandi nta muntu ushobora kukukuramo kuibuka abantu bawe , bagize ubuzima bwawe . ||| nobody can stop you from remembering your people who were so much part of your life .
n' ubwo hariho abantu baba batashaka ko mubiibuka , mubivuga , ariko twebwe ntitushobora kutabiibuka . ||| even though some people do not want us to remember or to talk about it , we can not forget them .
tuzahora tubiibuka kandi n' abana bacu babimenye , kugirango nabo bazanabiirindae . ||| we will always remember and even our children need to be told about it .
kuko ahari akenshi twa ... tuzize kuibwira ko bitashoboka . ||| perhaps our biggest mistake was that we never believed it could actually happen .
ariko ubu tuzi neza ko abantu bashobora kugambirira kukora ... kumaraho abantu . igikuru cya mbere n' ukumenya ko mugomba kuanga icyo kintu . ||| but now we know it is possible , we are aware that people can betray others and wipe up entire families .
mu bitekerezo mubiigisha abandi , kandi biba ngombaw kubirwanya n' imbaraga ... n' ingufu mukabirwanya . ||| it is something we need to fight against in our thinking and this can be done through teaching and also in fighting against it with all our strength .
ariko mpamya ko mu bana , mu rubyiruko bagenda baigisha , baigisha inyigisho niyo ya mbere nkuru . ||| but i believe that the younger generation and the youth , if they keep on teaching .... educational method is the primary idea .
inyigisho niyo yabiteye , ||| after all , it was through education that everything came up .
inyigisho niyo izabirangiza . ||| therefore , education is what will take it away .
nta kinri kibirangiza . ||| nothing else can !
turangiza nbwira uko wunva ejo hazaza ? wilbeforce wa none ni inde ; kandi ejo hazaza uhaumva utae ? ese wunva uhafitiye ikaizerae , ||| finally what is your ... how do you feel about the future ? wilberforce , who are you today and how do you view the future ? are you optimistic ?
cyangwa se wunva hazaba heza ; ||| are you faithful ?
cyangwa ... ||| how do you feel ?
aah ... ! ||| ha ha ... !
[ araseka ] nbanje kukubwira nti jyae nk' umuntu w' imaan nizera ibintu bizaba byiza . nizera ko akazaoza k' igihugu cyacu , kazaba keza . ||| [ he laughs ] in the beginning i told you that i am a man of god . i have faith that things will be good . i trust in a better future for our country .
avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' igihugu cyacu izaba nziza . ariko kugirango ibae nziza ni uko tubikora ... ni uko tubikorera . ||| the future of our country will be good ; but for it to be good , we will need to work towards it .
nitutabikorera ntabwo izaba nziza . ariko nitutabikorera , avenir [ ejo hazaza ] yacu izaba nziza . ||| if we do not work for it , it will n't happen ; but if we do , our future will be good .
ni ikintu rero kitari icya murengezi wenyine , n' ikintu kitari icya abayobozi bonyine , ||| it is not only murengezi 's responsibility or the government 's responsibility .
ni ikintu abanyarwanda bose bagomba kuiumvaish . ko niba tushaka kuzamera neza mu mu kihae kiri inberae , ||| all rwandans need to understand that if we want to build a better future and to avoid what we went through in the past , we will have to work on it .
kuzairinda ibyo byose tunyuzemo , tugomba kubikorera . ||| things will never happen miraculously .
ntabwo bizizana ni icyo nkubwira . ||| that 's all i can tell you .
ntashaka ko unbwira ibintu byinshi ... nbwira kuri mama wawe . ||| tell me about your mother .
... usae n' umunshushanyiriza . ||| describe her for me .
mama wanjye yari ... yari muremure ; ari inyobae , afite imisatsi y' iraendae , ||| my mother was tall and brown ; she had soft hair .
yakundaaga kuambara amajipo cyane n' amashati . ||| she liked dressing in skirts and shirts .
nibyo ntekereza nvuga kuri mama ikindi nvuga kuri mama , ||| that 's what i can say about my mother .
yakundaaga kusetsa cyane . ||| she was a very funny person .
ikindi nanone akagira ikitsurae . ||| but she could also be a tough person !
reka tutangirae nk' uko bisanzwe birarushaho kuba byiza . uyu munsi turi ku itariki ya 30 werurwe 2004 , turi ku kicukiro , kigali . ||| this is the 30th of march 2004 , and we are in kigali , kicuciro .
tukaba tuganira na beatha . ||| and , we are talking about beatha .
ubwo rero beatha nkusaba ngo unbwirae kuri mama wawe . ||| beatha , tell me about your mother .

yari inyobae cyane , ari muremure akunda kuambara amajipo kenshi . ||| she was very brown and tall .
hanyuma ikindi yakundaaga kusetsa cyane , ||| she was a very funny person .
ariko hamwe akagira ikitsurae kinini ... yagirair ... yakundaaga abantu bose . ||| but she could also be a tough person ! she loved everybody .
unbabarirae , ariko unbwiye muri make . nbwira ibintu byose uba wibuka kuri mama wawe . ||| sorry , please tell me more about your ... tell me about your first memory of your mother ...
ni igihe kibaga ari nko kuri noheri , ||| it was on christmas time .
kuri noheri njyaaga kusenga , kuri noheri nbaga ... batukuriye imyenda mishya , ||| i used to go to church on christmas and they used to buy us new clothes .
hanyuma nkajya kusenga nkeye , nza saa sita tukasanga batetse ibiryo bitasanzwe . ||| so i would be very smart in church on that day and i would always find nice food at home .
ubundi nkundaaga kuganira na mama cyane tuicaye mu gikoni . ||| i used to enjoy spending time with her chatting in the kitchen .
ni iki kintu kitasanzwe ubonaaga icyo kihae ? ||| what was special about those ocassions ... on that ocassion of christmas .
bibaga ari umunsi abantu bose bajya kusenga , ||| everybody used to go to church on that day , even the people who had not been to church in a long time .
babaga bataheruka mu rusengero . icyo nibuka nk' umwana ni uko icyo kihae turyaaga ibiryo bitasanzwe ... bitari bisanzwe turyaaga . ||| and it was the day we 'd eat special meals .
hanyuma ikidasanzwe ni uko imiryango myinshi yateranaaga abantu bakasangira , bakanywa inzoga , bakanywa ikigage byose . ||| and the other thing that made it special was that many families used to gather together on that day and share drinks , different local beers and several others .
noneho reka nkubaze ikibazo nri nkwaiye kuba ubundi ntangiraiyeho . unbwira izina ryawe n' imyaka ufite ? ||| i forgot to ask you a basic question at the beginning . can you just give me your name and age ?
izina ryanjye nitwa uwazaninka beatha , nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' ine y' amavuko . ||| my name is uwazaninka beatha , i am twenty @-@ four years old .
unbwira ikintu ubonaaga kikurutira ibindi igihe umuryango wawe uri ukiriho nk' umwana ? ||| can you tell me about ... when you look back in your family life , what were the things that were important to you as a child ?
ikintu kiri icya mbere kuri jyewe ni ... kiri ... icy' ingenzi ni ukuba nri kumwe n' umuryango wanjye , ||| the most important thing to me ... something that was special for me was being with my family .
numvaaga nkomeye . numvaaga n' inkuba itamanuka ngo inkubitae , nta kinri . ||| i felt very strong , i felt like even the thunder could not harm me , being with my family made me feel very safe .
kuba nri mu muryango wanjye byampaga morale , ||| being with my family gave me "@ moral @"@ .
bikabampa kaumva ko nta kibazo numvaaga nkomeye cyane . ||| it made me feel like there was no problem . i felt very strong .
nbwira kuri nyogokuru wawe . ||| tell me about your grandmother .

ibyabaye kuri nyogokuru wanjye ni ... ni uko muri 1987 baje kumwica . ||| what happened to my grandmother was ... she was killed in 1987 .
hari mu ijoro ry' umwaka mushya wa 1988 ... bishyiraaga 1988 . hanyuma baramwica . ||| it was on the eve of 1988 so they came and killed her .
yicwa ... yicwa urupfu rubi cyane . ||| she died a painful death .
nibyo bimubayeho . ||| that is what happened to her .
icyo kihae nri nfite imyaka irindwi . ||| i was seven years old then .
ushobora kunbwira gato kusa nko mu nteruro imwe , ukuntu nyogokuru wawe yishwe ? ||| can you maybe just tell me in one sentence how your grandmother was killed ?

bamwicishije inyundo mu mutawe , yahise apfa . ||| she was hit with a hammer in the head and she immediately died .
hanyuma bamukurura bamujyana hanze kumuta , ||| then they pulled her out of the house going to throw her body .
ariko bamuta ahantu h' umukingo , ahantu njyaaga nkunda kukinair ku manywa . ||| but , they dumped her somewhere i used to play during day time .
wunva umeze kutae iyo wibutse nyogokuru wawe ? ||| what are your feeling about your grandmother when you remember her ? not what incident , but when you remember her as a person
eeh ... ! numva ... nrababarara cyane , cyane ko bamwishe mu kihae turi tuendaaga kujya kutura i bugande . ||| eeh ... i feel so hurt whenever i remember that they killed her at a time when we were planning to shift and go to live in uganda .
numva ko iyo ataza kupfa wenda ntari kubona jenoside turi kuba tuibereye hanze . ||| i always feel like if she had n't died , i would n't have seen the genocide and everything else that followed . we would have been outside [ the country ] .
iyo ... iyo muibutsae numva ko kumwica kwe byampaye ingaruka nyinshi mu buzima bwanjye . ||| her death had many consequences on my life [ in the long run ] .
ushobora kunbwira mama wawe we uko byamugendekeye muri jenoside ? ||| can you just tell me ... tell me what ... maybe what ... tell me what happened to your mother ?

hamwe n' abandi bantu benshi bo muri quartier [ akacae turi tutuyemo ] bagiye kubata muri nyabarongo . ariko babatayemo bamaze kubatemagura amatako , ||| they threw them in the river nyabarongo after they had hacked them into pieces and cut down their thighs .
n' icyo nzi kimubayeho cyo nba nramenye . ||| that is what i know that happened to her .
mwari muri kumwe se ? ||| were you with her ?
ntabwo nri kumwe nawe kuko nri ndi mu kiruhuko cya ... cya pasika , ||| i was not with her . it was during easter holidays .
intambara rero yabaye ntari kumwe nawe . ||| the war started while we were n't together .
none se umenye utae ibyabaye kuri mama wawe ? ||| how do you know what happened to your mother ?
eeh , ku itariki cumi na ... cumi n' eshanu [ 15 /04 /1994 ] nibwo nzamutse ngiye ... nrimo ngenda mu muhanda w' i nyamirambo mu isoko ; ||| on the 15th , as i was walking around the nyamirambo market when i met a man who told me how she died .
nibwo nje kuhura n' umuntu uri uvuye muri quartier y' iwacu . ||| he was from our home .
hanyuma niwe uvuze ... unbwiye ukuntu baishe mama , ariko na nyuma y' intambara nabwo nje kumenya ko biri ukuri , kandi ata ... yavugaaga iby' ukuri . ||| later on , after the war , it was confirmed to me that what he told me was the truth .
uba uzi umuntu wishe mama wawe ? ||| do you know who killed your mother ?
mu kubiumva numva uwamwishe yishwe na groupe [ agatsiko ] nyinshi y' interahamwe , baje ari mu ki groupe [ igitero ] kinini , ||| from what i was told , they came in a big group of interahamwe but the man who killed her was called rwakatsi .
ariko umugabo wamwishe ... ushakaaga ko apfa cyane n' umugabo witwa rukasa turi tuturanye . ||| he was our neighbour .
uwo mugabo se uri umuzi ? ||| did you know that man ?
yee , nri muzi ... turi tuturanye . ||| yes , i knew him ... we were neighbours .
yari umuntu umeze atae ? ||| can you say it in one or two sentences ?
bakoze ibintu byinshi , ||| they did so many things .
bakoze ... baishe abantu mu ... mu buryo butandukanye . hari abo bicaaga uwo mwanya hari abo bicaaga ... nk' abagore bamaze kubafata ku ngufu , bakababamba ku biti ... uko bitangiye nnjyae nbona ... bitangiye kera . ||| they killed many people , in many ways @: some were immediately killed ; some women were raped before they killed them , and some were crucified on trees .
bitangiye muri za 1990 biza bizana muri 1994 aribwo bibaye byinshi cyane , ||| it started way before , in 1990 and the killing increased in 1994 .
ariko nko muri 1990 baishe ... batangiye kuigishwa kuica , kuko ahari bateguraaga jenoside . ||| in 1990 they were already teaching them how to kill , as they were preparing the genocide .
hanyuma ukuntu interahamwe zaje kuica ntawe ubwacu nta ... ni ibintu ... iyo tubimenya tuba turahunze wenda mbere . ||| if we had known that the interahamwes were going to kill that way , we would have fled before , we never thought it would reach that extent .
ariko tuumvaaga ko bitazaba muri kariya kageni . bibaye ibintu bibi , baishe abantu mu buryo bwinshi butandukanye . ||| people were murdered in many different ways .
ushobora kunsobanurair imyitwarire ... uko babaga [ abicanyi ] bitwaye ? ||| can you just describe for me their attitude when they were doing it ?
biri bitandukanye ukuntu babaga bameze , hari abazaaga bakuica baseka , baumva ko ibyo bakora aribyo ; baumva ko ibyo bakora ari ukukorera i gihugu . ||| they had various attitudes as they were doing it , some were laughing , they were very proud of themselves as they thought they were working for the country , others had an expression of anger in the eyes .
hari n' abazaaga bafite uburakari mu maso , uretse ko akenshi na kenshi ntabwo ubaga witayeho kureba ... attitude [ imyitwarire ] yabo . bibaga ari ... bakugeraagaho wunva upfuye . ||| however , in most of cases , nobody was paying attention to their attitude as by the time they would reach you , it would feel as though you were already dead .
wunva ugiye , kuko wunvaaga bakugezeho nta buzima uri ufite . ||| you would feel like you had no life left inside of you .
bazaaga rero uko bashaka ; bazaaga mu buryo bashabatse . ||| so they were coming in whatever ways they wanted to .
imbaraga zari izabo . ||| they had the power .
ushobora kaongera kunsubirair muri ya nkuru wigeze kunbwira y' umubyeyi n' umwana we w' umukobwa wigeze kubona ... ||| can you descride for me that story you told me before where you saw a woman and her daughter being raped ?
mu by' ukuri ntabwo nbabonye ariko nrabaumvise . ||| i did not actually see them but i heard them .
ahantu nri nihishe hari haruguru y' aho baba ... barimo babakoreraaga ibya nfura mbi hepfo yanjye , ||| they were raping them some where down the place where i was hiding .
yari umukobwa na nyina bombi . ||| it was a daughter and her mother .
umukobwa w' imyaka nka cumi n' itandatu [ 16 ] cyangwa cumi n' ine [ 14 ] . ||| the daughter was about fourteen or sixteen years old .
hari hariya i nyamirambo yari groupe [ igitero ] nyinshi y' interahamwe . ||| it was a big group of interahamwe in nyamirambo .
ariko icyo kihae ngerageje kuishyira imyenda mu kanwa , ngo nnjyae ntaza kutaka bakanbona . ||| i put some clothes in my mouth to stop myself from screaming so they do not find me . that 's all .
ni ibyo numva ... ntabwo nbabonye buri mu ijoro , hari nko mu ma saa munani y' ijoro . ||| i did not see them ; it was dark , at around two o'clock in the morning .
ushobora kugerageza kusobanura uko ubiumvise ? aho uri uri icyo kihae , n' uko umenye ibyariho bikorwa n' abo bicanyi ? ||| could you just describe that scene for me , because ... it is quite a difficult scene ? where were you at that time and how did you know what was happening ? could you just describe that for me ?
nri nvuye ku mumena , hari mu ma saha ya nijoro , ||| i was coming from mumena ; it was at night .
hanyuma manuka nshaka kujya mu nyakabanda . ||| i was going down to nyakabanda .
ngenda ngwira intumbi zari zimaze kuicwa muri ako kanya . hanyuma ukuntu nbimenye n' ukuntu nbiumvaishije , ||| i kept bumping into dead bodies of people who had just been murdered .
ni uko aho nri nihishe n' aho bari bari hepfo , ushoboraaga kaumva ibyo babakoreraaga n' ibyo bavugaaga . ||| i knew what was happening because from where i was , you could tell what was being said and what was being done to them .
kuko bavugaaga ko bagiye ku ... kubasambanya kandi nta ... nta n' ikiguzi babahaye nta n' inka babakoye ; ||| i knew they were going to rape them with nothing else in exchange . i t was not as though they had paid any cows as a dowry for them .
mbega wunva ibyo babakoraaga ntinzi ukuntu nbikusobanurair kuko ... kaereka umuntu nyawe ... wenyine ahaibereye . ||| i can not describe it to you , unless you had been there yourself .
ukuntu biri bimeze ... ni ... ahubwo numvaaga uburibwae kubarusha . numvaaga ari jyewe urimo ubabara kurusha uko numvaaga urusaku rwaru ... uko uwo mukobwa yasakuzaaga . ||| i felt the pain probably more than they did ; it was as though it was being done to me .
n' ejo bunri nramubonye mu mafoto bamaze kubona ejo bunri , ||| i even saw her picture recently .
yari afite impanga ye . ||| she had a twin sister .
ukuntu ba ... mbega nramubonye mpita nbiibuka ariko nta muntu nbashije kubibwira , kuko numvaaga nta ubiumva nk' uko jyae nbiumvise . ||| i saw it and i was reminded of what happened but i did not talk to anyone about it as i felt like no one was going to feel it the way i did .
ni ibintu ... numvaaga uburibwae kusa kumurenza . ||| it was ... i felt the pain probably more than them .
ushobora kunbwira ingorane zikomeye uhuye nazo , cyangwa ikintu ubona cyagukomereye kuruta ibindi muri jenoside ? ||| can you describe to me what was perharps ... the most difficult experience of being on your own during the genocide trying to survive ?
nvuga ngo bose ntabwo bari babi , ariko abenshi bari babi . ||| i would n't say that everybody was evil but the majority of the people were . if only few were wicked , it would not have reached such an extent .
kuko iba ari bake bari babi ntabwo biri kugera kuri uriya mwanya .... kuri kiriya kigero . iba ... nvuga ngo 5 % bari beza . abandi 5 % ntabwo bari bafite icyo bari ... bari hagati bifashe . hanyuma 90 % yari isigaye bose bari babi . ||| i would say that 5 % were good , the other 5 % was neutral and the 90 % remaining was evil .
nk' umuntu akubajije ibyabaye muri iki gihugu ngo ubimubwirae mu magambo make ubisobanura utae ? ||| how would you describe the ... if you had one sentence to say what happened in this country , how would you describe it ?
nko mu kihae wendaga kurokoka ubiumvaaga utae ? ||| was it evil and hatred ? was it madness ? what happened ? as you were trying to survive , what was going on in your mind about what was happening in this country ?
ntinbitekereje mu ntiambara , ariko ubu nibwo nbitekereje . ||| i did not think about it then but when i reflect on it today .
kuko iyo ngerageje kuibuka ibyabaye muri 1994 , igice nbishyiramo nvuga nk' aho u rwanda ruri rwimutse rugiye mu kuzimu . cyangwa rugiye mu yinri planet [ umubumbae ] ntazi . ||| i would describe what happened in 1994 as though rwanda had gone down to hell or moved to a different planet .
ahantu ruri rucecetse nta muntu wa ... mbega ntinzi ukuntu nbikuereka . ||| rwanda was silent . i do n't know how to describe it .
reba kusa abantu abaicwa umunsi n' ijoro . umunota ku wunri . ||| imagine people being killed day and night , minute after minute .
hanyuma nta muntu uvuga , nta muntu ugira iki ... mbega igihugu kiri kicecetse kirimo kikora amabi , ||| no one intervened or did anything ! the whole country was silent and was busy doing something so wrong !
wunvaaga ko tuimutse tugiye ahandi hantu kuko n' isi ntiyari ituzi . ||| it was as though we had moved to a different planet . even the entire world was silent as though nobody knew us .
n' isi yabaye nk' aho ntabwo ituzi . biri bi ... wagirango u rwanda ruraimutse , rujya ahandi hantu aho ntawunri muntu uri uruzi . ||| it was as if rwanda had been erased from the earth .
kuko ibintu bibaye birenze ukuemera ... ntinzi niba nvuga ngo birenze ukuemera . ||| the things that happened are difficult to believe if i can say , they go beyond what we can humanly comprehend .
birenze icyo umuntu yatekereza . ||| it goes beyond what one can imagine .
nbwira kuri yahaya . ||| tell me about yahaya .
yahaya ni ... nvuga ko ari umuntu mwiza kuko ibyo yakoze ntabwo ari abantu benshi babikoze . ||| yahaya is ... i would say that he is a good person because few people did what he did .
yahishe abantu bagera kuri mirongo itatu [ 30 ] barenze . ||| he hid over 30 people .
kandi ikindi nnjyae yarankijije umunsi wo nri ngiye kupfa ... kuko uriya munsi wo nrawuzi nri nzi ko bagiye kunyica . ||| he saved me ; i am sure that interahamwe was going to kill me .
kuko uriya mugabo yaragiye kunyi ... iriya nterahamwe yari igiye kunyica . ariko yahaya nirukanse mpungiye iwe , ||| when i run to yahaya 's house while fleeing , he welcomed me into his house and stand by my side .
ntabwo yanyirukanye ahubwo yaranretse ... yanrekeye iwe , ahagarara ku ruhande rwanjye . ntabwo ari benshi bahagaze ku ruhande rwanjye rero . ||| and i did n't have many people sided with me then .
niyo mpamvu nbona ko ari umuga ... ari umuntu mwiza . kandi ari ni umukiranutsi kuko ijambo yankirishije ntabwo ari ijambo ryo kaumva ko yari umuhutu , ||| that 's why i think he was a good man , a righteous man . he did it not even so much because he is a hutu .
ahubwo yavuze ati ... yanbwiye iriya nterahamwe ngo @: "@ amaraso umena , wameneye hano ejo , n' ayo ushaka kumena uyu munsi imaan izayakubaze , ||| he told that interahamwe that he will answer to god the blood he had shed there the previous day and mine as well .
ariko ntabwo wica uyu mukobwa . @" bivuga ngo ntabwo yitwaje ubuhutu , ahubwo yitwaje ko ibyo yakoraaga yakoreraaga imaan . numva rero ari umukiranutsi . ||| so he did n't even do it in the name of being a hutu but he did it for god . i think he was a righteous man .
nbwira noneho kubijyanye no kurokoka jenoside [ kucika ku icumu ] , kaumva urokotse ubiakiriye utae ? ||| tell me about surviving ; what was it like to get through the genocide and find that you 've finally survived ?
nyuma ya jenoside , bisaga nk' aho nanone usigaye mu muriro . ||| after the genocide , it still felt like hell .
kuko ibintu byose biri hirya yari imirambo , yari intumbi nta muntu muzima uri usigaraanye . ucaaga iruhande rwawe ukabona umuntu ... aho yaguye , ||| there were dead bodies all over the place , everywhere you passed , you 'd see corpses .
ukabona undi yari amagufa ... nraibuka njyewe ngenda nbona umwana yonka ... yonka nyina yarapfuye . ariko nmurebye ntinigeze ngira ikintu nkora , kuko numvaaga nnjyae ubwanjye ntakaye . ntinigeze nfata uwo mwana ngo mwigizeyo , ||| i remember seeing a baby that was breastfeeding on its mother 's dead body and i did nothing to stop the child , as i myself felt so confused .
ahubwo nramurebye kusa nraigendera . mu mutawe numvaaga ndi ... numvaaga nta kintu kirimo . no mu buengae numvaaga nta kintu kirimo , ntago nkoze ibintu by' abazima . ||| i did n't know what was going on .
kusigara rero nyuma y' icyo kihae wunvaaga ari nk' uko umuntu yatwika ishyamba ryoseee ... hanyuma akakureka ukagenda mu bushyae . ||| surviving that time felt like walking through some bush after it has been burnt .
kuko biri nko kugenda uri igicucu , cyangwa uri nk' ikintu kitazi n' ikintu na kimwe . ||| i felt stupid , as though i did n't know anything .
rangiza interuro yanyuma kubyo utubwiraaga . ||| would you finish the last sentence ?
nyuma ya jenoside ngiye ... tubaye icyumweru muri ste andre [ ishuri ryisumbuye riri i nyamirambo ] , ||| we lived in saint @-@ andre [ secondary school in nyamirambo , kigali ] for about one week .
ariko ku itariki esheshatu ... cyangwa eshanu ... oya esheshatu . nibwo ngiye kureba mama wanjye . ||| i went to see my mother on the 5th no on the 6th .
ngezeyo nsanga ibintu byose ... ngirango ikintu kifite ubuzima cyose nta kiri kihari . ||| when i got there was n't a single living .
n' inyoni zari zicecetse , ||| even the birds were silent .
n' imbeba nta zikibaho , ||| there were no mice around .
mbega wunvaaga ibintu byose bicecetse . ahubwo icyo ubonaaga n' ukubona ubusimba buva mu rutoki bwirukanka ... biri birenze . ||| in a word everything was silent and you could only see insects flying over the corpses .
ikindi ni uko nhise mpura n' umudamu turi tuturanye , yari yambaye ijipo ya mama wanjye , n' ishati ya mama wanjye . ||| the other thing i recall is meeting a lady who used to be our neighbour ; she was wearing my mother 's clothes .
hanyuma nragaruka inaha , ngeze inaha nibwo ngiye kubaan na famille [ umuryango ] imwe y' abantu bari bavuye hanze muri iyo minsi . ||| i came back here to kigali and when i got here i stayed with a certain family that had just come back from exile .
abantu ntari nzi , kuba mu bantu utari umenyereye , ururimi utazi , rimwe na rimwe baganira ururimi bakuraanye , ||| staying with people i did n't know , who were even sometimes speaking a foreign language , was also very hard .
biri bingoye cyane kugirango nbanae nabo . kandi ikindi nanone kubaan nabo , babaga batakuizeye bihagije . ||| the other thing that was so difficult is that they did n't totally trust me .
bavugaaga ko uwapfuye ariwe ... umututsi ni uwapfuye . ||| as a survivor i could have been with the interahamwe because to them all the tutsis had died .
uwasigaye ubwo yari kumwe n' interahamwe . ibyo nabyo bibayeho nk' ibintu bibabaza cyane kurusha noneho no kaumva ko usigaye . kuko abo usigaraanye nabo ntabwo baumvaaga ko usigaye . ||| that was also very hard ; it was even harder than being a survivor because those you stayed with did not believe that you were a survivor .
muri wowe inberae wiyumvaga utae ? ||| what was the feeling inside ?
nvuga ngo ... uko niumvaaga mo inberae ntabwo ... ntabwo biri ... nraumva ntakuha ikigeraranyo cy' uko numvaaga . ||| i do n't know what i can compare it to . i can not really express how i felt . there 's nothing i can compare it to .
ahubwo ugeraho kusa ukaumva ubaye ... nta kintu uri cyo . ugeraho ukabaho gutyo uko ubayeho kusa . ||| you reach a point where you feel like you 're nothing , you 're just there and days pass but you 're indifferent to everything .
ukabona umunsi urira , ukabona undi uraje , ukabaho mu buzima buraho utamenyereye ... ikindi wunva ko ntacyo ubwiye undi , ||| you 're living a life you 're not used to .
nta kintu umaze muri make . ||| in short you feel so useless .
kuko nraibuka ko umunsi umwe nigeze kuvuga ngo @: iyo nba nrapfuye kuko abapfuye ubungubu baracecetse . bameze neza . ||| i remember one day even saying that i should have died , as the dead at least were silent , they were fine .
numvaaga ko hapfuye abantu benshi ! nkaumva ... nkavuga rero kubaho mu buzima butafite ikintu butafite igisobanuro , birutaw n' uko nba nrapfuye . ||| my thinking was that living a non @-@ sense life was worse than being dead .
njyae rero ntabwo nigeze ... ngira ibindi byiyumviro . ||| my perspective of life was different .
nri nfite ibyiyumviro byo kaumva ko kubaho birutaw no kupfa . ||| my opinion then was that living was worse than dying .
wunva ushobora kubabarira abantu bakoze biriya bintu ? ||| can you forgive people who carried this out ?
umh ! ||| umh !
[ araseka ] icyo ni ikibazo kikomeye kuko ... ntabwo ... kubabarira ni iby' imaan kusa . ntabwo njyewe nbabarira nk' umuntu . ||| [ she smiles ] that 's a tough question . i can not forgive . forgiveness is from god .
ndi umuntu ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ndi ... ntabwo ndi umwuka . ||| i am only human ; i am not some sort of air .
ububabare bwose nshobora kuhura nabwo mu buzima bwanjye , ntabwo bumpa umwanya wo kubabarira . ||| all the pain i encounter in life does not leave room for forgiveness .
ubuzima umuntu abamo muri iyi minsi ubona ibiiza bikakuibutsa ibyabaye , ||| the life we live in today ... you see the good and that reminds you of what happened .
ubona ibibi bikakuibutsa ibyabaye , mbega n' iyo ubonye inzu nini cyangwa ubonye amafaranga menshi , wunva ntawe uribuyahe . wunva ntawe uri busangirae nawe , ||| you see the bad and it also reminds you of what happened . even when you get a big house or a lot of money , you have no one to give it to or to share it with .
ubona inzu nini ukabona ibaye ... nta kintu kirimo kuko nta muryango uri buze kukusuramo ... usanga rero no kuvuga ngo @: ||| you get a big house but it is empty because no family will come and visit you .
‘ kubabarira ... ’ wenda ubabarira kuko nta kinri ukora . ||| so when you think of forgiveness ... maybe you can forgive because there 's nothing else you can do .
kandi utababariye se ? kuko abantu baishe mu ntiambara ni 90 % . ubwo rero upfa . urinda wicwa n' umutima ... urwara umutima . ||| and if you do not forgive ... the killers were about 90 % ... it would kill you . you would get a heart attack and die .
ugerageza kurenzaho kusa . ||| you just look at it and leave it .
uba uzi abantu baishe umuryango wawe ? cyangwa se nibura ujya uhura n' abantu bagize uruhare mu kuica umuryango wawe ? ||| have you ever met any of the perpetrators who you recognised and know ... or having met anybody who was directly involved in killing members of your family ? if you have n't how would you handle it if it happened ?
abaishe umuryango wanjye bo kubera ntari mpari ntabwo nbazi . ||| i do not know the people who killed my family because i was not there .
bivuga ko mpura nabo ntanabazi . ||| i probably meet them without knowing they are the ones .
ariko umugabo wishe ... mu bantu baishe mama wanjye , bari aho kusa bose . iyo ubaciyemo nta kinri ... ubagurair inzoga , cyangwa ukabashakira ikindi kintu . ||| but the man who was in the group pf the people who killed my mother is there . when you meet them you just buy them a drink or something .
hanyuma umuntu nhuye nawe wishe abantu nhuye nawe kuri gare hano hirya mu mugi . aho kugirango agirae ikibazo , nijyae uhise ngira ikibazo . ||| there was a time i met a killer at the taxi park in town and instead of him being the one to have a problem , it is me who had one .
umutima uransimbutse nhise ngira ubwoba kusa ... nicara hasi kuko nri ntangiye kaumva isereri . ||| i felt so shocked , my heart stopped beating . i sat down , as i felt dizzy .
ntabwo rero ... uhura ... ubwo rero ntabwo nkubwira ngo ngiye kutekereza kubabarira , cyangwa ubugome , ||| i can not tell you that i thought of forgiving them or even of taking revenge .
ahubwo ngize ubwoba . ||| i was terrified .
numvise umubiri uzanye ubushayi nta kinri . ntabwo nkubwira ngo numvise nbabariye cyangwa ... kuko iyo uhuye nabo uta ubwenge . nta kinri utekereza . ||| i had goose pimples . i can not tell you that i forgave them or anything else , when you meet them you almost loose your mind , you can not think straight !
ubona ubutabera bukora akazi kabwo neza ? cyangwa ubona hariho kurenganuraw nabwo ? ||| has justice been done ?
icyo kibazo kiragoye kuko ... numva ... aho kugirango biitwae ubutabera , bitari ubutabera , ni byiza ko babareka noneho bakigira hanze kusa . ||| it is tough question because i feel like instead of it being called justice when it is not justice anyway , it would be better that they just let them go free .
kuko ntinkuifuza ko babaroha mu ruzi nk' uko baroshye mama mu ruzi . ||| that 's all i can wish them . because i would not wish them to be thrown into the river the way they threw my mother into the river .
mama bamuroshye mu ruzi , baroha data wacu , baroha sogokuru , baroha abantu benshi bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] yanjye . ||| my mother was drowned into the river together with my uncle , my grandfather and many other members of my family .
uroshye umuntu umwe rero , ntacyo bimaze . ||| therefore throwing just one person in there is useless .
kandi ikindi , leta iragaburira izi nfungwa . iraita ku nrwara zabo kandi ni benshi . ||| the other thing is that the government takes care of the prisoners ; it has to feed them and provide healthcare for them and they are many .
ibiiza rero ni uko babareka bakaza bakajya hanze , kusa bakajya babaha inyigisho wenda mu kwezi , cyangwa mu mezi angahe ... zibakarura mu bumuntu kuko ibyo bakoze nabo bari batakaye . ||| it would therefore be better to let them free and maybe to sensitise them every month or so to help them become human again as they had probably lost their humanity .
kuko uuturanyi mwahanaga inka , mwasangira inzoga , ||| how can you kill the neighbour you used to exchange cows with and share a drink with ?
mwasangira iki ... nabyo si ubuzima . ||| it 's not normal .
ni ibintu wunva ko nk' uko nkubwiye u rwanda ruri rwatakaye . ruri rwatakaye ahantu , kuko nta n' undi muntu warwumvaga . ||| it shows that rwanda was lost as i was telling you , because no one heard its voice then .
ruri ruri ahantu nta n' undi muntu yarebaaga . ||| we were somewhere where no one could see us .
nraumva rero ikintu nvuga ubucamanza , ubutabera kaereka ... nabyo ntibyampaza kubona wishe uwo muntu . nta n' icyo bimarair . ariko nanone nabyo ntibinshimaish , ||| what i can say about justice ... unless .... even that would not be enough , even if they killed them ... but it does not sound fair to me when it is called justice .
kaumva biiswe ubutabera , atari ubutabera . kaumva ko umuntu yishe ejo bunri yakoze iki ngo arakuze . mbega ntiiishe abakuze nkawe ? ||| knowing that somebody killed other people the other day and they say he 's an adult !
ko se bo bicaaga abakuze ? ||| were the people they killed not adults ?
kaumva ngo umuntu yari umwana . ||| or saying that they were children !
mbega umwana arica ? umwana ntiiica . ||| do children kill ? they do not !
kuki batabaye abana mbere y' uko bica ? ||| why were they not children while killing ?
aho rero bivuga ngo ... babavanaemo ahubwo bigirae inzira . baze tuturanae . ||| let them free them , which is what will make more sense to me . let them come and live with us .
ubona jenoside ishobora kaongera kuba mu rwanda ? ||| can genocide happen in rwanda again ?
ntabwo nbiemera ... ntabwo izabaho . kuko nkanjyae nta mutaima wo kuica nfite . niba abo bantu bazaza bafunguwe bakaigishwa , hakabaho kuibuka ibyabaye , ||| i do n't think so , it can not happen again .
hakabaho aho abantu bazajya bajya bakavuga bati @: "@ ibi bintu birabaye . @" n' umwana akajyayo akavuga ati @: ||| because personally i do n't have a desire to kill in my heart .
"@ ibi bintu birabaye . bibaye ni bibi . @" ntabwo numva ko jenoside izabaho . ntabwo izaongera kubaho . ||| if the people who are being released today are going to be sensitised and if remembering what happened will be part of our lives , if there will always be a place where anyone even children themselves can go and acknowledge that it actually happened , and that it was wrong then i do n't believe the genocide will happen again !
ugerageza kunbwira ingaruka ubona zo kurokoka jenoside ? ||| what do you think about the future ? ... can you describe for me about the consequences of being a survivor ?
ingaruka zo ... zo kurokoka ni nyinshi cyane . ||| the consequences of being a survivor are very many .
kuko iyo nrebye nk' abarokotse ... nkatawe turokotse intambara ... jenoside hari abarokotse batarokotse . ||| when i look at us the survivor of the genocide , some of us survived without really surviving .
hari abarokotse bafite sida , abagore bafashwae ku ngufu ; hari abarokotse kurokoka utakigira umuntu muvugana ; narwo n' urundi rupfu . ||| some women who were raped are living with hiv @/@ aids , some survived but they have no one to talk to , that is another type of death , those are some of the genocide consequences .
izo ni ingaruka . ikindi ntabwo ubaho mu buzima bwuzuye . uba mu buzima bw' igice . uba mu buzima bw' ibitangaza ; ||| the other thing is that you can never live a full life again , you live half of a life , and you live a life full of questions , of uncertainties , of maybes .
uba mu buzima butekereza ‘ surprise ’ [ ikintu kitunguraanye ] ... butekereza ko ... wenda ... wenda ... cyangwa se ... uhora muri wenda ... se ... uhora wunva wenda ... bishobora ukaongeraho , uhora wunva utafite umutima uri hamwe . ||| maybe it is going to happen again , you 're never at peace within your heart .
kurokoka rero niko ... ibyo nibyo baita ihahamuka ahubwo . ||| that 's what they call trauma .
uhora wunva uhahamutse buri kihae , ||| you constantly are traumatized .
ntabwo ugira ubuzima bwuzuye . ||| your life is incomplete .
uragenda ... ... nk' urugero njyewe , hari igihe ... iyo nreba abantu benshi ... iyo ndi nko mu mugi , nkareba abantu ikivunge cy' abantu . hari igihe nbabona baryamye ari intumbi . ||| for example sometimes i can be walking in town and i look at crowds of people and i see their bodies lying down , as though they were dead .
nkashaka kureba umuntu , nkashaka kumureba apfuye ; ||| i look at somebody and i imagine him or her dead .
nnjyae ubwanjye hari igihe njya nitekereza mfuye . ||| even me myself i sometimes imagine myself dead .
ibyo ntabwo ari ukubera ko ntekereza urupfu , nracyari mutoya . ahubwo ni ukubera intumbi nbonye , n' abantu nbonye baicwa . ||| not so much because i think of death , i am still young , but because of the many people i saw being killed .
ibyo rero nizo ngaruka zo kurokoka . ||| those are the consequences of surviving .
ntabwo ureba umuntu ngo umubonaemo ubuzima , ureba umuntu ukamubonamo apfuye . ||| you do not look at people and see life in them , you see them dead instead .
ubona jenoside yari ikwaiye kuibukaw itae ? ||| how do you want genocide to be remembered ? what is the right way to remember genocide ?
ukuntu bari bakwaiye kuibuka jenoside , ||| the way genocide should remember ?
bari bakwaiye kuibuka jenoside buri mwaka . ariko na none turi tukwaiye kuibuka tufasha abacitse ku icumu . ||| i think we should not only remember the genocide every year but also in helping out the survivors .
turi tukwaiye kuibuka ... kuko kujya kuibuka ibyabaye ku bacitse ku icumu , nta nicyo bibamaraiye turi tukwaiye kuibuka jenoside buri mwaka , ||| because remembering what happened only once year does n't really benefit the survivors much .
buri munsi , kuko abacitse ku icumu bo bayibuka buri munsi ntabwo ibaho buri mwaka kuri bo . ||| we should remember it every year , everyday because they do remember it every day , not just once a year .
ariko mu rwego rw' isi yose turi tukwaiye kuibuka jenoside tufasha ababaye muri iyo jenoside abacitse ku icumu . tubaibuka , tuigisha abana batoya , nruzi ko twebwe turaangiritse , ||| on an international scale , we should remember the genocide in helping out those who lived through the genocide , the survivors .
turapfuye . kaereka nyine abo bana batoya , bakahora bayibuka , n' urubyaro rwacu rukazibuka jenoside . ||| we could remember them in teaching the children about it because as far as we 're concerned , we 've already been destroyed .
urw' umuhutu , urw' umututsi , urw' umutaw rukaumva ko jenoside yabayeho . ||| we need to teach the next generation about the genocide , the descendants of the hutu , the descendants of the tutsi , the descendants of the twa , all need to remember that the genocide actually happened .
abaumva amakosa ya ba se bakayumva , abaumva akarengaane ka ba sekuruza bakakaumva ; ||| it needs to reach a point where those who need to understand where their fathers are faulty understand it , as well as those who need to understand the way their parents were victimized .
mbega tukabaho mu kihae cyo buri mwana n' uzavuka mu myaka ingahe azajya avuga ati @: "@ iki kintu kibaye mu gihugu kiri kibi . @" ||| in conclusion we need to make sure that even the child who will be born tomorrow will know that what happened in our country was wrong .
ubona hari isomo jenoside yatusigaiye , cyangwa ubona hari icyo jenoside ituigisha ? ||| do we learn anything from the genocide ?
njyewe numva beatha w' uyu munsi na ... ntabwo nfite ubwoba , ||| i feel like beatha today is ... i am not afraid ; i am not worried .
ntabwo nfite impagarara ... kuko aho bigeze ntabwo nshaka ko jenoside izasubiraho . rero ntingira ubwoba kuko ndi mu bantu bashaka ... bavuga ngo @: "@ ntabwo jenoside izaongera kubaho . ||| because where i am at today , i do not wish for genocide to happen again . so i am not worried because i am one of the people who say that the genocide should never happen again .
ikindi numva kusa ... ... nfite kuizera kw' akazaza . kubera ko umwana wanjye wanjye uzavuka , n' umwuzukuru wanjye , ||| the other thing is i have faith in a better future .
numva ko bazaba mu isi nziza . uretse njyewe umaze kuangirika . ||| i believe my children and my grandchildren after them will have a good life apart form me who has already been destroyed .
ariko numva ko abandi bo bazaba bazima . uretse ko umwana wanjye azagira ingaruka za jenoside . ariko umwana we ntabwo azazigira . ||| my children will still suffer the consequences of the genocide but their children in the following generation will n't .
ikinyejana [ urubyaro ] cya gatatu ... ntabwo kizabona jenoside nk' icya kabiri . ||| the third generation will not live out the consequences of the genocide .

nrarahira umugabo arangije bukeye ahongaho ati wowe turakuica , ||| but that man did not believe me and he decided to put me on hold before killing me .
ntegereza urupfu nyine ko bari bunyicae ntibanyica barangije bukeye mu gitondo , ||| they did not kill me that night . in the morning i went back to the so @-@ called grandmother .
noneho nsubira kwa wa mukecuru noneho mukecuru aravuga ngo uno mwana ntanraraire ahahanga batazamutsinda mu maso . ||| she refused to receive me pretending that she did n't want me to be killed in her presence .
wa mukobwa noneho nawe aravuga ati reka tushakishae ukuntu bigenda bite ? bigenda . ||| then the girl told me we should look for other alternatives .
noneho nramubwira se wowe uranshyira hehe ko ubona papa wawe yanyirukanye avuga ko bagiye kunyica nragenda jya hehe ? ||| then i asked her where she thought i could go when her dad had chased me , where she expected me to go .
noneho wa mugabo unyambuye iwacu baitaaga kayigamba uwunri mbese uvugaaga ngo nitiraanw n' umwana we . arangije nravuga reka noneho icyo kihae za mitingi zari zatangiye i bugesair nraumva abanyabugesera bari batangiye kuhunga . ||| the man called kayigamba whose daughter was my namesake said ... by then , the attackers were having several meetings .
nragenda ahongaho bahitaaga imigina , ||| in fact , in bugesera people had started fleeing .
ahongaho mbese nri ndi , nragenda jyayo jya muri mitingi yaho , ||| i went to a place called migina .
ngezeyo urugabo rwitwaga shiriduwi niba ari shiriduwi , ruraza runkura mu muhanda aho nri nicaye nicaraanye n' uwo mukobwa . araambaza ngo wowe uri bwoko uki ? ndamubwi , ||| there came a man called shiriduwi , i am not sure if it is shiriduwi . he came , pulled me from the roadside where i was sitting with the girl and then asked me what my tribe is .
ndamwihorera nbura ikintu nvuga . ||| i kept quiet .
ubwo arangije hakaba hari umugabo baitaaga biya murumuna w' uwo nguwo uri umuganga ahongaho , ||| i had nothing to say ... there was another man called biya , who was a young brother to the doctor in that area .
yari anzi hamwe n' uwo mugabo baitaaga kayigamba bari bari mu nama . ||| they both knew me very well .
araza arampamagara aravuga ngo uno mwana yahoze mu rugo iwanjye ngo n' umwana wanjye . ||| at that time , they were in a meeting and when they came out , they defended me . they said i am from their family .
ubwo arangije nragira , ||| that 's the way i survived the attackers .
ubwo mbese nkira gutyo aravuga ati ugendae ugarukae mu rugo . ugarukae mu rugo muby' ukuri jyewe nrabona ntabona ahantu nnyura . ||| he [ bayi ] told me to go home .
ubwo arangije ansigair muzehe wiwe kuko we yari afite moto arataha nnjyae nragenda jya mu rugo . ||| then i told him that i have no where to pass in order to reach home , he then asked his father to take me home because his father had a motorbike . he left for his home and i went to my home too .
turagenda , aragenda ajya murugo ngendana na muzehe . tumaze kugendana na muzehe tugenze nka nka km ahari , barangije baraza ba bagabo bankurikiye bashaka ku nyica . ||| he walked away and i also walked away with the old man . we walked for about one kilometre [ 1 km ] and then the other guys [ attackers ] followed me because they wanted to kill me .
barangije noneho baragira ... baravuga ngo murica umwana wa kayigamba mufite ibibazo . kuko icyo kihae yari akomeye yari afite n' ingufu . ||| some of them said that they would be in trouble if they touched kayigamba 's child meaning me ; because kayigamba was a strong and respected man at the time .
ubwo arangije aravuga ati @: "@ ubwo se umujyanye kwa kayigamba ? @" cyangwa umujyanye iwawe ? ||| they asked the old man ; "@ are you taking her to kayigamba 's home or to your home ? @"
aravuga ati @: "@ njyewe uyu n' umwana wa kayigamba mushyiriye kayigamba yamunsigaiye . @" ||| then he replied that "@ this is kayigamba 's child , i am taking her to kayigamba because he asked me to take her to him .
ubwo nragenda jya kwa kayigamba nongera marayo ikindi cyumweru , ||| i went to kayigamba 's home and spent another week there .
haza undi muhungu baitaaga manueli gutya araza kuhaihisha arangije ajya hepfo gutya mu masaka , ||| there came another man called emmanuel . he was seeking for a place where to hide and then he found a place around kayigamba 's house in a sorghum field .
hari igiti nkakiriya ahari kintuza cy' amapera kinini , ||| there was a big tree around , which looked like a guava tree .
noneho aragenda ajyamo uwo mugabo kayigamba aragenda amukuramo amaze kumukuramo aragenda amutsinda muri arya masaka . ||| he climbed the tree but unfortunately , kayigamba saw him and asked him to come down the tree . later he killed him from the same sorghum field .
ubwo nrangije turahunga umugabo mbese yabonaaga ko ntari umwana we , ||| we fled together .
akazajya afata isafuriya njyewe nikoreraaga isafuriya ishyushye tukagenda niyo babaga bakuye ku mashyiga . ||| but because i was not the real daughter to that man [ kayigamba ] , he would make me carry a very hot pot on my head .
jyewe nrayikoreraaga tukagenda . ||| every time , after cooking , they would ask me to carry the pot so that we continue our journey .
tugera ahantu bakanbwira ngo ningende jyae kuvoma , ||| we would walk and after some distance , they 'd ask me to go fetch water .
nrabiibuka njyewe ngarukaiye i rusatira . hariya mu bicae bya butare . ||| i remember i walked up to rusatira , those ends of butare .
kuko njyewe nbonye y' uko njyewe tutaza , mbese ko njyewe ntazabishobora , ubwo nrabiibuka kuko mu ntiambara njyayo baravugaaga ngo baryaaga n' ibigori , ||| i realised that i was n't going to cope with the situation for long because i joined their family when they used to eat maize paste everyday .
baravuga bati noneho ifu y' ibigori ni yo igira kutae ? ||| it is made out of maize flour mingled in water .
ngo niyo itubuka . ||| that is the only food that could satisfy the family .
wowe akazi alice uzajya utukorera , uzajya utusekurair ibigori kandi uzajya ubiyungurura . ||| i was put in charge of grinding maize and separating the fine flour from the big particles .
ubwo nkazajya nsekura ibigori , nza kurwara mu ntuze , mu ntoki . nje kurwara mu ntoki mbese kuturika cyane , ||| therefore , i would grind the maize until my hands got swollen .
ariko niba nnaharwaye gutyo , ntabwo binbuzaaga y' uko nitugenda ntaza kuikorera ya safuriya . ||| however , that never stopped me from carrying the pot whenever it was time to move ahead .
mbese wariwo murimo wanjye mbese tugiye . ||| it was my daily job .
ubwo turagenda tugeze i rusatira , i nkotanyi icya kora ziba ziraje , ||| when we reached rusatira , the nkotanyi came .
bagenda bica abantu mu nzira , bakampagarika , ||| however on the way , the perpetrators would kill some of the people who had fled with them . sometimes they would stop and abuse me .
pu ! ||| then i decided to stop and go back where we were coming from .
ubwo nrangije ngira kutae ? mpita decida njyewe kusubira inyuma uko bizagenda kose , nzapfae cyangwa bizagendae bite ? ko n' ubundi ntacyo nkirwanair . ||| i said to myself "@ there is no difference i may still die . even though i go keep going with these perpetrators , they may reach some where and kill me , i can not change much to my fate . @"
ubwo nrangije njyaaga jya kuvoma gutya ngiye kubona , ||| i used to fetch water .
nbona gutya ntuza uwo mugabo baitaaga abiya . araza aravuga ngo @: " ali , ngo @: ||| one day , as i was planning to go fetch water , abayi came and told me ; "@ alice , get out ! @"
sohoka . @" ntasohoka ; ||| i went out .
maze kusohoka araambaza ngo wowe ngo ntakuzi ngo uri umututsi , ||| then he said , "@ i know you very well , you are a tutsi .
ngo aho kugira ngo ugendae uturushya , ||| you will not continue to stress us out for so long .
ahubwo twagirango tubae tukuica ukava mu nzu twebwe tukagenda ukwacu . ||| i was suggesting we kill you and then we proceed our journey without you . @"
nravuga nti uyunguyu aranzi nanone ntakintu ndi busubizaeho ntaki , ||| i knew there was nothing to lie about because it was true , he knew me .
nricecekair ndamwihorera . ||| therefore , i simply kept quiet .
ubwo izi ntoki zari ziragize cyane ziratunbaye mbese zirajemo ikibyimba , maze araambaza ngo mbese ahongaho ubaye iki ? ||| but my hands were swollen and then he asked me , "@ what happened to your hands ? @"
nramubwira nti nsekuye ibigoli nrangije rero nragira hazamo ibavu riraturika none ubu ntinzi . ||| i told him that i was grinding maize grains and then developed corns in my hands , which turned to be boils and later on the boils busted .
ubwo arangije ampereza abagabo ngo bagendae bajyae kunyica . ||| then he told some men to take me and kill me .
abagabo bansiganira kunyica mbese hariya i rusatira , ||| but there was a dispute among those men because they could n't decide who would kill me .
barangije baravuga ngo uno mwana ntabwo tumwica mbese n' uzabaho . ||| that was in rusatira .
ubwo umwe aravuga ngo sha ngo ngaho igenderae . ||| one of them told me to go after that .
nongera nisubirair inyuma nraigendera , ||| i left them and went back .
sice mu muhanda njyewe nkazajya genda nkicira mu bihuru nkaigendera , ||| i would avoid using the main road and would go through the bushes instead .
nyuma rero ntinzi ukuntu nhuye n' abantu bavuga ngo mbese ni inkotanyi bagenda batoragura utwana nk' uko nguko nnjyae bantoraguramo , ||| as i was walking i met some people whom were said to be the inkotanyi . they were collecting children and that is how they got me too .
batujyana i butare . ||| then we were taken to butare .
tubaye ahongahooo , igihe kiragera noneho alisa nkazajya nibaza , ubusae ko ndi hano , nkaba nbona nta mwene wacu nrikubona , ||| we lived there until when i started thinking "@ well , i am here but how come none of my family members is here ?
n' ukuvuga ko nta numawe uriho wenda ngo azanshakishae cyangwa ngo azagirae kutae ? ||| does this mean no one survived to come and get me out of here ? @"
ntahabaye , ntahabaye , nrangije ngira kutae ? nyuma nza kuvamo mbese nbona ... barumuna banjye bo kwa data wacu bari hanze , ||| i lived there for some time and then ... later i saw my cousins .
mbese nrangije nravuga aho kugira bandagare reka tugirae kutae nnjyae nrabona hano ari nta kintu hamaraiye , ||| they were younger than i was and they were on their own . therefore , since there was no good life where i was living and yet at the same time my cousins were getting spoiled on the roads , i decided to leave the place and join them .
reka njyewe nvaemo nijyewe mukuru gendae nbasangae . ubwo nrangije mu by' ukuri ubuzima buratugora , ||| i was the oldest , life became very hard on us .
tujya hanze mbese jya hanze arijyewe mukuru ari njyae en charge ya famille . ||| i started that life of being in charge of the whole family since i was the oldest .
nkazajya nreba mbese ubwo ngeze ku buzima iby' intambara birangiye . ||| "@ i am now talking about life after the war . @"
ubwo tujya ku mugabo baita papa alisa , ||| we went to a certain man called papa alisa .
turangije turamubwira tuti rero twebwe i wacu urahareba , ||| we told him , " as you can see how our home was destroyed .
nta nzu ihari ntaki ahubwo twebwe utucumbikiye ukatuihera akazu tugira kutae tukiberamo njyewe na barumuna banjye dore nitwebwe tusigaye twenyine , ||| there is no house left . if you did us a favour and got us a shelter , it would be very meaningful to us . we are the only ones who survived , we will never burden you as far as food and other needs are concerned .
nraumva bitufasha ntabwo twebwe tuzakugora mbese mu buzima mbese nko kututunga ; ||| if you got us shelter , it would be of great help to us .
nraumva mbese tuzabona uko tubaho . ||| we shall look for means to get food by ourselves . @"
ubwo tujyaaga tuigira muri ako kazu , tuka ... hariho igihe tunaburaraaga , ||| we would endlessly sit in that house and sometimes we would even sleep without eating anything .
kandi na n' uyu munsi wa none ntureba n' igihe kishize n' ubungubu turaburara . keretse ... baragenda bakajya ku ishuri , ||| today , despite all the time gone by , we still sleep hungry sometimes .
nnjyae nkajya ku ishuri , ariko tuza mbese nko mu kiruhuko keretse nk' iyo umuntu atugiraiye impuhwe . utuhaye ibiro 2 by' ibishyimbo , utuhaye ikilo cy' ubugali , ||| unless ... my cousins and i go to school but on our return when on holiday ... unless someone feels sorry for us and gives us two kg of beans , and another one gives us one kg of cassava flour ... we normally find a way to survive on what we 've got .
tugira kutae ? tubifata uko nguko . cyangwa se ukasanga turi kuiganyira ukuntu mbese tugomba kuva ku ishuri , n' urugo ukuntu turi burutungukamo rumeze , ||| occasionally , when it 's time to live school we worry thinking about where to go as we dread going back to our so called home .
ntawe uzaza ngo atubwirae ngo mwaramutse , cyangwa se tukabura nk' uko tujya ku ishuri . nkubu njyewe nba nrarangije . ariko bigera ahongaho nkabivamo , ||| life where no one comes to say hi , sometimes we do not go to school . at my age i would have finished high school if it were n't for such problems .
nkabireka nkabura uko jya ku ishuri , ||| sometimes i stop because i have no means to go to school .
ngira amahirwe nkabona uko abo bana uko bagiye ku ishuri mbese bakagenda . cyangwa tubura uko tubigenza tuesae tukaicara . ||| however , sometimes we were lucky to go to school and the times we were n't , then we all just sat home .
ubwo mbese ukareba ubuzima mbese buragoye . ||| in short , life is really hard .
nkubungubu urebye trimestere ( ikihembae ) yashize ya mbere ntabwo njyewe nigeze niga kubera ibibazo nk' ibyo byose . ||| i did not go to school last term because of similar problems .
ubu nrangije kugira ngo mbe nbasha kusubira mu ishuri ngiyeyo ubu ejo bunri muri kino kihembawe , ||| until a few days ago i managed to go to school for this current term however , life is still too hard .
mbese nkabona ubuzima buragoye , ||| it 's difficult to get a job . nobody can employ me yet .
nkavuga se ubu nzakora iki ? ntanuwo nsaba n' akazi ngo akampe , ||| of course i can never work as a housemaid because i can not stand that job .
nkabona nanone ntawampa akazi . kandi nanone njyae ntawe uzampa akazi ko kuba mu rugo njyewe ntinshobora kuba umuboyi cyangwa ngo umuntu antukae cyangwa ngo agirae kutae . ||| i can not work as a housemaid where every one insults you or people do to you anything they wish .
mu by' ukuri wa mugabo yatutije inzu muri za 97 igihe kiza kugera ati rero akazu kanjye , n' ubwo ari gatoya , nkakodesha kakagira kutae , ||| well , the man helped us with his house in 1997 until when he told us that , although his house was very small , he would wish to get a small amount of money out of it .
kakampa amafaranga n' ubwo yaba 3000 cyangwa se 5000 kakoze isuku , ||| be it 3000 rfw or 5000 rfw in case he repaired it .
nraumva biangirira mbese akamaro . ||| he said that it would be of use to him .
turagenda noneho nravuga noneho njya ku musaza kabisa w' umuhutu witwa muhamudu nti muzae nzi uko uri inshuti ya papa , ||| i went to see another old man who was a hutu and told him ; "@ mzee [ old man ] , you used to be a friend to my dad .
none ubwo uri inshuti ya papa tushakirae inzu ntabwo tukugora , ||| since you were friends , please get us a small house we promise to never disturb you .
tushakirae akazu k' icyumba na salon cyangwa nigashaka kabae na , nta cyumba kirimo cyangwa tuzajya tushyiramo rido . ||| get us a house of one bedroom and a living room , even if it only has a bedroom without a living room we will survive it , we will hung curtains in the room to divide it .
arangije umusaza akazu arakampaye k' icyumba na salon kabagamo abakozi be , ||| fortunately the old man gave the house to me . it had a single bedroom with a small living room . it was his servants ' house .
arangije noneho igihe kiza kugera ati @: "@ noneho , mujyae munshakira n' igihumbi . @" ||| after some time , the old man said that we should at least give him 1000 rfw .
muby' ukuri njyewe nramubwiye nti igihumbi ntacyo nbona , ||| i told him that sincerely speaking i could not get that money .
nti ubuzima bwacu urabizi , uzi ko ufite icyuma mu rugo , umugore wawe niwe utugirair impuhwe . ||| "@ you know the way we live , it is your wife who sometimes helps us , " i told him .
ubwo mbese ukareba n' umuntu akagira n' isoni n' iki ? nk' ubu njyewe ntinshobora kujya gufunguza , ||| people would look at us and feel ashamed because i never used to ask for food even when we were starving to death . we would never beg food from anyone .
uraumva inzara ishobora kunyica cyangwa nba barumuna banjye ikabica cyangwa bakagira , ariko ntabwo nshobora kuza ngo nkubwirae ngo njyewe ngo alisa ngo nfite ikibazo iki n' iki , ngo ngirae . ||| i never go to someone and say that " i , alice , am hungry . @"
ntakuihorera niba ubona ko ari ngombaw , wowe wagikemura . s' ukuvuga y' uko benshi nrabazi ariko ubwira umuntu akakaumvira ubusa . sukuvuga ko nicaye , ||| i just keep silent until when one can tell from my appearance that i need something . because the majority of people listen to your problems yet they are not going to help you .
atari uko abantu batariho kandi bavuga ngo n' abagiraneza babaho . ||| i stopped going to school because there were no people in this world to help others in need .
nraicaye umwaka wose urashira . ejobundi nabwo nbonye ko rwose nicaye birangiye , igihembwe kirashira . ||| i dropped out of school for a whole year until a few days ago when i realised that i am risking stopping my studies , and then went back at school when the term was coming to its end .
kimaze kushira , n' ubungubu no kujya kuiga ngiyeyo nyuma . ||| i went to school very late .
kuko nigaaga hariya i kanombe . nrareba kuza kuiga hano ikigali , nta tick , ||| i used to study in kanombe .
ntataha nta muntu ugira kutae nsanga , ntaki , reka noneho ngira kutae ngendae nsubirae inyuma jyae kuiga iriya . kuko nzajya nbura n' uko nbigenza nzajya ngenda n' amaguru . ||| coming to school here to kigali with transport problems , going back home yet there is nobody to find there , plus several other problems ... therefore , i decided to study from there ... where i would walk in case i had no bus fare .
ubwo nrangije nragenda nsaba ishuri , bararimpaye , bamaze kurimpa ariko ngira ikibazo cyo kujya ku ishuri , ||| i asked for admission in the school and i was accepted .
nshakisha noneho n' umuntu nnanbwira se wo kabyarawe ungiraiye impuhwe ukampa agasabune wenda ka cinquante ( 50 ) biibura ampe nka 2 kiangwae se na ga colgatte , ||| but i still had more needs ; i wanted someone who came help me with let 's say ; washing soap , which coasted 50 rfw , or maybe to give me some colgate .
kujyenda uri mushyashya uvugae ngo ugiye kutangira usaba , ||| you know what ?
ngo nshyirairho agacolgatte , ntiza agasabune , kandi witwa ko uri mushyashya ukaumva nabwo n' ibibazo . ubwo nrangije nihagararaho haashije ibyumweru 2 abana baratangiye , ||| when one is new in a school , it gives a wrong impression to begin with asking anyone for a colgate or soap yet you are new in the society .
ntinzi rwose , ||| it is a problem .
ntinzi nnjyae ukuntu bigenze ngiye kubona nbona umudamu umwe araje , aravuga ati @: "@ ese ||| after being late for two weeks , i can not tell how lucky i was and a certain lady come and asked me @:
tumaze kutukabana , noneho nrababwira nti @: mu by' ukuri noneho murebae tubonye ibikoresho kandi ntawe uzabona ticket , ||| after dividing the soaps and colgate , i told them , "@ you see we have got something to use at school but we have no ticket to take us to school . @"
umwe yiga i nyanza undi yiga i shyogwe , ubwo murareba ubu se uzava hano ugendae i nyanza n' amaguru ? ||| one was going to school in nyanza and the other one was in shyogwe . i asked the first one if he @/@ she would walk up to nyanza ? @"

mujyende mujyae ku muhanda mushakae umuntu ubategair rifti umwe agendae , umwe ategae ijya i nyanza undi ategae ijya intuzaa ijya i shyogwe . ||| no matter how long it would take . "@ since you are too young , i said , you should go by the roadside and get a ride to nyanza and the other one to shyogwe .
ubwo bigenda gutyo . ||| that is exactly how it happened .
ubu rero nrangije ngira gutya nibwo nvuze nti rero reka nzajyae kureba na claire ejo , ||| afterwards , i decided to go and see claire the following day .
nrangije nravuga nti ni wenda mu by' ukuri turiganyae nti we ntiyabura iki ? ntiyabura icyo yamarair . ubwo rega ntateze nraje ! ||| claire and i went to the same school . hoping that she would get something to give me .
nje ino ahangaha . ||| i boarded a taxi and went there .
nrangije ubwo nsaba uruhusa ariko n' ukuvuga y' uko nabwo nzanaw n' iki ? nzanaw n' ibibazo . directeur araza aranbwira ati @: ||| first , i went to get permission from the school director [ headmaster ] he immediately told me "@ alice , you will not sit for the final exams . @" i asked myself why ?
alisa wowe nta uzakora exta kubera iki ? ubwo urumaw ko ari ibibazo biri kugenda biza mu binri . ||| i believe you understand how problems kept piling , up all at once .
nti kubera iki ? aranbwira ati @: ||| then i asked him " why sir ? @"
"@ uje nyuma usanga formulaire nrazijyanye , ||| he replied , "@ you came very late after i have already taken back the forms .
none ubwo nzijyanye n' uko nyine , uzaiga ntiuzakora exta ntabwo uzagira ... umwaka utaha uzagira . @" ||| and since i took the forms , there is no alternative , you will study but you will never sit for the final exams . maybe next academic year ... @" i got so disappointed that day .
noneho nibaza ubuzima bwanjye , nibaza kuza kuirirwa nicaye ngo nraiga , ntinzanakora ntinzanagira kutae ? ||| i imagined spending days in class yet i were n't going to sit for exams .
directeur nibwo nmubwiye nti njyewe urekae ntahae . ||| then i asked the headmaster to let me go back home but the headmaster said no !
ngo oya . nti njyewe reka ntahae niko njyewe nmubwiye , ||| i again asked him to let me go back home , once again he said no !
directeur arangije abona nrarakaye , ||| i got annoyed and he realised that i was .
buracya nsubirayo , buraongera buracya nsubirayo . nramubwira nti rero , ||| the following day i went to him again he refused .
ubundi directeur ntabwo aba azi ibibazo by' umuntu . nti mpa uruhushya ntahae jyae kubibwira mu rugo , uko ibintu bimeze , ampaye uruhushya . ||| the next day i told him that i needed permission to go and tell people at home about the situation . headmasters never know student 's details he thus gave me the permission .
nrangije noneho nravuga @: mu by' ukuri ntaho ntaha jya , ||| i said to myself , i have no home to go to .
ntaki , ahubwo reka ngirae kutae ? jyende jyae muri conseil jyae kwibariza . noneho reka jyewe jyae , ||| i better go to the examination council and ask if i can not sit for exams . that is the decision i myself made .
reka jyewe jyende muri conseil jyae kwibariza . uraumva , reka jyewe jyae muri conseil jyae kwibariza , nibarize impamvu njyewe alisa ntagomba kukora , ||| i decided to go to the examination council and ask why alice in particular would not sit for exams .
nibaza ukuntu jyewe nzaiga umwaka wose , uraumva , ||| the thought of repeating the whole year ... can you imagine ?
nkaongera ubutaha nkazagaruka . nkibaza n' ubuzima bwanjye nkabona ibyo bintu ntazabishobora . ||| at the same time i would think about my life and finally i decided it impossible .
kandi no kuza kuiga bingoye . ||| at first going to school was very hard for me .
nragenda nguza umwana nramubwira nti rero nbabarira njyewe unkurize amafaranga . ||| i borrowed 1500 rfw from a fellow student .
nti unkurize 1.500 nti njyewe ntashaka kujya i kigali imaan n' inshoboza nzayakuha . ||| i told her that if all goes well i would pay her very soon .
mu by' ukuri ntinzi ahantu nzayakura , ntinzi iki ! nricecekair . nba en charge ya ya mafaranga noneho kugira ngo jyewe nzabonae i ticket . ||| i did n't know where to get that money but i took it because i needed bus fare .
ubwo nraza jya hariya kuri conseil ejo nragenda nbabwira mbese ikibazo cyanjye ko ari cyo kibazo nfite , baemera kuvuga ngo bazagira . ||| then i went to the examination council yesterday and explained to them my problem .
batelefona directeur , baramubwira ikibazo cya alisa , ||| at the council they easily understood my problem . they gave a call to my headmaster and reminded him about alice 's case .
noneho uzauzuzae wowe uzauzuzae fomurmulaire yiwe numara kuyuzuza ugirae kutae ? uzayizanae . ||| they asked him to fill the form on my behalf and take it to the council for me .
ubwo rero nrangije , ||| then i left that place .
nragenda nravuga nimugoroba nti reka rero noneho jyae kureba claire , nramanuka mpita jya kureba claire mbese , ||| in the evening i decided to go and see claire as i had planned prior .
mu gitondo nibwo mbese yanbwiraaga ngo uribuze mbese . nravuga nti nta kibazo , ngo kandi barashaka ubuzima bw' abana bibana . ||| she asked me to go back the next morning that there were some people who wanted to know about life of children who take care of themselves . i told her that i have no problem with that .
nti njyewe ubuzima bwo nrabufite . ||| i know the experience of living alone .
nuko nyine nti nba nranagiye n' ejo nkaongera nkasubirayo ngo ngendae jyae ku ishuri , ||| i would have left yesterday for school because the headmaster said that i should go back to school .
kuko directeur yari avuze ngo mpite nongera ngarukae kuko bari bamaze ku mutelefona . ||| that is what he said on phone .
nuko mbese urebye ubuzima bwanjye n' ubwongubwo nriho ntariho . ||| in a word that is how my life is , i am half alive , half dead .
sibyo , simvuga ngo nrava ku ishuri nvugae ngo ntasanga uyu nguyu , ||| from school i do n't expect to find anyone home .
ibindi byo simba nnabitekereza kugirango umuntu wenda bibinri byo kusuraw byo kuvuga ngo njyewe ngo nragiye ngiye nsanze masenge nta masenge ngira , nta data wacu , ||| i do n't even think having someone visiting me ; let 's say an aunt visiting me , i do n't have any aunt , i do n't have any uncle , no one .
ntaki ! uko mpagaze uku nijyewe alisa ninjye mukuru w' umuryango . uraumva , ukareba ukasanga rero , ||| as you see me standing here in front of you , i am the oldest person of the family that survived .
nba numva na vacance zitanabaho . ||| because of all that , i wish there were no holidays at all .
kuko nragenda nkahangayika . ||| i suffer a lot on holidays .
ukasanga rero n' ibibazo bigenda binkomereye cyane nkashaka nkabibura . ||| i get several problem i can not solve .
nawe aho kugirango ugendae urebae umunyarwanda w' iki kihae , ugendae umubwirae uti nfite ikibazo iki n' iki , uraumva , ||| nowadays , telling a rwandan about the problems i face is just a ... they would just talk about your problems all around .
wa muntu nawe , ahubwo azakunyega azagira kutae ? agendae akubunza akuvuga . ||| one has to come up with a decision .
wowe ugira kutae ? uremera ukafata kamwe . ukagenda tukagenda tukibera muri ubwo burushyi bwacu , ||| we live in that small house suffering .
muri ako kazu kaho nkaha mbese , niba batugiraiye impuhwe n' uko mbese nyine bimeze ubuzima ni bara , bara . ||| if anybody feels sorry for us ... life goes on .
mwavukanaga muri abana bangahe ? ||| how many were you in your family ?
tuvukanaaga turi abana 4 ||| we were four children .
mukaba musigaye muri bangahe ? ||| and how many of you survived ?
uko tubanye ? ||| how we lived together ?
mbese ubwo ngezeyo mu rugo , iwe , muby' ukuri ntabwo nbaye nk' umwana wo mu rugo urebye njyewe yanfashe nk' umukozi wiwe . ||| well , when i reached his home , i was never treated like a home child . he took me to be like a housemaid .
ariko ijoro , mbese ni joro , yaravuga ... njyewe njyaaga njya kuihisha mu gikaranka ahantu , ubwo bukacya bumara kucya , ||| every night i would go to hide somewhere in the bush and in the morning , they would pick me up .
bakaza kunbwira bati ngwino , nkagenda , ubwo iyo nbaga ndi murugo iwe njyaaga kusoroma ikawa , ||| in his home i would go to harvest coffee .
tujyaaga kuzishesha tukajonjora . ||| we would take the coffee to the machine for grinding .
cyangwa nkajya no kuvoma amazi yo kuronga ikawa , ||| sometimes i would go to fetch water for cleaning the coffee .
ariko urebye , mbese akenshi akongako niko kari akazi kanjye mbese urebye ; icyo kihae muzi ko ikawa zari zaeze cyane ! ||| most of the time , that would be my work in his home . i guess you know that by then it was harvest time . for coffee as well as for other things .
n' imyaka yari yeze ! mbese ubwo , uko nri ndi bankoreshaaga uko ndi . nkagenda , ||| they used to give me a lot of work because i was vulnerable .
ubwo tuirirwaaga mu ikawa , tukazishesha , ||| we would spend the whole day in coffee plantations and take it for grinding .
ubundi nkaza nkajya kuvoma , ||| from there , i would go for water .
ariko mu kuvoma kwanjye bagiraaga kutae ? jyae ntabwo bampaga ijerekani nzima , ||| i would not use a normal can ; i would use an old can to fetch water and i would bring water with it .
ntwaraaga ikijerekani cy' iki ? cy' igice , cya kinri cy' igice nkagenda nkakikorera nkakizana , ||| i would bring half can water .
ariko kibaga ari igice kitauzuye . ||| not a full one .
ubwo , ||| i stayed there .
ndahabayee ... umugabo noneho yarangije aranbwira ati @: "@ reka noneho nkubwirae wa mwana we , ||| then that man came and told me ; "@ let me tell you young girl , i got you from your mum .
nkuambuye nyoko , maze kukuambura nyoko , nraumva ntashaka ko amaraso yawe azagira kutae ? ||| and i do n't want your blood to be counted on me .
azaambarwaho . none gira kutae ? wowe igenderae . ||| therefore , i beg you to go .
niba ushakisha ukuntu uri bugendae ukagera mu ruhango , simbizi , ugendae upima ikirere . @" ||| it is up to you to look for a way to ruhango , i do n't know if you can guess the right way . @"
nramubwiye , nti @: jyewe nraumva ntamenya iyo njya . ||| i told him that i did not know where to go .
nti jyewe rwose nraumva ntamenya iyo njya . noneho arangije aranbwira ati ... noneho , ||| i assured him that i did n't know where to go .
hakaba hari umwana uhabaaga umugore yarabereye nyirasenge , ||| but there was a certain child who lived in that family ; the wife of that man was that kid 's aunt .
we ubonaaga anrushije mbese no kujijuka , ubonaaga ko anrusha n' imyaka . ||| that child seemed to be wiser than i was ; she even looked older than i was .
noneho nramubwira nti wowe , mubwirae agirae kutae ? ||| then i decided to ask her to do me a favour ...
amperekeze , anyerekae inzira jyewe ntinzi ahantu ndi bujyae . ||| to escort me and show me the way because i did n't know the way .
arangije aramperekeza . amaze kumperekeza , angeza kukayira . angejeje kukayira noneho hakaba hari ahantu tuciye kwa musaza wa mama wo kwa se wabo , ||| then that kid escorted me up to a small route . but there was some place i remembered , where we once passed with my mum . it was at my uncle 's place . he was my mum 's cousin .
ariko mubyukuri jyae nri mpageze ari ubaw mbere , mbese turi tugiye ubwongubwo , mama aravuga ati @" njyewe ngiye kushakisha uko nshoboye tugende tujyae i burunri nta kunri . @"@ ||| the first time i passed there , i was with my mum and she said ; "@ i am going to find means of how we would go to burundi because there 's no other alternative . @"
ubwo arangije , ubwo uraumva ko we yagarutse mu nzira , ||| but as i told you , she stopped on the way .
noneho nnjyae ntakomeza nrazamuka , ||| then i went on and ascended the hill .
nravuga nti reka ncae hahanri , wenda bo usanga bakihari . ariho kwa marume . ||| then i decided to pass at my uncle 's place expecting to find somebody .
ubwo nciyeyo , nsanga wapi noneho nsanga intuze , ||| when i went there , i found no one .
n' ibyatsi birameze . ||| the grass had grown everywhere .
nti noneho alice nrajya hehe ? ||| "@ where will poor alice go ? @" i asked myself .
nkazajya mpagarara ahangaha nkareba hakurya , nkareba hakuno , nkabona nta hantu nzi . ||| i would aim from where i was standing and look across the hill but i would not find any place that i knew .
mu kuiahura mu by' ukuri ntiniahuye rimwe jyewe , niahuye kabiri . ||| believe me , i did not try to commit suicide only once , i did twice .
ubwo hepfo yaho hari umugezi , se bawitaga nguki ! hepfo ya , ||| slightly below that home there was a river .
mbese , ||| i do n't remember what it was called .
bari batuye , mbese ni nk' igishanga nk' ahangaha nabo batuye nka hariya . nkavuga nti noneho , nti uno mukenya noneho , ||| near their home , the river was approximately there [ she 's pointing ] and they were living somewhere like here [ as she 's pointing ] . near the swamp .
nti nragenda nanone nkugemo . ||| then i said to myself ; "@ i am going to throw myself in this river . @"
noneho nragenda nkuikubitamo , ubundi nragenda nywa amazi ngira kutae ubundi birangije , nikubita hakurya . maze kuikubita hakurya , ||| i threw myself in the river and simply drunk some water and found myself the other side of the river .
noneho nkaba nraumvise ngo umuntu wiyahura afite amafaranga ntapfa . ||| when i was young , i used to hear that when you commit suicide and you have money , you can never die .
jyae nri nfite igihumbi , ||| i had 1000 rfw in my pocket .
nravuga nti ubu ahari nti ni uko ahari nfite amafaranga . ||| "@ maybe it is the reason why i can not die . @" i thought .
ya mafaranga nyakuramo nyata imusozi , nraongera ninagamo . ||| then i put that money aside and then went back into the river .
nbona ibintu biranze . ubwo nbonye ibintu bianze ngira kutae ? ntaceceka nyine ubwo nyine , ||| i still did not die . then i left the river .
uko niko nvuye kuri uwo mugabo bajya baita kayigamba . ||| that is how i left that man 's home . he was called kayigamba .
none se , ubwo abo bantu bose ugiye unyuraho muri icyo kihae cya genocide . abo bantu bose wunva ukibaibuka ubabonye ubamenya ? ||| would you remember all the people you met during the genocide if you saw them today ?
yee , jyewe nrabazi . ||| yes , i know them .
nta maherezo yabo uba uzi ubungubu ku buzima bwabo ? ||| do you know anything as far as their lives are concerned ?
mbese kayigamba , ||| well , kayigamba is imprisoned .
amakuru ye nba nzi , arafunze . ariko ntabwo nzi ahantu afungaiye . ||| but i do n't know the prison where he is .
uwonguwo nawe baita abiya uri ntuza ... uri umuganga we yafashe , we nraumva ngo ari muri kenya ahari niko numvise . ||| i heard that abiya who was a doctor is now in kenya .
yajyanye n' umukobwa bajyaaga baita grace ubwo uwo mukobwa baitaaga grace nawe turi tuihishaanye ahongaho mbese , ||| that is what rumours say . he went with a girl called grace . grace was a girl we were hiding together in that home .
mbese yaravugaaga ngo ni muburyo bwo kumukiza ariko ahita agira kutae ? amugira n' umugore w' iwe barajyana . abongabo ntinzi iki ? ||| he used to say that he was trying to save her and later make her his wife .
ntinzi amaherezo yabo . ||| then they went together but i have n't heard more about them .
muri orpherinat . ||| in the orphanage .
mbese ubundi urebye , icyo kihae jyewe nbonaaga mbese , n' ubwo numvaaga y' uko ndi muri iyo orpherinat , jyewe nibazaaga ko atari iwacu . ||| actually , even though i was considered to be living in the orphanage , i would n't feel at home .
sibyo ? ariko ko mpari ngize kutae ? ||| is n't it ?
nzahava n' ubundi . ||| i knew i would one day leave the orphanage .
muby' ukuri nbonaaga nta kibazo , ariko ikintu jyewe kinahankuye cyane kugira ngo decider kusezera , hari umugabo baitaaga ntuzaa ... mbese ari nka directeur wacu . ||| otherwise there were n't many problems . however , for me to decide to leave the orphanage , there was a certain man who was called ... i do n't remember his name . he was some kind of director .
noneho igihe kiza kugera kuko jyewe , hano nfite n' igikovu banteye icumu hano ahangaha ku gatsinsino . nrangije ubwo , directeur akazajya , ||| one day ... i had a big scar here on my ankle , where i was speared .
kuko icyo kihae nri nnutse ndi akantu rwose kateye ubute . ubwo , ||| then he would ... by then i was too slim ; i looked very weak .
arangije directeur noneho aravuga ati @: "@ ariko nk' iri shyano ! @" ||| then he said to me , "@ look at this disaster ! @"@
akabivuga directeur icyo kihae , akabivuga . nrangije noneho , ||| . the director , said that .
ariko nkagenda mbese nkabona mubanri , mbese nta kibazo , ||| otherwise , i was fine and i was with other children .
nrarya nkaryama , uraumva , mbese nkabona , mbese byose bakatuha n' imyenda . ||| i could eat , sleep , you know , we would get all things plus clothes .
ariko jyewe nza kugira ikibazo cy' uwo mugabo bajya baita ngo ni kayigamba . ||| my problem was the man called kayigamba .
ubwo nrangije nyine nibwo ngize kutae ? ndesida ( nfata icyemezo ) jyewe kusezera nyine . ||| then i decided to leave the orphanage .
nravuga ngo ntasezeye , ||| i told them that i wanted to leave the orphanage .
nti nragiye nzagenda nbaeho uko iki ? uko imaan ishaka . ||| i said i would live the way god wished .
n' iyo ngenda nkakorera umuntu ariko ntagize kutae ? ntakomeje kuzajya ntukwa n' umuntu . ubwo nragaije , ||| i preferred working for someone as a housemaid to being abused by someone .
icyo kihae rwose nri nrangije ahari na primaire . ||| i think by then i had completed my primary studies .
ubwo rero mpita ngira kutae ? mpita nigendera rwose nyivamo . ||| then i left the orphanage .
ubwo rero uba uvuyemo , ufashe icyemezo cy' uko uba umukuru w' umuryango . ||| then you left the orphanage and decided to become the head of a family .
ubwo ngubwo muri icyo kihae uri ufite nk' imyaka ingahe ? ||| how old were you ?
i cyo kihae nraumva nri nfite ahari nka 17 cyangwa , 16 nraumva ariyo nri nfite . ||| i probably was 17 or 16 years old i think .
abo ureraaga bari bakurikiraanye batae mu myaka ? ||| the children you were looking after , what are their age difference ?
mbese umukuru muri abongabo , afite imyaka 18 ubungubu . yiga mu wa kane secondaire . ||| the oldest is 18 years at the moment ; she is in secondary four .
murumuna we nawe , yiga muwakabiri ubungubu . ||| her young sister is in secondary two now .
muri kumwe nabo ari babiri . ||| do you still live with both of them ?
ubwo nsigara ku rugo nrangije nfata intuze jyewe ubwanjye , nfata i lettre nrayandika . maze kuyandika nramubwira , ||| i stayed at home and wrote a letter on my own .
nragenda nrayimuha , umugore we ntabwo yari azi kusoma . ||| i took it to him but his wife did n't know how to read .

iki , ariko biza kuva ku ntandaro , murumuna wanjye aramubwira ati , mpa ikaye , ||| meanwhile my cousin asked for an exercise book , and he told her that there were no books .
abasaba mbese ikayi . amaze kubasaba ikaye arababwira , ngo nta makaye ahari . ngo nta n' amafaranga nfite yo kukugurair ikaye . ||| that he did n't have money to buy books .
ubwo nanone ikindi kihae kiza kugera yari afite abana b' abakobwa babiri , arabazanye , uwo mugabo mbese yakoraaga inahangaha i kigali , ||| some other time another event happened ; he had other two girls that he had brought ... he used to work from kigali ; he was a businessman there in the commercial street .
ari umucuruzi acururiza hariya muri quartier mateus ariko akataha ku wa gatanu . ||| but he would come home on fridays .
afashe abana be aragiye arabadodeshereje , twebwe arangije , aragenda atuzanira , ni nko kutufatair ibyamvagara . ||| he took his daughters to the tailor and made them good clothes then for us he bought us very funny clothes .
arabizanye , amaze kubizana aragiye abishyize muri garde robae ubundi arivugaishije , ||| he put those clothes in the closet and called me .
arampamagaye ngo genda murebae muri iriya myenda urebae ko wowe na barumuna bawe ibakwira . ||| he said to me , "@ look into that closet there are some clothes , check if they suit your cousins and you . @"
noneho nrayirebye , nrebye n' iyo bazaniye abandi , ndabi compara ( nrabigereranya ) nsanga ntibihuye . ||| i rushed to the closet and saw the clothes but when i compared them with the clothes that they had given others , they were incomparable .
nrangije nramubwiye ngo n' uko . njyewe nri umuntu ugira umujinya cyane , nramubwira nti n' uko murakoze , ||| well , i used too be so mad ... i thanked him .
maze kuyifata , njyewe nbwiye barumuna banjye nti iyo myenda ntimuyanberae , ||| i told my cousins never to wear those clothes .
ahubwo tugirae kutae ? tuyiherae umukozi wa hano mu rugo . ||| we decided to give them to the housemaid .
uraumva yazanye ubugutiya 3 @-@ n' ubupira ntazi ukuntu bumeze , uraumva , nramubwira nti njyewe n' uko mwarakoze mwaradufashije ariko ntabwo , ntabwo tugeze aho kugirango mutuhae ibintu bimeze gutya . ||| he brought us three funny skirts and three undefined t @-@ shirts , i just thanked him and told him that we had not yet reached the extent of wearing such things . @"
turayifata tuyiha umukozi , tumaze kuyiha umukozi noneho , ||| we gave them to the housemaid .
akazajya ayambara . umugore aje noneho umugore araturega , aravuga ati yamyenda ubahaye ntayo bigeze baambara , ||| she wore them and one day , his wife saw her wearing the same clothes . she immediately reported us to her husband . "@ they never wore the clothes you gave them .
ahubwo bagize kutae ? bayihereye valentine , ||| instead they gave them to valentine [ housemaid ] . @"
aratuhamagara , amaze kutuhamagara , uwo mugabo ngo koko ali , ||| then he called us and said "@ really ali ... !
ngo utinyukae unsuzugurae nrakuzanye ? nrangije nramubwiye ngo ahangaha siho ubuzima bugarukaiye , ufashe abawe , njyewe nrabimubwira gutya vis a vis , ||| how could you disobey me yet i brought you here ? @" i replied that it was n't the end of life .
ufashe abawe uragenda urabadodeshereza , twebwe urangije uragenda utuzanira iki ? utuzanira imyenda ntazi ukuntu imeze , twebwe tubonye imyenda tutayishoboye tugira kutae ? ||| i told him face to face ; "@ you brought your children tailor @-@ made clothes and brought us undefined clothes .
tuyiha valentine . ||| when we decided that we would never put them on , we decided to give them to valentine . @"
nanone ndesida kuhava nibwo ngiye kuri wa mugabo baita papa alisa , mbese tumubwira mbese ibyo bibazo yemera kutucumbikira , ubwo nrangije mbese wa mugabo namusezeyaho . ||| then i decided to leave that home and joined a man called papa alisa . we told him those problems and he allowed to live with us .
twebwe turagiye njyewe nigaaga mu wa mbere secondaire njyewe niho nigaaga . ||| meanwhile i said bye to the other man . by then i was in secondary one .
ubwo tudecida mbese kujya kuibana turagenda tubaye ahongaho umugabo akajya avuga ngo turananiraanye tugize kutae , ||| then we started living alone and he started saying that we got spoiled .
nti nta kibazo ariko muri tuesae uzacunge uzarebae ko hari uzagira kutae ? ko hari uzaiyandarika . ||| i said no problem , watch us and see if we would ever mess up on the streets .
tubaye ahongaho tutakigera mu rugo rwiwe tutakigira kutae ? ||| we lived there and never stepped in his home .
igihe kiza kugera , ubwo wenda yabonye ko tutasa nabi cyane cyangwa nta na mavunja turwaye nta ki ! ||| but i am sure he never saw us in very bad conditions ; we never got sick of jigger .
tukazajya tubona n' agasabune tukamesa akabona ntitusa nabi ! ||| we sometimes used to get soap and wash our clothes . he never caught us looking bad .
ubwo arangije mbese nanone aravuga ati @: "@ noneho ubwo , mwagiye muza mu rugo kutusura , kugira kutae ? @" ||| later he came to us and said , "@ even though you left us , you can come and pay us a visit . @"
njyewe muby' ukuri iyo babinbwiye njyewe ntabobinshimisha , ushobora kubinbwira nkakugayair mu mutaima ariko nkikairiza . ||| well , when someone told me something like that , in my heart i despise them , wondering why i should visit them then i say yes knowing very well that i would never appear in their homes .
ubwo nrangije mbese bikomeza kugenda gutyoo ... nraumva ari uko bigenze . ||| that is how my life went on .
iyo ubundi wicaranye na barumuna bawe ibyo ari byo byose hari ukuntu muganira ku buzima . ubaha inama ki ? mbese ikiganiro mugiraan kaerekeye ku buzima murimo kiba kiteye kitae ? ||| when you are with your cousins , i guess that sometime you talk about life ... what kind of advice do you give them ? what do you talk about as far as your life style is concerned ?
mbese nkanjyae mukuru , njyewe icyo nkoresha bwa mbere nbanza kubakaruma ( kubarema agatima ) . nkababwira nti @: ||| as the oldest of all , i first calm them .
‘ ibingibi siko bizahora . ’ mbese nkabizeza ko inberae hari ibiiza . ||| i assure them that things will change for the better .
njyewe mbizeza ko inberae hari ibiiza nkababwira ko tuzabaho neza ko tuzagira kutae , yuko nyuma y' ubu buzima mbese hazaza iki ? ||| i convince them how the future will be good and how we are going to get a better life .
hazaza ubundi . nkababwira nti dore rero impamvu twebwe tufite avenir , n' uko nta kazi kakibaho twebwe turi kuiga , kandi n' ubwo tuiga tuzagira kutae tuzarangiza . ||| so i go ahead and tell them @: "@ although we have no job now , in the future we will get one , we are studying and we will get jobs afterwards so the future will be good .
kandi nraumva y' uko imaan itagize kutae ? itatuteranye . ntawe nitwifata neza , tuzagira kutae ? ||| i believe god is with us , if we behave ourselves then the future will be brighter . @"
nkeka ko inberae tuzagira avenir nziza . mbese ntawe tukagira tutae ? tukiha morale , ||| therefore , we keep up our morale like that .
tuba tunaburaye tukagira tutae ? tukiha morale . mbese ukasanga mbese twifitiye izo za morale , ariko hariho igihe kazamo mbese , ||| even when we have n't had dinner we just keep morale . however , sometimes we feel discouraged .
burya wa mukani iyo ubwiraje uvuga uti nrarya , burya uba wunva nta kibazo , ariko iyo uburaye uvuga uti nta n' akantu , n' aka nagakeya usanga umuntu yahangayitse . ||| when one intentionally decides to skip dinner , they find it easy but when one misses it simply because there is no food , it is very distressing .
bakavuga bati alisa tubigenze tutae ? nnjyae ubwanjye alisa ntakunri nbigenza , mu by' ukuri noneho namwe muri bakuru , ||| the kids ask me @: alice what should we do ?
sibyo , murabibona njyende njyae hehe ? ku isambu nta kintu kihari , ||| yet , i myself have no choice .
namwe murabibona . ||| so i also ask them , "@ you are now mature , why do n't you tell me what to do ? look !
ari njyewe ntabwo njya kufata isuka ngo ngiye kuhinga ntinbishobora , namwe n' uko , ubwo tugirae kutae tutegerezae uko bizagenda , muby' ukuri ndababwiza ukuri , ||| there is no food in the garden , of course i can not dig because i do n't know how to , neither do you .
uraumva turya ari nk' umuntu utugiraiye impuhe nk' uku nguku . ||| so , what can we do ?
mbese akikora ukajya kubona ukabona akuzaniye nk' agafu nk' iki , ||| all we can do is wait and see what happens . @"
tukakafata kuko mu ruhango muzi ko haba imyumbati cyane , hari n' utuzanira ibiro 5 . niba tutetse ikilo k' ibishyimbo , tuzajya nyine tuteka utubaoga dukeya ubundi tutekae ubugari bwinshi wenda , ||| i want to assure you of this ; we get what we eat by luck , when someone gives us about four kilograms of cassava flour and maybe we had a kilogram of beans then we slowly eat that one kilogram of beans with those four kilograms of flour and some vegetables .
utubaoga tuturaye nk' icyumweru , ukareba ukasanga mbese umuntu akarondereza . n' uko urebye bimeze . ||| [ here in ruhango there is a lot of cassava flour ] that is the situation we are in .
nagirango nkubaze nk' ubuzima bwawe , n' ikibazo wenda kisa n' ikigoye kukibaza ... kukisubiza ukigeragezae . ||| i would like to ask you another question that is hard to answer but please , try and do .
wunva mu buzima bwawe , abantu bagiye bakukorera bibi bakubabaje wunva ubaibuka ushobora kubavuga ? n' icyo bagiye bakukorera ngo kanaka yagiye ankorera iki ; ||| do you remember the people who harmed you ? can you tell them to us and what they did ?
uti kandi yari afite n' ubushobozi bwo kugira ikindi akora kizima ? ||| for example @: you can say so and so did me wrong yet he or she could have helped me .
mu buzima ? ||| oh . in my life time .
rero mu by' ukuri , njyewe nta muryango nsigaraanye , njyewe ntawe nshobora kuveba . ||| well , the fact that i remained without a family , i can not blame anyone .
umuntu wese agira kutae ? yirebair mbese famille yiwe . ||| everyone is concerned only with his or her own familly .
kuri iki kihae abanyarwanda turahindutse . n' uwakagize icyo akumarair , uvuga uti @: wenda tuvugae ndi umurescape nawe uri umurescape , ||| nowadays , we have all changed as rwandans , the one who could help you as a survivor tells you he @/@ she is as well .
njyewe nyaza nkubwirae ikibazo nurangiza unbwirae ngo ibyo bigize kutae ? ngo ibyo bibaho . kuko ibyo ngibyo nrabikoze , sibyo ? ||| i confide in you and you just answer me that those things happen .
nragenda nreba umuntu , kandi nzi y' uko afite ko hari icyo yanamarair . yagize kutae ? yangiriye inama aravuga ati @: ||| this has happened to mebefore ; i approached somebody who i thought could help me , but his advice was that he also studied in similar struggles . @"
" ntawe tuize gutyo , turushye uraumva , nawe ugomba kugira kutae ? ugomba kujyenda ukaiga ukaruha ukagira kutae ? ||| that i should also bear with it because in the future i will be fine .
ariko nyuma ubuzima buzaza . @" mu by' ukuri arabinbwiye . noneho nnjyae nramubwira muby' ukuri ko unzi , uraumva ? ||| and after telling me all that , i asked him @: "@ you actually know me and there is nothing i am hiding from you ; in fact you knew my family .
ko ntaho nkukinze , ko famille yanjye uri uyizi , uraumva ? ukagombye kunbwira ngo njyende nigae , ||| how can you be the one to tell me to go to school without a pen or anything ? @"
noneho nta karamu nta n' iki , mbese nramubwira umuntu ajya kuhinga nta n' isuka afite ? ||| i asked him if he has ever seen a person who goes to dig without a hoe .
ese ungairiye impuhwe ukampa bic ya 50 cyangwa ukampa na kasuku , uraumva ? ntabwo ngira ? ||| "@ can n't you get me even a pen that costs 50rwf or even a kasuku [ the cheapest exercise book ] ? @"
arangije uzi ukuntu yanbwiye , ngo nraumva uje kuntura ibibazo nnjyae n' ibyanjye ntabishoboye . kuva icyo kihae njyewe nrabiibuka nbimubwiye 98 . ||| so he told me that @: "@ it seems you have come to give me problems and yet i have n't solved mine . @"
kuva icyo kihae , ntabwo yigeze , ntabwo nongeye kuvaaga ngo njyewe ngo ngiye kugira uwo nbwira ibibazo . ||| from then , i remember it was in 1998 , i decided never to tell anyone my problems .
njyewe nraicaye nravuga nti nzasenga imaan , ||| i sat down and decided to pray to god .
imaan nibona ko ari ngombaw izajya ibikora . kandi nibona ko atari ngombaw , ||| i decided that if god found it worthy to help me , then we would get help .
nayo izi icyo yadushigarije , ijya kutusiga kugirango abandi tugiye kupfa ntabwo tubarushaaga ubwiza cyangwa ntitubarushaaga kukiranuka ? noneho ngenda nda , ||| if he did n't then ... of course god knows why we survived among all those who were killed , it was n't because we were so precious not even because we were holy .
noneho nkazajya ngira ikiizerae cy' iki ? nti imaan iratuzi , iratureba , aho kugira ngo ubwirae umwana w' umuntu akusekae , ||| therefore , i believe god knows us and he is watching .
agirae kutae ? akuvebe , agirae kutae , nkicecekair . ||| instead of telling a son of man who will not help me and who may even laugh at me , i just keep silent .
nkagira nko muri cas mbi ( ibihe bigoye ) nkavuga nti @: ubusae alisa ngendae noneho njyae kusaba akazi wenda nk' ahantu wenda tuvugae , jyae nk' ahantu nshakishae n' umuntu nti @: nsabair akazi wenda ngendae mbe umuboyi ko nruzi nak' ubuplanto ntawakampa cyangwa iki ! ||| there is a time i reach my worst moments where i think about working as a housemaid for someone because i do n't think there is any other job that i can get .
nkabireba noneho nkaicara nkatekereza , njyewe nzajya nbyuka saa cumi n' imwe ngendae njyae kukora jyae kugira kutae nti wapi , nti ibyo ntinbishobora nti nnjyae turi tubatunze ariko ntinshobora kujya kukira tutae , ||| but later , when i think about waking up at 5:00am and all those struggles , i say no !
jyae kujya kuba umuboyi w' ahantu . ||| i can not work as a house girl yet we used to have them at home .
ubwo biba bigenze kutae ? bigeze muri bwa buzima , bubunri noneho ntazi ukuntu bumeze . ||| i think about such things when life has become very hard on me .
ubwo arangije ... nrangije ubwo mbese nkabigenza gutyo , nanone ba bana bakaza bakabwira ati @: "@ ubusae alisa turabigenze kutae ? @"@ nnjyae nkababwira nti @: mwikarume , inberae hari ibiiza , mbese aho kugira ngo ugendae ubwirae ikibazo umuntu runaka uyu n' uyu , ahubwo gira kutae muihorerae rekatwiryamire , tukiryamair . bukacya ubwo ukasanga ubuzima bugize kutae ? ufite ikibazo cy' inki ? s' ukuvuga ngo n' ikibazo cy' imiraire kusa . uba ukeneye n' urukwi rwo kucana . ubwo n' iki ? n' amakara , urabiumva neza , ijerekani igura 20 , ukasanga ari imivomere ari iki , byose ukasanga n' iki ? n' ibibazo . ukibaza . ||| and my cousins can n't stop asking me what they should do , but i keep on telling them to calm down that the future is promising . instead of telling people our problems , we simply sleep . at times it 's not only a problem of food ; finding firewood can also be stressful . because you need firewood or charcoal to cook , a jelly @- can of water costs 20rwf therefore , be it water or any other things , life still becomes so hard .
nanone nkubaze , nk' umwana wibana , ufashe responsabilites uri mutoya , nrabireba kandi ntabwo , ||| i would like to ask you as a child who lives alone and as a child who has a lot of responsibilies , we all can see that it was n't your own choice , it is because you lost your parents when you were very young and in turn , you were left with responsibilities .
ni ukubura uko mbese bigenda no kuba urabuze ababyeyi , ibibazo byo kuba urafashe responsabilites biraumvikana . uraumva ibintu bikugoye kurusha ibindi mubuzima urimo bw' ubupfubyi ndetse no kuba uri responsable w' abana wunva ari nk' ibiki ? ||| what main challenges do you have as an orphan who is responsible for other children ?
uraumva ikikugoye , ||| what else is a challenge to you ?
unbwiye uti @: kurya birakugora , icyo nicya mbere . ||| you told me that getting food is the first problem .
nta kinri ukaongeraho ? ||| do n't you have any other problem ?
noneho ukurikije ibyo bibazo byose ufite , ||| given all your problems .
wunva hari ubwiyunge bushobora kuiyunga n' abagiye bateye ibi bibazo byose , ||| do you find it possible to reconciliate with those who caused them to you ?
nravuga mbese bariya bicanyi batwaye ababyeyi bawe , bakatuma uba responsable w' ibintu , wunva ushobora kubiihanganair ukaiyunga nabo ? ||| i mean the killers who murdered your parents and caused you all these responsibllities at an early age .
jyewe umuntu unkoreye icyaha , aje akansaba imbabazi , kandi azikuye ku mutaima , nmubabarira . ||| but if a person who committed a crime against me asked me to forgive him when he is really sorry , i can forgive him , but since i do n't know him , my heart is divided on the issue .
ariko mukihae ntawe nzi , ndi hagati . ||| tell me !
ese , ||| what would you do ?
nmubabarira , nbigenza kutae ? ariko jyewe muzi , ||| would you forgive him or ... sincerely if i knew him and he was ready to ask for forgiveness , i would forgive him .
yansaba imbabazi akazihabwa cyangwa se atazisaba akakomeza akahanaw . kuko ubundi bajya bavuga ngo ubundi "@ uwicishijwe icyuma nawe agomba kuicishaw ikindi @"@ . sibyo ? ||| and if he were not ready to ask for forgiveness , then he would continue to serve his sentence .
iki kihae ababyeyi banjye baba bakiriho wenda banagize . ariko nawe , kuko ntavuga ngo bagendae bamwice n' ubundi ntabwo biriho , nmubabarira . ||| normally it is a said that ; he who killed using a sword should die by the sword , but since that saying was not obeyed then i can just forgive him .
ubundi se , ngira ngo nkubaze akandi kabazo . ubona , ni iyihe nama , urabona y' uko , ufite ikibazo , yego n' ubwo ukifite kandi kikomeye , ariko nka babanri muba muri kumwe nabo , urabizi nka hariya mu bana ba pnud nabo bahura n' ibyo bibazo bikomeye , abo muhuje ibibazo ni benshi , ibyo ari byo byose nkamawe mufite icyo kibazo cyo kuba murera imfubyi kandi namwe murizo mufite imyaka mikeya , mukiri aba mineur . ibyo aribyo byose hari ubuzima uzi wunva ndetse n' ukuntu ugenda ubwigobotora ubwigobotora , ni iyihe nama uha abantu bafite nk' ibyo bibazo ? ||| i would like to ask you another question @: what advice can you give to ... well , it is true you have a very big problem in fact a heavy one however , there are children who have the same problem as you and they are many . you who have the problem of looking after orphans yet you are also an orphan , there is a kind of life you know and you know how to survive through it . what kind of advise can you give to people with such problems ?
nk' abana b' imfubyi bibana ? cyangwa umuntu uwo ari we wese uba wunva afite ikibazo ? ||| are you talking about orphans or any other people who have such problems ?
nk' abana b' imfubyi bibana , ||| orphans .
ni nk' iyihe nama ubagira kugira ngo barebae ukuntu bagenda bigobotora amagorane n' imisaraba barimo ? ||| what advice can you give them , so that they can be able to lighten the cross they are bearing ?
ukavuga tuvugae nkanjyae ndi umunyeshuri , nyuzwe y' uko ndi umunyeshuri , nkanyuraw y' uko nnaburaye . ||| for example @: i am a student , i have to be happy with being a student and be happy even though i had nothing to eat for dinner .
kuko iyo nza kuba ntanyuzwe wenda n' uko ndi cyangwa n' iki ? abana benshi murabizi , bajya mu muhanda bakagenda bakaiyandarika bakagira kutae . kubera iki ? ||| if i was not contented with what i have ... i believe you know what most children do ?
ntabwo baba banyuzwe . baravuga bati njyewe ndi mpfubyi , uraumva , ntawe ngira nbwira noneho reka njyewe ngirae kutae , ||| they get to the streets and misbehave , why ?
ngendae jyae kuiyandarika . ukasanga aragiye araiyandaritse ntanyuzwe n' uko ari , akuyemo n' iki ? akuyemo na sida . ||| because they are not happy with what they have , they say ; "@ i am an orphan who has no one to listen to my problems @" so , they go to the streets and involve themselves in prostitution and end up getting infected with hiv @/@ aids which in now an epidemic .
kuri iki kihae noneho uzi yuko nicyo cyorezo noneho kiteye . ariko uyo unyuzwe ukanyura n' ukuri ukanyuraw n' ubuzima bwawe , kuko byose byose biza buhoro . ||| but if you are happy with the little you have and are content with who you are , the rest will come slowly .
mu rwego rwo kuanzura , wunva icyagirira abanyarwanda , ||| what advise can you give to your fellow rwandans since , as you can see , your testimony will be kept ?
kuko urabona y' uko ubuhamya bwawe buzabikwa tukubwiye ko buzajyanaw muri archive national . ||| remember that we said we are going to keep your testimony in the "@ national archive @" it will be well kept and you will see it .
buzabikwa uzabureba nunagira amahirwe yo kuzagira abana , n' abana bawe baburebae n' abo urera baburebae , ||| if you are lucky to one day have kids , they will be able to see it , plus those you are looking after .
baumvae inama n' impanuro ubahaye , ukurikije ibyo unyuzemo n' inyigisho mbese ugiye ukuramo nawe kuburyo bitumye nawe utanga inama zihagije . wunva hari ikindi kintu ukaongeraho , ||| all will be able to listen to your advice , which , you have given based on your lifetime experience .
kishobora kuzagirair akamaro ku bazabureba ? ||| what other advice can you give that will be of help to those who will listen to your testimony ?
kigirair mbese ... mbese ubundi njyewe icyo nkaongeraho . mu by' ukuri n' uko abanyarwanda tuesae mbese tushyize hamwe . ni uko tureba ukuntu genocide itazaongera kugaruka mbese mu rwanda . ||| well , if all rwandans were united , we could find a way to prevent genocide from happening again in rwanda .
tukashyira hamwe mbese tukashakisha nk' urukundo hagati yacu , tukakundana , turangiza mbese urareba mbese intambara zaikunze kugenda ziza , ||| we should be united and love one another .
abacengezi , cyangwa iki ? ariko murareba ko bitangiye kugenda bigira kutae ? bioroha . ||| i believe you have noticed how wars have been intervening but lucky enough they are stopping .
ariko muby' ukuri , nrebye nbona amahoro nta kibazo . ubungubu , ikibazo twebwe ubundi tuba twifitiye , ||| in fact there is peace and security .

njyewe ubundi nkundaaga kubaan na sogokuru . ||| i only wanted to live with my grandfather ; my grandfather was the person whose company i enjoyed the most .
kubera ko mu bantu bose numvaaga nishimaiye kubaan nabo nbanaaga ... numvaaga sogokuru ariwe nbana nawe cyane . ku buryo n' amashuri nri nranze kuyiga nshaka kumusanga , ||| i reached an extent of refusing to go to school just because i wanted to stay with my grandpa .
nragenda nbana nawe . ||| i moved in with him and we lived together .
eh mu rugo bamaze kubona yuko ntahashaka kuhaba nshaka kuibanair na sogokuru , baranreka nbana nawe . ||| when my parents realized that i did n't want to live with them , they let me go to my grandpa 's .
kubera ko we yarafite inka , nkajya niriraanw nawe nragiye . ||| i was happy because he had cattle and i would spend the whole day with him grazing the cows .
nyuma akajya anbwira amateka ya kera , akampa exemples [ ingero ] z' abantu turi tuturanye n' ubu bamwe barahari , umusaza umwe arahari . ||| later , he started to narrate me stories of the past . sometimes he would give me examples of some of our neighbours who were still alive .
akajya atubwira ukuntu muri ... kuhera muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , ukuntu bazaaga bazaaga bakabasahura , bakabatwarair inka , bakabica , ||| he told me how in 1959 they would come and loot their properties ; take their cows , kill them ... kill their cows , sometimes eat them or take the rest .
bakica inka bakazirya izindi bakazitwara , amazu bakayasenya ariko kuica nk' umuntu ntabwo bibagaho , nago bakundaaga kubikora . ||| but during those days they did n't used to kill people , it was rare .
aka binbwira gutyo ampa urugero rw' umusaza umwe turi tuturanye witwa nshaka . ||| he used to tell it to me live ... !
n' ubu arahari ngirango n' intambara iba nyuma baje kumufunga , baraongera baramufungura kubera ko ashaje . ||| he also gave me another example of a man called nshaka who was our neighbour and i think he was arrested after the war and released because he was aged .
ubundi kwa ba sogokuru hakaba hari abandi bana ba ... b' abuzukuru ba nyi ... ni mushiki wa sogokuru abuzukuru be . ||| there were other children at grandpa 's ; they were his sister 's grandchildren . therefore , they were his grandchildren too .
nibo nkundaaga kuba ndi kumwe nabo , ||| they are the ones we used to be together .
umwe niwe ukiriho abandi bose barapfuye . ||| only one of them survived , the rest died .
niwe tuirirwaanaga ku muhanda tuikinair , ||| we used to play together on the streets .
ibyo nvuze ni ubuzima bwanjye bwa mbere y' intambara . ||| what i talked about is my life before the war .
ibyinshi nta nubwo nri nbizi njyewe kuko ni ... numvaaga ibinshimaishije ari ukuiragirair inka kusa , no kuirirwa nikinair ku muhanda . ||| i did n't know much , i was simply interested in grazing cows , eating and playing on the streets .
ikibazo ntikiumvikana . ||| q ...
yee , ||| yes .
ubwo ... nrabiibuka nraumva hari mu ... muri mirongo cyenda na rimwe [ 1991 ] , hagati ya mirongo cyenda na rimwe [ 1991 ] na mirongo cyenda na kabiri [ 1992 ] . ||| i remember it was in 1991 ... between the year 1991 and 1992 .
ubwo nri nvuye kuragira , ariko no muri icyo kihae nri nrwanye n' abandi bashumba , n' abana be b' uwo musaza mbese witwa nshaka . ||| i was coming from grazing the cattle , i remember i had fought with nshaka 's kids who were also looking after cows .
nraza kubera ko ngiraaga amahane anbajije icyatumye nrwana nabo , mubwira ko bakubise inka inkoni mu matwi . ||| when he asked me why i fought with them , i told him they had hit a cow with a stick in the ears .
bayibabaje nrwana nabo . ||| and when they hurt the cow , i had to fight them .
kuko ntabwo ... ntabwo turakirizaaga ... ntabwo tukubitaaga inka , ushaka uzikoraagaho gutya uzikabukira kugirango zigendae , ||| we never used to hit cows ; we would just caress them while saying soft words and the cow would go where you want it to go .
kuzikubita ntabwo bibaga ... ntabwo ukundaaga kuzikubita , nta n' inka zagiraaga amahane zabaga zirimo . ||| we never used to beat them because almost all cows were peaceful .
nrwanye nabo rero , ngeze mu rugo nbimubwiye , ahita anbwira noneho n' amateka ye , ||| so , when i faught and after telling grandpa all that , he decided to tell me all about his past .
ibyo ntabyo nrinzi icyo kihae . ||| i did n't know it then .
anbwira amateka ye , ampa urugero rw' ukuntu noneho bigeze kuza kubasahura , baje kubasahura mu nzu baanga kuyivamo , ||| he gave me another example of how one time they came to loot them and they refused to live the house .
uwo nshaka akaba yari afite igitero ayoboye icyo kihae , bahageze [ ndi kaumva yarabwiye ko muri cyo kihae ko hari mirongo irindwi na gatatu ] . bigeze mu rugo ababwira ko atari buvae mu nzu , ||| the same nshaka was leading thea group of attachers and when they reached our home ... i guess he told me that it was in the year 1973 ; they came to my grandpa 's house , grandpa told them that he was not going to leave the house .
ababwira ko bari buyimutwikiraemo . ||| "@ maybe you burn me inside @"@ , he told them .
noneho barangije batwara inka n' imyaka barayitwara , kubera ko yari yanze kusohoka , ||| therefore , they took away cows and his harvest since he had refused to get out of the house .
baanga kumutwika , inzu bayimusigamo baraigendera , ariko ibintu barabitwara . ||| they did not burnt him , they just left him there in the house and took everything .
kuva icyo kihae rero nnjyae nibwo numvaishije noneho nrushijeho kubaanga . kuko kuhera icyo kihae nnjyae na ... ntangiye kungana n' abashumba be , ||| from then , i started developing hatred towards them . i started hating even the people who were looking after his cows .
nkaumva ntashaka ku ... no kubaegera nbona n' inka yabo nkaumva nyikubita nkanayica . ||| i would n't want to come close to them and whenever i would see their cows , i would feel like hitting them to death .
icyo kihae hari nka ryari ? ||| when was that ?
icyo nbikora hari muri [ 1992 ] . ||| it was around 1992 .
kuki ukunda kubikora ? ||| why would you do that ?
njyewe ... ubundi njyewe nkundaaga sogokuru cyane , ||| i ... i loved my grandpa so much , i can not explain it .
ntiunbaza ngo ni iyihe mpamvu . impamvu nini igaragara ni uko njyewe yampaga liberte . ||| maybe because he used to give me total freedom .
hari ahantu haegereye noneho umuhanda wa kaburimbo , nkakunda kuigira ku muhanda . ||| there was a place that used to be close to the main road , i used to like sitting there at the road .
kandi akampa n' uburenganzira nkajya k wiragirira , mu kihae mu rugo ho usangaaga bashaka ko nirirwa mu rugo nicaye mu rugo . ||| and again he would let me graze the cattle while at home they would want me to just sitting there .
nta n' abandi bana bahabaaga muri ... turi tuturanye tuumvikanaaga ngo njyae kukina nabo . ||| yet there were no kids to play with .
ukasanga mbese nikundira kwa sogokuru kuko nbanaaga ariho nbonaaga hanshimaishije . ||| generally , i used to like my grandpa 's place . i was happy there .
sogokuru yarapfuye ? ||| your grandfather died ?
sogokuru ? yarapfuye . ||| my grandfather died .
noneho wowe ku bwawe imibereho ubona yarahindutse ryari , ||| from your point of view , when do you think change occurred in your life ?
ubonye ibintu bihindutse ryari ? ||| when did you notice the changes ?
njyewe , ubundi na ... niyo nbibonaaga gutyo ntabwo nmenyaaga ibyo aribyo , ||| i ... normally i did n't ... whenever i would see such things , i would never understand what it meant .
kuko nnjyae nrabiishimiraaga , ||| because i used to enjoy it myself .
nbonaaga interahamwe zije ... icyo kihae nta n' ubwo tuzaitaaga interahamwe . ||| whenever i would see the militias coming ... we never used to call them interahamwe .
kuko yari amashyaka za m.d.r. icyo kihae hari hariho m.d.r. ariko njyewe i shyorongi [ commune ] icyo nri nzi ni ... yari m.r.n.d , [ ishyaka rya politike ] niyo nbonaaga cyane kubera no kunima [ kushyushya urugamba ] bakaririmba cyane , mbese ni muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] ntangiye kumenya amashyaka icyo aricyo , impamvu ariho , ||| there were political parties such as m.d.r but at the time , in shyorongi commune , i only knew of m.r.n.d. because i would hear them animating , singing loudly ... it 's only in 1993 that i understood they were political parties and why they were created .
ariko nkaumva inkotanyi nkaumva ... nnjyae nkazifata uko babivuga . ntabwo nnjyae nri nzi ikibazo cyabyo . uretse ko icyo kihae bitangira muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] , ||| when i would hear of inkotanyi , i thought of them in a negative way because i believed what was said about them .
hajeho amashyaka , ||| i was not aware of what was coming next .
nibwo sogokuru yongeye kunbwira yuko bashobora kuba baongeye ya gahunda yabo , bari barimo muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , na mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] ; ||| in 1993 my grandfather told me they might have resumed their mission , the one they had in 1959 and 1973 . @"
noneho njyewe nkaumva ... nawe yari aziko ko ari nta muntu ushobora kuica undi . ||| i would think that ... he did n't think people would kill others .
akaumva ko ari bya binri byo kuza bakabatwarair inka , bakabasahura bakabasenyair amazu bikashira . ||| we thought it would be as usual ; taking cows , looting properties , demolishing houses and that would be all .
mbese nnjyae ntabwo nri nzi ko bino bintu bibaye muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] bishobora kubaho . ||| i never thought that the things that took place here in 1994 would happen . i was really surprised .
ni ibintu nnjyae bintunguye ntabwo nbizi . ||| i did n't have a clue .
bihindutse bite ... bitangiye bite muri za mirongo cyenda na gatatu ... ||| how did it start ? how did it start in 1993 ... ?
muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] i shyorongi , kuko ariho na rinri , turi tutuye muri quartier [ mu kacae ] imwe , urebye ni nka partie [ igice ] imwe ya serile , ||| in 1993 in shyorongi , i was ... we were living in one part ... it was like one part of the cell .
uko imiryango yacu ifitanye amasano yose yari ituye hamwe . ||| all our relatives were living in that area .
ariko ku muhanda hanyuraaga imodoka zivuye i gisenyi , mu ruhengeri , baje inaha i kigali . ||| there was a road from gisenyi and ruhengeri going to kigali .
bafite amabendera , bagenda hejuru y' amabisi ... muri quartier [ muri ako kacae ] nabwo harimo abantu , abenshi bari famille y' uwo musaza . ||| people would pass waving flags , seated on top of mini buses ... in our neighbourhood , there never used to be much people ... the only people that used to be there were that old man 's family .
kuko uwo musaza nawe yari afite famille [ umuryango ] nini cyane , ||| that old man also had a very big family .
ku buryo nk' uwabasha kuvuga ko serile yari ikizawe na famille y' abantu ... y' imiryango ibiri ntabwo ... ngirango ntiyaba yibeshye . ||| if one said that there were only two families in that area , one would be almost true .
usangaaga ari iyo famille [ uwo muryango ] abantu bose bafitanye isano n' uwo musaza witwaga nshaka , abandi bafitanye isano na sogokuru , ||| almost everyone was related to that old man called nshaka and the rest were related to my grandfather .
ukasanga ari ubwo ... ubwo bwoko bw' abantu kusa bahari ... ||| that was the only type of people you would find there .
iyo serile yari iyihe ? ||| which cell was that ?
ni nyarurama . ||| it was called nyarurama .
.... noneho nyuma , nkajya nbona abantu bajya muri stade y' i shyorongi harimo stade yitwa nyakabingo . ||| ... then later , i would see people going to shyorongi stadium , which was called nyakabingo .
bakabyinairyo , hakaba n' andi ma secteur yazaaga kakabyinairmo bakanywa bakataha . ||| even people from other sectors would go there and dance and drink and then later they would go home .
ariko nnjyae nragendaaga nyine nnjyae nkajya kuibyinair nkagenda ... nnjyae numvaaga binshimaishije . ||| me too , i would go there to dance because i used to like it .
ariko uretse yuko ... uko njyaagayo bakabona nbiishimaiye nbonaaga mu muryango nkabona n' ababiishimaiye na bamwe , ||| although i would go to dance , i could see that some people in my family were not happy with it .
nkabona harimo akantu ariko njyewe simbyiteho , ||| i would sense something but it would be so unclear to me .
simenye ibyo aribyo . bigeze muri ... nraumva icyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] aribwo amashyaka nyamenye neza . umwaka ujya kurangira , kuko icyo kihae nigaaga mu wa gatatu primaire , ||| later in ... 1993 when i really knew what political parties were . the year was ending , i remember i was in primary three and that is when i quit school .
mpita nreka kuiga nraiicarair nraiicarair nrabiihorera . ||| i just stopped studying .
icyo kihae hari hariho n' intambara , ariko yari itaragera ino aha , ||| i remember there was a war but the war had n't reached our area .
tuumvaaga ko ibera mu ruhengeri n' i byumba kusa . ||| we used to hear that there is a war in ruhengeri and byumba .
kuki uvuye mu ishuri ? ||| why did you stop studying ?
bon , jyewe aho nigaaga n' umwarimu utuigishaaga yari mwene wacu . ||| well at school , even my teacher was my relative .
ariko nkanga kukubitaw ... ngiye ku ishuri rimwe nraza nza nkererewe ankubise mpita nisohokair nva mu ishuli nraigendera . pu , ||| but i used to hate being beaten ... one time i went to school late , and when i was caned i just walked out of school and to hell !
mpita nvuga ko no kuiga nta nakamaro bifite , ||| i did n't see any importance of studying .
kuko na sogokuru ntiyari yarize . nawe kubimubwira nawe numvaaga nta kintu bimubwiye nnjyae kuiga mpita mbi ... nrabireka . ||| even my grandpa had never gone to school and when i told him about it , he never had any reaction .
maze kubireka mpita niicarair . ||| therefore , i stopped studying .
ndi kaumva nta ... kuva uwo munsi nta n' ubwo nongeye kusubira mu ishuli , ||| from then , i did n't go back to school .
nrisubiyemo nyuma y' intambara . ||| i went back to school only after the war .
usubiyemo muri mirongo cyenda na kane ikirangira ... ||| did you go back in 1994 , immediately after the war .
oya ngiyemo muri mirongo cyenda na gatandatu [ 1996 ] . ||| no . i went back in 1996 .
ikibazo ntikiumvikana . ||| q ...
ngiyemo ... nize umwaka wa gatatu 1995-1996 . ||| i went there ... i completed primary during the school year 1995-1996 .
ni iyihe mpamvu usubiye mu ishuri ? ||| why did you go back to school ?
nyuma banshubije mu ishuli kuberako babonaaga nta bunri buzima . kandi nta n' ikindi kintu nri kukora , ||| they told me to go back to school because they realised that there was nothing else i could do with my life .
si nri ndi umuntu mukuru ngo hari akandi kazi nkora , ||| i was n't mature enough to look for a job .
nraje nraiga nyine kugeza ubu . ||| i just went to school up to now .
nbwira ukuntu iby' intambara bya ... ubibonye utae muri 1994 wowe ? ||| tell me how the war ... how did you face 1994 personally ?
bon . intambara itangira , mbese njyewe ubundi nkundaaga abasirikare cyane . ||| well , when the war started ... personally i used to like soldiers very much .
yee , ariko ... ubwo ngubwo mu mezi ya mbere y' umwaka w' 1994 , nri nfite musaza wa mama wo kwa data ... wo kwa sogokuru wacu , mbese ni mukuru wa sogokuru . ||| but ... during the first months of the year 1994 , i had an uncle , he was my mum 's brother ; he was a son to the big brother of my grandpa [ in kinyarwanda , cousins whose fathers are brothers are considered as brothers and sisters ] .
yari yaragiye mu nkotanyi . ||| he had joined the inkotanyi army .
noneho abantu benshi bakajya baza bavuga ngo , ngo @: "@ imiryango yacu ngo harimo abantu bagiye mu nkotanyi , ||| many people used to come saying , "@ in your family , some people joined the inkotanyi . @"
" ariko nnjyae nkaumva inkotanyi nkaumva ari abantu babi , ||| even me , whenever i would hear of inkotanyi i would imagine that they were very bad people .
mbese nnjyae inkotanyi nkaumva ndazanze neza . ||| generally , i would hate the inkotanyi so much .
kuko bitewe n' ukuntu bazivugaaga numvaaga nnjyae koko inkotanyi zishobora kuba ari mbi . ||| due to the way they would talk of inkotanyi , i also would believed that inkotanyi were very bad .
noneho rimwe noneho tuje nijoro , nraraanye na sogokuru nramubaza nti @: « se kubera iki turi kukomeza kuihisha ? ||| one night we came back and while i was sleeping with my grandpa , i asked him , "@ why are we hidding all the time ? @" then he told me , "@ you remember what i once told you .
arambair ati @: « bimwe byose nkubwiraaga bibaye urya munsi , ubungubu nibyo baongeyeho , uretse ko noneho buno bifite ingufu . » ||| they have resumed it , but this time it is even worse . @"
mpita menya noneho ubwongubwo nyine ari ukusahura ibintu ; bakica inka bakazirair izindi bakazijyana bakasenya amazu . bon , ||| i immediately understood that the looting of people 's properties , the killing of cows and the destruction of houses was about to happen .
noneho bigeze nko ku italiki ya 12 z' ukwezi kwa kane . nibwo musaza wa mama uri ufite umugore ... yari afite umugore , w' umuhutu basaza be baraza baramufata , baramutwara n' abana babyaraanye , ||| well , around the 12th of april ... my uncle [ mum 's brother ] had married a hutu lady ... her brothers took her with her kids and said that the rest should be killed .
baravuga ngo @: « ubundi abandi bagomba kuicwa . » umunsi babafashe babajyanye bose . baje baba ... hahise haza igitero kiraza kirabatwara . ||| they took them all on that day ; a troop came and took them all .
ubwo njyewe nhise nvamo nraigendera . nrabacika . nigair i butamwa mu rugo . ||| i left for butamwa at home .
ngiye kureba y' uko ... nvuga nti hano buno ... ahangaha niko bigenze buriya iwa ... mu rugo nta kibazo . ||| i left thinking that maybe things were safer back home .
ariko mpageze ... noneho nkubaiswe n' inkuba mpageze nta muntu n' umwe nhasanze . nsanze inzu zirangaye . nrebye mu nzu nbura umuntu . ||| but when i reached there ... i was shocked . i did not find a single person there ; the house was widly open with no one inside .
hari nka saa kumi n' ebyiri . nshaka umuntu nramubura . ||| it was around 6:00 o'clock in the evening , i looked for them but i never found anybody .
mu kihae nki ... nrazamuka ngiye kwa nyogokuru kubera ko nanyogokuru turi tuturanye , mpageze nbura umuntu . ||| as i was still ... i went to grandma because it was not far from there but when i reached there i did not find anyone neither .
nraongera nramanuka . ||| i went back home .
kubera ko ari ku gasozi gutya nramanuka mpageze hepfo , ||| since it was on the hill , i had to descend .
niba ari abantu ... abantu bari ... niba bari hakurya , niba bari he ? simbizi , ||| i heard people , ... people who were maybe from attacking some place ... maybe they were across the hill ; i could n't tell where they were from .
bahita baza biruka . numva igitero cy' abantu ubwo hari hatangiye kwira . ||| they came running ; i heard a crowd of people and it was getting dark .
numvise abantu basakuza mpita nurira igiti cy' umwembe , niicarair mu giti . ||| when i heard people making a lot of noise , i climbed a mango tree and sat there .
ba bantu baraza bazenguruka inzu , bajyamo inberae , bashaka umuntu baramubura . ||| they came and went around the house and entered inside but they did n't find anybody .
noneho bahita batangira bavuga bati @: « ubu ngubu bagiye kuihisha bari bugarukae nijoro , cyangwa hariho abandi bantu babajyanye . » ||| then they started saying , "@ they 've gone to hide , they will come back in the night or maybe someone else has already taken them . @"
ubwo ngubwo nhise menya yuko wenda batarapfa . ||| from then , i got the confirmation that my people were still alive .
nravuga nti @: buriya ntabwo barapfa wenda hari ahantu bari . ||| then i thought , "@ they have n't died yet , maybe they are hidding somewhere . @"
mu kihae nkaicaye aho ngaho mu giti , nijoro hamaze kuba nka ... nka saa moya n' igice , n' inzara yari inyishe , mu giti harimo imyembe nifatair umwembe ndirair . ||| as i was still in the tree , at night , at about 7:30 p.m. ... i got hungry and started eating mangos .
nrangije uwa mbere nfashe uwa kabili , ||| when i finished the first one i grabbed the second one .
numva umuntu ari kuzamuka mu rutoki . ||| i suddenly heard someone coming through the banana plantation .
mpita ... noneho nrawureka ntaceceka ngo numvae . ||| immediately i ... i left the mango waited to see who it was .
ngiye kubona nbona ni nyogokuru uzamutse , ||| the i found out it was grandma .
noneho nramanuka nda ... nramusuhuza . ||| therefore , i came down the tree and greeted her .
arangije nawe agira ubwoba cyane ukuntu nba nkiriho , ||| she was very surprised to see me alive .
aranbwira ati @: « n' abandi barahari , » ||| and she told me that , even the others were still alive .
araza anjyana ahantu ... hari ahantu bacukuraaga gasegereti , mu myobo yo hasi mu butaka , biberaaga ... bagendaaga bakairirwamo bakaza nijoro baje kuryama . ||| then she took me to ... there was a place where they used to mine cassiterite , in deep holes and that is where they used to live ; they would spend the whole day in those holes and come out at night when they were going to sleep .
noneho ubwo ngubwo anyereka ahantu bari , nijoro ubwo ngubwo turaza turaryama . ||| after showing me where they were , we went home to sleep at night .
uwo munsi ... umunsi ukurikiyeho , tuje nka ... tugiye kugenda saa cyenda . kuko turazaaga tukaryama saa cyenda ... saa kumi , zagera tukahita tuongera tukasubira muri ya myobo . ||| the following day , as we were preparing to live at 3:00 ... in fact , we used to go home to sleep at 3 a.m. and then at 4:00 a.m. we would go back to the holes to hide .
ubwo ngubwo haza ... ako kanya bari bamenye ko tugenda tukihisha tukaongera tukagaruka . hahita haza urutero runini cyane , abantu bari barimo ni abantu turi tuturanye ahongaho . bo muri ... turi tuturanye muri iyo serile . ||| immediately they found out that we would hide and come back to sleep , a very big group of killers came , the people who were in that attack were our neighbours , we were living in the same cell .
baraza bavuza induru , barahafata ... baratuzenguruka , ||| they came and shouted .
noneho bamaze kutuzenguruka , bari bazengurutse inzu yose , ||| they surrounded the whole house and soon after all doors were open .
imiryango yari rangaye papa afata urugi ahita arukurukubitaho . arukinze bararukubita bose rugwa inberae ... kubera nri nfite mushiki wanjye w' ikimuga , ||| dad slammed the door and locked it , they hit it hard and it fell inside ... i had a sister who had been born lame .
ntabwo yagendaaga , yari yaravutse aremaye , ||| dad asked her if he could carry her , but she refused .
aramubwira ngo amuterurae bagendae aranga . yanze ubwo kubera tuesae bahise batufata baratusohora mu kihae akiburana nabo baramukubita arasohoka afata umwana amushyira ku bitugu . ||| and when she refused ... they had ordered us all to get out and while dad was still arguing with them , they beat him up and he just carried the kid on his shoulders .
nri nfite matera ku mutawe , mu kihae bari batangiye kutusunika batushyira inberae , bari kutubwira ngo batujyanae batuicirae hamwe n' abandi , ||| i was holding a mattress on the head , when they started pushing us forward , saying they were taking us to kill us with others .
ngo batushyira muri ... batubwiraaga ko ngo ari ukutujyana muri bus , batujyana arusha . ||| they asked us to choose between putting us in a bus and taking us to arusha .
ni gutyo nbiumvaaga njyae ntabwo nrinzi iyo bus icyo aricyo , ||| that is what i heard but i did n't understand which bus they were talking about .
numvaaga ko ari bus isanzwe . ariko nreba hafi y' umuhanda ahongaho nkayibura . bon , noneho turangije , ||| i thought it was a normal bus but i checked around and i did n't see any .
mu giye bakiri kuvuga ... bakiri kubafata babashyira inberae , ||| well as they were still talking , putting people in front , i slightly bent .
njyewe nhise nca bugufi , nri mutoya , matera isa nk' aho ... mbese nsa nkaho nryamye hasi matera injya hejuru . ||| i was very small , it seemed like i was sleeping under the mattress .
mpita nvamo gutyo matera nyisiga ahongaho nrairukanka . ||| then , i sneaked away and left the mattress there .
noneho bo bagira ngo ndi munsi ya matera , ||| they thought i was under the mattress .
nyuma nragenda mpita nihisha mubihuru ahongaho , matera barebyemo babura umuntu . ntibabiitaho baraigendera . birabashobera . ||| i went and hid in the bushes around and when they checked below the mattress , they did n't see anyone . however , they did not mind much about it , they just got confused and left .
kuva uwo munsi kugeza ubungubu , ntabwo ntigeze menya ukuntu babaishe . ||| until today , i do n't know how they were killed .
icyo nzi cyo ni uko nta n' umwe ukiriho . ||| but i am sure they all died .
barabatwara , bamaze kubajyana , njyewe mu mutawe wanjye nta kintu na kimwe ntekerezaaga , nri meze nk' igiti . ||| they took them and then ... in my mind , i could n't think of nothing , neither could i feel anything .
nihishe ahongaho nabwo ubundi nbona image [ uko nagushushanyiriza ] nkuha y' ukuntu nri meze . nraicara , ntatekereza hashize umwanya , hari nka ... hari hamaze kuba nka saa tanu z' amanywa , ||| while i was hiding there , [ i can not find the right way of describing how i was feeling ] i sat and thought for a while ... it was around 11:00 a.m. i got out of the bush because there were dogs passing all the time , trained to search for people during the day .
nvamo muri icyo gihuru , kuko hari imbwa zairirwaaga zihiga abantu ku manywa . nragenda njya mu mwobo umwe tuirirwaagamo , bigijeje ni mugoroba nka saa moya , ||| i went into a certain hole where we used to spend time and in the evening , at around 7:00 p.m. i left the hole .
mpita nvamo . nravuga ngo @: buno ubwo hano babajyanye , buriya kwa sogokuru usanga bahari , ||| the i thought , "@ if they took my whole family at home , maybe at grandpa 's they are still there .
barikujya kuihisha bakaongera bakagaruka . ||| maybe they hid and came back to sleep . @"
noneho mpageze , nhageze nijoro nabwo bwenda kucya nka saa kumi , saa cyenda n' igice gutyo , nsanga nta muntu n' umwe uhari inzugi barazikuyeho , ||| when i reached there ... i was very dark almost in the morning , it was at around 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. i found nobody at home [ his grandfather 's home ] and the house had no doors left .
nshakisha umuntu nramubura , ||| i looked for people but i could n't find anyone .
nreba ku muhanda ... njya ku muhanda nshakisha umuntu nramubura , ||| i checked at the road ... i went to look for them at the road but i did n't find them .
mpura n' abasirikare bari kuigendera . ||| i met soldiers walking around .
noneho hakaba hari umukobwa uri utuye i shyorongi witwaga francoise ubwo yari mutoya nawe uretse ko ubona ari mukuru . ||| there was a lady called francoise who lived in shyorongi . she looked older than her age .
haza umusirikare araambaza ati @: wowe nturi musaza wa francoise ? ||| a certain soldier asked me , "@ are n't you francoise 's brother ? @"
nrikairiza . ||| i said "@ yes i am . @"
ahita anfata aranbwira ati ... anbwira yuko francoise ari inshuti ye . ||| then he took me and said that francoise was his friend .
noneho aranfata turajyana tubana nabo mu basirikare , ||| he took me and then i went to live together with the soldiers .
noneho barangije barabafata abasirikare bose bari ahongaho babajyana i jari . hano kuri ... kuri fm [ entenne ya radio ] . ||| later , all the soldiers who were there were taken to jari , where there is a radio antenna .
mpageze nraje nbana n' abasirikare , noneho nbona ... nri ntarabona umuntu yica undi . ibyo byose nbonaaga ari akavuyo bigenda bigenda gutyo , ||| i continued to live with soldiers but i had never seen people being killed ; i thought it was just chaos and that things would change with time .
nta muntu nri nkabona yica undi , noneho mu gitondo bazana abantu ngo n' abatutsi ... kuko ubaw mbere nbona umuntu apfa ni umukobwa bafashe bamukata na bayoneti bamukata gutya iki ikingiki [ ijosi ] kirasama , amaraso atakara hasi . ||| the following morning , they brought other tutsis people ... the first person i saw being murdered was a lady whom they got and cut with a bayonet ; they cut her neck open and blood spread all over .
ngira ubwoba nnjyae , ||| i was so scared ; it was my first time to witness murder .
nibwo bwa mbere nri nbonye umuntu apfa . ||| i had never seen her before .
yapfuye mureba uwo mukobwa ntinri muzi , ariko ni uwo ijari na n' ubu ntinmenya izina rye , nmubonye gutyo uretse ko n' ubu nba nreba image [ ishusho ] ye . ||| she was living in jari but up to now i do n't know her name . i just saw her there but i still remember her today .
nyuma , noneho bakajya baza kubera ko hari hariho urugamba hari inkotanyi , bakaza bakafata abantu ... interahamwe zairirwaaga mu kigo abasirikare bari inberae barimo kurwana , ||| the war went on , the soldiers were fighting against the inkotanyi in the hills .
zikazaan abantu zikabicira munsi y' ikigo , ahantu hari ikibuga cya jandarumeri . ||| meanwhile , the interahamwe would take local people and kill them in the camp just where there is a football field that used to belong to the state police .
habaagamo ikibuga cya jandarumeri . noneho hari abantu bazanye , nrabiibuka ari ni mugoroba , amavuta bari baohereje yo kuteka ... yo kutekair abasirikare . ||| one evening some cooking oil was brought for the soldiers .
baravuga ngo nta mpamvu zo kuyateka , ngo nta mpamvu zo kurya neza , ngo mubyeyi wabo yapfuye . bafata za ngunguru barazi ... ba ... bafata ingururu batekaagamo zose barazicanair , ||| then they said that , there is no logic in eating good food while their father has died [ president habyarimana ] .
bashyiramo amavuta . noneho bafata abantu bakajya babanaagamo batoya . abafite taille ntoya bakaba aribo banaagamo . ||| then they filled several drums with oil and put them on fire .
bagashya , gutya bakajya bakufataaga bakakujugunyamo ureba . noneho nyuma kuko nbirebaaga , ||| then they would choose the short tutsis and dump them in it and burnt them alive .
ngira ubwoba . ||| i was terrified !
mpitamo ngewe kuigira inberae aho urugamba ruberaaga icyo kihae . ||| therefore , i decided to move forward , towards where the war was taking place .
mpageze naho kubera ko ntabwo nri nkamenye kugenda nryamye hasi nk' uko nbonaaga abandi babigenzaaga , abo turi kumwe bose nkabona amasasu arabakubise barapfuye , mpitamo kuisubirair inyuma nbona ntacyo . ||| when i got there , i did n't know how to move on my stomach like i would see others doing ... when i saw some of the people i was with being shot dead , i decided to go back .
noneho mpageze , icyo hari abana benshi bagiye baturuka mu miryango y' ahongaho hafi ahongaho bakacikair mu gisirikare , ||| when i got there there , i found so many kids who had come from their homes in the neighbourhood to join the army .
haza interahamwe zije kubareba . noneho zikagenda zijonjoramo abana bose barimo , nnjyae banfatamo . banfashemo , ||| then some interahamwe came to investigate on all the kids . they picked all the kids , me included .
wa musirikare kubera ko yari ahari , bagiye kututwara , ||| since the soldier [ who had taken me there ] was there , he talked on my behalf telling that i do n't come from that area when they were almost taking me .
avuga yuko njyewe ntavuka ahongaho . barangije bavuga ko njyewe mpavuka ko banzi . ||| then some people said that i was born there , that they even knew me .
icyo kihae nrabiibuka ko harimo interahamwe imwe yavuze ngo ndi umuhungu wa kayiranga . kayiranga uwo nguwo ntinmuzi . ||| i remember there was a certain interahamwe who said that he knew me that i was kayiranga 's son but i did n't know who kayiranga was .
noneho arangije aravuga ati @: « bankuye i byumba , inkotanyi ziraishe ababyeyi banjye , ko mbese natoraguwe n' impunzi . ||| he told them that they got me from byumba when the inkotanyi had killed all my parents , and that the refugees had taken me there .
bahita bankuramo , abo bana bose barabajyanye . ||| immediately they took me out and took the rest of the kids .
ariko harimo umwana umwe ubacitse , uretse ko nawe nta mahirwe yagize yarairukanse aho yanyuze mines ziramwica . ||| one kid escaped them but unfortunately , he took off through a place full of land mines and they killed him .
abandi nabo barapfa . nyuma y' ahongaho nraje nraza ... hari ahantu hari akabande hagati hari ahantu hari akabuga ... ||| and all the rest were murdered .
... kameze nk' akabuga uvuye mu kigo , ukagenda ... mbere yuko ugera kuri ziriya antenne , hari harimo ikibuga . ||| then i left ; there was a small court that was next to the camp before you reach the antenna .
bafata abantu bari bahafataiye , babatwikira aho , kuko bo babamennyeho essense baratwika bahagaze . ||| all the people who were caught were burnt there ; they would pour petrol on them while they were standing and they would burn them .
ahantu bigishirizaga interahamwe imbunda . ||| that was the place where they would train interahamwe how to use guns .
abandi noneho barababwira ngo bafatae amapiki hafi y' a ... hari ahantu umukonseye yari atuye tuhitaaga kwa konseye , ||| they ordered others to use pickaxes . next to that place is where the local counselor was living ; we would call it ‘ at the counselor 's . @"
ubwo niho yari atuye ntinri muzi , numvaaga ngo ni kwa konseye . ||| but i did n't know him ; i just used to hear that it was at the counselor 's .
barabacukurair ucukura umwobo umara kugera kushyika uko ungana ukajyamo bakarenzaho igitaka . uri muzima . ||| they made people dig holes ; once one would dig a pit of his or her height , he or she would enter into the hole and they would just put soil above when someone is still alive .
noneho bigeze hagati kubera ko harimo abana baturutse i byumba b' abahutu , bamaze ku ... baravuga ngo njyewe ntabwo ndi umuhutu ndi umututsi barabinshinja . ||| meanwhile , some hutu kids who had come from byumba accused me of being a tutsi .
bajya kuzana interahamwe nijoro , kubera ko bagiye ... babivuze bari mu madirishya ndi kubiumva ko bagiye kuzizana . ||| i overheard them saying they were going to call the interahamwes to come and kill me . they went to call them [ the interahamwes ] at night .
mpita nsohoka . nsohotse banyirukaho n' izindi nterahamwe ziraza zinyirukaho , ||| in fact , i overheard them saying it through the window .
nrairukanka . ngeze ... ndi hafi kugera hafi y' aho inkotanyi zari ziri n' abasirikari ba ... tubanaaga , hari amazu y' uwo mugabo ngo yari konseye w' i jari , ninjiramo . ||| i immediately run away and when i got in the middle of where the inkotanyis and the soldiers i was with were fighting , i sneaked inside the house of the ‘ counsellor ’ of jari .
ninjiyemo nsanze ari intumbi kusa zipakiyemo mu buzu , abantu bagiye bica . ||| when i got inside , there were dead bodies all over the place , that 's where they were keeping them .
nbura aho njya mpita njyamo ... nfata ... njyamo hagati nirenzaho abantu bapfuye . ||| since i did n't have anywhere else to go , i hid in the middle of the corpses .
nbura ... uko nrimo ahongaho baraza , ||| when they came , they could not see me .
bafungura bakasanga n' intumbi zibereyemo bakaongera bakakinga . uko bi ... uwo munsi ndi kaumva nramazemo amasaha agera nko kuri ane . ||| then they closed the door and went . i spent about 4 hours lying down with those corpses .
amasaha ane ashize nibwo nvuyemo numvise ntamuntu ukikoma , nvamo nraza . ||| then i decided to leave the house after realizing that it was calm .
noneho nguma hafi y' aho ... aho abasirikari barwanairaga niho nhise nguma , hafi ya terrain , ||| i stayed in the area where the soldiers were fighting . i would hide at the frontline .
aho barasairaga nnjyae akaba ariho nguma . ||| and that is where i was staying .
hakaba hari umukecuru uri uhari haruguru y' aho bari baranze kuica . nmunyuraagaho , kuko hari ahantu tusoromaaga amatunda , n' ibigori n' ibisheke , ||| there was an old woman they had refused to kill ; i used to see her whenever we would be going to harvest fruit , maize and sugarcane .
nkamuzanira nawe nkahanyura nkahita nbimanura nkabijyana ahongaho ku ... aho barwanairaga . ||| i would always take some to her before i would take them to the soldiers .
uwo musaza nawe ... uwo mukecuru bamwishe hashize ... hasigaye iminsi ibiri ngo tuhavae . ||| they ended up killing her two days before we left the place .
nyuma ahongaho nraza bafata ... kubera ko inkotanyi zari zirafunze inzira izana ibiryo mu kigo ; ||| in that area the inkotanyi had blocked the roads used for taking food to the soldiers in the camp .
ibiryo bibuze , amasasu abuze , bafata decision yuko tuhava . ||| when they realized they could no longer get any food or bullets delivery , they decided to leave .
mu gitondo tuiriwe ahongaho nta muntu urasa , ni mugoroba nijoro bigejeje nka saa mbiri , baratubwira ngo tugende . turamanuka wa musirikare umwe uri warampfashe , ||| the following day , we spent the whole day without hearing any shooting until 8:00 p.m. when they told us to leave .
yari afite igikapu kiuzuye amafaranga . bya bikapu bya gisirikare avuga yuko ayo mafaranga , ||| as we were going the soldier who had taken me with him had a bag full of money .
ayashyiriye francoise uwonguwo uwo mukobwa mbese ubaga i shyorongi . ||| he said he was taking it to francoise ; i mean the francoise who lived in shyorongi .
arangije turamanuka kubera ko ariwe uri uri inberae afite imbunda , ||| since he had a gun , he went in front of us then i followed him .
ageze inberae tugwa mu kicae cy' inkotanyi niwe zabanje kurasa arapfa . ||| we bumped into the inkotanyis and he was the first one to be shot dead and everyone else was killed .
bose barapfa nrebye inyuma nbura umuntu nrebye inberae nbura umuntu , ||| i looked around but i could n't see a single living person , they had all died .
ntinri mpazi nsigara njyenyine none niicarair hasi , kugira nbanzae ntuze menye ahondi n' ahariho . ||| therefore i sat down to try and pull myself down as i did n't even know where i was .
arangije mu kihae nkaicayemo ahongaho , haza ikamyo y' abasirikare bagiye ... bajyanye amazi mu kigo ruguru , bahita babona nicaye muri borodire . ||| then ... as i was still sitting at the roadside , a military lorry , which was taking water to the camp , came .
baambaza impamvu mpicaye kandi bantumye kare . ||| they saw me sitting there ; they asked me why i was sitting there yet they had sent me a while ago .
umusirikare avamo aranbwira ngo ninurire imodoka tujyane nba nbacitse gutyo . ||| then a certain soldier got out and told me to enter the car . that is how i escaped them .
noneho mu gitondo baza kuta ... kuvuga yuko na ... hari umu ... ahongaho nba ko umuryango ujyae wose upfuye , kandi ko ndi umututsi nnjyae bibaza impamvu nba mugisirikare . ||| then in the morning they came and said that my whole family had died and that i was a tutsi too ; they were wondering why i joined the army .
bamaze kubimenya mpita nbahunga mpita njya mu mpunzi . ||| when they found out details about me , i escaped them and joined the refugees .
ngeze mo ... icyo kihae kubera ko ... nanze kujya mu mpunzi zivuka ahongaho , nhise njya mu mpunzi mu zaturutse i byumba . ||| when i reached there ... because i had refused to join the refugees whose origin was shyorongi , i joined those from byumba .
mpageze kubera ko zatangiye kunbaza ukuntu ... ubundi aho nturutse , nbabwira ko nturutse i byumba , ariho iwacu , kandi ko papa na mama ari inkotanyi zabaishe zibakubise udufuni . ||| when they started asking me where i was coming from , i told them that i was coming from byumba and that the inkotanyis had killed both my parents using clubs .
icyo kihae hari harimo abagore barankunda cyane , banfata neza , ||| some women liked me very much and treated me so well .
noneho ngenda mu mpunzi zigenda i byumba . ||| then i joined the refugees who were heading to byumba .
hanyuma ubwongubwo ubwo twagendenaga nazo , nibwo tuje kugera inberae mpura n' umugabo umwe , noneho ukomoka i butamwa . avuga ko anzi . ||| i left with the refugees from byumba and some time later , i met a man from butamwa who said he knew me but i denied it .
avuze ko anzi ndamwihakana , akajya anbwira ngo @: "@ nturi uwo kwa kanaka , nturi uwo kwa gatsimbanyi ? @" ||| he insisted saying @: "@ are n't you gatsimbanyi 's son ? @"
nti ashwi da , nti na gatsimbanyi simuzi . ||| "@ which gatsimbanyi ?
ngo none se ngo @: ||| i do not even know me ! @"
"@ ntabwo uturuka i butamwa , ngo ntabwo iwanyu ari mu ruriba ? @" nti @:@ oya , ||| "@ are n't you from butamwa , in ruriba ? @" "@ not at all ! @"
nrabihakana . ||| i went on denying it .
noneho umugore umwe turi kumwe ahita avuga ngo @: "@ murabeshyera uno mwana ngo ni uw' i byumba , ngo n' iwabo barabaishe ngo n' inkotanyi zabaishe . @" mbese nabo bari barabiemeye , ||| then one of the ladies who was with me defended me and explained to him that i was from byumba and that both my parents had been killed by the inkotanyis .
baranfashe nk' umwana wabo . ||| they all believed it was true and they treated me as their child .
turajyana tugeze ku ... ndi kaumva turageraanye ku mupaka , niho ntandukanaiye nabo , ||| we went on together ; i think we reached the boarder together .
nrababuze . ngenda ngendair mu kigare gutya n' abantu ntazi ahantu bagiye , aho bajyaaga ntinri mpazi , nibwo bwa mbere inzira ntabwo nri nzizi . ||| that is where i lost sight of them , they disappeared from the crowd . i continued walking with people i did n't know , i did n't know where we were going , it was my first time to take that route .
ngeze mu nzira , mu nkambi ahongaho ahantu bari bakaambitse nicaye ku muhanda , haza imodoka bafite amazi . ||| when we reached the way ... in the camp , i was sitting by the roadside and there passed a lorry carrying water .
noneho nfata amazi nywaho ayo mazi narayanyweye numva arimo umunyu mwinshi . nibwo bwa mbere narinkweye amazi arimo umunyu , ||| i drunk a bit of it but it tasted too salty ; i had never taken salty water before .
mu nda hararya mpita nrwara diarrhee [ kuhitwa ] . noneho iyo modoka ni aba ... ni iya croix rouge , noneho babonye nrwaye baranfata bashyira mu bitaro byabo , ||| i developed stomachaches and got diarrhea . it was a red cross car so when they noticed that i got seriously sick , they took me to their hospital .
nyuma baza kunbaza famille yanjye aho iri nrababwira nti @: ntabahari . ||| later they asked me where my family was and i told them they were n't there . @"
umugabo umwe uje nreba afite isura mbi , anbajije nramubwira ngo iwacu inkotanyi zirabaishe bose . ||| a certain man came and asked me about my family , because he looked ugly , i told him that inkotanyi killed them all .
noneho aranfata anyandika muri liste y' imfubyi , bajyana mu kigo k' imfubyi cy' i ndushu . kiri kiri muri ... kiri kiri i goma [ kongo ] , ||| he then added my name on the list of orphans and they took me to the orphanage at ndushu , in goma @-@ congo drc .
nbamo , nyuma noneho nvamo , ||| i lived there but later i left .
kuko nje kuandika ibaruwa nyinyujije muri croix rouge , iraza igera kuri mukuru wa mama yigishaaga hano ku muhaima . ||| i wrote a letter , which i sent through the red cross to my aunt who was a teacher here at muhima .
noneho nawe aranyandikair anyohereza n' ifoto , barayizana bahita banzaan , ||| she replied me and sent me a picture .
mpageze ubwo ngubwo ntangira kuiga . ||| they took me there and i started studying .
ariko kuva uwo munsi , nta n' umuntu nigeraaga nbwira uko ubuzima bwanjye uko buba ... uko bunbayeho ibyo nzi , nta n' umwe nigeraaga nbibwira . noneho mpageze , ||| throughout , i had never told anyone about my life or about what i went through ... in addition , no one had ever told me that my family was killed .
kuva uwo munsi nta n' ubwo nigeraaga numva yuko mu rugo baba barapfuye . mpita nongera noneho nrabacika , njyayo ku manywa , njya kuhairebair . ||| therefore , i disappeared again and went there during day time to verify myself .
mpageze nsanga ni ibihuru , nta n' inzira ubona , ||| when i got there , it was even hard to find the way as almost everything had been covered by grass !
nragaruka . ntinigeze nbabwira aho ngiye , nbabwiye ko nri ngiye kukina kusa . ||| i just went back home but i never told them where i had gone , i just told them that i had gone to play .
noneho nraje niicara murugo , ||| so , i just sat there at home .
murumuna wa papa yabaga hanze , nyuma yaho nza kubona na mushiki wa papa uri urashatse umu ... yari yarashatse umukongomani . aba ariwe nbana nawe , ||| my uncle was in exile and later i even saw my aunt [ my father 's sister ] who was married to a congolese .
niga primaire nrayirangiza ; nyirangije ninjira muri secondaire . ||| i lived with them until i completed primary school and joined secondary .
kuko narayitsinze njya muri leta njya kuiga mu biimaan [ kitaarama ] . ||| i passed well primary and joined a government school "@ byimana @" in gitarama .
mpageze kubera ko nibwo bwa mbere nri ngiye muri societe y' abantu , ||| it was the first time i was living around people of my age .
tungana benshi ubona ko abenshi tuziraanye . kuko abenshi bari abanyeshuri tuvanye ku bigo bimwe , uretse aho ngaho mu kigo nbanaagamo n' abana batoya cyane , ||| besides , we were almost all knew each other because the majolity had come from the same school .
n' abandi ari bakuru ; noneho hajemo umuntu umwe , hari umunyeshuri umwe turaraanaga antuka kuri mama . antutse kuri mama ntabwo biigeze binbabaza narisekeye . ||| of course some were younger than others . one day , one of the boys in my dormitory insulted me about my mother .
noneho ninjoro nbitekerezaho . ||| when he did , i did n't feel anything at the moment , i just laughted .
ubwenge noneho butangira kutekereza gutya gutourna [ kuzenguruka ] ntekereza ibya kera , ntekereza uburyo nriho . ||| but at night i thought about it , it was as though my brain was widening ; i recalled the past , i thought about my current life and i started asking myself why or what i was struggling for .
nibaza ikintu ndi kuruhair nreba inyuma nkabona nta murumuna wanjye nfite , nkareba nta papa , nta mama , ||| i thought , "@ i have no sister , no brother , i have no father , no mother . @"
nkabona ndi kuigira ubusa . kuko icyo kihae nrabiibuka , ||| i did n't see why i was studying !
nabyi ... nbirayemo , nbiirirwamo , kuiga ntabwo nigize niga , niriwe mu ishuli nka ... nimereye nk' igiti , ||| i remember that time , i never slept and the whole day i was thinking about that ; i did not study that day , i was in class but absent minded .
nkabona , kuko uwomunsi nmaze nk' amasaha atatu hanze bansohoye kubera ntianditse na notae . ninjoro ngiye ku buriri , umutwe uranrya . ||| i remember i spent about three hours out of class ; i was chased out of class because i was n't taking notes .
nanirwa kuryama , nrabyuka , nraongera nraryama , banvugaishije birananira , ||| when i went to bed that night i could n't sleep , i could n't talk .
njya kuvuga bikananira . kuvuga birananira neza banjyana mu bitaro i kabgayi , nabo birabananira . nje , ||| they took me to kabgayi hospital but it was all in vain .
banzanye mu rugo , banjyanye kwa muganga , baranbwira bati @: "@ nta kibazo ufite . @" ||| they took me back home ; at the hospital they said i did n't have any problem .
kuko nbashaaga kuandika ariko simbashe kuvuga . icyo kihae nmaze amezi atandatu ntavuga , nandika kusa . ||| i spent six months without talking , i was used to communicate through writing .
nibwo nje kujya hariya muri tromatisme [ ikigo kivura ihahamuka ] , ||| that is when i was taken to the trauma centre .
aba ariho nkorera nabo , nbanje no kukorana n' umugore witwa esther umwe ukoreraaga muri avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba jenoside ] nyuma y' amezi atandatu nibwo nongeye kaongera kuvuga . ||| i even started to work with esther who was with avega .
no kuiga , ahongaho mpita mpava , ||| i was able to talk again six months later and i went back to school .
nigair kuri apace . yee . kugeza ubungubu ni gutyo . bijyaaga bigaruka ariko ubungubu , ||| but i shifted from byimana to apace .
kubera ko nyuma y' aho nibwo ... biongeye kunbaho nibwo muri traumatisme banbwiye bati @: "@ uzajyae ugerageza kuganira n' abantu , ubabwirae amateka yawe nabo bakubwirae ayabo , bizajya bigenda bishira . @" ||| the situation continued like that up to when they [ trauma centre ] advised me to be in the habit of talking to my friends and telling them my story , vice @-@ versa .
ariko kubera nta muntu n' umwe wo muri famille , nta n' umwe nigeraaga nizera kuganira nawe , urebye muri famille [ umuryango ] yanjye yose nta muntu nvuga ngo yabaye mu ntiambara . ||| i usually do n't talk , not even to the members of my family ; but this is because they have never seen a war . there is none i can say that he or she knows a war .
nta muntu n' umwe wigeze ubona yica undi , ||| none of them has ever seen a person being killed .
n' ababonye intumbi ni bakeya , bazibonaaga ku matereviziyo . ||| even the few who have seen dead bodies just saw them on tv .
uraumva ko nta muntu n' umwe nba numva ko nganira nawe , ngo numvae hari ikintu azi , ||| that is the reason why i believe there is nobody i can talk to about such stories because i believe they do n't know a thing .
niyo mpamvu . ||| that is the only reason .
hari aho utubwiye ko ugiye mu basirikare , icyo kihae winjiraga mu basirikare ho umazemo igihe kingana iki ? ||| there is apoint you mentioned that you joined the soldiers . how much time did you spend with them ?
icyo kihae nmazemo iminsi ibiri , ||| i stayed there for two days .
kuko jyae numvaaga nshaka kureba aho barashisha imbunda nta kinri numvaaga kinshimaishije , ||| i just wanted to see the way they used a gun ; i enjoyed it .
ariko mpageze numvaishe yuko abantu bari kuica abantu , ||| when i reached there , i found out that some people had been commanded to kill others .
kandi nti ... ari n' itegeko , nravuga nti ubona no kwa sogokuru nabo bari bubicae mpita ntahagaruka . ||| when i thought that they could even attack my grand father 's place , i immediately left .
kwa sogokuru ntibari bazi aho uri ? ||| at your grandfather , did they know where you were ?
nta kintu nigeze nbabwira baranshatse barambura , kuko nje bara ... baraumiwe baambaza iyo nri ndi . nrabibabwira ariko nta kintu bigeze bantwara . ||| i did not tell them anything , and when i came back they asked me where i had been , i told them but they did not say a thing .
ikibazo ntikiumvikana . ||| q ...
icyo gi ... mbese nahavu ... nhavuye ndi kuvuga nti @: buno iwacu hari amahoro . kuko nbonaaga yuko ubuzima turimo , nbonaaga bianze bikuze ko bagomba kutuica . ||| i left that place knowing there was peace at my place , i knew that one day they would kill us because of the way they were moving with their machetes , they all had new machetes .
kuko ukuntu bazaaga bameze byonyine n' imihoro , bose babaga bafite imihoro mishyashya . uwo musaza witwaga nshaka niwe ubikaaga iyo mihoro . ||| nshaka was the one to keep the machetes .
bajyaaga kuyifata iwe . ||| so , they used to pick them up from his place .
harimo abahungu be , harimo n' abahungu ba mukuru ... ba murumuna we benshi cyane . mpita mpava rero , njya ... uri kaumva ko aribwo ibyo bintu byose bije kuba , ||| his sons , his younger brother 's sons [ nephews ] and his older brother 's sons [ nephews ] were all killers .
nabwo ngezeyo nkabona naho nta kigenda . icyo kihae nibwo nmenye ko ubwo hose ariko bimeze . ||| that is when i realized that the situation was similar everywhere .
ugiye n' iki . uteze imodoka ? ||| how did you go , in a car ?
oya ngiye n' amaguru , ||| no , i left by foot .
kuko nhavuye mu gitondo kare mpagera saa kumi n' ebyiri ... saa moya . ||| i left early in the morning and reached there at around six or seven in the evening .
ntiuri ufite ubwoba se bwo kugenda , cyangwa hari uko wihishe ? ||| were n't you afraid of walking or there was a way you would hide ?
icyo kihae mu muhanda hari abantu benshi bavuza induru , abenshi bajya kuhiga abandi , ariko njyae nta bwoba nbaga nfite ngendaagamo gutyo , nta muntu wigeze antangira mu nzira , ahantu ntinyaaga kunyura ni kuri bariyeri kusa . ||| at that time there were many people on the road screaming while hunting for people but i did n't fear anything at all because i could walk anyhow and no one stopped me , though i feared roadblocks .
hari ryari ? ||| when was that ?
nhoraaga ntekereza ... kubera ko nbanaaga ... mukuru wa mama tubanaaga ntabwo ari ... ntabwo ari uwo kwa sogokuru neza . mbese ba sogokuru bari bava inda imwe . ||| i used to think about the way i was living , i was staying with my aunt [ my mother 's older sister ] , they were n't real sisters but their fathers were brothers .
afite abana babiri , undi aba hanze . ||| he had two children and one was abroad .
nbona uburyo baigamo n' uburyo nnjyae niga , nkabona njyewe nta kintu kuiga bimaraiye . ||| whenever i would compare the way they study and the way i study , i would find my studying useless .
kuko nrazaaga ngera mu rugo muri vacances [ ibiruhuko ] , nkabona abana ... ... araje uko yishimaiye umwana we siko anyishimaiye , ubundi ibyo ntakibazo . ||| i would go home for holidays and when the others would come , they would be received in such a warm way !
ariko nka tekereza ese njyewe nshobora kuishimira ... kushimaish nde , ninde nshobora kuishimira nkamubura mbese . ukasanga mu mutawe wanjye ibyo ... nicyo kintu kirimo , kaumva ko nta kintu jyewe nimaraiye . ||| it would leave me wondering whom i live to make happy and who could ever make me happy !
binzirika mu mutawe kandi nta ... n' umuntu nbonaaga nganiraaga nawe , mbese tuvugaaga ibintu bisanzwe by' ubuzima bw' ahongaho bw' ako kanya . nta yinri gahunda nbaga nrimo nbona ... ntabwo nigeze nbona umwanya wo kuvugana n' umuntu n' umwe , ibintu bierekeye na jenoside . ||| there was none and this really troubled me a lot .
kuko n' aho muri traumatisme [ ikigo kita kubahahamutse ] aho nri ndi , ntabwo nigeze nbabwira ibyinshi , ibyinshi ngiye nbibabwira nbabeshya . nta muntu numvaaga nshaka kubwiza ukuri . ||| because i had no one to talk to and whenever i talked to anyone it was just the usual things but i could n't talk about things related to genocide because of being traumatized and in case i talked it was only lies , i never felt like telling anyone the truth .
ugeze muri traumatisme [ ikigo kita kubahahamutse ] niho utangiye kuvuga ? ||| did you start talking at the trauma center ?
yee , icyo kihae ... nibwo ntangiye kuvuga ariko ... icyo kihae nkoresheje bic [ ikaramu ] . noneho ibya bic , banbwira ngo tubivaeho , ||| i started talking from then , but at first i used to use a pen and later they told us to stop writing and they started persuading me to try and talk .
baaka bagenda banyumvaish ukuntu ngomba kuvuga , bikaza gahoro , ubundi barabwira bati ujyae ukora sport , noneho sport nyikora cyane . ||| at times they also would tell me to start doing sports .
noneho kino kibazo cy' umugongo nibwo kitangiye no kuzaho , icyo kihae nta nubwo ntekerezaaga ko ari n' iyo mpamvu wenda baba barankubise mu mugongo . mbese ... numva ari ibintu ntakwaiye kubabwira , nrabiihorera nanga kuirirwa nbibabwira byose . ||| i over practiced sports , which has caused me backaches , though i think it may be because of the beatings during the war .
ibyo banbajije akaba aribyo nbasubiza , baambaza ibierekeye n' intambara nkababwiramo bike , ibindi nkanga kubibabwira . ||| basically there are things i would n't feel like revealing and i could only answer what they asked , in case they would ask me about the war , i would briefly reply and keep the rest to myself .
utangiye kubivuga byose ryari ? ||| when did you start telling it all ?
ntangiye uno mwaka kubivuga , kuko ibya mbere ntangiye kubivuga ejo bunri . ||| it is this year that i started talking about it ; i recently said it for the first time .
n' ubungubu tuvugana harimo byinshi nba ngiye nsimbuka . ni byinshi ntiibuka . kuko nko kubiandika nabwo biranvunnye . ||| even right now as i am talking , there are some information that i skip , because there is much that i forgot .
harimo ibyo nanditse byoherejwe hariya i mudende [ universite adventiste ] . ||| even writing was n't easy ; there were some information i wrote and sent it to mudende [ adventist 's university ] .
nraanditse umunsi wa mbere , nanditse page ebyiri , nvuga ngo ejo nzaongera nandikae , ||| the first day i wrote two pages , hoping to add on the following day .
ngiye kwa ndika noneho haza ibindi ... noneho nashobo ... nbona chaine [ umurongo ] kuzana imwe , kugirango bigendae kuri chaine [ umurongo ] imwe nbona ntibishobotse . ||| when i sat the following day to continue , i had a lot to write but it was not flowing in order .
nfata decision [ icyemezo ] yo kufata umunsi umwe wo kubiandika . ||| therefore , i decided to leave everything and get a whole day to prepare it .
nntukura umunsi woseee ... nanditse , amapaji umunani , nrekera aho ngaho . ||| that day i wrote eight pages .
kuri uwo munsi nibwo ntangiye kugira ... kuzajya nbivuga . kubiandika ; nibwo ntangiye kubyamndika . ariko impamvu yatumye nbiandika , ||| and from that day on , it is when i started talking about it ... writing about it .
ni ukubera ubuzima bwanjye njyae ... nitekerejeho . kubera hari ... muri ‘ traumatisme ’ nibo baangiriye inama , barabwira bati @: "@ uzajyae ugerageza kubiivanamo ; ||| and the reason as to why i was trying to do this is because at the trauma center they had advised that in order to overcome it i must try and talk it out or even cry .
kubiivanamo uzajyae ugerageza ubiganiraeho n' undi muntu . kuko banbwiraaga ko nshobora ... cyangwa nkihangana nkarira , ariko mu buzima bwanjye ntinjya ndira , ||| but in my whole life i have never cried .
ahubwo umwanya wo kurair , ||| instead of crying , i can n't talk .
kuvuga birananira . kuko n' iyo tugiye hariya nko ku gisozi , akenshi abandi mu kihae bari kurair njyewe , akenshi ntabwo njya nshobora kuvuga . ||| whenever we go to gisozi , while others cry , i just can n't talk anymore .
niyo mpamvu iyo ngiyeyo nreba umuntu tujyana , noneho tukajya tugenda tuvugana . kugirango bitaza kuncika , nkashiduka binaniye kuvuga . ||| that is why whenever i go there ; i get someone i can keep talking to in order to avoid loosing my speech . but still i find myself quiet .
ubungubu nibwo ntangiye ku ... ejo bunri nibwo ntekereje , kubera ko nbana na murumuna wa papa . ||| i live with my dad 's younger brother .
kubera kutaumva uburemere bwa jenoside . niba ari ukutabwumva ... niba hari ukundi kuntu abifata simbizi . nk' ubu mu kuiga kwanjye niga ... niga nbijyana gahoro . ||| recently i was asking myself if my uncle understands the seriousness of genocide ; i wonder if he does n't know the heaviness of genocide or if he has a different perception about the genocide ... i do n't know .
iyo nize cyane , ||| currently ... i do n't stress myself with studies .
nshiduka no kuvuga binaniye . ||| because whenever i read a lot , i find myself in a position whereby i can n't talk .
noneho nkajya nbijyana gahoro , ||| afterwards when i come back home he shouts at me .
nza akaba arantutse ngo nta kuntu ngo ushobora kugira mirongo itanu [ 50 % ] ngo nshaka mirongo irindwi [ 70 % ] ngo abe ariyo ngira . ||| saying that i should get 70 % not the 50 % i manage to score .
kugira ngo nzabimubwirae nawe ntabwo ... n' ubungubu tubana ntabwo azi uko nshobora kuba nrarokotse . ||| i have never told him ... i guess he does n't know my past and how i survived .
ntazi n' ukuntu bigenze , no murugo ... niba hari n' ubimubwira amubwira igice kimwe , ntawe ubizi mbese . nawe ubwe agenda gutya ntacyo azi . ||| by the way , if he knows my story , he knows just a little bit of it .
nibwo ntangiye kaumva yuko kutagira undi muntu nbibwira , ko ari ubujiji bwanjye . ||| that is when i started realizing that keeping it silent is being stupid .
mpitamo kuzajya niandikair , ||| therefore , i decided to start writing .
nbona hari umuntu wo ‘ traumatisme ’ nkapfa kuganira nawe ho bikeya nawe . ||| and when i am able to get the counselors from the trauma centers , i tell them some things , which relieves me .
nk' ubungubu hari ibintu usimbutse ... hari ibintu utaigeze utubwira nk' ubungubu ? ||| even now there are some things you skipped ... is there some information that you did not tell us ?
yee , ||| yes , there are some things that i did n't tell you .
harimo byinshi nta ... bikeya ... nk' ubungubu ntinigeze nbabwira nk' ukuntu ... hariho ubwo nigeze kufata decision yo kuiba imbunda , nyuma y' ahongaho igihe nri nvuye i jari . nibye imbunda baranfata , ||| there was a time i stole a gun the time i left jari .
barankubita , ||| they found me and i was beaten .
ariko nbaumvaish yuko nshakaaga nnjyae kuyifata ngo numvae ukuntu imbunda imera , ||| when they asked me , i told them that i just wanted to hear how a gun feels like .
ariko ntabwo ariyo objectif [ intego ] njyewe numvaaga nfite . ||| however that was n't my real intention ; i wanted to take it and use it to kill the old man nshaka . and i was ready to face any punishment .
kuko numvaaga nfite objectif [ intego ] yo kuyifata , nmara nkaumva nkahita njya kurasa uwo musaza witwaga nshaka kusa , bashaka bakahita bankoresha icyo bashaka . ariko icyo kihae ntinigeze nbigeraho . ||| but i was so unfortunate because i did n't succeed .
mbese urebye ... jenoside ni gutyo njyewe nyibabwira nta kunri . ||| generally that is what i can tell you about the genocide .
kubera iki ? ||| why ?
impamvu , numva ko umugore ashobora kuzantaish igihe ... kuzatuma ngira ubuzima bubi . ||| i believe a woman might waste my time .
ntekereza yuko nramutse ngize amahirwe y' ubuzima bwiza , nkabona umugore ubaye imfu ... utafite papa we na mama we , ||| she might make me unhappy .
bose bapfuye muri jenoside , ariwe nbana nawe . kuko iyo ntekereje urugero @: ukuntu ngana , ||| however , i believe if i am lucky , i 'll come across one whose parents were killed in the genocide .
nkatekereza abantu jenoside yabayeho bariho , igihe nzajya kushakira umugore nkaumva bose bazaba bafite abagabo , n' abatazaba batafite abagabo bazaba ari bakuru cyane . ||| however , i think it will n't be possible because all those orphans of the genocide will be married before i will be in position to marry and those who may be still single will be too old for me .
nkaumva ko bizansaba kushaka umugore utazi na jenoside icyo aricyo . nbana nawe nbona nka papa we aje kumusura , cyangwa mama we , cyangwa barumuna be , cyangwa basaza be . nkaumva nabyo ibyo bintu bizantaish ... bizamungabanya mu mutawe , nkaumva yuko nbireka . ariko na none , nkaumva yuko nshaka umugore kugira nzabonae umwana uzajya mu mwanya wanjye mbese . mu muryango iwacu ntihagirae umuntu ... ntiwibagirane , ukazajya uhora wibuka yuko , nubwo jenoside yabayeho uwo muryango w' i ... iyo jenoside yabayeho uwo muryango uri uyirimo . ni gutyo nbitekereza . kuri avenir [ ejo hazaza ] wanjye . ||| i would n't want to marry someone who does n't know anything about the genocide . and when we will be living together and i see all his family members visiting us , it may confuse me . in the end i end up not thinking of getting married though at times i consider getting married so that i could have a child to replace those who died and to restore the memories of those we lost .
urashaka kuzakora iki ? ||| what would you like to do ?
ku bintu kukora , ubundi ntekereza ko nrangije kuiga , nshobora kuzashaka ibyo kuikorera . ||| i think after completing my studies , i 'll be self @-@ employed .
kuko ntabwo njya ntekereza n' umunsi n' umwe kugira umuntu nkorera . ntekereza ko nramutse nbonye uburyo nshobora kurangiza kuiga , nkagerageza gusha ... gucreya [ kuihimbair ] imishinga nkikorera ku giti cyanjye . ariko icya mbere ntekereza ni by' ubuhinzi n' ubworozi nkagenda kubishyira mu matongo yo mu rugo . ||| i want to make a project and it will involve agriculture and cattle breeding , which will be based at my now deserted home .
noneho ubwo uzaiga agricole [ ubuhinzi ] ? ||| that means that you want to study agriculture ?
oya , kuiga agricole [ ubuhinzi ] byo ntabwo bishoboka . kuko nk' ubu niga comptabilite , ||| i can not study agriculture because i am studying accounts .
mbese mubyo niga ndi kaumva kugira ngo nzajyae kufata iyo faculte nabwo bitarii ... nibyo nvugaaga ko wenda faculte nzafata ni management . ||| i think i will do "@ management @" at the university .
ariko n' ubwo ntari ... atari agricole [ ubuhinzi ] nbonye moyen [ ubushobozi ] byose nbikora nizera ko bishoboka . kuko mu mutawe wanjye numva ko ibyo byose bishoboka . ||| but if i get a chance to study agriculture , i will do both since i feel i have it on my heart .
nk' ubu wibaza ko umuryango wawe cyangwa famille yawe mu kihae kizaza , ubona jenoside izaba ari iki ku muryango wawe ? ||| when you think about you future family , what do you think genocide will mean to them ?
noneho abacamanza bantegeka kujya ngo kureba i.p.j. , ngo mubwirae ankorerae dossier . ||| afterwards the judges told me to see the prosecutor and tell him to make me a file .
nragiye noneho arangije arabi ... kubera ko ibyinshi bari babianditse baraongera baraandika arangije aranbwira ngo azabatumaho abandi ... abenshi bari mu rugo batafunzwe . ||| when i reached there , i found that he had written most of the things , although he rewrote them again .
umwe yari na responsable , ||| then he said that the court would call them , since most of them were not imprisoned .
ngirango n' ubu aracyari responsable . maze kubivuga , arangije aranbwira ngo nzagarukae ari kuwa gatatu . ampa n' isaha aranbwira ati @: ||| and one of them was a local leader who is not imprisoned up to now .
"@ saa tatu . @" nri nfite igare rya sport , nrizaho nrijeho nsubiye yo manuka bantera amabuye . abantu banteye amabuye ntabwo nri nbazi . ||| they told me to come back that wednesday at 9:00 a.m. i used a bicycle i had and while sloping down on my way back i was stoned by people i did n't know .
nkata igare nsubira inyuma . nsubiye inyuma , nrebye inyuma nbona abantu banyirukanseho . igare nraita hasi . ||| therefore , i decided to go back .
[ abo bantu ntinbamenye ] . nraitaye hasi nirukanse , nbona imodoka iturutse inyuma , mpita ntahagaga . ||| when i looked back , i saw a group of people running after me .
yari ... yari i toyota ya ba ntuza ya ardi . irahagara abo bantu nrababwira , nbabwira ukuntu abantu bari banyi ... bagiye kunyicira hano mu nzira . barangije baraza baranfata bashyirairmo iryo gare , ||| i went off the bicycle and started running , leaving it behind .
turajyana , n' abantu bahita basubira inyuma bahita babura ... turababura . kuva uwo munsi kugeza na n' ubu , ibierekeraanye n' ayo madossiers simbizi . ||| luckily i saw a vehicle and stopped it .
ntinzi ahantu bizanagarukair nrabiihoreye , ku buryo n' umwe muri ... muri bo uri urimo , [ muri babanri bari banyihakanaye ko batanzi ] nawe yarafunguwe yabaye umwere mbese . ||| i told them my story and then we went back , picked my bicycle , but the people who were chasing me were nowhere to be seen .
kubera ko abamushinjaaga , bose baransinzwe mu rubanza . njyewe ubwo ntinigeze nhajya , ntinzi n' ukuntu bigenze mbese numva ko yafunguwe kusa . ||| since then i never went back to follow up with the cases and in fact one of them was freed claiming that he is innocent because all who were accusing him were defeated in court .
mbese ibierekeye n' urubanza , nta muntu n' umwe tuvuga ko muri famille uba yara ... baba baraigeze baraburanaish bavuga yuko yaba yaragize uruhare rwo kubica . kandi umwe aracyari na responsible , kugeza na n' ubu nta kingombaw nshobora kujya kuhaka . ||| but personally i never went there and never even bothered to follow the proceedings .
n' ibyangombwa nigairho bya f.a.r.g. njya kubiaka i shyorongi , kubera ko bo baranzi nta kibazo naho mpafite . ariko i butamwa , kuba ariho nvukair ntabwo ... n' ubu ntinhakandagira . ||| most of the killers are still free in butamwa and one of them is a local leader , up to now when i want to look for farg documents i no longer go to butamwa instead i go to shyorongi because i also know the place very well .
kuva intambara yarangira usubiye i butamwa kangahe ? ||| how many times have you gone back since the war ended ?
ubwo iyo nshuro yari iya kabiri . ||| that was my second time .
ubwo ngiye yo gatatu kubera ko ubaw mbere ngiye yo ngiye kureba ko batapfuye . kuko numvaaga ko bahari kandi birarangiye . ||| which means i went there three times . the first time i went to see if there was anybody who survived as i believed they were still alive yet they all had died .
ubaw kabiri njyayo , ngiye kureba irangamuntu , aribwo njyaagayo nkasangayo urubanza . ||| the second time i had gone to look for an identity card and that is the time when i found a case .
ubaw gatatu buri ubwo nri ngiyeyo nyine ngiye kureba igisubizo , kubera ko bari banbwiye ngo nzagarukae kuwa gatatu . ||| and the third time is when i had gone for a reply because they had asked me to go back on wednesday .
nabwo ntabwo nigeze mbikurikirana nabwo nhise nigarukair . ||| however , i never followed it up , i just came back .
uvuye muri zairae ryari ? ||| when did you come from zaire [ congo drc ] ?
muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] , mu kwezi kwa mbere . ||| i left zaire in january 1995 .
umazeyo igihe kingana iki ? ||| for how long were you there ?
nmazeyo amezi nimba ari nk' atandatu ... atanu . ||| i spent there about five or six months .
ikibazo ntikiumvikana . ||| q ...
uretse ko umuntu yaba atekereje nk' umwana aramutse avuze ngo @: ||| it would sound childish if someone said that the elders should be removed from the world .
"@ abantu bakuru babakuraeho , hasigaraeho abana . ||| because if the old people were taken away , there would remain only children , which is not good .
nabyo ntibishoboka . nraumva ko kugirango avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' abanyarwanda ibae nzima , ni uko uubyiruko ruri kuzamuka gutya , nirwo umuntu yaheraho yigisha . ||| for a better future of rwanda , they should educate the coming generation .
kuko nk' iyo umuntu yiga aba ... iyo umwigisha ukamuha exemples [ ingero ] nyinshi araumva . ||| because as they study and you give them a lot of examples , they understand better .
uretse ko , aba ari na ... ari nawe wa mbere uba uwa mbere kubiica , ||| however they can even be the first ones to disobey .
ariko iyo abiumvaishije aruta ba banri bari ha ... bataigeze bagera mu mashuri . ||| but when they have heard about it , they are far better than those who never went to school .
numva aribo bantu umuntu yakuigisha . naho bino byo kugenda babaigisha kubabarira kusa , njyewe numva umuntu yabaigisha imvo n' imvano yabyo , ||| i guess they are the ones who should be sensitized . instead of teaching people how to forgive only , they should teach them the origin of everything , and the cruelty of it all .
akabaigisha ububi bwabyo , noneho umuntu wese akaumva ko agomba kugira ishyaka , ryo kaumva ko ibyo bintu byose bitagomba kubaho . ||| then everybody will feel concerned in stopping such acts from happing again .
wunva ari iki uzaigisha abana bawe ? ||| how do you think you will train your own kids ?
njyae numva nta mwana wanjye uzaba ... ni ngira amahirwe nkamugira . numva nta mwana wanjye ntuma agira iyo ... yinjira muri iyo cas [ muri ubwo buzima ] . ||| if i will be lucky to have children , i would n't want them to live that kind of a life .
kuko numva ko mu bintu byose bigomba kuzabaho , ngomba kuba aribyo nbanza kumwigisha . ||| because i believe that if there is anything i have to do for them first , is to teach them about those things .
kandi nkaumva ko umwana wanjye n' iyo nba ndi umukire kutae , atareraw n' umukozi . ||| i also believe that , even if i am very rich , a housemaid will n't be the one to take care of my children .
numva ko ari njyewe uzamwirerera na mama we . ||| i think their mother and i are the ones who need to raise them . in case their mother will be working , she shall quit her job and first raise up the children .

cyane cyane bajya bakunda kuvuga ngo ni umwana urushya ; urwaragurika , kuko nnjyae ngo nararwaraguritse , ||| i was told myself i used to be very sickly .

nibwo nri nkikikora ntegereje resultat [ ibisubizo ] , nibwo amahano rero yo muri mirongo 1994 yabaye . ||| level 8 had been removed . therefore i was waiting for my results but unfortunately enough that is when the catastrophes of 1994 started .
ubwo nawe urabiumva niko nvuga ubuzima bwanjye bw' ubwana . ||| i guess you too can imagine how my childhood was .
uko wibuka hagati ya 1990 na 1994 , uko ubibonye ni ryari utangiye kubona ko hari ikibazo ? ||| when you try to remember between 1990 and 1994 , when did you realize that there was a problem ?
yes , uraumva ubundi mu rwanda kera mbere y' intambara , haba ... , nkubu nkatawe tuigaga secondaire , ||| yes ... long ago in rwanda , that is before the war ... especially those of us who went to secondary school we used to study the history of rwanda .
cyane cyane burya umuntu wize yagize chance tunabyigaaga tuigaga amateka ... amateka y' igihugu cy' u rwanda ; batubwira mbere y' umwaduko w' abazungu ; bakatubwira nyuma y' umwaduko w' abazungu , ndetse batubwira ... bakatubwira no muri icyo kihae cya mbere y' intambara , ||| we were taught about life in rwanda before the coming of the whites , after the coming of the whites and life before the war meaning how rwandans leaved before the war .
uko turi tubayeho icyo kihae . aho niho bavugaaga ... icyo kihae abantu bari bafite power bari abahutu ; ubwoko bw' abahutu , ||| during that time , the hutu were on power .
mbere y' intambara ni nabo bari bafite ubutegetsi , ||| even before the war , they were the ones in the leadership of the country .
ukasanga ikintu bimiraije inberae bakaerekana ububi bw' umututsi , mbese nizo nyigisho zari zigezaweho babanzaaga bakaerekana uko umututsi yategetse mu bwami . ||| their main goal was to teach how tutsis were bad . generally that was the main lesson . people were first shown how the tutsi used to lead during the monarchy .
barangiza noneho bakajya baerekana mu mayeri uko ... ububi bw' umututsi . ||| then based on that , people were convinced on how bad the tutsi are .
ni muri urwo rwego nkuha nk' urugero ukuntu batangiraaga bati @: "@ tubarae nk' abatutsi bari mw' ishuli . @"@ ||| i could give you an example related to this @: they used to count the number of the tutsi in class , i would be asked to stand up in class .
bakakuhagurutsa wenda uri nk' umwe cyangwa muri babili , ||| sometimes there was only one or two tutsis in class .
ukaumva isoni zirakuishe ukatangira kuibaza byinshi . ||| i felt so ashamed and i 'd easily ask myself many questions .
ubwo nraibuka ko ... , jyae papa yakoraaga ahantu baitaaga i riraima ... i riraima kuri prison ya riraima . ||| i remember my dad used to work in a place called ririma , he was working at the ririma prison .
niho cyane cyane ninaho nbaye ubuzima bwanjye bwo mu bwana . ||| i lived in ririma when i was young .
noneho muri1990 , 1991 , 1992 , igihe ... igihe bavugaaga ngo inkotanyi ngo zateye , ||| then in 1990 , 1991 and 1992 a rumor spread that inkotanyi troops had invaded the country .
numvaaga amakuru y' iwacu za nyamata iyongiyo baratangiye kutwika amazu . ||| i heard that in our home village [ nyamata ] people 's houses were being burnt . the burning of houses used to be the first sign whenever there was a problem of tribes in this region . then the same acts started in ririma too .
niho batangiraiye , ||| normally in bugesera , it seemed as though people were bewitched .
ho iyo ikintu kikomaaga kaerekeraanye n' ubwoko , ||| even when they heard that people were being killed ... i was lucky because i was living at the prison and the supervisors protected us . there were times when at the ririma prison everybody was scared that the inkotanyi troops were coming to take control of it .
batangiraaga kutwika amazu . ||| i remember that time we spent the night outside ; we could not sleep in our houses . then the local people started killing each other ; we could hear that hutu are killing tutsi .
ntawe , aho nbaga i riraima biri byara ... ubundi u bugesair bwose wagirango buri bwararozwe naho tuumva ko abaturage batuye .. , kuko njyae nbaga kuri prison nizo mana zacu turinzawe nba surveillants , kuko hari n' igihe prison y' i riraima yigeze kugira ubwoba ivuga ngo inkotanyi baraza kubohoza kuri prison y' iririma . ||| i was so lucky to be protected , by then i was at the prison , and nothing bad happened to us .
icyo kihae turara ... ntanubwo nraye mu nzu icyo kihae twebwe turaye hanze ; ubwo nibwo wunvaaga mu kacae k' abaturage bicana ngo abahutu barikuica abatutsi . ni amahirwe ngize kubona nri nrizawe nri ndi ; nri ndi aho kuri prison ntacyo bibashije kututwara , ||| later things cooled down .
bigeze igihe birahosha . ni ukuvuga ngo nab' inyamata tuza kaumva amakuru ko bahungiye kuri ... ku kiriziya , ||| we heard that nyamata people hid in the church .
uwo babashije kuica baramwishe , ariko abandi bahungira ku kiliziya , barabarinda , ||| however some were killed on their way to the church but those who managed to escape and reach the church were protected .
igihe kiza kugera basubira mu ngo zabo . ariko babatwikiye amazu , ||| after sometime they all went back to their homes , most of them found their houses burnt .
ba ... ndetse harimo abo baishe , abasubiye mu ngo zabo bagafashanya bakaongera bakasakara utuzu tw' utugonyi twa kinyarwanda , bakaongera bakatura . ubwo ni uko bigendaaga . ||| some people had already been killed , those who went back home could help each other and construct huts [ rwandan traditional houses , made out of sticks and grass ] .
ni ukuvuga ngo bugesair tuhoraaga tuiteguye muri make , tuiteguye ko tugomba kuhigaw , ||| generally in bugesera we were always ready ; we knew we were being hunted and that at any particular time , we would all be killed .
cyangwa kuicwa isaha n' isaha . ni ukuvuga ngo nta buumvikanae nbonaaga hagati y' umututsi n' umuhutu bahoraaga bameze nk' ingwe , cyangwa i pusi n' imbeba niko nbigereranya . ||| i had never seen hutu in good terms with tutsi . they were like leopards and ... or cats and rats all the time . that is how i could compare the two clans .
ubibonye ryari ko ari ikibazo ? ||| when did you realize it was a big problem ?
ubundi ikibazo n' ukuhera muri 1990 , 1991 , ||| well , all problems began in 1990 , 1992 .
ariko aho ntangiye kuvuga nti @: ak' umututsi karashobotse ni muri 1994 , ||| but it was in 1994 when i realized that any tutsi was in trouble . in 1994 the situation got worse .
niho ibintu biri birakomeye nraibuka ko papa yari yarabonye pansion ( ikiruhuko cy' izabukuru ) kera , tusigaye tuba i nyamata noneho , aho baitaaga secteur kayumba , icyo kihae niko bahitaaga secteur kayumba . ||| i remember my dad had retired several years before and we were living in nyamata , which used to be called kayumba sector .
niho ntangiraiye kubona ibintu bihindutse koko , niho nhumutse kuko ubundi muri 1990 , ||| in nyamata i saw the real change that had occurred ; that is when i opened my eyes .
1992 basaga nk' aho bari baratuhumye amaso . ni ukuvuga ngo turahungaaga , tuhungira kuri commune cyangwa kwa padiri ( ku kiliziya ) , ||| because from the year 1990 to 1992 , it seemed as though we were blind ; those days , we could flee and just go to the commune or to churches and the priests could protect us and then we could go back to our homes .
bakaturinda tukasubira mu ngo zacu tukaumva ko nta kibazo , ||| therefore , we never thought it was a big problem .
bakakomeza baducengacenga gutyo . ariko aho tuje kubonera ... aho nje kubonera ko ukuri ari ukuri , ni icyo kihae kishyira 1994 , ||| but in 1994 , i finally accepted that the facts the way they were .
aho konseye ... konseye w' iwacu secteur kayumba , yakoresheje inama ( yari umututsi ) . ndetse ... noneho akoresha inama aravuga ati @: "@ ngewe basigaye bampisha mu manama ya leta , ||| that is when the councillor who was also a tutsi held a meeting and said , "@ i am no longer invited in meetings that are held on behalf of the government .
ati @: iyo bagiye kukorana inama za leta ntinkijyayo , ||| therefore , i do n't attend government meeting .
ati kusa muitegurae ko akagiye kutubaho , kabaye ! ati bibinri mwamenyereye kujya kuhungira i nyamata , ati muirindae ntihagirae umuntu uzigera ajya kuhungira i nyamata . ||| but be ready we are in danger ; stop that habit of fleeing towards the commune or to nyamata church .
ati niho ibi bintu byose bigiye kuzaba ( kuko we yari umuyobozi yarabibonaaga , ||| this time the killings will start from those areas . all i can advise you , is to be ready and face what is going to happen here . @"
yari umukonseye ) , ibigiye kuzaba byose bizaba biturutse hahanri mwahungiraga kuri komine , mu ma kiliziya niho bizaba biturutse . ||| because he was a leader , he had spied and got that information .
ntihagirae umuntu uzaibeshya ngo ajyae kuhungira i nyamata , ati @: "@ muzirwanaeho mupfae mwiruka ariko ntimuzagirae mutae ? ||| "@ all the plans for killing that are going to take place are made in the nyamata commune , in churches ; they all have the same plans @"@ , he added .
ntimuzahungirae i nyamata . @" ||| he warned us that no one should make a mistake of going to the former hiding places .
naho ngewe iyo nama niyo urebye nhumukaiyemo , kuko umuntu burya iyo umutegetsi ; iyo akubwiye ikintu burya aba akizi koko . aho niho ntangiye kaumvira ubwenge , ||| i learned a lot in that meeting . normally when a leader says something of that sort , it means that he is sure of it .
n' ubwoba butangira kuza , ||| then i grew up in my way of thinking and was so scared .
nti koko kashobotse . ||| that is when i really saw how much i was vulnerable .
aho ni muri 1994 mu ntangiriro ? ||| was that in the beginning of the year 1994 ?
mu ntangiriro ! mbese intangiroro za genocide z' itsembabwoko , muri uko kwa kane ; ||| in the beginning ... at the beginning of the genocide and the massacre , it was in april , the early days of the month .
mbese kukitangira . kuko nkubwiye ... ntiangiriye ubundi amakuru y' i nyamata cyangwa aho muri secteur kayumba . ubundi secteur kayumba cyangwa u bugesair , ||| i began with the information concerning kayumba sector or bugesera .
nibanze muri nyamata , nibanze muri kanyenze yari nk' indiri ni nk' indiri y' abatutsi hari hatuye abatutsi benshi cyane ; ni ukuvuga ngo icyakorwaga kibi muri gouvernement , habanzaaga u bugesair . ||| i mean i am starting from what took place in nyamata , kanzeze because in those areas there were so many tutsi .
bakatwikirwa , bakaicwa , mbese niho hambaire genocide yahitaaga ibanza gufrequa ... kugera . ||| whenever there could be any conflicts in the country , people in those areas could be in for it ; houses were burnt , blood was shed , in brief those were the target areas for genocidal acts .
uko bigenze rero @: ni ukuvuga ngo habanje kuba icyo baita ihigaan , ihigaan noneho bukacya , bucya ukajya kubona ukabona ku musozi ... ‘ ubundi kayumba ntinzi ukuntu njya nbaha urugero , ||| so , what happened , first there was what one could call ‘ hunting ’ , the following day , one could see at the hill ... [ i have failed to get a better way of giving you examples ] normally there was a hill where we lived , that hill was called kayumba .
hari umusozi umwe uwo musozi niwo nri ntuyeho witwaga kayumba hakaba n' indi misozi iyo misozi yitwa za ... za murama , secteur murama secteur mwogo , secteur muyenzi . ||| then there were other hills called murama sector , mwogo sector and muyenzi sector , which sectors surrounded kayumba .
zikikije kayumba iyo kayumba rero niyo yaririmo abatutsi benshi , kurusha ayo amasecteur yanri yose . ||| and tutsis resided in kayumba more than in other sectors .
’ noneho bucya ukajya kubona bakabona amazu atangiye kukurumaan , bakibaza , ||| then in the morning , one could see houses in flames and one would wonder .
abantu bakuru kuri twebwe bakajya bibaza bati kashobotse , bati batangiye kutwika . ||| but the grown ups would vulnerably nod and say that there was no alternative , that we were going to be exterminated since they [ hutu ] had started with their habit of burning houses .
konseye araturwanya cyane , aratubwira ati @: « ntihagirae uzahungira hehe .. ? i nyamata ; ||| the counsellor once again warned us from fleeing towards nyamata .
ahubwo mumanukae mujyae ku mipaka y' ayo masecteur . ||| instead , he advised us to go to the boarders of those sectors and our sector .
[ icyo kihae habyarimana yari atarapfa ] mujyae ku mipaka , ||| by then habyarimana had not yet died .
muboroke , mukingaire interahamwe ziza muri iyi secteur yacu . » ||| so , the counsellor advised us to go to the boarders between our sector and the neighboring sectors and prevent our sector from the interahamwe who were coming in .
kuko secteur yari irimo abahutu bari barimo hari harimo nk nkamawe ; tubiri .. tubiri .. , dutatu gutyo , utwo duhutu turitoratoranya tuvamo tujya muri ayo masecteur yanri ; ||| there used to be few hutu in our sector about two or three and they even left later on and joined other sectors .
noneho na ba batutsi bari mu masecteur , baza muri secteur yacu kayumba , ||| then other tutsi who were in other sectors came to our sector kayumba .
ni ukuvuga ngo @: secteur kayumba iba nk' indiri y' abatutsi . bigenda bite rero ? noneho , ||| therefore , kayumba sector became a sector of tutsi only .
ubwo tutangiye kurara amarondo , ||| what came next is that we started patrolling at night in our sector .
hari ubwoko bw' iwacu [ aho muri iyo secteur kayumba ] bwitwaga abamerae , nnjyae ubu ndi umumerae . ||| there was a clan in kayumba sector , which was known as abamere which i am a member of .
abamerae ni abantu babaga bafite inka , mbese turi tufite inka ; ahomuri bugesair kayumba tubaga tufite inka , kandi bazi ikintu baita umuheto , ||| this is a clan that used to own many cattle in the whole of bugesera @-@ kayumba .
kurasaan n' umuheto . noneho ni ukuvuga ngo iyo kayumba rero tukirinda tukazenguruka secteur yacu . ||| people in that clan used to be good at using bows and arrows . therefore , we could guard our sector by moving around in our sector .
tubaga tutandukanaijew n' ibibaya , ||| at different boarder with other sectors , there was a swamp .
ayo masecteur atandukanyaijew n' ibibaya tukamanuka nrabiibuka nnjyae nri ndi umwana n' ubwo ntafataaga umuhoro baratubwiraaga ngo icyo umuntu afite abe aricyo amanukaan . ||| this swamp separated our sector from other sectors . i remember i was young but i could carry a machete . we were told that one should carry whatever weapon they could get .
nkafata amabuye tukamanuka , tukirinda , tukarara amarondo ahangaho . ||| sometimes i could get stones and we could descend down the hill and patrol the whole night .
noneho , mbere habyarimana ataranapfa bakajya baza bashaka kuegera secteur yacu ngo baze batuhigae tukabasubizayo . uko bigenze rero habyarimana agize atya , ||| that was before habyarimana 's death . the perpetrators would attack our home village but we would defeat them and send them back . and then habyarimana died .
hari mu ijoro ryo ku ... ku .. mbese bucya ari kuya gatandatu , ku tariki ya gatandatu , ||| it was on the 6th at night .
nibwo ninjoro ... turi turi ... njyae nri nsubiye mu rugo ni njoro , nko mu ma saa moya saa moya n' igice gutyo ; ||| that night i had gone back home at around half past seven in the evening .
kuko iyo uri iwacu mu mbuga y' iwacu uba ureba kanombe amatara y' i kanombe , ||| someone standing in our home compound could see the airport 's security lights [ kanombe airport ] .
tuba tuyareba atondetse umurongo kuriya . tugiye kubona turi kukamaish , tubona ibintu by' ibiriro birazamutse bihuye hejuru birakubitanye , ||| therefore , while we were milking cows , we saw sparks rising above the airport and suddenly joined up in the air and ignited .
biraatse . bimanuka biaka ... ibishashi bigwa hasi ; ||| then , objects in flames started falling downwards , which from a distance looked like a polythene material falling on the ground .
abatukuraiye , nri nfite mukuru wanjye kwa data wacu uri uzi ubwenge yari yarize , ati @: ‘ ibi bintu si amahoro ! ||| those who were grown up like my cousin who was quite intelligent and who had gone to school said , "@ this is not a sign of peace . @"
’ ni uko yatangiye kuvuga , ati @: ||| everybody around said so .
‘ ibi bintu si amahoro . ’ turaryama bukeye nibwo batangaje rero ngo inkuru y' inshamugongo ; ngo prezida habyarimana baraye barashe indege ye . ||| then we went to bed and in the morning , the news that president habyarimana 's aircraft had crashed and spread all over .
eh ! icyakozwe rero ni iki @: noneho bya binri bihoraaga bigira kutae ? ||| eh ... what happened next ?
... bitumbatumba babishyira ku mugaragaro . ||| all the evil plans that were in their hearts were put out in open .
ntinkubwira .. batangira kujya baza kuhiga muri iyo secteur ; turirinze tukamanuka tukajya mu kibaya icyo kibaya cya karambi tukahurairmo aho ; ||| i have no words to explain this ... they [ perpetrators ] started hunting people in our sector ; we had protected our sector . we could go to karambi swamp where we could meet the attackers .
nabo bakamanuka bavuza amakondera aho ku murama ; ||| those attackers could come while producing musical sound by the use of some local musical instruments made out of horns called amakondera and get in murama .
‘ ntinzi niba ... ubyimagine ubiishyirae mu mutawe urebae ukuntu nawe nk' imisozi iba imaze hirya no hino . ’ bakamanuka bafatanyae urunana , ||| i wonder if you can imagine ... just put yourself in my shoe at that time and try to think about being attacked by people from all the neighbouring hills , all together for one hill .
bavuza amakondera baambaye amakoma ; ||| playing those makondera and dressed in banana leaves .
nibwo batangiye kuba interahamwe koko ukabona ko ari ibisimba . ||| that is how they became interahamwe [ people united with a common purpose ] and surely , they looked wild .
noneho , bakamanuka bagenda bavuza amakondera , bavuza amafirimbi , bagenda baterana inkunga ; ||| so , they came playing the makondera and whistles with so much courage .
ubwo ntawe tuhagaze mu kibaya tukanatukana , tukanahamagarana , tuti @: « mutinyukae muzae . » ||| we could just be standing in the swamp , cursing or calling one another saying , "@ try and come here . @"
baramanuka ... bakamanuka bakaharara nko hakurya ntawe tuhagarara hakuno bakatera amabuye , ||| they [ attackers ] came and stood on that hill at the other side and we were standing on our hill on this side .
bakatera amacumu , bakarasa imyambi , ntawe tukabaoherereza . ubwo , ||| then they started stoning us , shooting arrows , and we also did the same in turn .
tukaba ... kuko uraumva baba baje ari nka bakeya twebwe tuishyize hamwe tukamanuka igihiriri ; ||| they used to come in a smaller number than ours , because for us the whole sector could gather yet for them , some would come while others would not .
ubwo tukafata amabuye , tuesae tumanukaanye tukatera tukatera twavansa [ tubasatira ] tukabakubita bakasubirayo biruka . ||| therefore , we could put together our stones and stone them at a go . slowly by slowly they were defeated and went back running .
ubwo umunsi wa mbere uba urashize . ||| a day would end like that .
umunsi wa kabiri baraongera , baramanuka bukeye bavuza amakondera ; ||| the following day they came back . they came down the hill still playing the makondera .
noneho hari ibintu bari bazanye ntinzi ibyo ari byo by' ibiriro biaka , ||| this time they brought some things i could n't identify ; they were holding things burning with flames .
batutera ubwoba , nka biriya biriro baba bagira ku kibuga , ||| that was so scary .
iyo nk' ikipe itsinze ukabona ikiriro kiraatse . bakaza babicanye baambaye amakoma ! noneho , nnjyae nri ndi umwana ukundaaga kumanuka mu bantu bajyaaga kutabara , ||| those flames looked like the torches that are always lighted when a team wins a match . the attacker were holding these flames while wearing banana leaves , i was a young boy who used to like joining others on the field .
nkamanukaan amabuye , noneho tukahurair muri cya kibaya tukarasaan , tukarasaan , tukabakubita bakazamuka . ||| i would carry stones and we met them in the swamp and fought ; we shot each other until when they were forced to run back while no one had been killed in our group .
nta muntu upfuye n' umwe , ||| on the third day , that is when they realised that we were serious .
kusa ari ukurasaan imyambi tukacengaan nabo bakaturasa tukacengaan , ubwo bakazamutse . ||| therefore , they came down the hill like they used to and we too did the same as it had become the routine .
umunsi wa gatatu nibwo baje kubona ko turi serieux koko baramanutse nk' uko biri bisanzwe , ||| inside our hearts we were confident that we shall conquer them .
mbese ntawe turamanuka nk' uko biri bisanzwe , tuti @: ‘ tuzabakubita aba . ’ kuko turi twariyemeje ko tuti ntabwo bazapfa kutuica urubozo ; ||| we had decided never to let interahamwe kill us cruelly . so they tricked us by coming down the usual way and very close .
baramanutse , bamaze kumanuka nibwo baratujijishije turarasaan nka kukunri , tugiye kaumva tuumva barashe pistolet . ||| then we started shooting arrows as we used to do and all of a sudden , we heard them shouting with guns .
ubwo nriruka nriruka ... nriruka pe ! ||| i ran and seriously ran .
nsanga ... noneho nrenga , hari ahantu hari ibitare , sasa , ||| i ran beyond a place where there used to be rocks .
kuko conseiller wacu yari yavuze , ati @: « abantu nibave mungo zabo , ||| the local counsellor had ordered people to remain in their homes . he had said , "@ nobody should leave their homes and people should stay together . @"
birundaire ahantu hamwe . » bari birundaiye ku gasozi , ako gasozi bitakaaga ka kayumba nyine , ahantu hari n' ishyamba n' amabuye abantu bose ariho birundaiye ; ||| therefore people gathered together on one hill , which was kayumba hill .
abagore , abana , mbese n' inka , ari ho tugiye tushinga imizi abantu bajya mu ngo zabo kugira kutae ? ||| that place was bushy and stony and crowded with the people who had gathered there , children , women , and cattle ... generally that is the place where we had camped .
kutekair yo , bakagemura ... bakajya kurair ahantu tuishyize hamwe . nibwo rero interahmwe zaje zirara muri abo bantu , ||| some people would go home and prepare food in secret and bring the food to people in the camp where we were .
zaica abagore , zaica abasaza , zaica abana , ahongaho niho hapfuye sasa umututsi , ||| later on , the interahamwe spread into the camp and killed so many people ; women were killed , old people , children ... tutsis died on that day .
ni naho , ni naho umugore wa data wacu yaguye icyo kihae . ||| i remember that is the day when my uncle 's wife was killed .
aho niho haguye sasa umuntu w' umututsi wo muri kayumba , ||| the majority of the tutsis from kayumba died from there .
biraye muri izo nzirakarengane barabica kweri . ||| the interahamwe poured in those innocent people and killed them so badly .
ariko jyewe ntakomeza , maze kukomeza , ngera i nyamata kuri centre , uraumva ko consieller yari yaratubujije kujya kuri centre y' i nyamata ko ariho bituruka , ||| i continued to nyamata centre but the counselor had warned us from going to nyamata centre because all the plans of violence were made from there .
ariko abantu ntabwo bigeze babiumva . kuko manuka nmanukaanye n' impunzi cyangwa abatutsi n' inka zabo ngo bagiye kuri komine , ngo bagiye kwa padiri . komine na kiliziya biraturanye by' i nyamata , ||| but most people never agreed with him , because on my way i was with tutsi refugees who were fleeing with their cows and belongings and when oasked , they could say that they were going to the commune or to the church [ nyamata church and commune are next to each other ] .
ngo bagiye kuri komine bazabarinda . ni ukuvuga ngo , bari babuze uko babigira nyine , nta kunri , ||| therefore , people would say that they were going there to seek for protection .
kuko ntabwo urwana n' imbunda ! bari bazi ko kuri komine no kuri kiliziya koko ari ho bazabarinda . ||| in people 's mind , the church and the commune were always secure .
ubwo jyewe , nramanutse , ||| i also went down the hill .
ariko ku mutaima nravuga ngo jyewe simanukana n' aba bantu n' iki kivunge , nti reka ... n' iki gihiriri , nti reka nkuerekae , ||| deep in my heart i was saying i would n't go with all these people .
nti ngiye kukata muri centre nrani , mbese mu isoko nrani , isoko rya nyamata nibwo nciye mu mazu hagati , nragenda nikubita mu nzu hari inzu bacururizagamo ibigage , ||| therefore , i took a short cut through the center [ through the nyamata market ] . i passed between houses and entered a certain house where they used to sell local beer .
urabona mbese buriya buzu bwo mu mugi bwa kenyege . nkikubitamo , ntakingura umuryango , nkinguye umuryango nsangamo abandi bantu , ||| that house looked like those houses in the city slams . i found people inside who were also hiding .
bahu ... baicayemo ... bahungiye mo , bari kuhumekair hejuru , ariko nsanga ko ari abatutsi bene wacu . ubwo turaicara , ||| they were breathing deeply but when i realized that they were tutsi , i joined them and took a sit .
nraibuka ko nbize icyuya kishobora kauzura nk' igikombe , ||| i remember that time almost half a liter of sweat came out [ of my body ] .
nryama hasi nrabanza ndacururuka ... , ||| i laid down and first took a rest .
ariko ubwo numva amasasu avuga ruguru iyo za kayumba . ||| but i could hear gun shots towards kayumba area .
maze gucururuka nibwo nhagurutse , tusa nbakingura idirishya gatoya tureba hanze aho rero niho ntangiye kubona amaraso y' umuntu , ||| later i woke up and we slightly opened the window and piped outside . that is the time i started seeing people 's blood .
ni ukuvuga ngo ntangiye kubona bica umuntu , ||| i saw people being hacked .
bari babaishe kera , babaishe mbere ariko kuko jyae nirukaaga ntabwo nbiitaagaho , ||| well even before , people were killed but because i was running all the time , i never observed it clearly like then .
nrirukaaga nyine nrengera ubuzima . ||| i would just run for my own life .
noneho ubwo turarunguruka nbona umuntu bari kuicisha kupakupe [ coupe @-@ coupe ] ahongaho mu mugi wa nyamata ; ||| so , as we piped , we saw someone who was being killed with a machete . that was in nyamata town .
ni ukuvuga ngo akahaguruka yahaguruka bakamukubita kupakupe akikubuta hasi , yakaongera kuhaguruka bakamukubita kupakupe akaongera akikubita hasi , mpaka uwo muntu apfuye . ||| whenever he would try to stand up , he would be slashed then he would fall down again , he was slashed until he died .
bamukinairho ngo wa nyenzi we ngo ujyaaga he , ||| they were playing on his mind asking him , "@ you cockroach where were you going ? @"
nbiumva ndi aho ngaho mu nzu . noneho ibyo bivaho haza icyo baita kukora , interahamwe zihita kuri utwo ducentres zivuga , ||| i was silently listening from that house .
ngo @: ||| later on , they started using the term "@ to work . @"
« tugiye kukora , » bahera ku nzu ya mbere basaka kuri utwo ducentres twa nyamata , basaka , ||| the interahamwe could pass through the center saying , "@ we are going to work @" [ implying that they are going to kill ] . they started searching house by house in nyamata center .
basaka .. basaka ... , batwika , inzu y' umututsi cyangwa boutique y' umututsi , yari iy' mututsi bakahita bayishumika bakayitwika . ||| they searched all around and they burnt houses or shops that were owned by tutsis in that area .
noneho bahera kuri boutique ya mbere batwika , batwika ... batwika ; ||| shops were burnt , one after the other .
noneho jyewe ku mutaima ndavunga nti @: ntinshaka ko bansanga muri iyi nzu . baza kugera ku nzu y' umugabo witwaga kahaima , ||| i said to myself , "@ i do n't want to be found in this house . @" then in no time they had reached gahima 's house .
yari umukuru wa pl , yari president wa pl aho ngaho i bugesair ; ||| [ gahima was the president of pl in bugesera ] .
barayitwika pe ! yari inzu nziza cyane , barayishumika nrayibona ukuntu ihise ikurumaan nti koko . kuko babanje ku murongo umwee ... kuburyo baza kuza kutugeraho . ||| his house was very beautiful but it was burnt to ash . it was ignited and i saw its flames . the interahamwe burnt house after house to the point where , in the end , they were going to reach us .
noneho , nravuga nti @: aho kugirango bansangae , banfatae muzima nk' uku banyicae urupfu rubi ; ||| but i did n't want to wait to see the interahamwe getting me alive and see myself dying a painful death .
nti jyewe bazanyica niruka . ||| i decide to die running .
nibwo nfashe umwuko , ubundi hari icyuko ... iyo nzu ninjiyemo bayishigishiragamo ikigage . nfata umwuko , ||| then i reached for a spatula [ made out of wood , about two meters long ] that was in that house , which they used for stirring while making the local beer .
icyuko kinini nkishyira ku rutugu , maze kukishyira ku rutugu nshaka kusohoka , nshatse kusohoka abo bagenzi banjye baravuga bati @: ||| i held the spatula across my shoulders and tried to get out . when the people who were in the house saw that i was going to get out , they stopped me .
"@ uretse batakuicira hanze . @" ||| "@ why do n't you stay here , do you want to die from outside ? @" they asked me .
nti @: njyewe munbabarirae ntabwo nzapfa ndi munzu , ngo bantwikirae munzu , nti jyewe munbabarirae nsohokae , ||| i excused myself and told them that i was not going to die inside a house , to be burnt in the house .
nrabananira bashaka kunfata nrabananira nkubita urugi ntasohoka mpita nsubira , ||| then when i refused to stay , they tried to hold me [ to stop me from leaving ] and i hit the door open and i left .
nsubira inyuma y' amazu . noneho , ||| immediately i hid behind the houses .
wunvae iyo umuntu ajya kupfa cyangwa iyo urupfu rubunza umuntu abura uko abigenza , akajya mu bitashoboka kandi bigomba kushoboka . ||| but when someone is meant to die or if death is on the way , it is very hard to think straight .
ubwo jyewe nravuga nti reka nnjyae nsangae abandi kuri komine no ku kiliziya aho bagiye . ||| while i was behind the house , i decided to join others at nyamata commune or church .
ubwo abandi bari bamaze kugenda tayari , impunzi zashize inyuma nyine ari jyewe nsigaye . ni ukuvuga ngo , ||| other refugees [ tutsi ] had already left ; it was only i left behind .
nraretse ibintu birabanza birahosha , noneho nnjyae nva muri iyo nzu , n' icyo cyuko nragenda nyine nta ... , nta kutinya kugirango bagirengo ndi interahamwe . ||| i waited for the situation to calm down and then later i walked slowly with my spatula without fear in order to give people the impression that i am an nterahamwe .
n' icyuko meze nabi cyane nirakaje . ubwo nramanuka inyuma y' amazu ... nramanuka ntawunkomakoma ... nramanuka ngera ahantu baita mu ... , muka ... , nani mu kajevuba , ||| i looked very serious and passed behind the houses . no one talked about me , i just walked firmly and reached a place called kajevuba formally , it was known as gatare .
cyane cyane bahita ku gatare noneho aho ku gatare iyo uhaciye uhita uzamuka ujya kuri , kuri komine ariko nshaka kujya , kuri komine . nzamutse ngiye kujya kuri komine mpita mpabona bariyeri , ||| through gatare one just ascends the hill and reaches the commune . i was trying to get to the commune . before i reached the commune , i saw a roadblock just ahead of me .
bamaze kuhashyira bariyeri , bariyeri y' umupolisi . ||| at the roadblock there was a policeman .
urabona abapolisi ba kera imbunda bagiraaga , bagiraaga z' ibibaho gutya ... , ariko icyo kihae uwo mupolisi yari afite imbunda iteye ubwoba ! ||| normally during the days before the war , policemen used to have wooden guns , but that policeman had a scary gun .
kubwanjye nyishyira mu rwego rwa mitrayeze . noneho nri nfite icyo cyuko mpita nza ... nti ntashaka kujya kuri komine , ariko nbwira uwo mu polisi . ||| holding my huge spatula i told the policeman , "@ i want to go the commune @" [ i was desperate , i knew in all cases , i would die ] .
kuko nri nvuze nti ni ukupfa no kupfa nti uko nvuga kose . ||| i did n't care about the way i was saying it .
noneho umupolisi aranbwira ati @: urashaka kujya kuri komine ? ||| the policeman asked me , "@ you want to go the commune ?
ati buretse , ati @: ntabwo baratangira kuica . ||| wait , killings at the commune have not yet started . @"
ubwo nibwo nhise nvuga nti @: barapfuye bariya bantu bagiye kuri komine ! nti reka nrekae kujyayo , nti kuko maze kumenya ibanga ry' igituma bagiyeyo . ||| then i realised that people at the commune were going to die in the meantime .
nti butya bariya bantu baraza kubica ? nibwo nsubiye inyuma ubwo aranbujije . maze kusubira inyuma ubwo ntakata , ||| then i told the policeman , "@ okay , i will go back and wait . @" then i understood the logic behind sending people to the commune .
na none ni hahanri nravugaaga nti ese nrajya hehe ? ||| i went back but i was wondering were i would go .
nshaka izindi nzira kugirango nyuraemo nsubirae kuri ya komine , njyae kuri komine nyine . ||| so , i looked for another shortcut that would lead me to the commune .
nibwo ntambitse nyura aho baita aho mu kajevuba nyine ; nkitera intambwe ebyiri , nsanga aho interahamwe ziri kuvumbura umukobwa uri wihishe muri toilette , ziri ku ... kumukinguza ngo nkingurae , ||| i crossed through that place called kajevuba and as i had made two steps , i found the interahamwe who were forcing a lady to open the door of the toilets in which she was hiding .
ubwo nri nkifite cya cyuko cyanjye ; ngo kingura , ngo kingura tukuicae wa .. bamutuka ngo wa mbwakazi we . ||| " open the door you bitch @"@ , the interahamwe were shouting at her .
umukobwa ati @: « mbwambabariye , » avugair mo . ||| and she was pleading for forgiveness inside the toilet saying , "@ please forgive me . @"
ubwo nnjyae , kuko nbikubisemo , nanirwa ubuiruka nanirwa n' ubusubira inberae , ||| because i had already bumped into them , i could neither run back nor continue a head .
ariko umutima uranbwira uti ihanganae usubirae inberae , ||| but my heart told me , " be strong and go ahead . @"
nkomezae , nkomeje nragenda nivanga nabo n' izo nterahamwe na cya cyuko cyanjye . ||| therefore , i went ahead and joined the interahamwe . i still had the spatula .
ubwo ni nnjyae ubaye uwa mbere mu kukubita icyuko kuri urwo rugi kugirango batamenya , nkakubita icyuko kuri urwo rugi nti @: ||| in fact , i was the first person to bang my spatula on the toilet 's door so that they would n't know me .
nimumusohore iyo mbwakazi . noneho ubwo umukobwa bakomeza bamu ... , tukubita nyine nnjyae nirakaje ! ariko nza kuhagarara gatoya nravuga nti @: ||| i said , " bitch , you have to open the door . @"
ariko nti nk' ubu nibarangiza kumwica uyu ; nnjyae ntibakebaguza bakanbona ? ||| while we were banging the door , i realized that in case they got her and killed her , they would realize that i am a stranger and they would know that i am a tutsi then i would be killed next .
nti reka nkuerekae , mpita nigair inama nti reka njyae kunyara , nranabivuga cyane , ||| then i said loudly , "@ men , i need to pee . @"
nti reka nyarae sha . ubwo nibwo nhise nyura inyuma y' amazu , ||| so i pretended as if i was going to pee behind the house and i took off .
nta nubwo nongeye kujya iyo kuri komine , ||| from then i never thought of going to the commune again .
nhise manuka nsubira iy' iwacu mu cyaro , aho baitaaga i karambi . ||| i went down to my home village that was known as karambi .
ubwo buri bumaze , buri bumaze kugira kutae ? buri bumaze kusa , buri bumaze kwira ubwo , ||| then night came .
uraumva , ibikorwa biba bibaye ku manywa ; ||| the crimes were taking place in broad daylight .
bumaze kwira nibwo nnjyae nmanutse maze kubona ncitse abo babaish bari batangiye kuica uwo mwana w' umukobwa , ||| when night fell i left after watching those people kill the girl .
ndetse ngeze hepfo gato aho bari bavuye nsanga intumbi y' umukobwa unbaye robae de nuit . ||| i came back and found a girl 's dead body in a nightdress .
niba yari abyutse , niba yari yihishe nnjyae nyobewe uko bigenze , ndetse bari bamwishe kare , yari yamaze kutunba . ||| maybe she had been awakened ; who knows .
nibwo ngiye manuka hepfo gatoya aho baita ku gatare njya mu bihuru byaho , nryama mu bihuru byaho , nraryama , ||| it seemed like she had been killed several hours before because by then her body had started to swell . then i went to a nearby place called gatare , where i hid in bushes around and took a deep sleep .
bigeze nko mu ma saa mbiri y' ijoro nrazamuka , kuko icyo kihae iyo bigeraaga mu ... ma saa mbiri y' ijoro , nhise numva ibintu birahosheje , nta rusaku rukibaho , ||| i woke up at around eight in the evening ; at such an hour , there would be no noise , which implied that the situation has cooled down .
nta rusaku rw' amasasu rukibaho . ||| at that time , there would be no noise of the shootings .
noneho nrazamuka , ngeze ... ngeze kayumba hejuru , mbese aho ngombaaga kucurika nsubira iwacu . ||| therefore , i went up in kayumba where i was going on my way home .
nibwo ngiye kaumva numva nyamata amagrenades , urusaku rw' amasasu rwinshi cyane , ninjoro nko mu ma saa ... saa mbiri gutyo z' ijoro nibwo numvise urusaku rw' amasasu cyane ... , cyane ariko , ||| i suddenly heard a loud noise of grenades and shootings in nyamata . there was a lot of noise at around eight in the evening .
nti barabamaze neza neza ba bantu nti @: ||| "@ they are dead .
batangiye kuica . ubwo nramanutse , ibyo ndabyihorereye biri bigeze nko mu ma saa mbiri n' igice , ||| all those who went to nyamata , this is the time for the killings in nyamata . @" i said to myself . i ignored everything and went towards home . it was almost eight thirty in the evening .
nramanuka nyura ku muharuro w' iwacu , ntinya no kugera mu rugo kuko numvaaga nta jwi rivugairyo . ||| i passed by my home compound but i did n't want to enter inside the house . i was afraid because there was no sign of life ; nothing indicating if there was anyone .
ntinya kugera mu rugo nti @:@ none ngera mu rugo nkasangayo n' interahamwe ? ntangiye kutinya ku bwanjye nri njyenyine icyo kihae . ||| i feared to enter . what if i bumped into interahamwe in the house , i thought .
nca ku rugo , ||| i passed by the house and went on .
nramanuka manutse mpura n' abandi bahungu bagenzi banjye , nabo barokotse batagiye ku kiliziya . nibwo nisunze nabo , nti @: ||| on my way i met some boys who had survived [ they did n't go to hide at the church ] .
bite ba kanaka turasuhuzanya nti @: mbese namwe mwarokotse ? tutangira kuvugana nti @: jyewe ntinye kugera mu rugo , ||| we greeted each other and chatted a bit about how they survived and then i told them how i was afraid to enter in my home .
nti @:@ numvise kusa habairyo akanyana ; nti ariko nta majwi y' abantu numvise nti ngize ubwoba , nti reka tuibanaire . ubwo tutangira kuba dutyo , ||| "@ i just heard the calf crying but i never heard any human sound . @" i said . i asked them to remain with me .
turamanutse . ||| so , we remained together and went away .
abo bahungu bari bangahe ? ||| how many were the boys ?
ntabwo wigeze umenya ibyabaye ku bantu bo mu muryango wawe ? ||| did you ever get to know what happened to your family members ?
oya , ni ukuvuga ngo abantu bo mu muryango wanjye , mperukana nabo wa munsi nbabwiraaga nti katubayeho , ||| no , the last time i saw my family is the day i said we are finished .
ntabwo nongeye kaumva amakuru yabo . kusa nraza kukubwira , turaza kugera ahantu nje kaumva abo kwa data wacu , umuhungu wo kwa data wacu ko bariho , ||| i never heard of them again , later i heard the news from my cousin , that they were alive .
turaza kuhagera ntabwo turahagera . noneho , tubayeho gutyo bucya , bukwira interahamwe zikamanuka zikasubira mu ngo zabo zikajya kurya ibyo zasahuye , ||| at night interahamwe would go to their homes to eat what they had looted .
zikabaga inka zacu . tukajya tubiumva kumusozi iyo ngiyo baririmba , babyina , bishimye , ||| they would slaughter our cows ; eat our meat , singing loudly .
bari kutaurira inka bari kuishimira mbese intsinzi yabo , niko nvuga . ubwo ntawe niko kahaengae tubaga tubonye tukava mu bwihisho , ||| we could hear them from a distance at the top of the hill where they would be dancing and celebrating their victory . that was the time we could get some kind of peace while the perpetrators were singing .
tukaongera tukasubiraan tukaganira . ||| we would get together and talk .
ariko mu kuganira kwacu ntabwo tuvugaaga nk' uku tuvuga , nk' uku nvuga ; ahubwo bibaga ari ukaongoreraan ; tukaongoreraan ngo yewe , ||| however we could n't talk like the way i am talking ; we would simply whisper to each other .
naka se bite ? yarokotse cyangwa ? [ avuga yongorera ] mbese bikaba ari ibyo , ||| "@ hey , what about so and so , is he died or ? @"
twarasaraye kandi tutarasaraye . , turibazima . ok noneho bukacya tukaongera tukisubirair mu bihuru byacu , ||| whispering . morning would come and we would go back to that bush and sit .
ariko tukirinda ikintu cyo kugira kutae ? cyo kujya mu gihuru ngo wihishemo , ahubwo hakaba ikintu cyo gucungacunga kusa , ni uko tubagaho . ||| but we would not simply sit .
ni ukuvuga ngo interahamwe zaturuka hariya , tukaba tumenye ngo zirahari twebwe tukaca inyuma , tukazinyura inyuma . ||| we stayed there while watching the attackers . the interahamwe would come through this way , and us would go through the other way . we would always be behind them .
keretse abantu babaga baratemye , akarokoka nibwo ... nibo bajyaaga mu rufunzo ; bakihisha mu rufunzo . ariko icyo kihae interahamwe , ||| except for those who had been hacked and survived , they would go in the swamp and hide there [ as they were wounded ] .
zari zikikora mu misozi , kuko abantu bari bakiriho muri iyo minsi ya mbere , bataratangira gushoka urufunzo . noneho tukakomeza mururwo ; ||| the interahamwe were still working on the hills then .
bakaza bakairirwa bahiga ... bahiga . hakabaho igihe batuhize umunsi wose , tukairirwa tuirukankaan nabo kusa . nta ... baaka ... , ||| sometimes they could chase us the whole day and we would spent that day running .
iyo tugiraaga imaan . ni nk' iyo imvura yagwaaga , iyo imvura yagwaaga batinyaaga kuva mu mazu , bakaugama tukagira akahaengae ntawe tukajya hanze . ||| we were lucky if it rained because interahamwe would stay in their homes , then we would go out of our hiding place .
bibaga biteye ubwoba ||| it was terrible .
ubwo nibwo batangiye kutubaza , ngo murakora iki hano ? tuti ntacyo . nonese muri mu rufunzo mukora iki ? ||| they asked us " what are you doing in this swamp ? @"
tuti ntacyo . ||| we said , "@ nothing . @"
ati ... iki cyaan ntakizi bavugaaga uwo mwana turi turi kumwe . kuko hari interahamwe tuhise tumenyamo yitwaaga mapengu , yari umupagasi , umupagasi waho mu ngo nyine mbere y' intambara . ||| then one man from the attackers whose name was mapengu stared at this other boy and said , " i know this boy " of course he knew him because he used to be their house boy before the war .
noneho aravuga ati @: « iki cyaan ntakiizi ni icyo kwa kanaka . » ise w' uwo mwana yari umucuruzi yari afite amafaranga , ati @: ||| then he said , "@ young boy , do n't you have money ? @"
« sha ubwo nta mafaranga ufite ? » ubwo nibwo batangiye gushoka mu myenda ya wa mwana bacagagura amapantalo ye bakora mu mifuka basanga mo ibihumbi 80.000 . ||| then they grabbed him and started checking in his pockets .
bamaze kusangamo ibihumbi 80.000 . bati ya ... batangira kushaka nk' abayarwanair ; bashatse nk' abayarwanair , umukuru wabo niwe ubabujije aranayabaaka . ||| they found 80.000 frw .
amaze kuyabaaka , bati @: ‘ nrabizi kifite andi ! ’ bakora muri mugondo bakoze muri mugondo bakuramo andi ibihumbi 5.000 . ||| they were amazed .
noneho ni nk' ayo mafaranga yatukijije , nibwo batangiye kuganira bo hagati yabo bati ariko aba bantu tubicae cyangwa tubarekae ? ubwo bamwe bakavuga ngo @: ‘ tubakuraeho , ||| they almost fought over the money but their leader stopped them and took the money and said , "@ i know he has some more . @"
’ abandi bakavuga ngo @: « ariko sha abantu mukuyeho amafaranga angana atya » ngo reka baraicwa n' abandi cyangwa bazagwa inberae . ubwo umukuru wabo afata decision , aravuga ngo @: ||| they searched in ( mugondo ) the short he was wearing beneath his trousers and got 5,000 francs then they started discussing among themselves what was going to be the next step .
« mugumae aha ! » aratutegeka ngo mugumae aha ; muhumurae ntacyo muba ati @: ‘ ubu ntacyo muba kabisa , ||| some would say , "@ let us clear them off @" others would say , "@ we have taken a lot of money from them .
’ tuti @: yego . ubwo nibwo bahise baongera bafata umurongo bakigenda , ||| let us leave them they will be killed by other groups . @"
nnjyae kubera ubwoba nri nfite nri nfite isaha , mushiki wanjye ... ntinzi niba uzi amasaha yaredukaga gutya , hari amasaha kera ukoraagamo ukaumva afite rasitike , mushiki wanjye yari yarayiguze kera nri nyifite yari nka souvenir ye bakitambuka nrabakarura , ||| their leader told us to remain where we were then they immediately left i had an elastic watch that my sister had given me as a souvenir and because i was frightened i called them back and gave it to them .
nti muzae nnjyae nbahae n' isaha ariko munrekae . kandi bari baigendeye nibwo nkuyemo iyo isaha nrayibahaye . bihita bigenda biihuta , ||| then they left .
bakigenda intambwe ebyiri , baba baguye kubanri bantu babiri , kuko nri nbabwiye ko tumanutse turi abantu icumi , ||| while they were leaving they saw two other people , i had already told them that we were ten .
baba baguye kugikundi kibanri bantu babiri , abo bo ntibabagiraiye imbabazi , ||| then they met two others , these two were not given a second chance ; they were chopped like firewood .
tugiye kaumva tuumva batangiye kubatemagura . tuumva , kabisa ninko kusa inkwi iyo utema igufa rero ni nko ... kusa urukwi . ||| when one 's bone is hacked , his bones sounds like a wood that is breaking .
tukaumva barataka ngo @: « ayi ngo nimusohokeyo mwa nyenzi mwe barakubita barabica abo baba bavuyeyo . » bati @: ||| we heard those boys screaming , "@ ahhh..yiiii @" and they [ interahamwe ] were saying , "@ get out . @" finally they were killed .
« tukomezae sha , baganira ngo tukomezae sha . » barakomeza bageze inberae bagwa ku banri na none nabo barabica utwo tukunri twose turi turi kumwe baratuica . ubwo barakomeza bamaze kukomeza , ||| after killing them , they continued going , talking loudly .
twebwe ... ubwo biba bigeze nko mu ma saa kumi , saa kumi n' imwe gutyo . tuba turahagurutse njyewe n' uwo muhungu . ||| after a few steps , they met other people and killed them ; they killed everyone in the small groups we had been with .
iyo rero bigeraaga nka saa kumi n' imwe n' igice , saa kumi n' ebyiri , kutera bibaga birangiye bakataha , bakajya kurya ibyo bakoreye nyine . ||| at half past five or at six , the perpetrators stopped the killings and went home .
noneho turahaguruka n' uwo muhungu tugenda tusura buri nriri , tusanga , tugeze kuba mbere , tusanga umwe arahorota undi yaciye . ||| the other boy and i went back to check on the small groups of people , the first two people were dead and the other one was on the verge of death his head had been hacked and the brain was spilling and his breath was coming in spasms , we took the banana fibers that we were sitting on and covered their body , as a form of burial .
bamutemye umutwe bawusatuye , uwo umutwe basatuye niwe uri kuhorota nyine nawe araenda kupfa . tufata bwa bushara bwabushara bari baicayeho , turabuborosa ngo ubwo turabahambye birarangiye . ||| we continued ahead and found another group ; in this group they were all dead .
tuigira inberae tusanga nanone abo bo baciye nta nuhorota , agakundi ka nyuma niko tusanze umukobwa batemye basatuye hano , kabisa ubwonko bugaragara . ||| in the last group there was a girl whose brains were out but she was still alive .
ariko we akiri muzima yaratubwiye icyo kihae , n' ikintu ntazaibagirwa ngo @: ||| she told us something that i can never forget ; she said that she was so thirsty , that she wanted something to drink .
« nraumva inyota inyishe ngo mwampaye amazi , » turareba amazi ... amazi umuntu yabagamo tubagamo ... niyo tunyaraagamo tuitumaagamo ukaumva uyobewe uko ubigenza . ||| but water in the swamp was extremely dirty ; we were urinating , shitting in the swamp .
nibwo tumubwiye tuti @: reka tuambukae tuvae mu gifunzo . ||| we told her to let us get out of the swamp .
turamuterura umuhungu aterura hepfo , uwo mwana turi turi kumwe , nnjyae nterura ruguru , turamutwara tumushyira ... turamwambutsa . ||| then that boy whom we were together carried the lower part [ legs ] and i lifted the upper part .
ariko abo banri bose tugenda tuborosa amashara yabo ubwo tuba turabahambye birarangiye . ||| we crossed the swamp but all the way we would cover the dead bodies of our friends . that was all we could do for their burial .
noneho wa mukobwa tumugejeje ku nkombe y' urufunzo , tubona ahantu hari akariba ndetse ako kariba kari karimo uruho , uruho ntinzi uruho niba muruzi ? ||| then we reached the side of the swamp where we found a small pond and in that pond there was a piece of calabash [ in the rwandan culture , it is used for drinking water .
uruho batahisha amazi tuba tugize imaan tufashe rwa ruho ; ||| ] we were so lucky to find it there .
tumuhaye amazi , tumaze kumuha amazi andi tuyamumena mu mutawe . ariko uko ubibonaaga ubonaaga ari umuntu utagomba kukira . ||| we gave her some water to drink and poured some in her head , but you could clearly tell that she would not survive .
kandi ntawe tushakaaga kurengera ubuzima bwacu ntabwo turi kukomeza kugira kutae ? ||| yet we were also fighting to save our own lives .
kujyana n' uwo muntu . tubona tutari bumushoborae turi kupfa tuesae . noneho turamubwira tuti @: ||| there was no way we could keep on moving with her in such condition .
rero kanaka uzamukae upfaire ruguru ku musozi , ntupfaire mu gishanga . ushakae ukuntu uzamuka icyo kihae kandi biri bigeze mu masaha yo kujya kushaka ubwo bujumba kukura ubwo bujumba bwo kurya . noneho umwana w' umukobwa nibwo atubwiye ati @: ||| we therefore told her to make an effort and crawl up the hill , so that she does not die in the swamp , and it was the time to go and look for sweet potatoes .
ariko se ? akatugaish inama , ngo @: « ariko se ngo nta ujya i nyamata kwa muganga kuivuza ? » ||| she asked us if she could go to nyamata hospital but we told her that it was more dangerous .
tuti inyamata niho ibi bintu byose biri kuturuka uraba ujyayo se kukora iki tuti ntawukuvura ubwo nibwo ngize ntae nibwo yatusabaiye ku mana aratubwira ati "@ rero mugize neza maze imaan izabahae umugisha @" tumusiga aryamawe aho turagenda , ||| she thanked us and prayed for god to bless us . we left her lying there .
ubwo uwo mukobwa ntahamya ko yapfuye kuko ukuntu yari ameze ntabwo yari umuntu wo kuzakira . ||| but i am sure she died because she was in a very bad state .
ubwo akazi kacu karakomeje ko ku kukora , ||| we went on with our daily routine .
turagiye tukuye ubwo bujumba , turazamutse tugeze hahanri tujyaaga tuhurair nijoro tuesae tusanze na none hari abarokotse , ||| we got our sweet potatoes and went up the hill for our usual night meeting place . when we reached there , we found some others who had survived .
tutangira kubwiraan kanaka arihae ? yapfuye ubwo nibwo tumenyaaga tuti @: umubare upfuye ni uyu . ||| of course we started asking each other , "@ where is so and so ? @" so that we would know the number of those who died .

noneho , baba batutungutseho direct . izo nterahamwe , bari interahamwe eshatu , ||| they immediately appeared from the corner .
imwe ifite inkota , indi ifite umuhoro , indi ifite eh ... abandi babiri bafite imihoro , umwe afite inkota . ||| they were five in number ; one had a sword and the rest had machetes .
noneho baraje baratuhagaritse , bati @: ‘ yemwe , ’ tuti @: ||| they stopped us from a distance and asked us , " where are you from ? @"
yee . bati @: muriabahe ? tuti @: ||| we also asked them in return , "@ and you where are you from ? @"
esemwebwemuriabahe ? tuihagararaho . barazaa .. , hari mu kwezi nrabiibuka , ||| i remember it was moonlight they came a little bit closer and checked on us ; my friend had a very long nose , so they said , " check this one .
kihae cy' ukwezi , baraza baraturunguruka neza gutya , batujya mu maso ... ah .. ! bahita bavuga ngo dore iyi ni inkotanyi . ||| these are inkotanyi . @"
uwo muhungu yari afite izuru rigera ... risongoye rigera nk' ahangaha . bati @: « nimuicarae vuba , bati @: ||| they ordered us to sit down but i immediately pinched him .
muicarae . » mushuna urwara ; mushunnye urwara , ‘ ku mutaima jyewe nravuga , ||| deep in my heart , i had a feeling that i should run rather than sit there and die such a death .
nti ntabwo npfa nicaye , ashwi ! ’ kuko batangiye kuzamura inkota n' imihoro . nreba inyuma gutya , ||| then they started raising their machetes .
mpita mpindukira vuba na vuba nriruka ; nirutse , ikigabo kimwe kinyirukaho , kifite inkota . ||| i looked behind and swiftly run .
abandi babiri basigaraan wa muhungu . turiruka turiruka , nri ndi umwana rero , ibaze umuntu w' umugabo arakuirukankaanye akurusha n' umuvuduko ; ||| one interahamwe chased me , you can imagine a grown up man chasing a young boy , and of course he was faster than me .
turiruka umuhanda wose turiruka nbonye neza . nk' uko nba ndi aho mbese muri metero cyangwa metero n' igice .. , neza agiye kunfata nibwo nkase mu masaka . nanga kukomeza umuhanda nkata mu masaka . ||| we ran the whole road when i saw that he was about to catch me , i entered into the millet plantation that was nearby .
nkase mu masaka , ||| in the millet plantation , i could n't run properly .
amasaka aba ankubise imitego ; ankubise imitego nitura hasi . ubwo kiba kingaiye hejuru , ||| i slipped and fell down and he got on top of me .
kikajya kitema ; kikatema aho nvuye , nkibarangura kikatema ... kikatema ariko kiramfash ... kinfataish imihoro nk' ibiri . ubu bantemye hano mu ntegae , ||| he wanted to hack me but he missed because he hacked when i had already moved .
na hano ku rutoki . uko kintema nkazamura amaguru nti yee ... nti @: nbabarira ! nkaongera nkibarangura , ||| i kept on rolling , and then he hacked me on the finger and behind the knee .
kikatema kiti @: "@ hagarara kavunae umuheto . @" noneho , imaan ngize , ||| he repeatedly hacked .
nza kugera ku mungoti , mbese umungoti umpa imbaraga ntahaguruka , mpagurutse nibwo nbonye igihuru inberae yanjye nkikubitamo , nkikubisemo nrakipfumura nragenda nicara inyuma yacyo . ||| i would put up my legs and scream for forgiveness , by chance i reached the terrace , which enabled me to be on my feet again , i saw bush of thorns and jumped inside , passed through and sat behind .
icyo kigabo cyo kitinya kunyura mu gihuru ; icyo gihuru kiri icy' amahwa kabisa . ubwo kiranbwira , ||| that man feared to follow me because of the thorns .
ngo @: "@ ni hahanri sha , ngo @: nihahandi n' ejo ni umunsi . @" ||| then he said , "@ tomorrow is yet another day . @"
ntaceceka , ubwo kiba kirazamutse . noneho , ngiye kaumva numva wa mwana ruguru ari kutaka . ||| i remained seated and then he left me there . i heard the other boy screaming , begging for forgiveness .
bakakubita akataka , ngo @: "@ wa nkotanyi we ujyaaga he ? @" ||| they beat him saying , "@ where were you going you inkotanyi . @"
bakakubita akataka . ubwo yaje kugwa aho ngaho biraumvikana . ||| they repeatedly beat him i believe he died there .
ubwo jyewe ntabwo ... nri ntaramenya ko bantemye , ||| i did n't know that i had been hacked .
hari hakishyushye ntazi ibyabaye . ||| the wounds were still fresh so i could n't tell .
ubwo ntakomeza ndiyicariraa ... ubwo ageze ruguru wa muntu avuza induru , avugije induru , ||| therefore , i sat there and when the other perpetrator [ the one who hacked me ] saw his companions , he shouted and called them .
numva munsi yanjye , ngo @: "@ komera komera , komera komera ! ||| just below where i was , i heard people shouting back , "@ calm down , calm down . @"
nti yayaa nti @: ntapfuye [ avuga yongorera ] ! ||| then i whispered to myself ; "@ i am dead . @"
ariko imaan ikomeza iranbwira , iti @: wowe guma aho , ||| but god made me strong and i remained seated .
iti @: guma aho ; iti @: ||| "@ calm down , calm down . @"
"@ komeza wicare aho . "@ komera komera , komera @" yampaye inka ! no hirya gato , ||| several voices from all corners calming him .
ngo @: "@ komera komera , ||| the number of people had increased considerably as they came to see what was happening .
komera . @" ||| i was praying thinking i was dead . all those people met at the main road and then he told them that there was one inkotanyi in the bush . he suggested that they enter the bush but some people who had just woken up said it was okay , that tomorrow was another day .
numva abantu babaye benshi , nti ntapfuye pe ! ||| they were trying to discourage them from entering the bush .
ubwo egide nrara ntazi ibyo ari byo , ||| therefore , i , egide spent the whole night without knowing what was going on .
ariko nraibuka ko nri nambaye ikintu cy' igipantaro ariko nambaye ibirenge . noneho bukeye , burinze bucya ntaramenya ko bantemye . noneho bukeye nibwo abantu banbwiye ... , ||| i remember i was dressed in trousers but i was bare feet . until morning , i was n't aware of the wound i had on my leg .
ngize ntya nbona , ah .. ! urutoki rwo nri nrubonye , kuko rwararegeye ... pe ! ||| but i had noticed about the finger because it was too loose .
rwararegeye nkabona igufwa neza , urwo rwo nrarubona . noneho mu gitondo abantu baranbwira , ngo @: ||| i realized it when people asked me why my trousers had a hole , which is when i realized that i was hurt .
"@ ese ko iyo pantaro yawe yacitse ? @" nrebye ku ipantalon nbona ikintu kiraasamye cyane . eh ! ntangira gucumbagira sasa , ||| i began to limp , then and there ; i had it rough .
nibwo ntangiye gucumbagira ; ntangira gucumbagira ubwo ndatesekara , ntangira kujya nihisha mu rufunzo nk' abandi . ni ukuvuga ngo nnjyae nba uwo mu rufunzo . ||| i began to hide in the swamp like others ; we would hide in the swamp because that is where we could easily hide from the attackers .
nkagenda nkajya mu rufunzo , mu rufunzo rero kuihishamo iyo wunvaaga interahamwe uhitaaga ucubira mu mazi , ||| whenever we heard attackers coming in the swamp , we would sink in the muddy waters .
ukajya munsi y' igikuri . ibaze nawe kushyira ikintu cy' igikomere mu mazi . ||| you can imagine sinking in that water with wounds all over .
ubwo bukwira tukazamuka ncumbagurika ncumbagurika , hari umukecuru tubanaaga , akafata ibibabi by' igiti ntinzi ibyo ari byo , ||| at night i would limp slowly by slowly ... there was an old lady whom we were hiding together , she could squeeze some herbs and apply them on my wound .
ubwo akabivuguta akakandaishho . ubwo akaba ariwo muti nbona . noneho , igihe kiza kugera ba .. , ||| that was the medicine that was available .
hari mukuru wanjye uri iyo ku musozi iwacu , wo kwa data wacu sasa ; noneho numva ngo ariho , ndetse na karumuna kanjye ako ... ka petit frere ko kwa data wacu , ||| time came when a person from our village came and told me that my older cousin and his other two brothers were still alive .
na none n' undi ; mbese abo bo kwa data wacu bari batatu bakiriho bose ari abahungu . ||| the three brothers were all alive .
noneho , nnjyae nriruka , noneho bageze hepfo babona ni uwunri umwe kusa . nibwo bamwe bagarutse , ||| after killing him they realized that he was alone therefore , they came back to look for other people .
jyewe ubwo naracumbagurikaga ariko iyo nbonaaga interahamwe nrakiraaga , direct akaguru kakaba kazima nkarambura pe ! nkiruka . ||| i was limping but whenever i would hear attackers , i would become very normal .
ubwo bamwe baragaruka turiruka , baratuirukankaan pe ! baratuirukankaan , nibwo ... nraibuka ko nigeze ... nkandagiye mu , ||| my leg would just straighten out and i would run .
nkandagiye mu mwobo . umwobo urantega nrikubita ... ngwa gatebe gatoki . ariko imaan irampagurutsa nyine vuba na vuba , nraongera nriruka . ||| some of the attackers saw me and ran after me .
ubwo uwo munsi tuirirwa tuiruka batuirukankaan tucengaan nabo , tuba ... tuka turabarokoka . burya nibwo nmaze kubona , n' ubwo bajya bavuga ngo @: ||| we ran , ran and ran .
‘ ntawumenyera akabi , ’ ariko akabi turi turakamenyereye kuko turi turavuze , tuti @: ||| that day the attackers really chased us , i remember stepping in a hole and falling down and i kept on rolling until i was on my feet again .
turamenyereye kuzinduka tuiruka , tuvuga tuti kama ... , ni ukupfa no kupfa nyine ejo ni njyewe ntakunri ngira . kusa turamenyereye kuiruka . ||| we had said that we would not get used to the situation , but eventually we got used to running because running was part of the routine .
noneho tubaho dutyo .. , bakajya nyine bica kuko nraibuka ko hari umu ... uri chef , chef w' i bwami mbese babanri bavugaaga ngo chef w' akarere kera ku kihae cy' ubwami yitwaaga ruhorahoza , ||| life went on like that , killing was the in thing ; i remember there was a certain man whose name was ruhorahoza he was a chief during the monarchy .
bara yari umututsi muremure cyane . bamuhayeho ... mbese bamufasheho nk' urugero baramubamba . baramwica bamubamba ahantu ku nzira . ||| he was a very tall tutsi ; they crucified him by the road and said that he should be a reference in the future .
kugira ngo abatutsi bose ngo bazazae baza barebae , barebae ukuntu , ukuntu abatutsi mbese babagize , tutinye tuesae ko ariko bazatugira . ||| meaning , those who would want to see how tutsis looked like in the future , would be shown that body .
kandi ikindi bari bafite mission , u bugesair bari .. , bashakaaga kubusigamo umututsi umwe , kandi uwo mututsi ngo yari akamuga , ||| in other words , interahamwe thought that no tutsi who would survive . their mission was to kill every tutsi in bugesera and leave one man who was handicapped but survived the nyamata killings .
hari akamuga ki i nyamata n' ubu kariho kaitwaaga bahinyuza . ko ... kararemaye ubuguru bumeze butya , kagenda kikurura . ||| he was called bahimuza . he was terribly injured at nyamata but he is still alive .
kugira ngo ngo n' umuntu uzaza wese , mu mateka ye azazae abona uko umututsi yasaga . ||| that whoever wanted to know about the history of the tutsi in rwanda would see that man .
ni ukuvuga ngo ntibashakaaga ko hari umututsi n' umwe usigara . ||| that is to say that the interahamwe wanted to wipe out all tutsi .
ubwo ye ... rimwe na rimwe , nkahura n' abantu batorotse ; ni ukuvuga ngo batorotse muri cya kihae cyo kuica muri kiliziya bakabwira amakuru yahoo . bakabwira ukuntu batorotse mu kiliziya ko bateye guru ... mbere na mbere baraje bafata , ||| sometimes i could meet people who had escaped from nyamata church .
bakajya bafata impinja mu kiliziya k' inyamata . noneho ngo bafata impinja , bakaereka ... bakahagurutsa n' umubyeyi w' urwo ruhinja . barangiza bakamumwereka ngo do , ||| they could tell me how the interahamwe killed people ; the interahamwe would take a baby , holding it upside down and showing it to its mother , then they would swing it and hit it on the altar .
bafite ubuguru , ubuguru bw' umwana . umwana acuramye . ngo bakakazunguza bakakakubita kuri aritari umutwe ; ||| people closed their eyes from seeing that act .
abantu bakipfuka gutya . noneho ubwo niwomukino ngo babanjemo bakajya bafata akana bakakakubita kuri aritari . noneho , imperuka igiye kuba , ||| that was the opening of the killings .
mbese bagiye kutera amagrenade . nibwo bafashe umugabo ngo umwe w' igikwerere mwiza baramugarika , baramugaramika , bamukubita intuza ... inkota mu kituza , ||| before they threw grenades on the people in the church , they took a good @-@ looking gentleman and ordered him to lie on his back ; they stubbed him in the chest and blood oozed out .
amaraso aratungereza no hejuru . ubwo nibwo ni nko kufungura urupfu . niko uwo muntu watorotse mu kiliziya yatubwiye . ||| that is how that man who survived nyamata told us .
ubwo nibwo bamaze kumutera inkota , nibwo basohotse batangira banaagamo amagrunede . bamaze kunaagamo amagrunede , nibwo nyuma interahamwe ngo zainjiyemo , ||| after stubbing him , the interahamwe went out of the church and started throwing grenades to the church .
zishaka uwarokotse . uwonguwo yakaotsae atae rero ? yagiye munsi y' intumbi . ||| then they entered and started looking through the dead bodies to see who was still breathing .
we yihishe munsi y' intumbi , yihishe munsi y' intumbi barica ... barica we aza kuvamo nyuma , ||| someone hid under the dead bodies .
nibwo yarokotse aza mbese atangira kuirukanka nk' abandi . ||| he came out after the interahamwe had left and started running with others who were trying to hide .
n' ubu aracyariho ? ||| is he still alive ?
we , aracyariho . ||| yes he is still alive .
ari i bugesair , i nyamata ... ... noneho ubwo turakomeza tubaho gutyo tuihishaan , tuihishaan , ||| he is now in bugesera in nyamata . so , we went on with our life of hiding .
noneho habaaga ... hari akagabo kaitwaaga batanga k' agaterahamwe , paul batanga . yari afite imbunda . ||| there was a man called batanga paul , he was an interahamwe .
we bari baramuhaye mission yo kuica abasore bose , babaga muri ako karerae . kandi umusore uri usigayemo muzima , ugaragara , ||| he had a gun with the mission of killing all young men who were left in that area .
uzi ubwenge , yari uwo grand frere . kuko yari yarize , noneho bamuha mission yo kuguma bianga bikunze azapfae . ||| yet the only cultured boy left in that area was my older brother .
bigenze bite ? ubwo nibwo uwo batanga bamuhaye mission ari ni mugoroba nko mu ma saa moya . kuko hari igihe , ||| because he was educated .
iyo bigeraaga nijoro , nyine ... iyo bigeraaga nijoro ahantu nk' amazu yari akiri , bari batarayasenya , cyangwa n' iyo babaga barayasenyae . ||| therefore that man was given a mission of finding my brother dead or alive .
tukagenda tukatekair nk' ahantu mw' itongo . ubwo bari baraducunze babona ko tutekair muri iryo tongo ry' iwabo . ubwo ... ubwo tuza ... barazamuka ari nimugoroba , hari hariyo abasaza barokotse nyine batarapfa . ||| then at around seven o'clock in the evening ... we used to go to the destroyed houses at night and cook from there .
n' ubwana bose buri kaota . kuko nimugoroba , ubundi , nimugoroba tubaga tuzi ko nta gitero kigomba kuza . ||| because we thought that at night , there was no interahamwe who could attack us .
ubwo ako kagabo baita batanga kazaan n' abo bandagaye , abo baita abandagaye n' ukuvuga ngo ni famille zishyize hamwe ebyiri , zi ... zikora igitero simusiga . baraza nibwo bakainjira bati @: ||| then that man called batanga came with that group called "@ the irresponsible ones @"@ , two family units to make a deadly group .
"@ gendaneza arihae ? @"@ uwo mukuru wanjye yitwa gendaneza ; n' ubu ariho , ni umusilikare . ||| they entered and asked , " where is gendaneza ? @"
ati @: "@ gendaneza arihae ? @" akivuga , ngo @: ||| he immediately threw a grenade and started shouting .
"@ gendaneza arihae ? @" ahita arekura grenade , atangira no kurasa . bahita bagenda , ||| they surrounded the house where the old men used to be .
baragota ; bagota urwo rugo ruri rurimo abo basaza , n' akana , ako kana ko ntakazi kaitwaaga nosenti , ||| in the same house , there was my brother in @-@ law 's kid called innocent .
kari ... kari akana ka murumuna wa muramu wanjye . ‘ niko nvuga . ’ noneho bahita babatwikira mu gikoni , aho ngaho bashumika cya gikoni , ||| they burnt the kitchen where they were ; the kitchen was made out of grass .
ibya ... kiri ik' ibyatsi babatwikiramo , baanga ko basohoka . bahairmo pe ! neza . ||| so , they just ignited the kitchen stopping them from getting out .
ibyo bivaho . ||| they were burnt alive .
bikomeza bityo tuihisha , hapfamo bamwe , ||| life continued like that . we kept on hiding from them , some died , we would be attacked and we kept on hiding .
bukacya igitero kikaza tukairirwa tuiruka , bakapfa . noneho hari , ||| some out of our group would be killed .
abantu bari bazi inzira z' ikinyarwanda ariko ubwo haje kuza si ... mbese uwo mukuru wanjye yari afite i radiyo , hari i radio za kera zaitwaaga mera , hari akaradiyo yari akifite rero , agendana . ||| but my cousin had a small radio called mera .
bucya ... bukwira nako bwa ... bucya , akakahisha ahantu mu gihuru . ||| he used to walk around holding it in his hand but he would hide it in a bush from the public .
tukairirwa tuiruka ... ariko bukwira akakafata akaumva amakuru . ||| the rest of the day we could spend it running and at night he would listen to the news .
kari kakirimo amabuye atarashira . ||| the batteries were not yet discharged by then .
ibyo , eh .. ! tubaga tubifite erega aho tubaga tuihishe . kuko turavugaaga , ||| we used to have those weapons expecting to use them to protect your life .
tuti @: ||| however not every one of us still had them .
« umuntu nkugeraho ushobora kuitanga . » ariko bibaga bikisigaraanye abantu bakeya , ntabwo ari bose ni ukuvuga ngo tugiye tuaka ... tuifashaish abantu babifite , bagize nk' ubwoba bwo kugira ngo tujyane . ||| but we borrowed the weapons from the people who still had them yet they were afraid to join us .
abaemeye ko tujyana bageraaga kuri makumyabiri na bane , kuko ba ... tujyaaga tuumva amakuru y' abantu ba ... tujyaaga tugenda urusororongo . ||| we left when we were about 24 in number .
hariho n' abatugiye inberae , ukajya kaumva ngo bapfairiye ahantu kuri nyabarongo , bataranambuka babaroha muri nyabarongo . ||| we all knew each other because we were following each other in a line . there was a group , which left before us and after sometime , we heard that they were thrown in nyabarongo river .
ni ukuvuga ngo iyo abantu bagendaaga abandi bagiraaga ubwoba , bati @: "@ baragenda babicirae inberae ni hahanri . @" kuko nta bantu na bamwe bigeze bagenda , ||| therefore , most people would be afraid to go because , even those who left , did not survived .
ngo bagerae iyo bagiye . bahitaaga babicira mu nzira . ||| no one had ever left for somewhere and got there ; they would be killed on the way .
noneho , ubwo abiyemeje ngo bagiye i burunri ni hahanri ntibazaguma biruka . ||| people would wonder if those who went to burundi stopped running .
bagera inberae bakabicira mu nzira , ni uko bijyaaga bigenda . ||| were n't they killed on the way ?
noneho hakabaho rero abagira ubwoba bwo kugenda . ||| generally there were some people who were afraid of moving .
bati @: ' tuzakomeza tuirukae ariko ntabwo tugiye kuicirwa mu nzira , bati @: ibingibi biri bitubeshejeho tuiirukair tukabona turarokotse , ||| they would prefer running around in the neighbourhood to dying on their way going somewhere . therefore , they would stay behind saying ; "@ we are used to running and we survive by chance .
bati @: « ni hahanri turagenda , ahubwo bahitae batuicira n' ahandi tutazi tugeze . » ||| it is all the same , we can go and die in a place where we have never been before . @"
noneho twebwe tuishyira hamwe nijoro , nko mu ma saa moya , tufashe urugendo . ariko tuva aho tufashe intego y' uko hagomba ... tugomba kupfa n' uwa nyuma akapfa . ||| at around seven o'clock in the morning , we got up and agreed with each other that we must defend ourselves , no matter what would happen , we should fight .
tugomba kurwana nibatuvumbura , ||| we decided we were no longer going to run .
apana ibyo kuiruka , ntabwo ukuiruka utazi ahantu uri kuirukair . nibae n' ubwo tuirukaaga tuzi akarere k' iwacu , tuvuga ngo turihishair aha ; ||| we used to run because we were at home ; we knew the hiding places , and the best bushes .
eh ! tuzi utuyira ... ibihuru byiza tuzi ahantu tukuihisha . ariko turavuze , ||| but then , we did n't know the place . the place where we were going was new to us . and we did not know where to run and hide .
tuti @: ' nitugenda muihanganae ntihagirae ... tuti @: ||| we decided not to run even if we met the attackers .
« tupfae nk' abagabo . tuti @: uwa nyuma nyine , apfae yemerae apfae nawe akirwana . » ||| we decided to fight for our lives . and even if we all died and there remained only one of us , that person was asked to die like a man ; fighting for his life .
ubwo tuba tufashe inzira nka saa moya . turamanutse tuikubise mu kabande , ||| we walked down the hill towards the valley . it was around seven o'clock in the morning .
mu gishanga . turagiye tugenda iruhande rwa nyabarongo , ku nkuka ya nyabarongo nraibuka ko tugiye amajoro atatu n' iminsi itatu . ni ukuvuga ngo iyo nshyizemo iminsi ; ||| through the swamp we reached the banks of river nyabarongo . we walked for three nights and three days .
umunsi iyo ucyaaga tujyaaga ahantu mu nkuka tukihisha neza hasi . ||| at daytime we would hide .
noneho , bukwira tukagenda iruhande rw' inkuka . ariko nraibuka ko hari ahantu tugeze ; ni ukuvuga ngo turagiye turagenda ... turagenda ... turagenda ! ||| and at night , we would walk by the riverside .
tuza kugera ahantu nyine inkotanyi zi ... zageze . ni ukuvuga ngo zairukanye interahamwe , interahamwe ziragenda nazo , zihungira ahantu mu rutoki . ||| we walked for a long time and finely reached a place where rpf had already chased the interahamwe .
zishinga ikambi ... inkambi mu rutoki . urwo rutoki ruri inzitanae , ndetse no muri uko kugenda twebwe , tufataanaga ishati ; ||| after chasing them , they went and camped somewhere in a very big banana plantation . the banana plantation was very bushy ; we walked holding one another 's shirts in order not to break away from each other .
umwe inyuma y' undi . ni ukuvuga ngo turi abantu makumyabiri na bane , ibaze tukajya ku murongo , umwe akafata ishati y' undi . ||| you can imagine a line of twenty @-@ four people through a bushy plantation .
noneho tuza kugera ahantu muri urwo rutoki rw' inzitanae , tubona umuriro uraaka , mbese mu rutoki . eh .. ! ||| at some point we saw fire and asked one another , "@ what is the fire about ? @"
tuti ibi n' iki ? ||| no one knew .
ubwo tuba tubanyuzemo neza . ah .. , abagore kusa benshi . noneho tuanga kubavugaish . ||| so , we went ahead and passed through the camp of interahamwe , but we saw it was only children and women . we passed through the camp and did not talk them .
twebwe tukifataaniye umwe ku wunri umurongo ; tubacamo hagati na hagati . ||| we were still holding each other 's shirt .
turaongera tugeze hirya .. , tuhita tuisubirair mu nkuka iwacu . ni ukuvuga ngo aho twiyemeje kugenda ; ||| we continued until we reached the other side of the river and then walked by the riverside .
ubwo buba bugiye kucya nko mu ma saa kumi , nibwo twacyebutse inyuma , ||| it was almost coming to morning around four o'clock .
uw' inyuma , umuntu w' inyuma abona umugore yamukurikiye .. , yadukurikiye , amurebye abona ni interahamwe kabisa ! ||| then the last person on the line looked back and saw a woman who had followed us all the way , when he looked clearly at her , he found out that she was interahamwe .
noneho umugore nawe yaratubonye , ati @: aba bantu si abacu ; ||| then that woman also noticed that we were not her people .
ahita asubirayo yiruka . aravuduka , ||| she went back running and called others .
ariruka pe ! ageze ruguru ahita ajya kutabaza bene wabo . nibwo rero bamanutse batuvugiriza induru , batuvugairije induru uraumva ko bigombaaga kutatana . ||| they came shouting and , remember we had agreed not to run but we forgot and got scattered ; we were traumatized .
bibinri twiyemeje byo kuvuga ngo @: ... ngo ntituzatataane , kubera ko turi turahahamutse nyine tuba turatataanye . nibwo tutangiye kuihisha , ||| then we hid separately in nyabarongo river .
mu ... mu ... ukutandukanye . kuihisha byo turi turabimenyereye , kuburyo umuntu yajyaaga neza neza mu mazi , agasigaza umutwe kusa wo kuhumeka ; ||| one had to lift the head out for air .
nabwo yakaumva umuntu agiye kumegeraho akaba ya ya ... yacengera mu mazi akamaramo akanya gato akazamuka , ||| when you heard a person coming then you would sink in the water for a few seconds , and then if there was nobody nearby , we would put our heads out .
ni uko tuihishaaga . ||| that was our way of hiding .
noneho baratuja , interahamwe zijagata muri iyo nkuka ariko ziratubura . ni nk' imaan yatugenzeho nta numawe baishe . ||| the perpetrators chilled and moved around the riverside but they did not see us . it seemed like god was with us .
ubwo bararambairw baranazamuka . ||| then they got tired and left .
ubwo bawije tugenda tushakana ; tumaze hafi isaha tushakana . umwe akahamagara @: ||| it was getting dark . so , for about an hour we started searching for one another .
‘ kana , ’ [ ikivugirizo ] niyo signe [ ikimenyetso ] yacu . tukavugiriza , ||| we whistled our names because that was our sign .
tukabona bose baraje ; ||| everyone was around .
tuesae turaongera tusubira uko turi tumeze . turaongera tufataan intuza imipira mu mipira . ||| we held each other 's shirts and walked on a line again .
jugujugu turagenda ... turenga aho ngaho . ||| after that place , we did not meet other hardships in other places .
ni ukuvuga ngo ahandi hose tugeze hari paradizo ! ||| it seemed to be paradise .
nta kintu tuumvaaga gikomakoma . turavuze , tuti @: ‘ ibi ntibisanzwe ! ||| because we could n't understand it . it was too unusual for us to move without hiding .
’ noneho turagiye ... ubwo uraumva buri bumaze kwira . tugenda iryo joro ryose ... mbese bugiye kucya , tuanga kuihisha ; mbese nko mu ma saa kumi . ||| therefore , we moved ahead and night was falling .
mu a saa kumi burya activites ziba zatangiye . [ ibikorwa by' abantu ] . ni ukuvuga , ngo @: ||| we also found that unusual .
tugiye kubona tubona nta nyoni itamba ; ||| we continued walking the whole night and when it was almost dawn , we did not hide instead we continued to walk .
nko mu ma saa kumi , saa kumi n' imwe ... bishyira saa kumi n' imwe , ||| at around four o'clock in the morning , there was nothing moving .
tukabona nta nyoni itamba uuh ! ||| [ of course at around four in the morning some activities take place ] . but that time there was none .
tukakomeza tukaigendera , saa kumi n' ebyiri tubona nta nyoni itamba ! ahubwo tutangira kubona inka , ||| around four thirty there was still no activity or action [ openly taking place ] .
tutangira kubona inka ziragiye nta muntu uziriho ; eh ! tuti , ‘ ibi ni iki ? ||| at around five in the morning , there was not a single activity , not even birds singing .
’ noneho , turakomeza turagenda tu ! tuti @: ‘ ariko twiyemeje noneho , ||| on the other hand , at around six in the morning , we started seeing cows without a shepherd ; we were surprised .
ubu ni ukupfa no kupfa , turakomeje turagiye ... tuza kugira ikibazo , cyo kuambuka nyabarongo , kugirango tugae ku wunri musozi wa juru . ||| we continued to walk but later on we had a problem of how we were going to cross nyabarongo in order to go to juru hill .
noneho , ah ... uwo mu type uri uturangaje inberae yari azi utuyira ; aza kutubwira ko hari ahantu nyabarongo ishamikira . ni ukuvuga ngo igira itya yagenda igashamikamo utuntu tw' utu ... utugezi , ||| then the young boy who was leading us who knew shortcuts told us that river nyabarongo branches off somewhere .
ati @: « ntahazi tugende . » n' aho hantu rero , ||| and he assured us that he knew the place .
hari ukaongera kugenda nk' umunsi wose . turaongera turakubanuka ... ni ukuvuga , ||| but to reach that point , it would require another whole hour .
ngo @: tutaye ahantu turi kuhita tugera ako kanya , tubanje kujya kushaka ako kayira . turagiye ... , ||| we walked and reached that point and then he dived in .
tugeze kuri ako kagezi gatoya , tuikubisemo . uwo muhungu hamugeraaga nk' aha kandi yari muremure ‘ mu katuza . ||| the water level was up to his chest and yet he was tall .
’ twebwe nk' abana batushyira ku rutugu . ||| they had to put young boys like us on their shoulders .
ubwo tuba tugize imaan turakaambutse ; tukaambuka nta nduru kandi hari ku manywa , ||| we crossed it without any one shouting at us yet it was daytime .
ubundi turi turamenyereye kugenda ninjoro . nta muntu tuumva ukomakoma ku musozi . ||| normally we were used to walking at night when nobody at the hill could see us .
twebwe turiyemeza tuti @: ‘ tujyae ku musozi . ’ ||| but this time we decided to walk and climb the hill .
tuva mu nkuka , ni ukuvuga ngo @: tuzamuka imusozi ; ||| we got out of the river and went up the hill .
tuzamutse imusozi uraumva turi tumaze iminsi itatu n' ama .. , iminsi itatu n' amajoro atatu , tutarya ! nibwo tugize dutya tubona , ||| we had spent three days and three nights without eating .
tugeze ahantu ku rutoke ! urabona ibitoki bya ker ... nk' umuntu ... yabaga ari iki ? yabaga ari umututsi baramutorongeje mu muraima we , ibitoki bikinekesha . ||| we walked up and came across a banana plantation , which belonged to tutsi people who had fled their properties .
tubonamo nk' igitoki cyanetse tukirwanairho . abatusumba bakajya kurwanair hejuru , ibiguye hasi akaba ari byo jyewe nfata . kuko nri umwana , ||| the bananas were ripening and we were all grabbing them ; those who were tall could grab a banana from up high and those of us who we young like me would pick the ones that were falling .
nkarya . noneho abandi batangira kujya mu mirima y' imyumbati barakura , uh .. ! nta nduru turaumva n' imwe , ||| others went to a cassava plantation .
nta muntu uratukoma ! tuti @: ‘ ibi ntabwo ari amahoro kabisa ! ’ ubwo wa muhungu aravuga ati , ||| all that time there was no distraction , no one shouting , eh ... it was unbelievable .
aratuhagarika ; ni nkawe uri utuyoboye . arangije ati @: « tukomezae urugendo . » ||| that man had taken up the responsibility to be our leader ; he stopped us and asked us to continue our journey .
turaongera turagae ... , ntabwo tuigeraaga tugenda ikivunge , tutondaaga umurongo . turagiyee .. , ||| we never walked in anarchy , we walked in a line .
ubwo tugeze , urabona nk' uyu tuvugae ko ari umuhanda principale , hano hari akayira , noneho .. , ||| then we reached near the main road but the same man who was like our leader told us to wait before we crossed .
uyu tuvugae ko ari akayira turimo , hano hari umuhanda principale tugiye kuikubitamo . noneho muri ako kayira tugeze nk' aha , uwo muhungu aratubwira , ||| he advised us to hide in the banana plantation and let him go to spy the situation .
ati @: « mubae muhagaze . ati mwebwe mwihishe mu ntoki , ati @: ||| he had a spear .
ngewe nragiye , » yari nfite icumu . aragenda , twebwe turihisha mu rutoki , ||| he told us that , if we heard him scream we would know that he had been caught , which meant death .
tuti nitwumva .. , aratubwira , ngo @: ||| therefore , we should run away .
« nimwumva nvugije induru , mumenye ko tayari bagiye kunyica , ||| he went and reached the main road .
mwihu ... muirukae . ||| he looked ahead of him and saw nothing .
ubwo aragiyee .. , ageze muri wa muhanda principale gutya agikandagizamo ikirenge , arebye ruguru abona nta kintu kiriyo , akebutse amaso hepfo ahita abona umusirikare . ||| when he looked behind him , he saw a soldier wearing a cap .
umusirikare muremure yari yambaye agashapo , ka songa mbere aka ... aka kagofero kano k' inkotanyi ; yambaye baotae , yambaye tisheti [ umupira ] y' umuhondo , ||| he was a tall man wearing a yellow t @-@ shir with inkontanyi uniform trousers .
nta gishati cya gisirikare yari yambaye hejuru , yambaye i pantaro ya mukotanyi , akenyeye igitenge mu nda gutya akihambiriye . ||| he was wearing gumboots with a piece of cloth tied to his waist .
noneho umusirikare nibwo yaje kumwita ... kumwisobanuraho , ati @: "@ jyewe ndi uwanyu ! eh , ||| then the soldier told him that he was of the same side with him .
umuhungu yumva ... ntabwo yamwitambuweho ... ntabwo ari we yabwiye . ahubwo yaramubwiye , ati @: "@ genda uzanae bagenzi bawe mwari muri kumwe ! @" ||| and then the soldier asked him to go and call the rest who were hiding .
eh .. ! noneho umuhungu arabaza ati @: ‘ umuntu unbwiye ngo ngendae , koko aranshakira amahoro , ||| so , the guy left but doubting his coming back .
uwagenda nkahita nigumairyo ? ’ noneho tuti ni inkotanyi tu ! ubwo aragiye , aragiye ntanamukurikiye ! ||| he thought that the soldier wanted him to bring those who were hiding with him so he could kill us together . but he did not fear much so he said maybe he is an inkotanyi .
aragiye ... ati cyangwa aragirango tuegeraan sha atuicirae hamwe , ati @: ariko nta kibazo . araza aratubwira amaze kutubwira turaza . ||| so the guy came and told us the whole story and then he took us to where the soldier was .
abantu ... uraumva ba bantu makumyabiri na batatu , tuesae tuba tubaye makumyabiri na bane . ||| imagine a line of all the twenty @-@ three people plus him making twenty @-@ four .
tukigera aho tu ... tubona ni nka ... ni nka bataillon ! ||| as we had reached there , we saw almost a battalion that was hiding in the same place where we were .
ivuye hahanri turi turi hose , ||| we could n't tell where they were from .
baraje bahise batugota . ||| they just surrounded us .
eh ! aba bantu baturutse he ? tuumva ubwoba turatangira turatitira tuti turapfuye , ||| we were trembling and thought that our death had come .
eh .. ! tuti sha ... tutangira kaumva mu mitima yacu tuvuga , tuti @: utuzanye mu rupfu . ||| in our hearts we were cursing the guy that he had led us into death .
noneho baratangira baratubaza , ngo @: " murava he mukajya he ? @" baraongera baratubaza , ||| then the soldiers started to ask us where we were coming from and where we were heading to .
tubabwira ko tuvuye i bugesair ; ubwo tubabwira uko bimeze noneho nta kibazo . batangira kutubaza , ||| we told them that we were from bugesera .
bati @: "@ ese abandi basigaye bameze batae ? bataratubwira ko ari inkotanyi . bati abandi se musize bameze batae ? @" ||| until then they had n't told us that they were inkotanyi . then they asked us again , "@ how are the people who remained behind ? @"
tuti @: ‘ tusize nta kigenda abantu bari kuica , abandi ni inkomerae barashaka kubasonga , ||| we told them , "@ everything is going wrong ; people are being killed , others are injured .
mbese bimeze nabi . ||| generally the situation is too bad . @"
bati @: "@ muhumurae rero muri abacu .. , turi abanyu . ||| then they asked us to calm down , "@ we are on the same side . @"
bati @: ||| they told us .
« ese umuhu ... umukobwa ... » , batangira kutubaza umukobwa ujyaaga ajya ku mulindi ; w' iwacu iyo i bugesair ajya kusura inkotanyi . bati : ||| then they started to ask us about a lady who was living in our village bugesera . they said that she used to visit them in mulindi .
"@ kanaka aracyariho ? @" tuti @: aracyariho ariko bamutemye ukuguru . ati @: ||| we told them that she was still alive but the perpetrators had cut of her leg .
« yewe ! ati @: nrarara ngezeyo . » ||| then one of them said that before the end of the day he would have reached there .
ubwo turishima , tutangira kuvuga cyane , bibinri byo kaongorera biba birashize . ||| we were so happy and we started talking loudly and we forgot about the tactic of whispering .
turatangira turaseka , turishima , ||| we started to laugh and became generally happy .
tuti @: mushaka mutaicae ubu tubabonye ; tuti @: iyaba mwatwiyiciraga tukavaho . ||| we told them that since we have seen them , no one else is going to kill us unless they killed us themselves .
eh ! baumvise tusakuje bahindura isura . ||| suddenly they stopped us from shouting .
bati @: "@ nta soni ! bati @: mucecekae muumvae , ||| they said , "@ listen ! @"
" baumva ... tuumva imbunda zivugair hafi aho koko . nibwo ba ... tuhise tuceceka , tuti @: karabaye [ avuga yongorera ] . ||| we heard gunshots not far from where we were .
ubwo baratuhagurutsa tuesae , tutonda umusururu nyine umurongo baratujyana .. , batugejeje inberae , bati @: ||| then they told us to stand up and hide in the banana plantation .
mubae mugiye aho mu rutoki mwicaremo , batwicaje mu rotoki . tuti bagiye kuturasairmo hano . tugiye kubona tubona umurongo nk ' abantu bagera kuri magana abiri , ||| then we saw a line of about 200 soldiers passing on the road where we were .
barahise b' abasilikare , inkotanyi zikoreye ibitwaro , batambuka , bamaze kutambuka ntawe tuba tuvuyemo . ||| they were lifting heavy weapons .
baraongeye baratujyanye , batueretse ahantu hari inzu bati @: "@ mubae ahangaha , bati @: ||| then we joined the line , we were shown a house where we were going to be living , and they asked us to eat .
uwaba arya umuntu uwaba arya iki , icyo ashaka atubwirae tukimuzanirae , bati @: ariko muryae . @" ||| they said , "@ even if it means to eat man 's flesh we shall bring it to you but make sure you eat . @"
ubwo nibwo , tutangiye kaumva tubayeho neza , tutangira kurya , abasore bamaze kutora ubuyanja bari baturimo , ||| then we became so excited because our life had improved .
batangira kujya mu nkotanyi , mu gisirikare . ||| we had started getting food , some of us who had gained stamina asked to join the rpf .
muri make ni uko ubuzima bwanjye bwage .. , nba mu ... nkambi gatoya ni nabwo batuvanye aho kuri juru batujyana .. , ||| in brief that is how life went ... i even lived in the refugee camp shortly , it is the nkotanyi members who took me there in juru .
batujyana aho baita i nyagasambu nsanga aho , nanone izindi mpunzi cyangwa abandi barokotse babashyize ; ||| later they took me to nyagasambu , where i found several other refugees [ i could call them survivors ] .
hashize igihe gitoya nnjyae ninjira mu gisirikare . nba umusirikare , ||| we stayed there for a while and after i joined the rpf army and i became a soldier .
ubundi muri make ni uko ubuzima bwanjye bugenze , kusa icyo kihae abantu bari ibikoko . kusa ntinzi ikintu kiri cyara .. , njyewe n' ubu njya nbiibaza nti @: ||| during that time , people were very hostile ; sometimes i wonder and ask myself what had happened to the hutu .
‘ umuhutu muri icyo kihae yari ameze atae ? yari ameze atae , ||| i can not imagine how they were thinking during that period .
umutima ukuntu yari awufite , umuntu kufata umuhoro akatema uwunri ? nkiro ... tuki ... nkirokoka ho ; ||| i wonder where their hearts had gone . someone reaching a point of getting hold of a machete just to hack his fellow human being !
ni ukuvuga ngo intambara ikirangira nravugaaga nti @: ‘ ntabwo nzaongera kuvugana n' umuhutu bibaho . ||| after the genocide i thought that i would never talk to a hutu for the rest of my life .
’ kuko numvaaga meze nabi cyane , numvaaga umuhutu ari umwanzi kweri ! ||| i hated the hutu so badly . i knew they were real enemies .
nbonaaga umuhutu nkaumva , muri make ntahahamutse nkaumva akwaiye kupfa nawe . ||| and every time i would see a hutu , i would almost be traumatized . whenever i would see a hutu i would wish them death .
muri make rero ni uko ubuzima bwanjye bugenze bw' intambara nkaba nriho . ||| in brief , that is how i lived during the war until i survived .
igihe mwari muri mu rutoki aho uwo musore aza kubabwira , ati @: "@ nhuye n' umusirikare aranbwira ngo @: muzae tukoranae , yabibabwiye atae ? ||| when you were in the banana plantation , how did that gentleman come to you and convince you that he met a soldier and he is asking him to take all of you to him ?
yaje , we yaraje ataitira , yaje nyine asa nk' ufite ubwoba turi dusanganywe , ||| he came shaking and he looked so afraid .
ati @: "@ sha ati muzae ati @: baranbwiye ngo nimuzae muesae . ati @: ||| and then he said , "@ i was told to call all of you .
simbizi , niba ari inkotanyi ... niba ari inkotanyi turakira , ||| but i am not sure if the guy is an inkotanyi .
niba ari interahamwe turapfa , ||| in case he is one then we will have survived and if he is an interahamwe then we will die .
ati nimuzae . @" ||| but come , let 's go . @"
ntawe tuza tufite ubwoba , ||| we followed him but we were afraid .
tufite uko gukekeranya , ubwo nibwo tuhageze tubazaw ibyo bibazo , tumaze kubazaw ibyo bibazo , baratuimenyaish ubwo tuba tuumva turakize . ||| then we were asked the questions i told you above , and then they told us who they were . after which , we felt at ease .
aho mwari mutuye ku gacentre uri utuyeho n' umuryango wawe , ntabwo umenya uko bigenze ? ||| you were living with your family at the market centre , do you know what happened to them ?
ikibazo ntikiumvikana ! ||| q ...
ubundi mu gisirikare nbayeyo , ba ... baje ku kututwara ngo tujyae mu gisirikare nba i nyagasambu . ndetse mu kugenda kwanjye , ||| we were taken to join the army in nyagasambu .
ngeze i nyagasambu nsanzeyo umushangazi umwe , n' umukecuru . ngeraanyo n' aga petit frere ako turokokaanye kaitwa rwikangura john . ||| i found my aunt and my younger cousin whom i survived with called rwikangura john .
noneho tuba ahongaho , tutangira ubuzima bwo gusagata . ||| we started a life of looting .
tubagaho mu buryo bwo gusagata , tukagenda mu baturagae , ||| we would sometimes go to villages and loot .
rimwe na rimwe n' uko gusagata n' ubwo turokotse hari abapfaagamo ... abapfairiyeyo . ||| there were some people who lost their lives then .
mukagenda mugasagata mu misozi interahamwe zikabavumburayo zikabicirayo . ubwo nba muri ubwo buzima , nibwo rero haje abo bagabo b' abasirikare uwo mu capitaine ; ||| sometimes the interahamwe would see us . we were so lucky to survive . later on , there came a soldier he had the rank of a captain .
araza aratubwira ngo abashaka kujya mu gisirikare , ||| he asked if there was any person who wanted to join the army .
ngenda ntorotse . ||| i joined the army without telling anyone because i would be asked so many questions .
ako ga petit frere kanjye niko kari kabizi konyine , uwo mushangazi nanze ko abimenya kuko yari kunbuza . ||| i only let know my cousin .
ndatoroka mpita ngenda nta nubwo nkoze imyitozo myinshi cyane ya gisirikare , kusa hari aho kutabara . ni ukuvuga kujya ku rugamba . ubwo ntabwo ngiye ku muriro ngo nrwanae , ||| i did much training , although i did not go to the front to fight .
kusa ngiye mu unitae baitaaga , unitae baita @: "@ general headquarters , " yari ishinzwe kutarura ama kajoriti ( inkomerae ) no kutanga umusada w' amasasu , ||| but i joined the unit that was known as the "@ general headquarters @" which was concerned with gathering the wounded people , supplying bullets and food .
ibiryo , ibintu nk' ibyo . ni uko igisirikare nkikoze . ||| that 's the role i played in the army and how i can not tell you how i left .
mu kuvayo rero ni ibanga ryanjye , ntinzi ko npfa ku kubivuga neza . ||| it is my secret .
icyatumye ujya mu gisirikare ni iki ? ||| why did you join the army ?
igituma , cyane cyane ni ibintu nka bitatu @: icya mbere , numvaaga kubwanjye , ||| there are about three reasons why i joined the army ; the first one was the bad impression i had of the hutu .
numvaaga remord nfite y' umuhutu kunza . nkavuga kweri umunyagaw w' umuhutu , nkaumva ko intambara itazapfa irangiye , mu buzima bwanjye . ||| i felt like the war would never end .
ati ... ko agomba kuza aka nyica bianga bikunda , ariko noneho nravuga nti @: ' reka nzae nkuerekae . ||| therefore , i had to join the army and get trained and maybe own a gun so that in case i was attacked , i would be able to fight back and then go and save others who were still being killed .
reka nzae njyae mu gisirikare , ||| i had left them behind .
niyo yaza asangae nfite imyitozo ya gisirikare , cyangwa nfite imbunda nshobora kumurwanya . ’ ikindi cya kabili @: ||| secondly , i wished to be a hero .
numvaaga nshaka kukomeza , nnjyae cyane cyane ntabarae ; ntabarae abari kukomeza kupfa . kuko nnjyae numvaaga nrabasize inyuma . ||| i wanted to save those who were still being killed , well i had left them behind but i wished to go back and save them .
icya gatatu @: ni ubwo buzima nri nbayeho , ahongaho mu buhungiro . nkavuga ngo reka nvae muri ubu buzima njyae mu gisirikare wenda niho bizamerair neza . ||| thirdly , i joined the army because the life i was leading in the refugee camp was horrible . therefore , i decided to join hoping to find a slightly better life .
wowe iyo urebye , ukurikije ibyo unyuzemo ubona u rwanda ruri kugana he ? ||| given the life you experienced , where do you think rwanda is heading ?
mu ruhae rwego ? ku rwanda muri rusangae cyangwa ku .. , ni mu rwego rwa politique ? ||| are you asking me rwanda at large or you are asking me the political point of view ?
ntakubaza muri rusangae . ||| i am asking you in general .
ubundi , bidatewe .. , ubundi muri uru rwanda abanyarwanda maze kubona ko turi abantu , ||| generally , i have come to realize that rwandans are wise people .
turi abantu b' indyarya . tuzi ubwenge ariko turi n' indyarya . ||| we are wise but hypocrites .
ni ukuvuga ngo abanyarwanda turamutse tubaye abantu bakingutse , bakinkukiraanye nikonavuga ; bashobora kubwizanya ukuri . u rwanda ubona rujya ahantu heza . ||| if rwandans were open to one another , i mean they can be honest towards each other ; the future of rwanda would be good .
ni ukuvuga ngo mu rwanda rwacu hari abantu b' inyangamugayo ariko harimo n' abandi ba ruryi bakimeze ... bakifite inda zi .. , zijya inberae , ||| in my country rwanda there are honest people , however there are also others who are still greedy .
bashyize inda inberae . rero u rwanda rwacu ururebye , ururebye inberae gutya ubona ari u rwanda rujya ahantu heza . rufite vision nziza . ||| if you critically observe rwanda , you will find that rwanda has a good vision .
ariko mu kihae hataje za kirobya nk' ibiakair , ||| the only condition is that some of its people do not become selfish .
ngo abantu bashyirae inda inberae . kandi bigenda bigaragara , ugenda ubibona ko hari abantu bafite inyungu zabo . ||| it has been happening , people who put their personal interests forward .
bashyize inda inberae . jyae niko nbibona . ||| sometimes i say they are selfish .
ikibazo ntikiumvikana ! ||| q ...
ubundi njyewe , kera mu gisirikare nibwo bigeze kuvuga , ngo @: « ariko uje tukajya kukusibaish iyi nkovu yawe ! » ||| sometime ago when i was still in the army , i was asked if i could accept to be taken abroad and get my scar removed but i refused .
ngo banjyanae hanze ! nrabianga , nrabianga , nti @: ||| i told those people that my scar would stay as y souvenir of the genocide , because i personally do n't find it easy to forget the genocide .
' njyewe nimundekere inkovu , inkovu izaba amateka . kuko jyewe ku bwanjye numva jenoside ntashobora kuyibagirwa , ntibibaho . ||| never .
nnjyae ikintu nshaka ku , ubundi nshaka kukora , ntashaka kuba inararibonye , mu mateka y' u rwanda . ||| i want to appear in the history of rwanda .
ntinzaibagirwae ibiambayeho , nbibwirae n' ubuvivi n' ubuvivure niko nvuga , umuntu uzanturukaho wese abimenye , amenye ko genocide ari mbi . ||| i will never forget what happened to me and i will tell it to my grandchildren and my great grand children . whoever will generate from my family will have to learn that genocide is very bad .
kandi njyae ... ni ukuvuga ngo @: njyae mpora nyamagana . ukuyamagana kwanjye ngaragaza ibibi bibayemo ; ||| i will expose what was in it [ genocide ] .
ni ukuvuga ngo kuko jyewe biambayeho nbigaragazae nk' uko n' ubu nbibabwirair inberae . ||| the way i am now giving you this testimony .
ubona ibibazo bikomoka kuri jenoside , bizaffecta abana bawe [ bizagira ingaruka ku bana bawe ] n' ubuvivi bwawe ? ||| do you believe that consequences of the genocide will affect your offspring ?
yee ! biza affecta [ bizagira ingaruak ] kuko ; nk' ubu jyae nbaye responsable w' aba rescapes nkaiga aho baita i shyogwe muri kitaarama . ||| it will affect them because already now i became the person responsible for survivors by the time i was in a school in shyogwe in gitarama .
nkagerageza kaumva abana , abana bakajya banbwira ibibazo byabo , ||| i try to listen to the children and to understand their problems .
ukasanga nk' umuntu uturutse hanze , sibyo ? ntabyo yabonye n' amaso , ||| someone did not see what took place during the genocide , for example the people who came from the neighbouring countries and who did not see what happened besides hearing it from people .
ariko ku ... kubimubwira kusa , tuvugae ubimubwiye . ukasanga ... cyangwa ukaumva arashaka kuza mu muryango aba rescapes . ||| well some of these people say that they want to join the survivors association .
ati @: « jyewe ntashaka kuza mu muryango w' aba rescapes . » kuko azi ububabare bwabo . ndetse hakabaho n' igihe ahahamuka . ||| some join and sometimes get traumatised after hearing people 's testimonies within the association .
urwo ni ... ni urugero rworoshye . noneho nkanjyae rero ubyaye , ||| that is a simple example .
tuvugae nimbyara umwana wanjye nka bimubwira , nkanamwereka ... nkanamwereka ingaruka mbi , ||| but i personally if i get my own children , i will tell my children the stories of genocide and show them the consequences of it .
nkamwereka exemple n' igikomere , cyangwa nani inkovu nfite ya genocide yo muri 94 . ||| i will show them my scar of the 1994 genocide .
bizaba ari ikibazo , ||| i know it will be hard .
umwana wanjye agomba kubibika mpaka ! kusa impungenge wenda nfite , ni uko hariho abantu bazakomeza kumanjirirwa nk' abo bahutu ; bazakomeza bamanjirirwe , ||| but my children will have to keep it at heart . but i am worried because there are some people , the hutu for example who will keep on harassing my kids .
tuzajya tubivuga bamanjirirwe , iyo niyo mpungenge nfite nti est @-@ cae @-@ que bazatinyuka ? ||| but i really wonder if they will one day feel free to live with us with no worries ?
baongerae babanae ntawe neza baumvae bisanganywe ntibi ... nba numva bitashoboka ntinzi uko nbivuga . ||| i find it impossible , i do n't know how i can put it .
noneho nraumva ushobora kutanga nka message [ ubutumwa ] , uha isi yose cyangwa n' abantu bashobora kaumva ubu buhamya . ||| is there any particular message you would like to pass to the world at large especially to those who will came across this testimony .
amafaranga ntakinri amaze , niba ukunda u rwanda , kandi wunva uvuga ngo @: ||| money has no value if you do n't use it appropriately .
ubwiyunge bw' abanyarwanda uhora ubushyira inberae , bierekanae . fata ba bana bari kugwa aho ngaho , bari kubura amashuri ubaegerezae ubatungae mu rugo rwawe . ||| but sincerely if you are a nationalist and you really need reconciliation among rwandans then show that love , take in the orphans who are starving out there , who have no school , take them in and raise them in your home .
twe kushyira inberae inda kusa zacu , ||| let 's not be selfish .
ahubwo turebae abanyarwanda muri rusangae . nidukundana nibwo igihugu cyacu kizatera inberae . kandi icyambere ni ukukunda igihugu , aho kugira ngo tukundae ... buriya hari umugabo njya nemera perezida wacu wa repubulika , ||| rwandans in general , we should love one another that is how we will be able to develop our country .
ni umugabo . ni umugabo perezida , kuko we akunda igihugu n' abanyarwanda . kusa , ||| i like our president because he loves his country and the people in the country , which i find very wise .
imaan izamufashe akoranae n' abantu bakunda igihugu , ||| may god bless him . i wish he works together with people who love the country and the nation at large , and then our country will develop .
bakunda abanyarwanda . kugirango igihugu cyacu tukizamurae . ||| to love the people who love their country and rwandans in order do develop it .
nraumva ari aho ... ariyo message [ ubutumwa ] ntanga @: ‘ kuba umunyarwanda yakundana n' undi ; kandi akaharanira i gihugu cye . ||| the message i can pass on to all rwandans is to love one another and strive for the improvement of our country .
’ niko nvuga . ikindi nraongera nbisubiraemo @: ‘ umuntu wese wibeshya gupfobya genocide ... ijambo genocide uwo ni ukumwamaganira kure . ||| the other thing is and i will not stop repeating it , anyone who denies the genocide should be opposed .
’ murakoze . ||| thank you .
ariko ubwo hagati aho , ubwo baza kuica murugo nyine , baje ari benshi abazanye intwaro , abafite impiri , ||| when they came home to kill , they were very many . some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons .
abafite iki , ||| so they came home and found us there .
ni uko batusanga nyine aho turi turi mu rugo kuko turi abantu benshi cyane , hari n' abari babashije kuhungira mu rugo abari hafi abari batuegereye , kuko babonaaga ko nta hanri hantu bashobora kuba ba ... ba ... baca cyangwa se bakwitabaza . ||| we were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else .
bahitamo kuza mu rugo rero kugirango tuifatanyae , ubwo niba ari ukurokoka turokokae cyangwa se niba ari igihe cyo kupfa nyine ubwo tupfae . ||| therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together .
nibwo rero nyine bije kuba , ok nbasha kuvamo , ||| so it happened but ... well , i managed to escape .
ubwo baje ari mu kihae cya saa kumi n' ebyiri nigice . baza ari benshi , kiri nk' igitero cy' abantu bagera hafi nko kuri magana abiri , ||| they came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people .
kuko habanje abasirikare bafite imbunda , ||| soldiers came first and then the interahamwe followed .
nyuma y' aho nibwo haje kuza mo interahamwe , ariko nazo zikaba zo zari zitegereje ko uri bubashae kurokoka asimbuka nabo babashae uburyo bashobora kuba bamurangiriza nyine , ||| they [ interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] .
ibyabo baitaaga ngo ni ukurangiza . ||| they used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ .
ubwo ... bon , hari harimo abatwite , ababyeyi batwite , abandi bantu b' inshuti bari bari aho , ||| then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... i am the one who came out of there alive .
ubwo ni njyae muntu ubashije kuva mo muri abo bose . hari igihe cya nimugoroba , baturasa bari abantu benshi cyane , ||| it was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many .
kusa ariko aho nri ndi nbashije kuhabyuka ngo nrebae ko hari uwaba yarokotse nsanga nta n' umwe , nsanga imivu y' amaraso , iki . ||| as i was lying down , i stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . there were only floods of blood .
ariko kubera ko icyo kihae nnjyae ok , nri maze kuba igishushungwe numvaaga nta kintu nshobora kubasha kukora hagati aho , biba ngombaw ko nnjyae nshakisha uburyo nshobora kuba nva aho hantu . ||| but because by then i was ... well , i had become numb ; i could n't think of doing anything at that time yet i needed to find my way out of that place .
kuhava birangoye cyane , kuko ntari kubona inzira y' ahantu nshobora kuba nca n' iki . ||| it was n't easy to leave that place because i was difficult to find space where to step .
ok ! nbasha kuihisha ahantu nihishe , nza kugira imaan nbona burakeye , ||| well , i hid myself and i was lucky to see a new day .
nibwo nbashije nnjyae kugerageza uburyo nva aho hantu . ||| that is when i got out of that place .
kuko nbonaaga ko birangiye , nta kinri kintu nkihategereje , ||| i thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing i was waiting for .
nravuga nti @: nnjyae reka nshakishae uburyo nshobora kuba nkuirwanaho nrebae ko nrokoka . ||| then i thought , " let me find a way of protecting myself and see if i would survive . @"
nbasha kubatoroka , kusa n' abaje nyuma , kubera ko aho banrasaiye nhataye ishati y' icyatsi , bari baranrashe hano mu mugongo . ||| i escaped them . even those who came later ... in fact , i left a green shirt where i was shot ; i was at the back .
mpata ishati yanjye , ubwo bukeye baje kusahura nibwo bamenye ko hari umuntu ubashije kuhava . ||| so i left my shirt there and the following morning , when some people came to loot , they realized that someone had managed to escape .
bagerageza kushakisha ngo barebae wenda ko banbona , ||| they tried to look for me but they could n't find me .
kuko bari batanze n' amatangazo cyane bavuga bati @: "@ umuntu turi busangaane uwo muntu , nawe tushobora kumugirair nabi . @" ||| they even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed .
ariko kubera ko hafi ahongaho atariho nbashije kuba natorokera , ubwo ntakomeza nragenda , ||| but i did n't hide near there , i continued fleeing .
kiri igihe cy' imvura , imvura igaw n' iki , n' abandi bantu bahunga , bagira kutae . ||| it was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing .
nshakisha uburyo nshobora kuba nhunga ngo njyae kuri e.t.o [ ishuri rya kicukiro ] nbona bitashoboka , kuko hagati ahongaho nta bufasha bunri nri nfite . ||| i looked for a way of going to e.t.o [ a technical school in kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because i had no one to help me [ get there ] .
ngerageza kushakisha uburyo bwose birananiraan , ||| i tried all possible ways but i failed .
ubwo nibwo ngiye ndorongotana ahantu hose n' iki , ||| then i started moving around .
ariko aho hose ntekerezaaga ko hashobora kuba hari abavandimwe , nabo bari bamaze kupfa . ||| however i thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died .
ubwo nkomeza gutyo iki , intambara irakomeza y' ikiendaan kane [ 1994 ] ngenda nca mu bantu bagiye bapfuye , ||| i continued doing that and the war went on , the 1994 war .
abo basize babatemaguye batari bubashae kugira icyo bimarair . ||| i would pass through dead bodies , people who were terribly hacked and could n't do anything for themselves .
kubera ko nnjyae bari banrashe ariko mu mugongo , nkapfa kugenda gutyo kusa . ||| i had also been shot on the back but i would try and walk .
kuko nrabiibuka , barashe ari muma saa moya , ||| i remember the shootings took place at seven in the evening .
bamaze kurasa , ngerageza kusohoka muri urwo rupangu turi turimo . kurusohokamo ariko binbera ingorane ndende cyane , kubera ko hari abandi bantu bari bamaze kuzitira aho inyuma , ||| later after the shooting , i tried to get out of the fence where we were but it was a problem to me as they had destroyed all the behind passages .
bategereje ko hari uri busimbukae . ||| they blocked the way out so that they could see anyone who would try to jump over the fence .
ariko noneho hagati ahongaho bategereza ko hari uri bukomae , ubwo bari bamaze kuica mo indani bababwira bati @: "@ nta kinri kisigaye mushobora kuinjira noneho mukatangira kusahura . @" ||| they waited and realized that there was no alive , then they told each other , "@ you can now enter and start looting . @"
nza kuharokokair gutyo banjyana mu bitaro , ||| that is how i survived and i was taken to the hospital .
baranvura , kubera ko nri nararashwe , ||| i was treated because i had been injured .
ariko bavura ibikovu kusa , ntibabasha kukuramo isasu ryari ririmo . ||| but they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound .
ubwo intambara irarangira mu kwa karindwi , ubwo nyine ibintu by' amashuri biri bitarajya ku murongo . nibwo ubwo , ||| in july , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating .
f.a.r.g. [ ikigega gishinzwe kutera inkunga abacitse ku icumu ry' itsembabwoko ] nyine batangiye kutubwira ngo tuitabaire ibintu byo kujya kuiga n' iki , ||| then f.a.r.g [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school .
tujya mubyo kuiyandikisha , batuohereza kuiga , kuko bagendaaga ba disitiribiwa [ bakwirakwiza ] abanyeshuri muri za minisiteri . ||| we started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools .
ubwo nbasha kuiga , ariko kubera ko nri nfite ikibazo nyine cy' akaboko kubera urutugu ahantu barashe , kubera ko nri ntara ... , mu mutawe nri ntara , ||| so i managed to study but because i had a problem with my arm , which was due to the wound where i was shot at the shoulder , i was not very okay mentally .
ntaratungana neza . ubuzima bukomeza gutyo , bukomeza gutyo , ||| life went on like that .
hakaba hari n' abandi bana nabo baba baragiye barokoka , bamwe na bamwe tukasanga nabo bari aho , ||| they were other children who survived .
tukagerageza kuganira ibyagiye bitubaho n' ibyo bagenzi bacu bagiye bahura nabyo mu ntiambara , ||| we used to meet there and talk about what happened to us and to our people during the genocide .
ariko ukasanga yuko ibyo bihae biri ibihe bibi cyane . ||| but days were very bad during that period .
nta n' umuntu ubashaaga kuba ... urabona kugira ngo wice umuntu utakurwanya burya , ||| no one was able to ... imagine one killing a person who is not fighting back .
byo buriya ni ikintu cy' ikibazo cyane . uraumva nta kuntu ukuicwa n' umuntu utakurwanya burya , ||| it is a big problem ; killing someone who can never fight back , it is like killing a lamb .
uraumva ni nk' aho ari intama burya , ushatse umushinyagurair icyo wunva ushaka . ||| the killer was capable of torturing the victim as much as he wished .
ni uko nyine tugira imaan tubona intambara irahagaze , ||| fortunately , the war ended .
ubuzima buratangira uko bisanzwe , ||| life went on as it used to be .
yego ukasanga hari ibintu bimwe na bimwe bigoraan mu buzima ariko kuva umuntu burya afite amahoro , ibindi burya umuntu agenda abishaka buhoro buhoro . ||| well , life was still very hard but peace was certain . the rest comes slowly by slowly .
eh , ubwo nyuma y' aho nyine kugeza ubwo iki kihae tugezemo , ||| from then up to now life is going on fairly .
nrabona ubuzima burimo bugenda nta kibazo , ok , hari ibintu by' ibibazo umuntu agenda ahura nabyo mu nzira , ibibazo by' ubuzima , ||| well , people get problems like health problems and others but one keeps trying to look for a living .
ibintu nk' ibyo , ariko umuntu akagenda agerageza , agerageza uko bishobotse kushakisha ubuzima . ||| we believe that it is god , who knows .
umuntu akavuga ati buriya imaan niyo ibizi kuko uko ibyagiye bigenda byose muri jenoside no kuba abantu barabashije kurokoka , numva ko hagati cyane hashobora kuba harimo n' uruhare rw' imaan cyane kuko , ||| when we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that god played his role .
abantu ubwabo bwo numvaaga batari kuba bafite ingufu zihagije cyane kusa hatarimo ingufu z' uwiteka . ||| because human beings would never manage it without god 's power .
utubwiye ubuzima bwawe kuburyo burambuye . ndagirango , numvaaga nkubaza utubazo tumwe na tumwe ; ubundi utubwira amazina y' ababyeyi bawe ? ||| now that you have told us about your life in details , i would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ?
eh , ubundi papa bamwitaga macumi francois , mama yitwaaga umulisa odeta . ||| eh , my dad was called macumi francois and my mum was called umulisa odetta .
mukaba mwaravutse muri abana bangahe ? ||| and how many were you in your family ?
turi abanaa ... babiri murugo , batatu . ||| we were two ... three kids at home .
turi batatu bari abahungu . tuesae turi abahungu . ||| we were all boys .
ubwo rero nyine nibo bapfuye bose aba ari njyewe urokokamo . ||| they all died and i am the only one who survived .
ni wowe urokotsemo ? ||| among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ?
ubu nfite makumyabiri n' itanu . ||| i am twenty @-@ five years old .
tukiri mu buzima bwa mbere ya jenoside , urabizi neza ko abantu bakundaaga kugenda bahiga , bagatorezwa , bakafunga ibyitso bakagira kutae na kutae ; ||| before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ?
ese iwanyu icyo kintu kigeze kihagera wenda kuburyo wowe cyangwa se ababyeyi bawe bataotaijew ngo ubae utunyurairmo muri make ukuntu bataotaijew ? ||| if it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ?
yee , kirahageze , kirahageze cyane mu miryango , ||| yes it used to happen especially within families .
hari bamwe na bamwe bagiye bazira ibyo bintu , ||| some people were victimized in that way .
wenda nko mu miryango yacu yagiye yimurwa . hari aho babaga batuye nko ku musozi , ariko kubera ko bavugaaga bati @: "@ harimo ibintu by' ibyitso by' inyenzi hariya . @" ||| our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift .
bikaba ngombaw ko nabo bagenda baimuka , kuburyo no murugo twaratotejwe icyo kihae tubura securite . ||| i remember how my family was tortured and we had no security .
kuko umusaza wanjye yari umuntu ukunda kukora hanze , mu bintu byo hanze by' amasafari , ariko tukatotezaw ukasanga nijoro interahamwe zateye mu rugo , bakubise inzugi , ||| my father used to work in exile ; he used to go on long trips and then interahamwe would attack us at night ; they would bang on our door ... but we would be patient because the same people we were supposed to report to were the ones to initiate everything .
bagize kutae . ariko nyine umuntu akapfa kuihangana , kuko abo uregairaga kirya kihae ni nabo banabikoraaga . uraumva rero ko hagati ahongaho ntabunri buryo umuntu yagombaaga kuba yakwidefanda [ kuirwanaho ] uretse wenda kuhamagara nk' abaturanyi ukababwira uti @: ||| i guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it .
"@ tugize ibyago ibi n' ibi , " nabwo abo wishyikiraho wunvako bashobora kuba bagufitiye ikaizerae mufitanye ikaizerae . ukababwira uti @: "@ nhuye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi , ||| still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ i got such and such problem . @"
" ariko nabo kubera ko nta kintu bakufashaaga wenda bakakubwira bati @: "@ gerageza ugirae gutya cyangwa se ihanganae cyangwa se gira gutya , nta kunri kuntu tubigenza . @" ||| but since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do .
ariko ibyo bibazo byo turabigize cyane kugeza n' ubwo jenoside yagiye kuba mu rugo bamaze kuhatera nk' incuro nk' eshatu . ariko ntibabashae kugira icyo bageraho . ||| we definitely used to get such problems . in fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . but they never did any harm to us .
utubwiye ko hari abantu bagiye bimura bo mu muryango wawe . ||| you told us some of your family members would be forced to shift .
hari abo wibuka utubwira amazina , ||| do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ?
babakuraaga he babajyana he ? ||| where did they go or where were they taken ?
yee , ok , harimo nka mu ... ok namwita nk' aho ari marume , ||| yeah ... okay , there was ... well i can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in gikondo and in kinazi before .
kuko cyo kihae we bari batuye hano i gikondo ariko bakaba barabanje kutura i kinazi . bava i kinazi , bamaze kuva i kinazi bajya i cyangugu , ||| when they left kinazi , they went to cyangugu .
naho barabimura nibwo bagarutse kutura hano i gikondo . ||| they made move to cyangugu and then they came back here in gikondo .
so , hagati aho rero igihe iby' ibyitso biri bikomeye , hari uwo bafashemo wacu . baranamukubise ku buryo yanapfuye yarabaye umusazi , ||| during the time when people were suspected to be traitors , there is one of my relatives who was beaten up to the extent that he died after going crazy .
yitwaaga francois . ||| his name was francois .
ubu jenoside ejobundi niyo yabatsinze i gikondo , ahantu baitaaga ngo hari interahamwe ikomeye baitaaga kongore [ congolais ] . ||| he died in the genocide in gikondo , an area where there used to be a terrible interahammwe called ‘ congolais ’ [ congolese ] .
bakaba rero nyine uwo mukecuru baramwitaga ko ariwe nyinakazi w' inyenzi muri gikondo hariya . ubwo nyine jenoside niho yaje kubatsinda nyine , ||| his mother [ francois ' ] was called nyinakazi w'inyezi [ meaning ‘ mother of inyenzi ’ ] in gikondo . the genocide found them in gikondo .
abandi bakagenda babaaka ibyangombwa , ntibabashae kusohoka , ntibabashae kukora akazi . ||| their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work .
bavuga ko iyo basohotse bagiye hanze , baba bajyanye amabanga y' inyenzi , ||| whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to inyenzi .
bagaruka bakaba aribyo babaga bagarukaanye . ||| and whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from inyenzi .
ariko bagerageza kubisaka ntibanabibonae n' ibintu nk' ibyo ... ariko ukaumva ko hagati aho babaga mu muryango hari insecurite . ||| they would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . one could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family .
birazwi ko muri icyo kihae hari hariho intambara y' amoko , y' abahutu n' abatutsi . ||| it was well known that there was a tribal war between the hutu and the tutsi .
utubwiye yuko papa wawe yakundaaga kujya hanze , na maman wawe akasigara ahongaho , ||| and you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home .
ubwo papa wawe yaziraaga ko yakundaaga kujya hanze ? cyangwa yaziraaga ko ari umututsi ... ? ||| do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a tutsi ?
eh , yazira ko ... we yaziraaga , si nibyongibyo by' ubututsi we yaziraaga ko avugaish ukuri , ||| well , he was not harassed because he was a tutsi but because he used to say things the way they were .
ubundi akazair ko yashatse mu mafamiye baitaaga ko ari iy' inyenzi nyine ibintu nkibyo . ubundi akazair ko nanone ari umuntu uvugaish ukuri , ||| another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an inyenzi .
ari umuntu ukunda kugira inshuti cyane z' ahantu henshi cyane zitandukanye . hakabamo n' ibintu by' amashyari nyine by' amako ; iby' amoko bikajya ku ruhande , uturere ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| he was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort .
kuko n' ahantu turi tutuye hari habi cyane , ||| the place where we lived was located in a very bad area .
ni ahantu mwumvaga baitaaga ngo ni muri "@ camp butaro @"@ , ||| you have probably heard of a place called ‘ camp butaro ’ .
za mpunzi zavaaga za ruhengeri za he bose bazaaga hariya mri ako kacae . ||| all the refugees who came from ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area .
utubwira muri makeya ... kuko wambwi ... uvuze ko bamuzizaaga ko yavugaishaga ukuri , ariko ... uko yabiitwaraagamo hagati ahongaho , ||| could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... what was his behaviour ?
n' iyo mwaganiraga avuga ati @: "@ bariya bantu banziza iki ? @" ||| the times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ?
utubwira muri make ukuntu yabiitwaraagamo ? ||| tell us in brief how he used to handle it .
ubundi ikintu we bamuzizaaga , bamuzizaaga ko ... icya mbere bamuzizaaga ko ari umuntu donc ... utakunda ibintu wenda tukuita ko nk' ahoari amashyari cyangwa se by' irondakoko cyangwa se irondakarere . ||| in fact what he was accused of , he was accused ... first of all he was someone who ... did not like the ideas of jealousy or of ethnic or regional segregation .
kandi bakanamuziza ko we yari wa muntu utatinya ibyo kuvuga ngo nrakutinya kuko uri umuntu , cyangwa se nrakutinya kubera yuko nbona ukora aya makosa wunvae ko nyakushyigikiyemo , ||| secondly , he was not afraid of saying the truth , he did not fear anyone and he could n't support anyone he would see doing something wrong .
oya . ||| never !
sasa bikatuma rero bavuga bati @: "@ uyu muntu araturwanya , kuki tushaka kukora ibi , twe tumubwira ibingibi akabianga . @" ||| so , they thought he was against them . they would say , "@ why is it that when we tell him our ideas he never agrees with us ? @"
binakubitairho ko yabaga yagiye nk' iyo mu masafari akatuzanira amakasete wenda inkotanyi iki ... zaba iza video zaba iza ba kayirebaw ibintu kibyo . ||| what made things worse is that whenever he would go away on long trips , he would bring us tapes of inkotayi or kayirebwe 's video tapes .
bikaba rero nyine biratumaaga bagira ikintu cy' ako kabazo cyane . kuko ... ||| so there was always a question mark .
mbese icyo bamuzizaaga n' uko abandi bahutu bavuga bati @: "@ uyu muhutu mwene wacu kuki atakora kimwe ntawe ? @" ||| he was victimized because other hutus would say , "@ this is our fellow hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @"
nawe akababwira ati @: "@ ibingibi ntabwo ariko bimeze . @" ||| he would tell them , "@ this is not the way things should be . @"
utubwira muri makeya mukimara kaumva ko indege ya habyarimana yaguye , cyangwa bamaze kuyirasa . mu rugo iwanyu babiakiriye batae ? ||| could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that habyarimana 's plane crashed ?
donc , njyewe nrabiibuka icyo kihae nri ndi muri etude umukecuru wanjye yari arimo yoza karumuna kanjye muri salon . ||| i remember i was revising my lessons and my mum was cleaning up my young brother in the sitting room .
ubwo muzehe nawe yari afite akantu kameze nk' akabuvette aho yarimo asangira n' abandi bantu tugiye kaumva tuumva ko habyarimana yapfuye . ||| my dad owned a small bar where he was sharing a drink with other people , and then we heard that habyarimana died .
ariko uko nbibonye nbonye ko ababyeyi bahise bahindura isura , ubwo uraumva ko kiriya kihae turi abana ntabwo bashoboraaga kutusobanurair buri kimwe cyose . ariko nhise nbona harimo nk' akantu ko kukonja hagati y' ababyeyi , ||| i could tell that there was a change on my parents ' faces .
hagati y' abantu donc bari mu rugo . ||| by then we were young , and although they would not tell us exactly what was going on , i could feel the tension in my parents and in everyone who was at home .
utubwira muri make ukakomeza uhereye mbese kuba yarabwiye ati @: "@ tuhungae , " nyuma y' aho bya ... , niba wibuka n' amatariki , ||| tell us in brief ... from where he said , "@ let 's flee . @"
uti @: "@ igihe iki n' iki ; hashize iminsi ibiri , cyangwa itatu wenda ... kugeza ku rupfu rwe bigenze bite ? @" ||| what happened later ... if you remember the dates or if it was two or three days later ... up to his death , what happened ?
icyo kihae ntinibuka ariko nzi ko twebwe ... yeee ukuntu bigenze hagati aho , ||| i do n't remember the days but i know we were ... yeah , what happened in the meantime .
bakimara kurasa indege . bukeye bawho mugitondo , nrabiibuka ko yafunguye muhabura nka saa .... , nka saa kumi n' imwe gutyo arimo yumva amakuru . ||| the morning after the plane crashed , i remember he tuned in radio muhabura to listen to news at around five in the morning .
ubwo noneho haza guterefona umugabo uri utuye ku kicukiro baitaaga evode , evode ariko akaba yari yarabyaye muri batisimu karumuna kanjye . ||| then some man called evode called , he was my brother 's godfather .
barimo baganira aramubwira ati @: "@ sasa rero ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ||| as they were talking he told my father how things were , he said we had no way to flee before it 's too late .
ntabwo tufite ubufasha bw' ukuntu tushobora kubaba tuhunga hakiri kare , ikindi cya kabiri , n' abashobora kututabara bari kure yacu cyane . @" ||| secondly , he said that those who could have helped us were too far .
nta kuntu tugombaaga kukora urugendo ruva ahangaha ngo tugerae kuri c.n.d. ntibiri kushoboka . ||| there was no way we would walk up to c.n.d ; it was impossible .
agerageza guterefona , abantu bagaterefona bo hanze babaza bati @: "@ ese bite i kigali bimeze kutae ? ||| he tried making phone calls ... people who were outside the country would call him asking about the situation in kigali .
tumaze kaumva ko indege ya habyarimana yarashwe , ariko se bimeze bite ? @" arababwira ati @: ||| they would say ; "@ we have heard that habyarimana 's plane was crashed , how are things there ? @"
"@ twebwe tutegereje kusa ko hari ikindi kintu kishobora kuba wenda kibaho , " kuko bari bavuze ko abantu batagomba kusohoka mu mazu , ||| we were waiting to see what would happen because they had forbidden people to go out of their homes .
nta n' uwemerewe kusohoka . ariko abari bazi ubwenge bari bamaze kumenya ikigiye kuba icyo ari cyo . ||| nobody was allowed to go out of his or her house . but the wise men had already sensed what was going to happen next .
ubwo hagati ahongaho yakomeje kugenda yakira amaterefone yo hanze no hino , amubaza uko bimeze . ||| meanwhile he received several phone calls from inside and outside the country , people were asking him how the situation was .
ababwira ati @: "@ nnjyae ahantu ndi , ati @: ndi kumwe na famille yanjye ariko tubuze ahantu tuca , ||| he would tell them , "@ i am at home with my family but we do n't have a way out .
ubu n' abari kuica bari kuicira inberae y' umuryango w' iwanjye hano , ati @: hagati ahongaho ati @: nrabona ari ibintu bikomeye . ||| people are being killed in front of my house , things are horrible here . @"
ubwo hakaba hari undi musanzire we bari baturanye , ||| a certain neighbour whose wife was my mom 's sister .
nawe yari afite umudamu utwite kabisa , inda y' impanga . kubera ko uwo musanzire wacu nawe yari afite barumuna be banri , ||| his wife was pregnant ; she was carrying twins . he had several other brothers .
nabo bari bari kumwe munzu , ||| they were all together in the same house .
papa aramubwira ati rero ati aho kugira ngo , ntahantu uri bucaishe uwo mudamu , ibiiza reka tumuzanae umusigae murugo , ||| then my dad told him , "@ instead of ... there is no way you will hide your wife , you 'd better bring her to my home and leave her there . then the rest , everyone should find his own way .
namwe buri umwe acae ukwe n' undi ukwe , ubwo uzarokoka azabara inkuru . niko bigenze umudamu aza mu rugo , ubwo abandi nabo bakomeza kuhunga ukwabo . ||| whoever will survive will tell the story . @" that is what happened , they brought he home and others started fleeing in different directions .
noneho uko abantu bakomeje kugenda bisuka mu rugo , ni nako interahamwe nazo zajyaaga imigambi yo kugira ngo babae batutera . ||| as people would keep on coming to hide at home , the interahamwe would also plan how to attack us .
ariko noneho mu kututera bakaba baratinyaaga ko ibyo ari byo byose muzehe ashobora kuba wenda yabarwanya . ||| although they were making plans , they were also afraid that my dad would fight them .
ariko yaranabigerageje birananiraan , kuko bari benshi . ||| indeed he tried though he failed ; they were very many .
kuko babanje kurasa portaille nini cyane babanje kuyirasa amasasu menshi irabananira kuko murugo baharwanaiye iminsi ibiri , inzugi zaanze kufunguka zo hanze z' amaportaille . ||| they first shot our gate ; it was a very big gate , they shot with so many bullets and it never fell down . they fought to open the different gates around the fence for two days in vain .
noneho nimugoroba nibwo bize umugambi kumugoroba , bashobora kurair ibipangu nibwo baguye mo inberae . ||| it was one day in the evening when they finally decided to climb up the fence and get inside the compound .
ariko ubwo tumaze nk' ibyumweru nka bibiri , bikiri ahongaho , amaterefone agicicikana n' iki ... ubwo muri iyo quartier turi tutuyemo abandi bari bamaze kuhunga , ||| for two weeks things were still the same ; phone calls time after time ... in that area where we were living , others had already fled .
abandi bamaze kutwikirwa , abandi bamaze kupfa . ||| people 's houses were being burnt and people were being killed .
nta hantu donc na hamwe , umuntu ashobora kuba yabona yahungira . ||| generally there was no place to hide .
ubwo nyuma y' ibyumweru bibiri kuko batuishe ari ... , kuwa kangahe ... kuwa gatanu mu ma saa kumi n' ebyiri . ntinibuka amatariki neza , ariko nzi ko ari nka nyuma y' ibyumweru bibiri . ||| two weeks later ... they came to kill us ... on a friday at around 6:00 p.m. i do n't remember well the dates but i am sure two weeks had passed .
ubwo , nibwo bainjiye ari nimugoroba , ||| that evening they entered our home .
baraza barasimbuka urupangu , barasa urugi rw' inberae urw' inberae rurakinguka . nibwo bazaaga mu rupangu bagezemo , baravuga bati , ||| they jumped the gate and shot the front door and it opened .
ubwo turi twifungiranye . baravuga bati @: "@ mukingurae . @" ||| then they all entered inside the gate but we had locked ourselves inside the house .
muzehe aravuga ati @: "@ ninkingura , byose ni hahanri nta kunri kuntu turi bubigenze n' ubundi , bararasa inzugi ni hahanri bari bwifungurire ku ngufu . @" ||| they ordered to open the door but my dad said , "@ whether i open or not will n't make any difference , they will still shoot the doors and open them by force . @"
uwo murongo w' abantu , uwo murongo w' aba ... abari bari mu rugo ni abari bari mu rupangu n' ubundi bari bahahungiye . ||| that line of people ... it was the people who were inside the house and the ones inside the compound .
kuko muzehe yarabaterefonnye arababwira ati @: "@ mwebwe nimubona binaniraanye , bamwe mubaoherezae hano murugo , ||| they had sought refuge at home .
abandi mucicikane , buri umwe ahungae ukwe ahungae ukwe , ||| my dad would call people and tell them that in case things got worse where they were , some should come to his house while others flee to other areas .
ntimugendae muri muesae . kuko nibabatega , bashobora kubatega bakabica muesae . ibiiza , ||| he would warn them from fleeing in a big group saying that , in case they ambushed them , they would die in a big number .
muoherezae abo mushoboye , ab' abasore barimo cyangwa se inkumi zikirimo , baumva bafite ingufu , mushakishae uburyo buri umwe agendae ukwe ukwe , ||| "@ send me the ones i can hide and tell the strong boys and girls to flee in separate directions . do n't let them flee in a big number . @"
ntimugendae muri benshi . ||| he would tell them .
ariko ku bwe nyine yabonaaga ko bitashoboka kuko cyane cyane yababazawaga n' abo bana batoya , n' abo bagorae babo batari bubashae kuiruka , ||| he never thought that such a thing would happen . mostly , he felt pity for the children and the women who were n't able to run .
bari bugendae bica umugenda . ||| he thought such people would easily be killed .
ariko nk' umuntu w' umugabo aravuga ati @: "@ biibura baranrwanya ndi buirukae banrase wenda cyangwa se bankubitae umuheto [ kumurasa n' umuheto ] nkomezae ariko wenda kugeza igihe nribuze kupfair , ||| at least a man is capable of fighting or running .
ariko tutapfaanye n' umuryango wose . @" ||| even if they are shot while trying to run they can keep on running only if they are not fleeing with the rest of their family .
yee , ubwo rero uwo murongo batusohoye turi benshi , batushyira hanze . ||| they got us out of the house . we were very many forming a rank and they took us outside .
ubwo barasa uwo babanzaagaho nyine wabo , ubwo barakomeza , jyae banrashe ndi uwa ... ndi uwa gatanu . ||| they would shoot every person to get out , i was the fifth person to be shot .
bamaze kunrasa , ariko ubwo mu kunrasa akaba yaranrasaaga njyae nshaka gutoroka . kuko ahantu turi tuicaye hari hari ikintu k' ikigunguzi kiri hejuru cy' amabuye , ||| after shooting me ... they shot me while i was trying to escape ; i was sitting somewhere where there was a drum supported by stones .
ariko hakaba hari akantu k' akaryango k' inyuma bari bagize barashe karafunguka , ubwo noneho bo bainjira ari benshi kuburyo uwo muryango nrawurebaaga nkabona ko nta muntu uhahagaze . ||| around there , there was a small door , which they [ militias ] had shot and it was open ... the militias entered in a big number and i could see that no one was standing at the door .
sasa muri kwa kujya kuhaguruka gutya nibwo yahise anrasa hano [ yerekana mu irugu ] nikubita hasi . ||| as i was trying to stand up , he shot me here [ he shows ] and i fell down .
ubwo nikubise hasi , niba yaraketse ko npfuye simbizi . anca hejuru , arasa ubwo abandi bari bari iruhande rwanjye ||| when i fell down , maybe he thought i was dead . he skipped me and shot those who were around me .
ubwo barangije , umwe ati @: "@ ariko , ati @: ||| at the end one of them said , "@ this is not enough , open a grenade . @"
ibi ntibihagije , ati @: nimufungurae grenade . @" baba barayifunguye . ||| they opened one .
n' ubungubu nfite ahantu zanfashe hano , nfitemo fragment ebyiri . ubwo uko zakakubise , zirakubise ubwo nnjyae iba iranyinjiye , ||| i even still have its scars somewhere here ; i have two fragments inside ere .
ariko mu kunyinjira , numvise ari nk' akantu kameze nk' urushinge . ntinbiitaho , ||| as they threw the grenade , i was also hurt but it just felt like an injection so i ignored it .
nravuga nti @: sasa nimpumeka , abantu baranyumva . ||| i thought in case i breathed , they would hear me .
nnjyae nguma muri ya maraso ntaceceka ndaturiya kusa ... ariko ubwo ishati ubwo inyuma yahindutse amaraso , abanryamye hejuru bose babaye amaraso . ||| therefore , i remained in the floods of blood and kept quiet . my shirt was full of blood and everyone who was lying on top of me had blood all over .
ubwo jyewe icyo nkoze nracecetse kusa , ntaceceka nrabiihorera basubiramo batera grenade , abandi bakajya bagenda bakandagira bajomba ibyuma , ||| i just kept quiet . and then they threw another grenade and some of them walked over people 's bodies stabbing them with knives .
ntinzi uwaje kunjomba ubwo icyuma ariko arahusha , ||| i did n't notice one who wanted to stab me .
kijomba muri pasiparume hasi ariko nrakiumvaaga kabisa ko ari njyae yaje aje kukijomba ; ||| fortunately he missed and hit the ground on the grass instead .
araongera arazamura ajomba hano [ yerekanye ku rutugu ] , arebye asanga amaraso arava , aravuga ati @: " ibyo ari byo byose nta wukihumeka urimo . @" ||| i sensed that it was me he wanted to stab . he again raised up the knife and stabbed me on the shoulder . when he saw me bleeding , he thought we were all dead .
nibwo bazamukaaga . ||| therefore , they left .
ariko muri uko kuzamuka ubwo bazamukaaga nbareba . ||| i was watching them as they were leaving .
noneho icyo nkoze nhise negura umutwe , ngize ntya ngize gutya , nsanga abantu bose nta n' umwe uri kuvuga , bose babaye intumbi intumbi bose . ||| i rose up my head a bit but everybody was silent ; they were all dead .
nrabyuka ntahagarara . kusa ikintu njyewe nibuka nkoze , ninjiye munzu , nsohora ikiringiti , ||| i stood up ... one thing i remember is the way i entered the house and picked up the blanket ; it was raining and the blanket was very big .
imvura yaragwaaga , kinini cyane ; ndorosa . maze korosa icyo nfashe nhise nfata igitenge cy' umukecuru ntakitera . ||| therefore , i covered them and covered myself with a loincloth , which belonged to my mum .
ariko ubwo nkaumva nbaye igishushungwe nravuga , ese @: njyae munzu nryamae ? ||| i had lost my mind ; i would wonder if i should get into the house and sleep .
numvaaga nta n' umutima nkifite , bya binri byo kuvuga ngo umuntu ararira , numvaaga nta n' amarira , habae n' ikitonyanga . ||| i was confused . sometimes people cry but i did n't have tears to cry , not even a drop .
kusa ahubwo ntekerezaaga ibintu binbayeho izo saha , nkaumva nnjyae binshobeye . ||| instead i would think about what had happened to me and i 'd suddenly feel so confused .
yee , umukecuru nawe baramurashe kusa , ||| yes ... my mum was also shot .
yari umuntu w' umurokorae ukunda kuisengera , numvaaga za yezu kristu kusa . ubwo barumuna banjye nabo ubwo , bari baegeranyae gutya . ||| she was a "@ born again christian . @" she liked praying so much ; all i would hear her say was , "@ jesus christ @"@ .
kuko babicaje ku murongo , bari baicaye ku murongo nk' uko tuba tuicaye gutya . ubwo abandi numva induru ku ruhande ... iki , ||| and my brothers were next to each other ; they were made to sit in a line like this ... i heard people screaming besides .
hakaba ariko hari harimo umutante wanjye umwe , ||| i remember my aunt ... there was no other way but if i had had help , she would have survived .
ni uko nyine nta kunri biri kugenda ariko iyo abasha nko kubona ubufasha wenda aba yaranakize kuko we yanpfairiye mu ntoki kabisa gutya . nta bunri bufasha nri nfite , nta ki ... yari afite inda y' impanga , ||| she died in the banana plantation but i too was helpless , i could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant .
ubona kabisa ko akifite umwuka . ||| for her she still had some strength to breathe .
kuko nta kinri kintu nri kubasha kukora nnjyae , numvaaga nnjyae ntazi ukuntu nbaye . kuko we mamusize ahongaho bimaze kurangira , ||| there was nothing i could do for her , myself i had lost conscience due to what had happened to me .
nibwo njyewe nhise ngenda . ariko ubwo muri uko kubyuka , nta n' umwe ukomaaga , umukecuru we bari barangije kumurangiriza , ||| i left her after she had breathed her last breath . by the time i left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead .
bamaze kumurasa , bamurashe amasasu atatu . abiri yaciye hano irinri rica hano , ||| they shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here .
barumuna banjye bo bagiye babakubitagura ubuhairi , amasasu aha [ yerekanye mu mutawe ] n' iki , ||| my brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head .
kuko yari umuvu munini cyane w' amaraso menshi cyane . ||| there was a big stream of blood .
ariko urahavuye ntiwongeye kumenya ngo ... ||| but when you left , you never got a chance to know that ...
nta kinri kintu nongeye kumenya . ||| i never got another chance to know what happened next .
kusa icyo nzi cyo nongeye kumenya nyuma yaho ni uko kusa nje intambara irangiye bibinri nyine , jenoside imaze kurangira , ubwo aribwo igihugu kikitangira nyine kwisanasana n' iki . ||| i came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up .
nibwo nje nsanga intumbi kusa ziri aho mu rupangu hose zirajyaye , ||| and i found only corpses lying in the compound .
ahantu hose . nbasha kushaka abanfasha , kuko hariho abandi bacitse ku icumu bagenzi banjye bo kuri uwo murengae , ||| i tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide .
babashije wenda kunfasha kuba umuntu yapfa kubarenzaho akataka kusa kugira ngo umuntu arebae ... ||| they helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ...
icyo kihae ushoboraaga kumenya ababyeyi bawe cyangwa ... ||| by that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ?
icyo kihae ntabwo nbashaaga kubamenya buretse nk' ipantaro papa yari yambaye n' igitenge umukecuru yari yambaye . ok , wenda na burumuna bwanjye nabwo nbashaaga kumenya wenda nk' igice cy' umwenda yari yambaye , ||| by that time , i could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing .
ikabutura cyangwa se ishati , ||| i could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing .
ibintu nk' ibyongibyo . ||| things like that .
ubashije kubashyingura mu cyubahiro ? ||| were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ?
mu cyubahiro ntabwo bibashije , ||| i was n't able to do that .
kubera ko kirya kihae urabona ubuzima buri , abantu niyo bari bakiva mu bibazo n' igihugu ariyo kikitangira kwisuganya kugira ngo barebae ko batangira kudemara . ||| you see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal .
urebye ntabwo tukoze ibintu binri bihaambaye nta kinri , ||| we did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony .
tufashe kusa , tushaka imyenda myiza n' iki , ni uko turabasasair mo indani , turenzaho itaka . ||| we just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil .
kusa icyo tukoze tumennyeho ikintu cy' igisima cyo hejuru kusa nta kinri kintu . ||| then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else .
kuva uvuye mu rugo . ||| from the time you left your home .
nvuye mu rugo ubwo nrakomeje nragenda , ariko ubwo muri uko kukomeza , ||| when i left home i continued to walk .
niko nkifite n' abampiga inyuma , kuko bagerageje kushakisha ahantu hose , bava ndetse n' aho baitaaga ku kicukiro bajya i gikondo . ahandi hantu turi tufite amazu , ||| but even as i was going , there were some people who were behind me . they tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving kicuciro for gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there .
baza kureba ko wenda abantu b' aho aribo baba bampishe . ||| therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me .
ahubwo basanga na hariya ntinigeze mpagera . ||| they found out that i never went there .
ubwo hagati ahongaho aho souffrance [ imibabaro ] zirangiye , nibwo maze kuhura n' inkotanyi nbashije nabo kubasobanurair ibibazo nhuye nabyo , nbabwira n' aho narokokeye . ||| after the struggle , that is after meeting the inkotanyi i told them [ inkotanyi ] all i went through and where i had been .
bagerageza kunfasha uko bishoboka , ||| they helped me as much as they could .
baranbwira bati @: "@ ese bite ? @" ||| they asked me , "@ how are you ? @"
nrababwira nti @: kusa ikibazo nfite ni invunae , ||| i told them that my problem was the injury i had .
kandi murabona hari haraboze kabisa , kuko nta muti nbonaaga nta n' ikintu nbonaaga kinvura . ||| they could see it had rotten because i never used to get treatment .
babasha kunyondora , n' iki . baranbwira bati @: "@ genda usubirae mu buzima bwawe busanzwe . @" ||| they treated me and later asked me to go home and start looking for a living .
ariko ubu hagati aha ibyo aribyo byose nrabona ubuzima bwanjye , ok , si bwiza cyane , ariko nta n' ubwo ari bubi , ||| my current life ... well i can not say that it is very good but still i can not say that it is too bad .
kuko burya iyo ubasha kuryama mu mahoro , ukaramuka , ubuzima burakomeza . ||| when there is peace in the country and one is able to sleep peacefully , then life goes on .
ukimara kubonaan n' inkotanyi zikakubwira ngo ujyae mu buzima bwawe busanzwe , ukoze iki hagati ahongaho , ugiye he ? ||| after you met the inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ?
ubanye na nde ? ikikutunga ukibonaaga utae ? ||| whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ?
hagati ahongaho ... ubwo ... ukuntu bigenze ubwo nyuma , bamaze kunreka ubwo nibwo nhise njya ku kicukiro , hakaba hari umuntu wo muri famille uri uraharokotse . ariko nawe , ||| what happened later after they left me , i went to kicuciro .
nkaba nibuka ko , eh , intuza ... intambara igeze , nyuma wenda y' icyumweru kimwe . ||| there is someone from my family who had survived but i never knew ... when the war began , i guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them .
bakaba bari bamaze kutumenyaish ko bo deja batutanze kupfa . numvaaga rero ibyo ari byo byose nabo batakiriho , ||| therefore , i thought they had all died .
ubwo nragenda njya i remera hafi na iamca [ aho k.i.e iri ubu ] . ||| i went to remera near iamca , where kie [ kigali institute of education ] presently is .
nibwo nje kubona umugabo umwe uri uvuye i buganda , ok nawe yari aziraanye no mu rugo . ||| then i met a certain man who had come from uganda ; he knew my family .
aza kunjyana kuiga i bugande nigayo igihe gitoya nragaruka , ||| he took me to school in uganda . i studied there for a while and came back to rwanda .
ino ahangaha nraiyandikisha ntakomeza nraiga buhoro buhoro buhoro . ariko uko nrebye nbonaaga ubuzima ibyo aribyo byose uko ngiye nbubamo ... ubwo n' ukonguko bigiye bigenda , ||| i registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . that is how things used to be .
nkahura n' abantu b' inshuti abari inshuti ab' inshuti ntinzi cya ... nabo wenda ba ... baangirira impuhwe kubera ibibazo nfite n' akanrimo . ubuzima bugenda bugenda gutyo ... ||| i would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on .
kugeza ubwo nje kumenyera nsubira mu buzima busanzwe . ||| i finally got used to it and started living a normal life .
nkanavuga nti ibyo ari byo byose n' ubwo na jenoside yabaye ibyo ari byo byose ibyabaye , ||| i would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened .
ibyo aribyo byose ariko umuntu agomba kushaka ubuzima . n' ubwo umuntu atabiibagirwa ariko ubuzima bugomba kukomeza . ||| one can never forget what happened but life has to go on .
ushoboye ku ... kuiga ? urangiza se ... ? ||| did you manage to finish school ?
ngiraaga ikibazo cyo kurwara ku ... umutwe . ||| i used to have a problem of headaches .
nba nakurikiye nkaiga nkaiga ariko ngeraho nkaumva nrwaye umutwe cyane , no kubera ikibazo cy' aka kaboko , kakarya cyane simbashe kugira ... ntuza ... ||| i would be attentive in class but all of a sudden i would get terrible headaches . another problem was due to my arm ; it would hurt me so much and i would n't ...
wigeze kutubwira y' uko watesetse cyane . ||| you said you suffered a lot .
ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo utusobanuraiye neza uko guteseka ... ||| but you never explained very well to us how you suffered .
eh , guteseka kwanjye ukuntu bigenze ... ||| eh ... the way i suffered ...
ukuntu bigenze mu buzima rusangae usibye ibyo byose , ||| what happened in your life in general ?
mu buzima rusangae watesetse kutae kuva ababyeyi bawe ukimara kubabura kugeza ubu , ||| not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now .
wunva ari iki cyagutushije kugeza ubu ? ||| what has been the most challenging thing ?
ok , kuba nbura ababyeyi ? ok ! ||| loosing both my parents ?
icya mbere , ngiye mu buzima ntari menyereye , ||| well ... first of all i started another kind of life , which i was n't used to .
surtout [ cyane cyane ] kubera ko burya iyo uri kumwe n' ababyeyi kandi ukiri na mutoya , burya hari ibintu ... hari imyaka burya ugeramo , wenda bamaze kukukuza nawe ukamenya aho niveau y' ukuntu ushobora kuba uba ushaka ubuzima bwawe . ||| because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living .
ariko ubwo nringiye mu buzima ntamenyereye . ||| i entered another life that i was not used to .
kuba nta muntu nfite ushobora kuba unfasha wenda mu bitekerezo runaka , wenda nvugae nti nkeneye iki mbe nhita nkibona . ||| living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something i needed .
ibyo nabyo biri ibintu bigiye bingora . ||| those are the things that would disturb me .
no kuba byonyine kusa ... n' ibyo nbonye byonyine , ||| the fact that ... those are things i noticed .
n' ukuntu nbonye ukuntu abantu bapfa , n' ukuntu ngiye nbona nsimbuka intumbi , abo ngiye ngeraho nziko aribo bashobora kunrokora ahubwo nkabona nabo barashaka kunyica . ||| the way i saw people dying and the way i was skipping corpses , people i would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me .
kugeza ubwo nje kuhura n' inkotanyi . ||| until when i met the inkotanyi .
kuko nrabiibuka hari umugabo wa hano tuhuraiye niba ari ... hano munsi ya sainte famille , ||| i remember there was a man who lived here and we met at sainte famille .
anbwira ko agiye kunrokora . ||| he assured me that he was going to save me .
ariko tugeze ahantu nbona ahubwo ahantu anjyanye , ni ku cyobo . ndamutoroka nriruka . nkwepera mu bantu bari bari ahongaho ntiyamenya ahanyu nrengeye . ||| but we reached somewhere and i noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . i escaped him and run away ; i escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where i went .
so , ngiye nbona rero ibintu bigiye bitandukanye cyane mu buzima , ||| i saw different things in life .
nkagenda nbona ukuntu abantu bafite ibibazo , ||| i saw people suffer .
nkareba ukuntu nyuma y' aho jenoside birangiraiye ukuntu imfubyi zagiye zihura n' ibibazo , cyangwa se nnjyae ibyo ngiye nbona n' iki . ||| i saw how after the genocide orphans got problems , i included .
n' ubuzima ngiye menyera ntari menyereye . ||| i got used to a different life style .
uko imaan yagiye infasha ubu maze kubimenyera . ||| god helped me now i am used to the new life style .
burya yego baravuga ngo @: "@ akabi ntikamenyeraw nk' akaeza , " ariko bigera aho ukabimenyera bitewe na cas [ n' ubuzima ] urimo . umh ||| there is a saying that , "@ akabi ntikamenyerwa nk'akeza . @" it means it is more difficult to get used to bad things than to good things . but later you get used due to the situation . yeah ...
ubwo nyine ubuzima bukagenda gutyo . uwo nbashije kubwira igitekerezo cyanjye , yabona ari ngombaw ko anfasha akanfasha . ||| life went on like that ... i would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could .
kuza kugeza ubwo numva maze kabisa kumenyera , no kuba maze kuigira hejuru , numva ari ibintu bishimaishije cyane . ||| until i got totally used to it and i grew older , which made me so happy .
wunva kuri wowe ari iki wibuka kikakubabaza kurusha ibindi , muri wowe ; ||| in your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ?
kandi kikakutaish kuba ukuishima . ||| something that takes away your joy .
ni nk' iki wunva wibuka kikakubabaza cyane ? ||| what hurts you most whenever you remember it ?
kuba ntari kumwe n' abavandimwe kuba ... ok , nta famille , ibyo nabyo biri mu bintu bya mbere , ko kubaho ntawe nfite nbwira ibibazo byanjye nimba we yabikemura . ||| living without my relatives ... no family , which is the most important thing ... living without anybody to tell my problems .
surtout ukasanga icyo kintu [ arimyoza ] nkaicara wenda nkavuga nti iki kintu nkagombye kukibona muri ubu buryo . ariko se ko nbona ntawe nfite ukinfashamo , bigenda kutae ? ||| sometimes i say , "@ i could get this or that in such a way , but since there is nobody to help me , what can i do ? @"
[ arimyoza ] bikatuma mpita nibuka nti @: ubu iki kihae iki n' iki , iyaba umubyeyi aba andi hafi , cyangwa undi muvandimwe yaka kinfashijemo . ||| then i remember that , i could have been with my parents or relatives and they could have helped me in such a time .
kusa ntibicae intege , kandi na none nkababazaw ubuzima imfubyi barimo ku viva [ kubaho ] butakagombye kuba ngombaw . ||| however , it does n't discourage me . secondly i am hurt by the kind of life orphans lead yet they were n't meant to live that way .
na none ukasanga wenda muri ... surtout muri nk' imfubyi eshatu enye , ariko muesae ukasanga ntacyo mumariranye , ||| especially when they are three or four orphans who can not help one another .
nabyo ukasanga ari agahinda na none . ||| it is a pity .
ibyo aribyo byose , eh bigaragara ko niyo uba uri imfubyi ugomba ... ubuzima bugomba kukomeza . ||| well ... even if you are an orphan , life has to go on whatever the case may be ...
yee , kabisa ibyo byo nbona ko bugomba kukomeza ... n' ubu buranakomeza rwose . ||| yes , that is true life has to go on . and it is still going on .
eh ! nragira ngo nkawe ubinyuzemo ufite experience [ inararibonye ] y' ubuzima bugoye nk' ubwo , ni iyihe nama ugira abantu bafite ubuzima nk' ubwawe ? ||| what advise can you give someone like you who passed through such hardships and who experienced a hard life ? those who lead a life like yours ?
kusa inama nbagira , ikintu cya mbere nbaha moral . ||| the advice i can give them ... first of all i would encourage them to have morale .
bakamenya ko mu buzima biriya ni ibintu , ok bibayeho kubera y' uko abantu kirya kihae bari babaye inyamaswa kubera na politique mbi . ||| they should know that in life such things ... well , such things happened because people had become wild due to bad governance .
ikindi kintu nbagiraho inama , ni uko uwunva afite ubu afite occasion yo kuba igihe cye yakikoresha neza , akaba yakikoresha . ||| another advice i can give them is to use their time efficiently .
niba abashije kuiga akaiga , ||| if one has a chance to go to school , he or she should study .
niba abashije se kubona ako kazi akakabona , ||| if one gets a job then he or she should work .
niba se hari n' uwo iwabo wenda baba bararangiye ariko afite n' ako ga parcelle wenda basenyae ; nkaba mubwira ko igihe cyose yaba afite possibilite ishoboka nawe ashobora kuba wenda yasubizamo ... wenda nawe iye . akasubizamo umuryango , ||| or if there is someone who has a farm with destroyed houses , he or she should try to build there his or her own house and put there his or her own family when they get an opportunity to do so .
mu kihae cyose azaba afite ... possibilite zishoboka kuzikoresha . igihe cye akaba yakikoresha neza . ||| any one who has a chance should use it well .
njyae nraumva ari cyo kintu nbagiraho inama . ||| that is the advice i can give them .
noneho umara kuemera ko ukikoze , ubwo ibyo aribyo byose niba ari n' ibihano uzabigabanyirizwa cyangwa se ukuri kuzabakugaragaye . ||| if you admit that you committed a crime then your punishment would be reduced or ... whatever the case , the truth would be revealed .
wenda nibyo bavuga ngo @: "@ umuntu yanakubabarira , " wenda nraumva no kubabarirwa wenda sinaku ... hari abatanga imbabazi hari n' abatazitanga . ||| maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't .
ariko , babanzae baemerae bati @: "@ tukoze icyaha , twaraishe koko tumennye amaraso . @" ||| but they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood .
ubwo nibamara kuemera ko ibyo bintu kabisa ko icyaha bakikoze ibindi bizaoroha . ||| after they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier .
ariko mu kihae bataemera ko icyo cyaha bakikoze , kandi hari n' ababi ... n' ibimenyetso wenda bibagaragaza ko babikoze koko . numva ibiiza ko ari uko babiemera ko babikoze . yee . ||| but since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... i think they should just acknoweldge what they did .
abantu baba bara ... rirokotse iri tsembabwoko bo ubaha ubuhe butumaw ? ||| what message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ?
kusa bo nabo ubutumwa nbaha ... ok barimo ingeri myinshi , kuko hari nk' uba yararokotse [ arimyoza ] ariko kubera kuko nabo imyumvire yabo si imwe . kandi noneho kubera ... n' ikindi kinabitera ni ukubera ubuzima baba barimo . ||| the message i would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading .
hari nk' uhagarara ku murengae w' iwabo akareba akasanga nta kintu na kimwe kikihari , umh ! ||| there are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh !
akabona abo bantu bamwiciye wenda amafamiye [ imryango ] yabo arimo arakidegembya aho . ||| but the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully .
kusa nmuha inama yo kugira ngo asae nk' umuntu ubiirengagiza gato , abanzae akomezae ubuzima . ashakae ubuzima nmara kubona ubuzima azabona ko n' ibindi [ arimyoza ] byoroshye . ||| the only advice i could give such a person is to kind of overlook what happened and go on with life .
yee , ||| he or she should look for a living .
kusa ntibiteze kumushiramo , ibyo ntibishoboka . ||| he or she will later find out that everything is possible . however , such a person will never forget what happened , that is impossible .
ariko biibura azarebae uburyo abyikarumamo [ yakwiyumanganya ] nawe arebae ubundi buryo yabigenza . kusa ashakae ubuzima kuko niko bigenda . ||| but he or she should just find a way to ignore it and look for a living because that is how life is .
kuko n' abatuicaaga baumvaaga ko tutashobora kurokoka , ||| because even those who were killing us never knew that we would survive .
baumvaaga ko no kuba turarokotse ni ... bo baumva ari inzozi kuri bo . ntushobora kaumva ukuntu ushobora kuza ukica tuvugae umuryango w' abantu ijana , harokokamo umuntu umwe . ||| to them , the fact that we survived is unbelievable ; imagine killing about a hundred people from the same family and one survives .
bo baumvaaga ko bitashoboka ariko imaan yo yabaeretse ko buri kintu cyose kishoboka . ||| they never knew it was possible but god proved to them that everything is possible .
umh . ||| umh ...
iki kikorwa cyo kuibuka abantu bajya bakora , wowe ukivugaho iki ? ||| what do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ?
icyo kikorwa njyae nrakishima cyane ni na kiza , ||| i appreciate that ceremony and i find it very good .
kuko nta kuntu ushobora kubona milliyoni hafi zingahe zapfuye . ngo tu turenzeho tusae nk' aho ... tuvugae ngo biribagiraanye ? ||| there is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten .
oya ntabwo bishoboka . ||| that is impossible .
iki kikorwa ni kiza kugirango ... iyo cas icyo kihae buri muntu wese bazajya bavuga bati @: "@ iki gihugu habaye amahano aya n' aya yatewe n' impamvu izi n' izi , ||| it is a good ceremony because ... whenever that period comes , people always say , "@ at such a time , disasters occurred in this country due to this or that reason . @"
ariko noneho icyi kikorwa tukora cyo kuibuka abagiye bapfa mu ma jenoside n' ibiki ... kiha n' abandi urugero , kiha n' ibindi bihugu urugero , bakavuga bati @: "@ iki gihugu ibyabaye koko ni ibintu bibi kandi ntibizaongerae . ||| that act of commemoration for those who died in the genocide ... constitutes an example to other nations ... it gives an example to other countries and they get a chance to judge that what happened to our country was terribly wrong and should never happen again .
kusa nkabona ko iki kikorwa ari kiza cyane kugirango kikanguraire abantu kumenya aho igihugu cyacu kigana , n' ayo mahano yabaye ko atazaongera kuba . ||| i find that ceremony very important because it helps people to predict our country 's future and it helps us to avoid its reoccurring .
ngira ngo nkubaze ikindi kibazo , urabiumva ko uri mu buzima utakwaiye kuba urimo iyo uba ukifite ababyeyi , ariko nanone wifuza ko ugira ubuzima bwiza . ||| today you are leading a life that is different from the one you would be living if your parents were still alive . you certainly desire a better life .
muri make wunva ari nde ubigiramo uruhare kugira ngo ubuzima bwawe buongerae bubae bwiza ushyirae n' umutima hamwe ? ||| whom do you think should play a role in improving your life and for you to get peace at heart ?
kusa , ibyo byo kugira ngo umuntu abigiraemo uruhare byo ... nraumva cyane cyane . ok , na f.a.r.g [ ikigega gishinzwe kutera inkunga abacitse ku icumu ry' itsembabwoko bataishoboye ] ikoresha uko ishoboye ibasha kufasha bamwe , ||| saying that one has a role to play in it ... f.a.r.g tries its best to help some of us .
ababaho ubuzima bugoye ikabasha kubagira inama , uburyo bashobora kubiifashamo . ariko numva cyane cyane ibyo ari byo byose ubuzima ubundi umuntu yakakwaiye kugira , si ukuvuga ngo wifuze ibyo utazabona , ||| the fund tries to advice those who are leading a difficult life about how they should behave in such a situation .
cyangwa ngo umuntu akwizeze ibyo atazakuha . ||| i believe in life it ’ [ s important to ... not that we should wish for things we will never get or let someone make promises they will never fulfill ...
njyewe uko nbona ubwiyunge bw' abanyarwanda numvaishije bikabaye kuba intabwae ndende cyane . ||| i believe reconciling all rwandans would be a very big step forward .
kuko iki kihae tugezemo ntabwo ari igihe cy' imyiryane . ||| when you consider where we are at , there is no longer time for conflicts .
ni igihe cyo kugira ngo buri munyarwanda wese aho ari yumvae ko akunze igihugu cye , ||| it is time for every rwandan wherever he or she may be , to love his or her country .
yumvae ko akunze umunyarwanda mugenzi we , ||| they should love each other as rwandans .
baumvae ko bagomba ku kaunga ubumwe bakafatanya bakaubaka igihugu cyabo . ||| rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country .
naho ubundi ibintu by' imyiryane nbona ntacyo bibagezaho , kuko ni ibisubiza igihugu inyuma bikairirwa bitaeza imvururu , imyiryane mu bantu . ||| conflicts and rivalry only make us move backwards , which result into fights within the nation .
ukasanga hagati ahongaho njyae nba nreba ukasanga nta imyiryane nta nyungu irimo . ||| there is no interest in conflicts .
ahubwo nkareba nkasanga ubumwe bushingaiye ku bitekerezo bizima mu kaubaka igihugu , numva aribyo bishobora kuba biba intambwe ndende cyane . kugira kigira ngo abanyarwanda babashae kubaho neza , cyangwa se babashae kugira ubuzima bwiza . ||| instead , i believe reconciliation based on principles for developing the country would be a big step forward for a better life .
numva aricyo kintu bakagobye kubanza kujijukairw cyane cyane bakamenya ko aricyo kintu kifite intabwae ndende cyane . ||| i believe they should first understand clearly how important reconciliation is and what an important step it is .
wowe kubwawe ubona bishoboka ? yuko abanyarwanda baiyunga . niba bitashoboka wowe ubona ni izihe mbogamizi ... ? ||| in your opinion , do you find it possible for rwandans to reconcile ? and if it is impossible why is that ?
kugira ngo ... ukuntu njyewe nbibona nbona kuiyunga kw' abanyarwanda byo ... ok , bishoboka buretse ko bishobora kutwara igihe kirekire , ariko bizashoboka . ||| in my opinion , reconciliation among rwandans ... well , it is possible but it will be a long process . but in the end it will happen . it is even taking place nowadays .
kuko n' ubu biranatangiye kuko urabona ko ibyo aribyo byose umwe abasha kaumvikana n' undi niyo yaba ari ubwoko runaka n' undi ari ubundi runaka . ||| today people do interact yet they belong to different ethnic groups .
ariko ukabona ko babasha kuvugana , niba ari ukusangira bakasangira , niba ari ukugenderana bakagenderana . ||| they talk with no problem . they visit each other . and when it 's time to share , they share .
ariko nbona ko bizashoboka . kuko nbona ko niyo ntabwae yatangiye ... kuko ibyo aribyo byose , numva n' uzasubira inyuma akaba yakuanga wenda iyo ntabwae , nraumva ibyo aribyo byose njyae ku giti cyanjye namwita nk' injiji . ||| but it is possible it is on its way ... and personally , i think those who do n't want to move forward and make that step are fools .
kubera yuko ntazibana wenyine se , ntabwo azavuga ngo @: "@ nzabana n' ubwoko runaka kusa , ||| because there is no way one will live alone in this world ; there is no way one can decide to live with only one ethnic group .
" ntibishoboka . ||| it is impossible .
kuko niba wunva ukeneye kugira ngo uzabanae n' abantu runaka kusa , icyo kihae nraumva no kuyobora igihugu bigoraan cyane . ||| if you feel like living with only one group of people , then even governing this country will become a problem .
n' umunyarwanda uwo ari we wese bya ntabwo yabasha kubaan n' undi . ubwo tuba tusubiye nko muri ya periode n' ubundi nk' uko imyiryane yagiye iba , ||| that means that all rwandans would n't be able to live with each other .
abantu bica abandi babaziza ubusa , ||| it would be like going back to the time of conflicts when people would kill others without any reason or because of what you own or because of your ethnic group .
umuntu akuziza ibyawe . ngo @: "@ umuntu uri ubwoko runaka ntabwo ashobora kujya mu ishuli ngo atsindae ! @" ||| it was said that due to your ethnic group , you were not allowed to pass in school . to me , that is nonsense .
ibyo nkaumva ko ibyo aribyo byose ari nta kintu bishobora kugeza igihugu inberae habae na gatoya , umh . ||| it can not contribute to the development of the country .
hari nk' abantu bakishyira ikintu cy' ubwoko inberae . hakaba n' ikindi kibazo kiba kihari , ||| some people would always put forward the issue of ethnicity .
ubu nibwo nkimara kaumva y' uko uvutse ku babyeyi batandukanyaije ubwoko . wowe ku bwawe wunva ubiakiriye utae ? ||| i have just understood that your parents were from different ethnics groups . how do you feel about it ?
njyewe kuri njyae numva kuri njyae nta ... ibyongibyo byo kuvuga ngo uyu ni bwoko runaka , uyu ni bwoko runaka , kuko n' uwagiye kukora jenoside hari abo yagiye yica kandi batari ubwo bwoko . ||| to me i do n't feel anything ... saying that so and so is from this or that ethnic group ... even the genocidaires killed some people who did not belong to the ethnic group that was hunted .
kandi kubera ko bo bashyigikiye noneho ibitekerezo bizima , no kaumva ko atashobora kufata umuntu babyaraanye ngo amutemae nk' uko uriya abikora . ||| they were victimized because they had positive ideas and they did n't believe they should hack the mother of their children just because she is of a different ethnic group .
kuko hari n' abagiye babikora ngo babiita ngo ni ukuca agahigo . ||| some did it in the name of taking up a challenge .
ngo njyewe ... ngo ... ngo @: "@ uyu yishe kwa kanaka , noneho nnjyae ngiye kuica uyunguyu . @" ||| they would say , "@ so and so has killed somebody 's family , therefore i also have to kill a certain family . @"
ngo kuberako kanaka yabikoze . ukasanga ibyo ari ubujiji cyane . ||| just because somebody killed they also had to kill , which is so stupid .
ibyo ari byo byose uri utubwiye ngo nk' umu rescape ajya yicara akavuga ati @: "@ abahutu baranyiciye , ||| you just mentioned survivors who say that , "@ hutu killed my people . @"
" kuri wowe wunva ari abahutu bakugiraiye nabi cyangwa ari abatutsi bakugiraiye nabi ? ||| do you personally believe it were the hutu who did you wrong or do you believe it were the tutsi ?
mbese wunva ari bande ukiriza ibintu bikubayeho hagati y' umuhutu n' umututsi ? ||| which of both sides do you blame ?
njyewe umuhutu nbona ariwe ubikoze kubera ko nta ibyo aribyo byose nta mututsi uri kuza kunyica . ||| i believe it was the hutu who did me wrong because no tutsi would have come to kill me .
icya mbere cyo nraumva nta n' ahantu yari no kuhera kubera ko ntacyo npfaaga nawe . ikindi cya kabili . nawe ntiyari kutinyuka kuza kunyica kandi nawe ahigaw ; ||| first of all , there was no way tutsi would come to kill me since we had no problems with each other . secondly there was no way they would find the courage to kill us yet they were also hunted .
icyo nicyo kintu cya kabili , uraumva rero ntahantu yari kuhera . ||| i guess you understand that they had no possibility of killing me .
ariko kubera ko uriya ariwe uri ufite power [ ubushobozi ] ari nawe wunvaaga ko afite ubushobozi bwo kukora buri kimwe cyose , niwe uje kubikora . ||| but since the hutus had the power and the ability to do anything they wanted , they are the ones who killed .
hari gahunda iriho yo kuhana ibyaha baita "@ inkiko gacaca . @" ||| there is a certain program for gacaca courts , which is meant for punishing the criminals .
yo uyivugaho iki , ||| what can you say about it ?
mu rwego rwo kuza kushaka ukuri kuri jenoside no kaunga abanyarwanda . ||| in the name of revealing the truth about the genocide and bringing reconciliation among rwandans , what is your view about gacaca courts or how do you understand it ?
uyibona utae ? uyumva kutae ? uyivugaho iki ? ||| what do you think about it ?
ubundi njyewe ukuntu nbona ibintu bya jenoside ... bya gacaca . kuko wa mukani ikintu kusa njyae nshimaiyeho leta yakoze kusa yacu , nyishimiraho ku kintu kimwe cyo kuba barafashe bamwe ... abari ... donc abakoze propagande babajyana arusha . ||| the way i consider the issue of gacaca ... well , something i always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to arusha .
noneho abandi biba ngombaw ko bazajya baburanairw mu nzego zaho zo hasi nyine ahari abaturage . ||| it was important to let the other perpetrators be judgeded from their local courts where the local people have access .
kuko ntabwo ibyo aribyo byose niba umuntu yariciye muri gikondo , cyangwa muri remera , akafungairw tuvugae muri ... ku muhaima . ntabwo azajya kushinjwa n' uwo ku muhaima kuko uwo ku muhaima ntamuzi . ||| because ... for example if someone killed in gikondo or remera and he is imprisoned in muhima ; there is no way someone from muhima would accuse him without knowing him .
azaza hahanri kavukire ke , aho yari atuye n' ubundi . kugirango babashae kubona ko ibyo biha koko bimukurikirana cyangwa bimuhama . ||| therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted .
ibyo rero so numva ari byiza cyane , ||| i believe it was a very good idea .
kubera y' uko iyo bataza no kubyoroshya ngo babikorae kuriya numvaaga biri kuzagoraan cyane . kubacira imanza biri kujya bigoraan cyane . ariko kuko bagenda bakabazana mu maselire bavukamo , ||| because if they had not simplified it in that way , maybe it would be more difficult to judge them .
amakomine bavukamo amaprefecture . bituma na n' abangaba b' aba avocat bababuranaish nabo bibaorohair , ||| but when they take the prisoners in their respective provinces , communes and cells , it facilitates the judges who examine their cases .
n' ikigega kikadu ... kikabaorohair , n' abo bantu nabo babasha kujya kubashinja bikabaorohair . ||| and it becomes easy for the witnesses to have access to the courts .
kuko ntabwo uzajya kuburana n' umuntu uje gushinjirizwa ku rukiko i nyamirambo uvuka ku gikongoro . ||| there is no way you can witness someone whose trials are taking place in nyamirambo when you are from gikongoro .
icya mbere bizakugora amatike kugira kutae ... aho kurara . eh ! kusa njyae numva biriya ... igitekerezo bafashe biriya aribyo byiza , ||| it is hard to get means of transport or accommodation ... i guess the idea was good .
kugira ngo abacirwa imanza bamenyekane ko baciriwe imanza kandi n' ibyo biha babihanairwe . ||| so that the defendant are judged and punished for their crimes .
kuko ni agahomamunwa cyane kubona umuntu mwaturanye atinyuka akica umuntu w' umuturanyi , nka gutya nkaza iwawe ... akica umuryango wawe wose akawurangiza . abana be mwariganye se , cyangwa se mwarashyingiranywe cyangwa se urakoreshaaga imisi iminsi mikuru akakusura . ||| it is unbelievable that a neighbour could actually have the courage to kill his or her neighbour ... that someone would come to your place and kill your whole family when you used to go to the same school with his children or when your families intermarried , or when they used to pay you a visit when you threw parties at home .
nkaumva ko ibyo aribyo byose ibya gacaca ari ibintu byiza cyane . ||| i believe gacaca is very good idea .
iriya gahunda yo kuihana no kuirega ibyaha by' abantu bari muri gereza , yo uyivugaho iki ? ||| what do you think of the program of getting prisoners to say the truth about people 's death and ask for forgiveness ?
kusa njyewe icyo nheraho n' uko ... ubutumwa ntanga ni nk' uko ntawe kiera nyine ujyaaga uganira na ba sogokuru bakakubwira intambara z' itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , bakakubwira iby' itandatu na kabiri [ 1962 ] uko bigiye bigenda , ||| what i can begin with is ... the message i 'd like to give is @: when we were young , we used to talk to our grandfathers and they would tell us about the 1959 war , the 1962 war and what took place there .
ariko noneho twebwe cyane cyane ku mwihariko icyenda na kane ho bibaye ni birebire cyane . ||| now in our case ... the 1994 war particularly terrible .
kuko ukuntu bagiye bica byo biri ibintu bikabije cyane . ||| people were killed in an extremely horrible way .
kuko numva ko kera ngo bicaaga bakica niba ari abagore n' abana , ntinzi ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| i used to hear that in the past they would kill women and children ... i am not sure but it was something like that .
ariko noneho bibaye ku miryango yose ku buryo ntacyo basigaaga n' ikikuvukaho n' iki ... ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| but this time the whole family with its offsprings would be killed and completely finished ... such things ...
kusa numva ibi bintu byo ntibiteze kwibagirana , ||| it seems like what happened will never be forgotten .
kuko n' umwana nzabyara , azagerageza ibyo aribyo byose kunbaza ati @: "@ se papa ko ntagira sogokuru ko ntagira nyogokuru bite ? @" umh . ||| because even my children will one day ask me , "@ dad where is our grandfather or our grandmother ? @"
icyo kihae nawe ubuhamya uzamuha uzamubwira uti @: "@ sogokuru yapfuye igihe iki n' iki na nyogokuru wawe kubera ibibazo bibaye by' imyiryane mu gihugu , abantu baanga abandi . babaziza ubwoko , ||| in that case what i would tell them is "@ your grandparents died at this period , when conflicts rose in the country and some people hated others based on their ethnic belonging or on their honesty about their [ political ] opinion .
babaziza ko bavugaish ukuri ; abandi na ndetse bakanazira y' uko bafite ni wenda amafamiye [ imiryango ] mu bintu nk' ibyongibyo . kubera y' uko cyane cyane hari n' ibyi ... kuko no mu kuica hari ibintu bigiye bigera n' imiryango bagezeho kubera n' amafamille bikarenga cyane noneho . ||| others were victimized because of their families ... it went to an extent of families killing each other because of grudges already existing within them .
nkamusobanurair uko ibibazo bimeze nkamubwira ukuntu icyenda na kane [ 1994 ] abantu baanganye , ||| i would explain to him how things were , how people hated each other in 1994 .
ukuntu baishe umubyeyi wawe bamuziza ubwoko ubu , cyangwa se bamuziza kuvugaish ukuri kwe . ||| i would tell him how they killed his relatives simply because of their ethnic belonging or to their honesty about their [ political ] opinion .
kandi noneho nkana mu considera [ yashatse kuvuga gukonseya cg kujya inama ] mubwira y' uko we mu kukura kwe ibyo bintu atagomba kubaigenderaho . ngo yumvae ko hari ibyo azakomeza kutera inberae , cyane cyane nko kugendair ku bwoko , ||| then i would advise him not to ever follow such ideologies especially when based on people 's ethnic groups and never to give importance to such ideas .
akaba aricyo kintu cya mbere ngomba kumukuramo . ||| that is the first thing i would warn him about .
ahubwo nkamubwira ko mu kihae atabafite ubwo ari icyo kibazo kibiteye ko abantu bari banzae abandi , ||| i would explain to him that the reason he does n't have grandparents , is because of the hatred somepeople developed towards others .
ko habaye ibibazo hagati y' ubwoko ubu n' ubu . abantu barangaan baricana bigira kutae . ‘ niyo mpamvu ubona utafite sogokuru wawe , ' n' iki . ||| i would tell him how there once were conflicts between two ethnic groups and as a result , people hated one another and killed each other .
ariko nawe biibuze nkagerageza kumwumvisha ko ... aho ukuri kuri . ||| i would want to try and teach him the truth .
ku buryo nawe bitazamubangamira mu buzima bwe nkura , ||| so that he may never be affected in his life as grown up . i would encourage him never to believe in such ideas .
ngo yumvae ko icyo kintu azakaigenderaho . wenda ko baishe wenda ba sekuru kubera ubwoko ubu n' ubu cyangwa se kubera bari bashyigikiye abantu aba n' aba . ||| i would tell him that his grandparents were killed either because of the ethnic group they belonged to or because they were supporting a certain ethnic group .
kusa nawe akakura azi ko bibaye ariko atari ikintu mbega kituma ... kimutaish umwanya we nawe ngo abe yagira . ||| i would tell him so that he grows up knowing what happened . and the point would be to avoid him wasting his time doing the same thing .
iyo umaze kureba ... ubona hari ibyo ubayemo , ibyo ukiri kumwe n' ababyeyi bawe ibyo ubayemo , ubuyobozi buri buriho bw' amashyaka uko iterambere ryari rimeze mu gihugu . ||| in the past while you were still with your parents , you saw the government , the political parties and the development that were in the country then .
ubona kugeza ubungubu wowe urabona avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' i gihugu cyacu ari iyihe , nyuma y' ibyabaye byose ? ||| what do you think is the future of this country when you consider its past ?
avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' i gihugu cyacu ... kusa ikintu cya mbere wenda nshimira wenda leta y' ubumwe , n' uko bagerageje kugira uruhare rw' ukuntu biibuze abanyarwanda bakaongera bakasubira mu mucyo . ||| our country 's future ... well the first thing i am thankful for is the government of unity ; it is trying to bring back rwandans into transparency .
bakabasha wenda no kugira ngo wenda izo nterahamwe nazo zakoze ibyo bintu zibashae kuhanaw . kugira ngo bierekanae ... bitangae urugero , kugira ngo n' ikindi kihae hatazaongera kuba hagira ikindi kintu cy' umwuka mubi kiza mu banyarwanda , ||| they also try to find a way of punishing those interahamwe who did those things [ killed ] so that it all comes in the open ... in the future there would be no more bad spirit among rwandans .
usangae batangiye kaongera kutemaan , batangiye kaongera ku kuicana . ||| things like hacking one another or killing one another .
so , nkaba numva ibyo aribyo byose nabo baragizemo ba yaragizemo intabwae ndende cyane . kuko i gihugu nrabona kitera inberae , ||| therefore , i believe the government played a great role and now the country is developing ; new houses are being built , there is a change in the governance .
nrabona hari imyubakire se , ||| generally , things are changing for the better .
n' imiyoborere se , nrabona intambwe ... birimo bigenda biza . nkabona ibyo aribyo byose nizera ko ibyo aribyo byose no mu myaka iza ariko bizagenda igihugu kirushaho kutera inberae . ||| according to me , as years go by , the country will farther develop .
kuri ubu buhamya utuhaye nta kinri kintu ushobora kaongeraho ? ||| is there anything you would like to add on the testimony that you are giving us ?
yaba ari ubutumwa cyangwa se mbese icyo wifuza kaongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe mu rwego rwo kubusoza . ||| it could be a message or anything you would wish to say as a conclusion .
nraumva ari ibyongibyo . ||| i think that is all .
nitwa uwamahoro clemence , ||| my name is clemence uwamahoro .
nkaba nravukaiye ku kibuye ahahoze ari commune mabanza secteur rubaengair , cellure kigabiro . ||| i was born in kibuye in a district , which was called mabaza in sector called rubengera , in kibagiro cell .
nkaba ... ubungubu nkaba nfite imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe [ 21 ] . ||| i am 21 years old .
ku bierekeraanye n' ubuhamya bwanjye ... bw' ubuzima bwanjye mbere y' intambara nri kumwe n' ababyeyi n' abavandimwe na famille [ umuryango ] . ||| well about the testimony of my life before the war , i was with my parents , my relatives , and my family at large .
noneho ngera igihe cyo kutangira ishuri , ||| then time came for me to start studying .
ubundi intambara yabaye niga mu wa kane primaire [ w' amashuri abanza ] . ||| the war started while i was in primary four and from then , we started having hardships in our studies .
ariko hagati aho ngaho tujyaaga tuiga nabi bakagera igihe bakababaza amako , bakavuga bati @: "@ abatutsi bajyae ahangaha , abahutu bajyae aha . @" ||| we would be asked about our ethics , they would come and say , "@ tutsis stand there and hutus stand here . @"
ariko ku ruhande rwanjye jyewe nta kintu nri nzi , ||| but on my side , i never knew any thing .
kuko hari n' igihe bajyaaga baambaza nkababwira nti @: "@ twebwe iwacu turi abanyiginya , " nkaumva ntinumva ibyo bashaka kunbwira ibyo aribyo . ||| i remember sometimes they would ask me and i would tell them that , "@ my family belongs to abanyiginya ... @" [ a clan ] i could n't understand what they meant .
umwarimu utuigishaaga kuko yari aziraanye na papa , ||| but my teacher knew my dad , so he would go and ask my father and then he would know it from there .
akahita agenda akamushaka akamubwira ... ubwo akabimenyera igihe cyose kuko igihe cyose . kuko igihe cyose yaraambazaaga jyewe ntingirae na kimwe mubwira , ||| otherwise , all the time he asked me , i never used to reply him a single word .
kandi mu rugo i wacu ntabwo bajyaaga banbwira ngo bababwirae ngo @: "@ nibajya bahamagara abangaba , mujyae muhagaruka muri aba , [ mu batutsi cyangwa se mu bahutu ] . ||| because in my home , they never used to brief us about where to stand in case they asked for tutsi or hutus to stand @-@ up .
bikomeza kugenda gutyo , ntibitinze nyine nraimuka ngera mu wa kabiri ; mu wa gatatu ; ||| therefore , things continued like that and it never took long , i shifted from the first class to the second class to the third up the fourth .
mu wa kane turi mu kihembawe cya mbere , ||| i remember it was in the first term in april .
ari mu kwa kane . nraibuka igihe kimwe ... ubwo habyarimana yapfaaga . ||| i remember one time when habyarimana had died ; he died on the 6th of april 1994 .
yapfuye ku itariki esheshatu [ 06 ] ariko ku itariki zirindwi [ 07 ] nkanjyae njyae nibwo nbimenye . abandi bo bari babimenye . ||| but on the 7th that is when i knew that he was died yet others knew it earlier .
tuicaye tuesae ku irembo n' abandi bose baicaye barimo bibaza iby' ukuntu umukuru w' igihugu yapfuye ! ||| we were seated outside the house with several other people who were wondering about the president 's death .
ni uko hamaze umwanya tugiye kubona tubona hakurya aho baitaaga za mushubati na hehe hose ... batangiye kugenda batwika amazu . ||| and after some time , we saw across in mushubati and other areas , houses burning .
ni uko muri ako kanya turi tuicaye ku irembo turi abantu benshi , ||| we were many people seated outside .
hamanuka igitero cy' abantu benshi bari baturutse aho baita za bandamiko n' abakaiga bari batuye ruguru , ||| and , immediately we saw a very big group of attackers coming from bandamiko they were the bakiga , who lived just across .
bari bari kumwe n' umugabo umwe baitaaga fayineto turi tuturanye . ||| they were with a certain man who was called fayineto ; he was our neighbour .
agenda avuga abaereka mbese ama quartiers [ utucae ] y' ahantu hari hatuye abatutsi . bamanuka batunyuramo hagati bagenda bavuga bati @: ||| he was introducing them the areas , which were mainly occopied by tutsis .
"@ ahangaha naho hari umuryango munini w' abantu b' abatutsi batuye muri kano kacae , aka gasozi ni akabo ubwo naho nimumara kuzamuka epfo iriya , ||| they passed in the midst of our group and said , "@ there is a big number of tutsis living in this area ! it is only the tutsis covering this hill .
ubwo muri buzamukaire hano mugendae mukora ahangaha . @" ||| therefore , once you are done with those areas in the valley , you will come and do a good job here . @"
ubwo baravuga bati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose abatutsi nibo batuiciye umutae ... umukuru w' igihugu , ||| then they said , "@ it must be the tutsis who killed our president .
bianze bikunze ntabwo mugomba kubaho . @" ||| therefore , they must n't live . @"
ubwo uwahoze ari bourgmestre wa commune mabanza , yitwaaga bagirishema ignace . ||| then the former burgomaster of mabana district ; mr. bagirishema ignace came .
araza ... yagendaaga n' imodoka avugair muri micro [ indangururamajwi ] avuga ngo @: "@ abatutsi bose aho bari nibazamuke bagendae kuri commune , babashae kubarindira hamwe bose . @" ||| he was moving in a car speaking loudly using a microphone , he was saying that , "@ all tutsis wherever they are should come up at the district 's offices in oder for them to ensure all the tutsi 's security at once . @"
kubera ko bari batangiye kugenda batwika impande n' impande , hasigaye ahongaho i wacu . ariko baheraaga hasi bagenda bazamura . ||| because they had started burning from all sides except our home village . however they would begin from the valley and come up to the hill slowly by slowly .
ahitwaaga za mushubati bari bamaze kutwika , za secteur za kihara , noneho baza bagana i rubaengair . ||| they had burned all those ends of mushubati , gihara sector , and they were proceeding towards rubengera .
tubonye bari kutwika rero tuumvise n' imodoka ihise ku muhanda , ari kugenda avuga ngo , ngo @: "@ abatutsi bose ngo nibahungire kuri commune , ||| therefore , after realising that houses were being burnt , yet someone was anouncing that all tutsis should seek refugee at the district 's offices where they would offer security services to all of them .
kugirango babashae kubarindira hamwe bose . @" tuesae turazamuka , na papa na mama n' imiryango , turazamuka . ||| we all went to the district ; my father , my mother and families all of us we left for the district .
tugeze kuri commune hari abantu benshi cyane , hari ku itariki zirindwi [ 07 ] . burira buracya , ku itariki umunani [ 8 @/ 04 /1994 ] abantu bakomeza kuza ari benshi , ||| when we reached there , there were many people , it was on the 7th of april .
kugeza n' ubwo babura ahantu bahagarara , kuko ikibuga cyose cya commune kiri kiuzuye . kandi abantu bakiza ari benshi . noneho bourgmestre bagirishema akomeza kuvuga ati @: ||| morning come , which was on the 8th of april 1994 but people continued coming in big numbers .
"@ kuko abantu bakiza ari benshi , kandi abakaiga bari kumanuka ruguru iriya , babafitiye umugambi yuko bagomba kubicira ahangaha . ibyaba byiza kurushaho ni uko mwafata ibintu byanyu , ||| then bagirishema the burgomaster went on and said , "@ since several people are still coming , yet the bakiga are coming from up there with a plan of killing you from here .
n' abana n' abantu batabashije kugenda mukabasindagiza , muesae mukajya muri stade kuko niho hantu hagari , kandi hakolotiriye [ cloturer @hazitiye ] neza ku buryo mwabasha kurindaw neza , nkuko byakogombye kugenda . ||| i guess the best idea is to carry your properties and babies , and help those who can not walk , up to the stadium .
kuko aho ngaho nta mutekano uhagije uri uhari , kuko ni ahantu harangaye abantu bari kuza ari benshi , abandi bari mu mihanda , abandi baje bazanye n' ibintu byabo ... nuko ... akibitubwira gutyo abantu bari bakimanuka ari benshi . ||| since it is a big place and well fenced , it will be easy to protect you as required . @"
aravuga ati @: "@ muesae mugomba kugenda , mwagera muri stade bakabarindira hamwe , ba ... mbese niho muba mufite umutekano uhagije , ||| truly at the district it was not secure because it was an open place with people coming in big numbers , others were on the road ; some would come with all their belongings ... so he said that we had to go to the stadium where we would all be protected .
kuko hari abasirikare bari bubae batatse [ bagose ] impande zose , baraba ari benshi , nta muntu ushobora kuza kubainjiraan , ngo abashae kugira inabi yabagirair » . ||| geneerally it was the safer place where no one would attack us and be able to do any harm to us .
akimara kubivuga atyo abantu bari bakiza ari benshi , ubwo abandi bahita bamanuka . ||| as soon as he had finished saying so ... people were still coming in big numbers and others were leaving .
iwacu turi abana barindwi , abakobwa babiri n' abahungu batanu . ||| we were seven children and home ; two girls and five boys .
njyewe nri uwa kane , ||| i was the fourth born , the first three were boys .
nkurikiraaga abahungu batatu umwe aravuga ati ... yitwaaga epa ... epaphrodite dushimimana yari mukuru yigaga 4ieme secondaire [ mu wa kane w' amashuri yisumbuye ] aravuga ati @: ||| so one of them said ... he was called epa ... epaphrodite dushimimena . he was a bit old ; he was in senior four [ secondary ] .
"@ njyewe ... [ ubwo papa yaratubwiye ati @: @"@ ni ukugenda tuesae tukajya ku kibuye kuko murabona ko nta kunri bigenda . @" ||| he said ... but dad had told us that , we should all go to kibuye because there was no other alternative . @"
] aravuga [ epa ] ati @: "@ njyewe ntabwo nshobora kujya ku kibuye , ngo nemerae kupfa nk' imbwa , njyenda njyana n' aba bantu bose ntinzi ... njyewe ngomba kusubira mu rugo wenda bahanyicire ariko ntinshobora kufata urugendo ngo njyende ku kibuye . @" ||| then epa said , "@ i will n't go to kibuye to wait for death like a dog , follow all these people ... i have to go back home and rather die there than taking a journey to kibuye . @"
ubwo arabiihorera we asubira mu rugo , ||| so , he refused going and went back home .
noneho uwitwaga aimable na pacifique njyewe nkurikiraaga , baramukurikiraga . bo babajyana ku ... hari mugabo umwe uri inshuti yacu , ||| then my other brother called aimable with pacific whom i followed , they followed him and they were taken to ... there was a certain man who was a family friend .
yapfaanaga ikintu na bourgmestre banabana mu gipangu , ||| he was related to the burgomaster and they were living in the same gate .
aba ariho babajyana . ||| that is where they were taken .
noneho jyewe na murumuna wanjye batujyana ... hari umukobwa umwe mama yari yarabyaye muri batisimu tubanaaga , ||| then my sister and i , we were taken to ... there also another lady , to whom my mum was a godmother . at times we would live together .
batujyana iwabo tuba yo . ||| we were taken to her home and we stayed there .
abandi batoya babiri nabo basigaraan na mama bose bajyana muri stade . ||| the remaining two who were the youngest , stayed with mum and went to the stadium with her .
ubwo tumaze kugenda baragenda bagerayo turabimenya ko bagezeyo . ||| after we left , they also left and when they got there we were informed .
undi nawe yasubiye ku matongo ... kunza hari ku matongo kuko bari bamaze kuhasenya ariko batari batwika . ||| the other one went back to the abandoned home ; it was already demolished though they had n't burnt it .
twebwe tuguma ahongaho ntabwo turi tuzi uko bibaye , ||| we stayed there and we did n't what had happened .
turi tuzi bagiye ku kibuye bakabarindirayo barangiza tukazaongera tukabonaan , ||| we thought that those who went to kibuye are going to be protected and after some time , we would join up again .
kuko bari batuohereje n' ahantu ubona hagaragara . kandi abantu bari baziraanye na bourgmestre ba hafi muri famille tukaumva ko nta kibazo tushobora kugira twebwe . ||| because they had sent us in a home that was well off ; ‘ people who were related to the burgomaster ! ’ we thought we were really safe .
tuba ahongaho ku itariki umunani [ 8 /04 /1994 ] , bigeze nimugoraba , ||| so , we stayed there on the 8th/04/1994 .
nibwo uwari data wacu witwaga kasasair yagize gutya azamura inka zose zo mu rugo turi tufite azizana ahongaho turi turi , ||| and , in the evening uncle gasasira brought all the cows , which were at home in that home where we were .
amaze kuzizana ahita asubirayo , ati @: ||| then he went back .
« ku kibuye abantu baracyari kuza ari benshi ... ati @: ||| but before he left , he told us that , "@ several people are still coming in kibuye but they are all worried because there is a rumor that they are going to kill them .
« ariko hari ikihuha abantu bose bafite ubwoba ko bagiye kubica ati hari igihe wenda tushobora kutazaongera kubonaan aba atusezeyeho gutyo aragiye . ||| there is a possibility that we will never see each other again . @" be said bye to us and left .
amaze kugenda tuguma aho ngaho haba hamanutse i gitero kiza kivuga ngo @: « ku kibuye ... [ bari kuza baririmba ] ngo abantu bose bari muri stade ngo @: turabatsembatsembye , ngo @: ||| we stayed there and suddenly there came a group of attackers saying [ they were singing ] ; we have wiped away all the people who were in the stadium in kibuye .
turabamaze , ||| they are all finished .
abasigaye ngo n' utwagiye tusigara muri quartier [ mu tucae batuyemo ] , ||| maybe those who remained in their home areas are the ones who have survived and we have to search for them seriously .
ngo abo ngabo nibo tugomba kushakisha uruhindu , tukahiga n' imbwa kugirango ntihagirae umuntu n' umwe usigara . ||| we shall use dogs to hunt them so that no one stays behind . @"
kuko benshi bari bagiye ku kibuye biragaragara ko ari abantu bakuru , mbese bose bo bamaze kupfa . ||| apparently those who went to kibuye were the old people and they had killed all of them .
kuburyo no kuri buri muryango wa stade hose hari bariyeri nta ubashije kusohoka , ||| they had set roadblocks on every entrance and exit of the stadium .
uri kusohoka wese bari kugenda bamutema ... bamutema . ||| no one was able to get out ; whoever would need to pass they would hack him or her .
tumaze kubiumva gutyo nkangae ninjye uri mukuru , na murumuna wanjye turi turi kumwe , numva ko ari ibindi binri . ||| after hearing that ... since i was the eldest to my sister whom we were together , i realized things had worsened .
nti bamaze kubica , noneho twebwe tusigaye hehe ? ||| then i wondered , " since they have killed them , where are we left ? @"
uwo mugabo rero ... uri ... aho ngaho turi turi , ||| then , the owner of the home where we were living .
amaze kubiumva , aravuga ati @: "@ ibyo ari byo byose namwe ... [ yitwaaga munyagishari ] ... ati @: ibyo aribyo byose namwe barahita bagaruka kubareba . ||| after hearing that he said , "@ all in all they will come back for you @" his name was munyagishari .
ati mu bantu bari kushakisha bagomba kupfa bianze bikunze hano muri rubaengair , harimo abagabo batatu . ati @: kahaizi arimo , ||| he continued , "@ among the people who are most wanted in rubengera , there are three men . those three must die ; "@ gahizi is among them . @"
niwe uri papa wanjye yitwaaga kahaizi evariste ; ||| my father , he was called gahizi evariste .
hagomba kupfa karungu ; hagomba kupfamo n' umugabo witwa leonard . ||| then he went on mentioning the names ; "@ karungu is one of them and leonard . @"
abo ... uwo leonard barakoranaaga bose bari abarimu baigisha i mushubati . ||| leonard was my father 's colleague ; they were teachers in mushubati .
ati @: "@ abo bagabo bagomba kupfa ati @: bianze bikunze ubungubu namwe bari buze kubanyiciraho . @"@ ||| "@ whatever it takes , they must die . they will even come to kill you in my eyes . @" he told us . we could n't understand what he was taking about .
twebwe tuumva ni ibintu tutaumva tuicara hanze turi kumwe n' abandi bana ku irembo , ||| therefore , we sat outside with other kids .
noneho ubwo tumaze kaumva ko ku kibuye ho bamaze kubica , tuumva nyine ko ntakisigaye ntawe tugomba kupfa . ||| when we had that all those who went to kibuye were killed , we knew that we are the next to be killed .
noneho tujya mu nzu , umugabo akatubwira ati @: "@ mwebwe mwiza hano mu nzu kuko bari buze kuza basaka , ||| and , whenever we would try to enter in the house , that man would tell us that , "@ remain outside because they will come to check in the house .

mubae mukina n' abandi bana ntabwo bari bubamenye . @" ||| therefore , keep on playing with other kids outside they will n't know you . @"
haza kumanuka igitero kigiye kwa karungu , ||| and then certain group of attackers went to karungu 's home .
kuko uwo karungu we yari yanze ... nawe yari yanze kujya aho muri stade yasigaye ahongaho , yabaga ahitwa mu nrara hakurya aho baita mu gacaca gutyo . ||| karungu had also refused to leave his home so he remained there in ndara where he lived just across a place called gacaca .
kihanyuze , habonekamo umuntu umwe uri uzi iwacu , ni umukobwa witwaga sesaeko . ||| and when that group past , there was some lady called seseko , who knew our family .
araza aratubwira ati @: @"@ ibyo ari byo byose hano hantu uyu mugabo utuye hano n' inshuti yo kwa kahaizi , yamurerairaga abana , ati @: ||| then she said , "@ the man who lived here was a good friend to gahizi .

harimo uwo sesaeko niwe nbashije kumenyamo , n' undi mugabo witwaga byiringiro uri utuye aho ku kigabiro , ||| i only knew seseko plus a another man who was called byiringiro ; he lived in kigabiro .

eh ... tubona igitero kiturutse ku ntuza ... barimo kuza bavuga bati @: @"@ n' abari basigaye bose tumaze kusubiramo . @" ||| then we saw a group of attackers who were coming from ... they coming saying that , "@ even those who had remained we have completed them . @"
umwe akavuga ati @: "@ njyewe nishe abo kwa kanaka . ati @: ngiye ahantu hari hari umuryango wo kwa kanaka , ||| one would say , "@ i have killed the family of so and so .
nbaheramo nibo njyewe ... nibo niiciye kuko nibo bantu numvaaga batajyaaga banjyamo , ||| i looked for them and killed them because they are the ones i never liked most .
nibo bantu tutajyaaga tuvugana , nibo bantu igihe cyose numvaaga umutima wanjye utabishimaiye . ||| we never used to talk and heart was never happy with them . @"
undi nawe tuumva avuze gutyo , noneho umugabo umwe aravuga ati @: ||| then another one said the same story .
"@ muri famille [ mu muryango ] yo kwa kahaizi , ati @: njyewe ... n' uko nbonye nta bantu benshi nri nzi mo . kahaizi ntawe nbonyemo , ||| and then another man said , "@ in gahizi 's family though i never saw many of the members ; i did n't see gahizi .
ati @: ibyo aribyo byose umugore we yapfuye , ||| but the wife died .
ati @: ariko ... ati @: ||| that is the only family i killed . @"
njyewe niho honyine nishe . @" avuga ukuntu yagiye abakubita ubuhairi , avuga ukuntu yagendaaga abakubita icyuma , ||| he was imitating how he hit them using a club , saying how he was cutting them with knives .
ati @: "@ ariko na bwa bwana bwose ntabwo nbonye . @" ||| "@ but i did n't see all their kids . @"
eh ! ||| he added .
numvise avuze gutyo mpita nbwira murumuna wanjye nti @: "@ yenda wowe simbizi , nti @: ariko tuicarae ahangaha baze batuicirae ahangaha , ||| when i had him saying that , i told my sister that , "@ i do n't know your idea but i suggest we sit here so that they find us and kill us from here .
ni benshi ... kuko urabiumva ko nta kisigaye , ||| hope you can here that they are very many and there is nothing left .
nta n' aho tusigaye . ||| we are not even left anywhere . @"
ubwo nka gutya inberae y' umuhanda hari hari ahantu hari amasaka , turi muri ako kayira nyine tugiye kugwa mu muhanda , tukimara kubiumva . eh ! ||| across the road there was a sorghum plantation , we were still in the shortcut almost getting to the main road .
mu mutaima wanjye numva bibaye ukundi kuntu , ntinzi ukuntu nbiumvise mbese . ||| as soon as i heard them saying those words , heart charged ... i can not explain how i felt .
numva biranrenze nravuga nti @: ||| it was beyond my understanding .
"@ njyewe nraicara ahangaha bahanyicire ntabwo nshobora kugenda bibaho . @"@ ||| then i said , "@ i am going to sit here . let them kill me from here , i will n't walk anymore .
baze bansangae hano banyicae [ hari nko mu ma saa saba ] . ariko ntabwo nshobora kukomeza inzira , witure mu bantu nka bariya ? noneho nti @: ||| they should find me here and kill me . @" it was around 1:00 ... "@ i can not continue walking , how can one land in a group of such people ? @"
bari butuicae nk' uko baishe ya nka bagenda bagenda bakata urutoki , bakata ikirenge . nravuga nti @: jyewe simva aha . ||| i would imagine them killing us like they killed the other cow ; cutting a finger , a leg ... i said , "@ i will not move further . @"
mpita nicara . ||| then i sat down .
nicara aho ngaho mu masaka hafi y' inzira , ||| i sat in the sorghum plantation next to the road .
nraryama nravuga nti @: wenda nibashaka bagirae ngo ni umurambo barekae kunyica . ||| then i laid down , "@ if they find me lying then may mistake me to be a corpse . @" i imagined .
ariko byiza byo reka nryamae mu nzira nti @: wenda ntihari bauburae n' uwijijisha akubitaeho ikintu ariko ... eh ! ||| i decided that it was better to lie on road maybe one would hit me accidentally and then i would rest .
birangirae mbese . nraumva kubaho kuri iyi si jyewe jyenyine ... numvaaga ari ibintu binrenze . ||| because i would imagine living alone in this world and i would find it very hard to understand .
numva biranyobeye agahinda karanyica murumuna wanjye aranbwira ati @: ||| i got confused with a lot of sorrows .
"@ rero reka nkubwirae ... @" [ yitwa dudu ... ubundi yitwa uwumukiza grace ] ... aranbwira ati @: ||| then my sister told me that , "@ let me tell you ... @" she was called dudu as nickname but her true name is uwumukiza grace .
rero clemence reka nkubwirae , ||| she said , "@ listen , clemence .
niba wiyemeje kusigara hano , jyewe ntabwo ndi busigarae ahangaha . @" ||| if you decided to stay here , i will not stay here with you . @"
ni umuntu w' intwari cyane . ati @: ||| she is so brave .
"@ njyewe nzaemera npfae , ngiye kugenda mpure nabo nikomereze , nkomezae muri stade wenda ntinbura umuntu n' umwe nzi wo mu rugo , wenda tujyae tugendana . ||| she told me that , "@ i have accepted dead , i will meet them and proceed to the stadium . perhaps i would meet there at least one person from home then we would continue together .
ariko wowe ubwoba bwawe ... ntabwo nsigaraan nawe ... ntabwo nshobora kuemera kupfa nreba . ||| but you with your cowardliness ... i can not stay with you because i can not die seated just watching .
ubwo nraicara , nravuga nti @:@ basi njyewe ntabwo nshobora kuitura muri bariya bantu . ||| so , i sat and imagined , "@ well , i am incapable of landing in a group of those people . @"
nri nnutse cyane ndi muremure ariko nnutse ... nnutse . ||| i was tall and slim .
noneho we akaba yari abyibushye kandi ari mugufi . ||| my sister was fat and short .
njyewe aho nnyuraaga hose bavuga bati @: "@ dore ya nzoka . @" abo tuhuye nabo ... abana tuhuye , bati @: ||| and , wherever i would pass they would shout at me saying , "@ look at that snake ... @" all kids we would met they would say the same thing .
"@ dore ya nzoka . @" ariko undi we ntibamumenye . ||| but my sister they would n't recognize her .
nravuga nti @: uraumva bariya bana tuhuye ukuntu banbwiye , bavuga ngo @: ||| therefore i asked her , "@ did you hear what those kids said ?
"@ dore inzoka , ngo @:@ ubungubu iracyajya hehe ? @" ||| they said that , [ look at that snake , where is it heading at this time ?
none wowe ngo ; "@ tugende tuiturae muri bariya bantu ? @" bari bunyicae kutae ? ||| and now you are telling me that we go and meet those people , how do you think they are going to kill us ?
nibabanza kunyica ? urabibona utae wowe ? ko uri buicwae n' agahinda . ||| and in case they killed me first , how will you handle it ? definitely you will dye of sorrows .
nti njyewe nsigaye hano . ||| i will stay here . @"
ubwo mpita ... hari mu .. mu masaka , ||| it was in the sorghum plantation .
nravuga nti reka nzae nryamae no mu nzira wenda bari buze bankandagirae . umwe akubitae undi akubitaeho birangirae , aho kugirango banyicae nabi . mpita nururuka ku gakingo kari kari aho , ||| then i decided to lay in the way so that they come and step on me or hit me at once rather than being killed with torture .
nicara neza mu nzira nraryama . ||| therefore , i came down the hill and laid in the way .
we ahita anbwira ati @: @"@ bayi njyewe ntinshobora kupfa nicaye ahangaha . @" ||| then she said , "@ bye ... i can not dye just seated here . @"
ubwo ahita agenda . ||| immediately she left .
tuherukaan ubwo ngubwo hari mu matariki nka cumi n' abiri [ 12 /04 /1994 ] gutyo tuherukaanye ubwo ngubwo , tuongeye kubonaan mu kwezi kwa cyenda kushira . ahita agenda ubwo ngubwo ati @: "@ njyewe ntinshobora kupfa nicaye . @" ||| that was the last time i saw her , [ it was around the 12th april in 1994 ... until towards the end of september , that is when i saw her again ] she just left me and said that she could not sit and wait for her death .
nryama ahongaho , ||| i laid in the road .
ntinzi hari nk' ukuntu ahari umuntu ajya apfa kubera ubwoba , ku buryo umuntu ashobora kuza akaba yanakuica ntugirae icyo wunva , ||| i guess there is a way that one dies due to fear , to the extent of not feeling anything though being hurt to death .
kubera ko umaze kupfa . ||| because you are already dead .
ubwo nraicara nraryama nrasinziraiye nicura ari nka saa kumi n' ebyiri hatabona . umh ! ||| therefore , i laid down and i was taken by sleep . by the time i woke @-@ up it was about 6:00 p.m. in the dark .
nrebye nbona ndi ahantu mu masaka ku muhanda , ||| i looked around and found out that i was in the sorghum plantation on the road .
nravuga nti @: ese bishoboka kutae ? ||| "@ how is it possible ! @"
nrebye doudou nramubura , ||| i wondered . i looked around but i could n't see doudou .
nravuga nti uru nirwo rupfu rwanjye . ||| "@ this is my death . @"
nreba ahantu ndi ntekereza ubuzima nri nrimo nrahaicaye mpava nka saa kumi n' ebyiri n' igice hatabona . ||| i looked at the place where i was and compared it with the life i led before ... i sat there till around 6:30 p.m. it was in dark .
ntatangira ntatekereza ubuzima nbayemo kuva nkiri umwana muto , maze kutangira kuiga , ||| i started imagining my childhood life , my school life , and how far i had reached .
aho nri ngeze ... eh ! ||| eh !
papa ... mama ... basaza banjye ... barumuna banjye ... bose nrabareba . ||| my father , my mother , my brothers and my young sisters , all i have lost them .
nrabireba numva biranyobeye . ||| i imagined all that and got confused .
ntangira kureba muri famille [ mu muryango ] hirya hose nbona abantu bose bapfuye , ||| i started searching my family members but all of them were killed .
nbona nsigaye jyenyine , ||| i was left alone .
biranyobera . ||| so i could n't understand it .
nibwo nhagurukaaga nravuga nti @: "@ ese nkorae iki ? @" ||| then i woke up and asked myself , "@ what can i do ? @"
ntekereza kufata umuhanda ngo ngendae muri stade , nbona ntabwo biri bushobokae . ntekereza uko nribusubirae hahanri banyirukanye , naho nbona ntibiri bushobokae . ||| i thought about going to the stadium but it was impossible , then i thought bout going back to the other family where they had chased me but still it seemed impossible .
nravuga nti @: ahari niba hari haje imbwa nonaha ahari zika nyica , ariko nkaumva ko nvuyeho nbitekerezaho ... bigeze aho ... nshaka igisubizo ntakibura . ||| then i said , "@ i wish dogs would come and eat me , because i would die and there would be nothing much left to worry about . @" i failed to find a decision .
mpitamo kukomeza akayira karimo aho hagati mu masaka , ||| later i decided to follow some small route that was in the sorghum plantation .
nvuga nti wenda nhura n' igitero kirimo kugenda kishakisha bakahita banyica . ||| i was hoping that i would attackers , who would be looking for survivors to kill them so , they would kill me .
decision [ icyemezo ] nfashe ni iyo , yo kugenda ngendaa ... ngendae , aho buzair ngeze azabae ari ahongaho . ||| i decided to keep walking aimlessly , wherever night would find me , i would sleep there .
numva ntinshaka kaongera kuihisha . ||| i did n't want to hide myself anymore .
noneho nkihaguruka ahongaho , ||| then i stood up and started moving .
ngenze nko muri kilometero ngenda gutya mu masaka , ngendaaga ahantu kugirango ahari mpure n' abantu bari kushaka abandi bantu . ||| i walk a distance of about a kilometer ; i would walk though ways where i would meet people hunting others .
bahitae banyicira ahongaho , ||| because i wanted to die .
birangirae ntihazagirae n' uzanbona no hanze . ||| i did n't want to people to ever see me in exile .
nkijyenda mpita mpura n' umugabo umwe witwaga alexis , ||| while i was still moving , i met a certain man called alexis .
uwo yajyaaga anyigisha ariko asimbura mama . mama yari amaze iminsi yaravunitse ukuguru , noneho uwo mugabo akaba yaramusimburaaga . eh ! ||| he was teaching me in place of my mother because ; my mum had injured her leg . therefore , he replaced my mum .
tukubitanye nramubwira nti @: "@ nbabarira unyicae . nti nbabarira unyicae , ||| so when we met i told him that , "@ please help me and kill me . @"
monsieur , nbabarira unyicae . ||| i pleaded .
aranbwira ati @: @"@ wowe nkuica ntae ? ||| then he said that , "@ how can i kill you ?
ntabwo ... mubo ... nishe benshi , ntakica benshi , ariko ntinshobora kuica umwana wa dativa ntibibaho . @" umh ! ||| i killed too many people and i will kill more but i can not kill dative 's child . @"
nramubwira nbabarira unyicae . ||| but i insisted , "@ please kill me .
mama yapfuye , papa yapfuye , musaza wanjye batatu bamaze kupfa murumuna nawe aragiye igitero nonaha kiramwishe , ||| my mum and dad are dead ; all my three brothers are dead , and my young sister desperately went to attackers now they killed her .
none ngewe nsigaye hehe ? ||| i am the only one left and i am left nowhere .
nbabarira unyicae ... niba unkunda nbabarira unyicae . ||| so please , if you like me , do me a favor and kill me . @"
tukubitanair gutya mu masaka , ||| we had met from somewhere in the sorghum plantation .
yari afite inkota irabagirana , irimo ijejeta amaraso ibyo aribyo byose yari amaze nko kuica umuntu . ||| and he was holding a glittering knife , which was dropping blood . it seemed like he was coming from killing someone .
nramubwira nti @: "@ nbabarira ... @" turayirwanair , ||| but i kept on asking him to kill me in fact we fought for the knife .
nti @: "@ nbabarira unyicae ntaho ndi , ||| i begged him ; "@ i am left no where , please kill me .
uku niko kupfa nabi ... ungairiye neza ... @" ati @: "@ rwose bebe ... [ bajyaaga banyita bebe ] ... ati @: ||| this is the worst death . the best you can do for me is to kill me . @" then he said , "@ sincerely bebe !

ariko wowe ... nishe benshi n' ubu ntakica benshi , ||| but i can not kill you though i killed so many people , and i am still killing others .
maze kuica benshi ntibabaarika . kandi ntakica benshi . ||| the people i have killed are uncountable and i will kill other more .
ariko wowe ntabwo nshobora kukuica . kuko amaraso yawe nzayabazaw . ||| but i can not kill you because i can be accused of your blood .
nramubwira nti @: ungairiye neza ... ntapfukama . nbabarira ntakuinginze . unbariye uka nyica ahari ko ... simbizi , ||| i knelt down and begged him again ; "@ you would be of much help to me if you killed me . please i am begging you .
imaan yonyine yazakuihembair . ||| there is nothing i can offer but god would reward you for that . @"
nuko aranreba ... amaze kunreba aranbwira ati @: "@ oya , ati @: ||| he looked at me and said , "@ no !

aranbwira ati @: ||| i said to him .
"@ aho kugirango nkuicae reka nkuerekae . @" ||| then he said that instead of killing you , "@ let me show you . @"
nti @: aho unjyana hose nirwo rupfu rurenze . ||| but i told him that , "@ wherever you may take me , it would be the worst death for me .
kuko ungairiye neza nakwibagirana kuko kusigara njyenyine ... kandi aho hantu ushyira ntabwo ariho nzahora . ||| the best you can do for me is to do something that would end my story . because surviving alone in this world ... look i will never stay there where you are going to take me . @"
aramanura anjyana iwabo . anjyanye iwabo ... eh , ||| he took me to his home .
nabo batuye aho ngaho mu gacaca , mama we anbonye , ahita atera hejuru ngo @: @"@ dore ya nzoka . ||| they were living in gacaca and when his mother saw me , she shouted and said , "@ look at the other snake !

ngo nbabarira ngo @: simbashaka . simbashaka ... simbashaka , nsohorair ahangaha . @" ||| just do me a favor and take her out of here ; i do n't want her here ... i do n't want her ... not at all . @"
kuko bari batuye hejuru y' umuhanda gutya , hepfo haba haturutse igitero . ||| their home was situated just above the road and then , a group of attackers was coming from the other side [ below ] of the road .
ngo @: "@ reka nzae nbahamagarae baze bamwice avaeho rwose anibagirane . ati @: kuko ntinifuza yuko mu nzu yanjye hashobora kubamo inzoka nk' iyingiyi . @" ||| then she said , "@ let me call them . they will kill her and she will be a gone story . i can not let my house accommodate such a snake . @"
umuhungu ahita afata inkota yari afite afata nyina mu ntuze ... aramubwira ati @: "@ mama , wowe uranyibyaraiye , ntabwo ubiemera ? ||| then he held his knife on his mother and asked her , "@ mother , you know that you produced me , is n't it ?

ati [ umukecuru ] : "@ nushaka unyicae ntabwo bishoboka . @" ||| "@ you rather kill me but it is impossible . @" immediately she rushed to the door and shouted for help , "@ help me ... help me .
aba aragiye ku muryango akoma akaruru . ati @: "@ nimuntabare ... ... nimuntabare hano inzoka zanteye . @" ||| i am attacked by snakes . @"
noneho mu kihae bakijararanganya kuko ni ahantu hari amazu menshi , bakijararanganya , umuhungu nibwo yahitaaga amufata amupfuka umunwa , amusunikair munsi y' igitanda , ||| as the neighbors were still preparing to intervene , the son grabbed her and held her mouth and then pushed her under the bed .

ubwo ibitero bararanganyaije babura umuntu , batangira kushakisha mu masaka babura umuntu barikomereza . ||| the attackers were still looking for that person [ me ] , but they did n't find anyone . therefore , they proceeded .
ubwo biri muri iryo joro burira ... ... ubundi nijoro ntabwo bajyaaga bakunda gusaka cyane . ||| in was the same night and they never used to search a lot at night .
bigeze mu gitondo umuhungu ubwo yari yagiye ... uwo alexis yari yagiye mu kazi nyine . ||| therefore , in the morning , alexis had of course left for work .
aho agarukaiye nibwo yabwiraaga mushiki we ... yari afite mushiki witwa therese nawe yabaga mu nzu kubera ko ngo yasaga n' abatutsi , ||| when he came back he told his sister who was called therese ; she never used to go out of the house because she looked like the tutsi .
yari muremure ananutse , noneho aho anyuze hose mu nzira bakashaka kumwica , ||| she was tall and slim and wherever she would pass they would attempt killing her .
mbese bakamureka ari uko amaze kuvuga musaza we , kubera ko bari baziraanye bakoranaaga , akahita aza bakamwihorera . ||| they would let her go after mentioning her brother because he was known as a colleague whom they worked together . so she would come home after they released her .
noneho aramubwira ati @: @"@ therese rero uyu mwana ugomba kubaan nawe nta zigerae abura amazi yo kukaraba , ntazigerae abura ibyo kurya , ||| then the brother told her , "@ therese , you have to stay with this kid . she should never fail to get water for bathing or food to eat .

akaba ari ho mbese nawe agomba kuba .. @" mushiki we arabiemera , ||| her sister agreed .
aragenda ashyira mu cyumba arankarabya arangaburira nraryama . ||| she took me to the bedroom , washed me , and gave me food to eat . then i slept .
bigeze nko mu ma saa tanu haza kuza ... bigeze nko mu ma saa tanu haje kuza umukecuru w' aho ngaho tubaga , agenda ari kushakisha ahantu hose kuko yari amaze kaumva yuko hari ahantu abo bana bo kwa kahaizi bapfairiye . ||| at around 11:00 o'clock , the other old woman came [ the one whom we first lived together ] she coming looking for us from every where because she was told that , "@ gahizi 's children died from some place . @"
kubera abantu batunyuraagaho tuicaye aho ngaho bahise baumva ko tupfuye birangiye . ||| she heard it from the people who passed us from where we were seated . they imagined we later died .
noneho bahita bazamuka babwira uriya mukecuru ... umukecuru wa munyagishali , baramubwira bati @: @"@ ba bana bari bari ahangaha ibyo ari byo byose bapfuye , ||| therefore , those people went straight to that old lady [ the mother to munyagishali ] and told her that , "@ the other kids who were here , must have died .
kubera ko tugiye tunyura ahantu tubabona , tuza kubona umwe arambaraye mu ntuze ... undi turamubura , ||| because we saw them while we were passing by and in a few minutes we saw one lying down and the other one disappeared .
ariko kuko bari bajyanye ibyo aribyo byose n' undi afite ahantu yaguye . ||| maybe she died somewhere else . @"
umugabo niko kunbwira ati @: @"@ rero mwana nbabarira unsohokaire ahangaha . @" ||| then the man told me that , "@ young girl , get out of my house .
eh ! amaze kunbwira gutyo biri bimaze kugera nko mu matariki nka makumyabiri [ 20 ] gutyo ... nravuga nti @: " basi . @" ||| when he told me like that ... it was about the 20th ... then i said , "@ fine . @"

umugabo umwe anfata ukuboko aransohora ati @: "@ ngwino ugomba kupfa ... ugomba kupfaan n' abandi . @" ||| a certain man held me by the hand and said , " come here , you must die like others . @"
noneho hari ukuntu iyo babona umuntu bahitaaga bavuza induru . ||| there was a way they used to shout when they saw a person .
noneho ngiye kaumva numva bakomye akaruru . bakomye akaruru , ||| and then all of a sudden i had people shouting .
ngeze ku muhanda nsanga si njyewe bakakomeye ahubwo hari undi mugabo witwaga rukemasibe uri umwarimu , ||| when i reached at the road , i realized that it was n't me instead , it was another man who was called rukemasibe . he was a teacher and they had revealed him .
nawe bamuvumbuye . bati @: " rukemasire turamubonye . @" ||| "@ we have found rukemasire . @" they said .
abana bari kumwe hari harimo abantu bari baishe ... batemye ariko banzae kupfa , babatwara ku ngorofani . bagiye kubaroha ahantu mu cyobo . ||| the kids they were together , some were hacked but they were still dying ; they had n't died completely and they were taken on a wheelbarrow to a certain pit hole to be dumped .
hari icyobo kiri kiri hariya nyine aho mu gacaca inyuma ya commune , ||| there was a certain pit hole in gacaca just behind the commune 's offices .
ku buryo abantu babaga batemye bakabona ntibapfuye babatwaraaga ku ngorofani bakagenda bakabarohamo . ||| and , all the people who would be hacked but not dead , they would carry them on a wheelbarrow and dump them in that pit .
noneho hari hari umuferege uyoboramo amazi , hari mu kihae cy' imvura , ||| but there was a trench of water and it was during a rainy season .
noneho imvura yagwa amazi agashokera hahanri . ||| therefore , water would run through that trench to the pit hole .
nbwira uwo mugabo nti @: "@ nbabarira unyicae , ariko umpwanye npfae burundu simere nka bariya . niba wiyemeje kunyica , ||| then i told that man , "@ please kill me , but kill me at once because i do n't want to be like those .

"@ kahaizi , ... anbwira karungu ... ngo @: ||| he mentioned names of people and mentioned gahizi and karungu .

baranyihoreye nraongeye nsubiye muri rwa rugo . ||| they left me there . and then i went back to the other home . those perpetrators were all from the tribe called bakiga and they wondered why i was going to that home .
bati @: "@ ariko hariya hantu ari kujya muri ruriya rugo ... [ bari abakaiga kusa ] ... hariya hantu ari kujya muri ruriya rugo harimo inka , ||| "@ maybe those cows in that home belong to her family ! @"

noneho nbwira muzehe nti @: "@ ariko se muzae ... ? nti @: ubu noneho ko inka zishize , ||| then i asked the old man in that home , " since the cows are over , what will you give out next time they come ?
ubutaha uzatanga iki ? ni njyewe uzatanga . @" umusaza aranbwira ati @: "@ ibyo byo urabiumva niyo mpamvu nkubwiye ko ntashaka kaongera kukubona hano . @" ||| it should be me . @" then he said , "@ definitely that is why i told you that i do n't want to see you here anymore . @"
"@ ... nonese nbigirae ntae ? @" ||| "@ so , what can do ? @"
ubwo ngubwo ntasohoka , nravuga nti @: "@ reka ngendae ... @" numva ko igisubizo ari uko ngiye kufata urugendo , nkagenda ku mugaragaro . ||| i asked him . then i got out of the house and said , "@ well , i have to leave ... @" i decided to start moving in open .
uwo mpura nawe yanyica yakora iki ... icyo yifuza cyose . ariko numvae ko ntiicaye hariya . ||| i did n't care about who i would meet and what he would do to me . all i was avoiding was staying in that home .
kuko nrarebaaga ukuntu baje atanze inka . ukuntu baje atanze inka . none zirashize . ||| i saw how he would bribe them with a cow every time they came to his home , till when all the cows were finished .
hari hasigaye inka ebyiri . ||| there had remained two cows , now the two cows were also taken .
none zirashize . ubwo zimaze kushira ... noneho ibyo ari byo byose ngaruka , nawe ntabwo azaemera kusigarair aho . ibyo ari byo byose ... nawe yaragendaaga , ||| therefore , since the cows are finished ... definitely he would not accept to remain with nothing .
ntinigeze mubona yica , ariko yaragendaaga . akaza kugaruka nimugoroba . ||| he also used to move ; i could not see him at home , he would come back in the evening .
akagenda akagaruka nimugoroba . ||| ever , he would go and come back in the evening .
nkavuga nti ubu ninjyewe bazaica . ||| i would say , "@ they will kill me next . @"
noneho nreba ukuntu baishe inka ... nicyo kitumaaga ntashaka no kuhaguma ... kuko nbonaaga nnjyae ari ko ngomba kupfa . ||| but i would imagine how they killed the cows ... in fact that is the only reason why i never wanted to stay there . i would imagine it is would be same way they would kill me .
... nramubwira nti @: "@ ubu nragiye . @"@ ||| i told him that , "@ now i have left . @"
aranbwira ati @: "@ genda rwose unbabarirae , ||| then he asked me that , "@ please go and never think about coming this way .

iyo aya masaka ataza kubaho nta muntu uri kurokoka mu bantu barokokeye i rubaengair . ||| but some times i wonder , i think that is god works ; i always say that if the sorghum plantations were not there , no one would have survived among those who survived in rubengera .
nragenda ... njyae nbaye mu masaka bukira bukacya , ||| i left that home . i lived in the sorghum plantation for days .
bumara kugera nijoro nkagenda nkanywa amazi , ubundi nkagaruka nkaiicarair ahantu nka gutya mu masaka gutya . ||| at night i would go and drink some water and then come back and sit some where in the sorghum plantation .
nkareba ababa bahita , bahita mu bitero , usibye ko abenshi ntabamenyaaga babaga bacanze n' abakaiga b' iyo ... ba ruguru iyongiyo . ||| i would see everyone passing , the attacker , although i would notice them . they used to be mixed up with the bakiga from up there .
nkabonamo abaitwa ba sesaeko ... uwo mukobwa witwaga sesaeko niwe nbonaaga cyane , ||| i would see seseko ... that lady who was called seseko was the common figure , maybe it was because she was the one i knew before .
kuko arinawe nri nzi , n' uwitwaga dushimimana barahita . bukira , ||| i also knew dushimimana , they passed by ... night would fall .
nkaicara nkabireba . ||| i would sit and watch .
noneho haza kuaduka systeme [ uburyo ] y' uko bamaze kumenya y' uko nta bantu bakiba mu ngo , ||| they came up with a new system of hunting people with dogs , after realizing that people no longer live in the house .
noneho bakajya baohereza imbwa mu masaka . ||| they would send dogs in the sorghum .
kuko koko abantu benshi barokotse mu masaka . ||| truly , most people survived from the sorghum plantation .
nkajya niicarair gutyo ... imbwa ... noneho ukajya ugenda niba ushaka nko kuimuka cyangwa ugendagenda , unaniwe kuicara no kuryama , ||| lets say one would walk a bit trying to change a position or when one is tired of either sitting or sleeping .
ukagerageza ukuntu utandukanya amasaka mo hagati buhoro buhoro , ukajya ugenda atanyeganyega . ||| then we would separate the sorghum plants slowly and we would move without shaking .
noneho kubera ko hari ahantu mu mucyamo hasi bakahagarara hejuru ku musozi , bahagarara babona amasaka anyeganyeze , ||| because it was in the valley , they would stand on top of the hill and see shaking sorghum plants .
bakahita bashumurizamo imbwa . ||| immediately they would send dogs and blow whistles .
noneho ukaumva bavugije ifirimbi . ||| and , maybe it would show signs of raining .
noneho imvura iba irakubye , ||| whenever it would rain .
ikubye ... iyo imvura yakubaaga njyewe muri jyewe nhitaaga numva nruhutse nkaumva nfite amahoro yose . nravugaaga nti @: mu nvura nta bari buze kuza kunshaka hano mu masaka . ||| i would fell relieved , because i used to know that no one would hunt me from the sorghum plantation , while it was raining .
n' abari bujyae gusaka baragenda mu ngo ariko ntawe uri buze ngo yemerae kunyagirwa . ||| maybe they will go to homes but no one can allow to be beaten by rain just looking for me .
noneho ngiye kaumva ... ubwo nri mvuya ahantu hamwe nbona haegereye hari umuhanda , kandi nbona ibitero bikikomeza kuza bituruka muri stade , nravuga nti @: ||| suddenly , i heard ... i was trying to shift from where i was , because it was very close to the road yet groups of attackers were still coming from the stadium .
"@ reka nzae nigaire haruguru . @" ntinyaaga kuba npfa nreba . wenda nzamukae nibanyirukaho bari busangae nahwereye . nraimuka nrazamuka nigair haruguru . ||| therefore i decided to extend upwards because i was afraid of dying while i was watching .
eh ! ngiye kaumva numva bavugije ifirimbi . bati @: ||| i said to myself , "@ i better expend a bit and in case they run after me , they will find when i already fainted . @" so i changed the place and went a bit up . suddenly , i heard whistles .
"@ hariya hagati ... murebae murebae impande n' impande , hariya hagati mu masaka ... turabona arimo ahungabana ibyo aribyo byose harimo abantu . @" ||| "@ there is somebody there . check in all sides in the middle of the plantation . the plants are moving , there must be people . @"
umugabo ubwo barinze bapfa bameze gutyo , kuko ... uko nbirebaaga baryamye ahongaho bapfundikanyaije ubura bwabo baryamye gutyo mu nzira , bariho basamba . ||| they finally died while still tied together . how i saw it ... they were lying down in the road with their intestines tied together ; they were dying .
nibwo nbonye igitero kiturutse kuri stade kizamuka nravuga nti @: "@ ubu noneho njyae baranyica batae ? @" ||| then i saw another group of attackers coming from the stadium and i said , "@ how am i going to die ? @"
numva biranrenze . ||| i could n't imagine how .
mpita nfata decision [ icyemezo ] y' uko ngiye kugenda nkaongera nkasubiza ruguru , aho ngaho mu gacaca . nkazamuka nsubira kwa wa mugabo ... ariko numva kusubirayo , ||| then i decided to go back to the other family in gacaca in the other man 's home . but i would imagine going back there yet all cows were finished , i knew he would handle me to the perpetrators .
noneho nta nka afite ari butangae , kandi nawe n' ihari araumva atavairmo aho n' ukuntu yari yaraziruhiye , ariwe uzahairira azigirair kutae ... byose . ||| he wanted some profits out of those cows .
nravuga nti @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose ninsubirayo , nti @: nangae arahita antanga , ||| because he looked after them and cared about them all the time . then i said , "@ if i go back , he will handle me to the perpetrators .
nangae banyicae gutyo birangirae . @" ||| then they would kill me in the same way . @"
ubwo biri bya ... hari hashize iminsi nyine ari nko mu kwa gatanu mu matariki ... mo hagati . ||| days had gone ; it was about mid may .
hashize umwanya ... nibaza ukuntu ngiye kusubira muri urwo rugo biranyobera , noneho mpitamo kaongera kuiicarair hahanri . ||| i took sometime imagining how i would go back to that home but finally i decided to go back in the sorghum and sit .
hari ahantu hari umuferege nyine aho ngaho harengejeho amavetiveri , ||| it was in some trench and they had lied grass [ vetiveri ] on top of the trench .
niicarairmo ... ntakomeza niberamo burira . nmazemo nk' iminsi nk' itatu , nta kintu noneho numva kuko hari igihe cy' imvura , kandi mu kihae cy' imvura ntabwo bakundaaga kugenda cyane . ||| therefore , i sat in there up to night .
ndicaraa ... hashize nk' iminsi nk' itatu ntahaguruka , nongera kujyendagendamo hagati mu masaka , ngiye kaumva numva bavugije induru . imbwa ziraongera ziramanuka . ||| i spent almost three days in there .
eh ... nikubita hasi ... icyo nzi ni uko nikubise hasi , nkaza kaongera kukanguka nko mu ma saa cyenda . nta nbaw nbona , kandi zaje nzibona zingeze iruhande ari nyinshi . ||| it was very silent because those days it would rain a lot yet they would n't go out for people while it was raining .
nravuga nti @: "@ ubungubu zigiye kunrya nabi zinshinga inzara nabwo sipfe . @" nherutse nikubita hasi ahari umuntu ajya muri coma [ kuta ubwenge ] agahwera ariko igihe kizagera akazayivamo . nikubise hasi birarangira . ||| therefore , after those three days i stood up and walked in the sorghum plantation again .
hari nka saa nkahae ? ||| what time was it ?
hari nko mu ma saa cyenda n' igice . ... nikubita hasi nbiheruka ubwo ngubwo . ||| it was around 3:30 ... i lost my understanding when i fell down .
bigeze nimugoroba ... ... nimugoroba rwose . ntabwo habonaaga , nibwo nicuye . ||| and in the evening ... yes it was in the evening because it was dark , that is when i gained consciousness .
njya kureba nbona ndi ahantu ntazi , mu mwijima , numva nvuye ahantu kure cyane . ariko numva ntinibaza ikintu kibaye . ||| i did n't know where i was ; i felt like i was coming from very far and i would n't imagine what had happened to me .
nibwo nje kutekereza . nongera kutekereza ukuntu ibyo bintu bigenze , ntekereza iby' uwo boniface ukuntu bari bamwishe , ||| then later i started recalling what had happened , all that had happened to boniface ; how he was killed .
ntangira kutekereza niba ari inzozi ... niba ari ibintu nrebaaga nbitekerezaho umwanya munini rwose , ||| i began wondering if i was dreaming or if it was real . i spent a long time thinking about it .
bigeza nko mu ma saa tanu z' ijoro . ariko amafilimbi ari kwa kunri bikivuga , ariko nkaumva bavumbuye abantu hano iruhande , ||| and a round 11:00 p.m. in the night ... but they were still blowing the whistles ; they would retrieve someone just next to me , then retrieve others the other side .
nkaumva bavumbuye abandi ahangaha ... abandi nkaumva baranishyae rimwe kusa ... basi . ||| i would hear others shouting only once and for all .
nravuga nti ... nkatekereza ukuntu nzapfa bikanyobera . ariko se ... nkareba n' ikintu nkuiicisha nkabona ntinpfa . nkatekereza nkavuga nti ... simbizi . ||| then i said ... i would imagine how i would die ... i would thing of anything i would use to commit suicide and i would see that it would n't kill me .
nkaumva simbizi , ||| i would think but find no solution .
ntinzi icyo nkora . ||| i did n't know what to do .
nraicara burira muri iryo joro ryose , biza kugera aho nta n' ikintu kikikoma . ||| i remained seated all night through , until when there was nothing moving anymore .
buracya nibereye ahongaho mu masaka , ndi jyenyine , ||| morning found me in the sorghum plantation alone .
ariko noneho nkaicwa n' ikintu kimwe . cyo kutekereza kusa . ||| but i was affected by only one thing , ‘ thinking too much .
noneho nza kuibuka hahantu ba bana bo mu rugo banyuze , numva binjemo . ||| ’ then i would recall the memories of the place where my brothers passed .
nravuga nti @: "@ ariko uwakongera nkaicara nkahareba wenda . kusa nkaicara nkahareba , nkaongera nkatekereza ku buzima bwanjye bwa mbere . ||| then i said , "@ i should sit up and try to see that place . @" then i would compare my passed life with the life i was leading .
kuko ubwo nrimo kusa ikisigaye ari uko npfa ... nta kinri . ||| i was only remaining with death .
nrazamuka nicara ahantu ku muhanda nitegeye . ngiye kubona nongera kubona na none bourgmestre amanutse , ||| i went to the road and sat there . while i was sitting there , i the burgomaster passing again .

mu rugo araza ... ubundi ahandi n' abapolisi bagendaaga bainjiramo bakagenda basakasaka , ||| he came to my home by himself yet it was the policemen who were supposed to do that .
ariko we noneho aravuga ati @: "@ njyewe ... @" ajya kwa nyogokuru , kuko nyogokuru yari afite ... [ ubyara papa ] ... yari afite abana babiri babaga inahangaha i kigali . ||| but he said that , "@ i ... @" he went to my grandmother [ my dad 's mother ] ; her two kids were living in kigali .

niba akukubise mu mutawe n' ukuvuga ngo birakubita utugufa ... ibintu byose bijanjagurike usigarae uvirirana . ||| and , if they hit it in the head , it means that , the bone would be crashed and one would keep bleeding .
ariko ntupfae ngo uhwane bitewe n' ahantu bakubise . ||| but one would n't die , depending on which part they hit .
noneho ngiye kubona ukuntu baishe umuntu gutyo , nkahita numva ko ndi bupfae nabi nkahita mpaguruka . ||| therefore , whenever i would see how they kill people , i would just tell that i would die a painful death and i would immediately move .
nraongera nragenda nkajya nizembazembagirira mu masaka ... noneho nza kugi ... nta bantu banri nri nkihura nabo cyane ahubwo imbwa . ||| i immediately stood up and started walking around in the sorghum plantation . that time i was not meeting people anymore instead i would meet dogs .
babona amasaka anyeganyeze bakavuga bati @: "@ hariya harimo umuntu . @" imbwa zikahita ziza ... zikamanuka . zaza nkahita ... nkikubita hasi kubera ubwoba , ||| whenever they would see plants shaking they would send dogs .
basi nkisinzirair . nkazicura nk' ejobundi mu gitondo . ||| so i would faint and wake up the following day in the morning .
ntazi aho nvuye , nkabona ndi ahantu ... ntinzi uko bigenze ... ubwo niko iminsi yagenda yicuma ... yicuma ... yicuma ... ariko iyo hataza kuba hari amasaka simbizi . ||| and , i would neither tell where i was nor what had happened . that is how days would go by but if there were no sorghum plants , i wonder what would have happened .
nta n' umwe ahari uba urarokotse . niko njyewe ... niko nbibona . ||| i guess none would have survived .
birarangira hagati aho ngaho urebye imbwa nizo zakomezaaga kuza . ||| from then , people stopped coming instead they would send dogs .
noneho nza kaumva nshonje , numva ntinzi ukuntu nbigenza ... amasaka , ||| then i got so hungry but i did n't know what to do .
nta kinri kintu kirimo ni amasaka ... ukareba kuba urya ibyatsi ukasanga nabyo n' ibintu bitashoboka , ||| there were no other crops rather than sorghum . therefore , you would imagine eating grass , which was impossible .
usibye ko ari nk' akantu kazaaga gato wenda uruhutse utakomeje kutekereza naho ubundi nta nzara nta ki ... nta kuyumva wapi . ibyo ntabwo bibaga birimo . ||| after all , thoughts about food would come to your mind only when you were resting , which was for a small time . most of the time one would n't feel hunger or ... we could n't drink , that was out .
nraongera nrazamuka nravuga nti @: "@ ariko uwasubira kwa wa musaza , wenda nkagenda ... kuko ibyo aribyo byose ... nta bitero nkibona bikigenda cyane , ibyo ari byo byose bishobora kuba birahagaze . @" ||| then i left and said to myself , "@ what if i go back to the other old man 's home ... maybe they stopped because i no longer see attackers moving . @"
ntaterera nrazamuka , nsubira mu rugo . ||| therefore , i went there .
ubwo hari hashize igihe ari nko mu kwa gatandatu , biri bimaze kuba mu kwa gatandatu mu matariki ya mbere . noneho ubwo hari hasigaye inka ebyiri . ||| but days had passed ; it was around early june and they had remained with two cows .
noneho nraicara muri urwo rugo , maze kuicara burira buracya , noneho bigeze mu gitondo ... mu gitondo cya kare rwose nko ma saa kumi n' imwe n' igice , hamaze kucya buke ariko bigaragara ko hakaijimye , ||| i stayed in that home after two days and nights , in a certain morning ... very early around 6:30 a.m. it was slightly dark though there was some kind of light .
nibwo ngiye kaumva numva igitero baraje barakomanga . barakomanga bati @: ||| then i had a group of attackers knocking on the door .
"@ munyugishari wowe , ahangaha hari abana ba kahaizi . none kuba bahari nta kintu na kimwe kigomba kukorwa batari bava mu nzira . bati @: ||| "@ munyagishari , in your house there are gahizi 's children . and since they are here , we can not do anything before we wipe them away .

noneho ubwo baganiraaga nawe bari ku muryango bari inyuma noneho ahita ansohora anjyana mu kikari . ||| they told that man ; munyagishali . they were talking while standing outside the door . so , he took me behind the house .
ansohoye anjyana mu kikari bakomeza kushakisha ahongaho ndi mu nzu yo mu kikari barangije baraigendera . ||| they started checking in the main house yet i was in the small house behind the big one .
bati @: ||| later they left .
"@ turi buze kugaruka hamaze kucya , nihamara kucya ibyo ari byo byose ntacyo uri butubeshye . ||| "@ we shall come back in dawn while we can see clearly . you will n't lay to us anything .

nazo zigomba kugenda . @" ||| they will also be taken . @" they said .
nuko ... ngiye kubona nbona aramanutse inyuma hari igitero cy' abantu nka mirongo itanu [ 50 ] . ||| therefore , i saw him coming and behind him there were about fifty people .
eh ! nravuga nti se pasiteri ... ntahaguruka nragenda nramusuhuza . ||| then i wondered , "@ pastor ! @"
nragenda nramusuhuza , eh .. ! nkabona aranreba nabi . ||| i went and greeted him though , he was looking at me so badly .
ubwo uko agenda afite agasakoshi k' iwe karimo amabible ; ||| as he was walking , he was carrying his small bag of bibles .
ibintu byose ... isakoshi yarayigendanaaga . ||| he used to walk with that bag so , i saw him .
mpita mubona ‘ ... se pasiteri n' iki gitero kimuri inyuma gutya ... umh ? ||| "@ what is between pastor and this whole group of attackers behind him ? @"

ngiye kaumva , numva barakomanze . ||| suddenly i heard people knocking .
pasiteri ... pasiteri igitero bose baje bamwirukanka inyuma bafite ubuhairi , ||| the whole group of attackers came running behind the pastor .
bafite ibisongo ... nravuga nti @: "@ noneho abantu mirongo itanu bagiye kunyica njyenyine , ||| they had clubs , sharp sticks ... then i asked myself , "@ fifty people have come to kill only me .
baranyica batae ? @" ||| how will they kill me ? @"
nkaumva simbyumva . kubera ukuntu nri nbonye bariho bica abantu , ||| i could not understand it because i had seen how they killed several people in several ways depending on ‘ who was who .
biteye n' umuntu babonye uwo ariwe ... akaba yakata intoki undi akakata ikirenge ... nravuga nti @: ||| ’ ... some would be cut fingers , other would be cut feet .
"@ noneho abantu bangana gutya ... @" nbonaaga ari nk' isoko ryose . ||| then i would wonder , "@ all these people ... ! @" they seemed like a whole market .
ngo @: "@ kwa kahaizi hasigaye umwana ... kwa kahaizi hasigaye umuntu , ngo ari hariya inberae . @" bari kuza bivuga . ||| they were saying , "@ some kid from gahizi survived and she is just in front there . @"
nravuga nti @: "@ aah ... nibyo ? @" ||| "@ is that true ? @"
nbitekerezaho nkaumva simbikurura ngo nbiumvae . ||| i would ask myself but i would never understand it .
"@ aba bantu bose ? njyewe ! @" nkaongera nkasubiza amaso inyuma nkireba "@ ... njyewe uyu nguyu ? ||| "@ all these people for me as i am ... @" i would look at myself and could n't believe it .
abantu bangana gutya ... pasiteri abari inberae ? @" umh , ||| "@ all these people with pastor leading them ! @"
nkaumva biranyoboye . ||| i would not believe it .
nravuga nti @: "@ ntininjira muri iyi inzu rwose muzae ... ntugirae ikibazo ngo ... ntibari bukusenyair kubera njyewe . ||| but i refused to enter in the house .

birangirae binibagirane rwose pe ! nawe uzaryamae usinzirae . @" ||| "@ they should come and finish me , maybe you would get a chance to sleep . @" i told the girl .
nraicara ngiye kaumva numva barakomanze . baraza baramubwira ... ... pasiteri uwonguwo . uwo pasiteri kanani na ntuza na ... afite agasakoshi k' iwe , ||| as i was sitting there , pastor kanani came ; he was holding his bag .
ngo @: "@ rero muzehe ngo hano ngo tuumvise ko hari abana ba kahaizi basigaye , ngo bakaba bari ahangaha . ngo none ngo aba bantu bamereye nabi ngo bagomba kubica , ||| then he told the old man , "@ we heard that in your home , there are gahizi 's children who survived , now these people are on my case .

umusaza arababwira ati @: "@ nbabwiye ko hano nta mwana uhari nimuzae murebae . @" ||| the old man said , "@ i told you that there is no child here . come in and see . @"
umusaza we yararebye aravuga ati @: ntinshaka ko bansenyair , ||| but he imagined and said , "@ i do n't want them to demolish my house .
kandi na none nibamara no kunsenyair n' umwana baramwica . ||| because , they will still kill the child after demolishing my house .
nk' uko n' ubundi bihereye kera . inka zose bamaze kuzimaraho kubera umwana , ||| after all , this has lasted for so long ; they took all the cows just because of the same kid .
none baracyamushakisha . ||| and , now they are still looking for her .
nimubima bari bunsenyaire . kandi nibansenyera n' umwana nawe azapfa . ||| in case i do n't give them the kid , they will demolish my house and if they demolish the house , even the kid will die . @"
umwana nimuzae mumusake nimumubona mumutwarae . ||| therefore , he told them that , "@ come into the house if you get her , then you will take her . @"
barainjira barasaka abantu mirongo itanu mu nzu umwe . ||| they all entered in the house . fifty people in one house .
abandi burira hejuru , abandi impande zose mu masaka barataka , mu makawa impande zose , bati @: ||| some climbed on top of the house others looked around in the sorghum and coffee plantations , they checked everywhere and said , "@ we must know the kid , who is here .
"@ tugomba kumenya neza umwana arahari , arahari turabizi neza . @" ||| we know there is one . @"
kumbi ba bana turi kumwe , bagiye inyuma bagenda bavuga ngo @: "@ umwana umwe yarapfuye ngo hasigaye undi , ngo wa wunri muremure unanutse , ||| they were informed by the kids we were together ... those kids went saying that , "@ one kid died , the one who is tall and slim and resembled her mother , is the remaining one .

noneho mu mutaima wanjye nkaumva akantu k' ubwoba , ariko ku rundi nuhande nkaumva "@ ... yee ... nibyo birangirae ... birangirae . ||| i would be a bit afraid but on the other hand i would say , "@ yes let it be over maybe all the worries will be gone .

nuko bose baragenda baicara ahantu bategereje ko ngiye kusohoka hari akantu k' umukingo , kuko umuhanda uramanukaaga ukainjira mu rugo , ||| therefore , they all went out and sat at the slop waiting for me to get out ; the road was on slopping up to our home .
noneho hari umukingo muremure bose baicaraho nyine ... ‘ biri bimeze nk' uko yesu yagiye inberae kwa pilato . ||| therefore , there was a steep slop so , they all went and sat there . ‘ it was similar to how jesus went before pilato .

abantu nka mirongo itanu barazamu ... baicaye ahantu hejuru nnjyae ndi inberae yabo . ||| about fifty people sitting and me standing in front of them .
noneho ka kantu ngiraaga ko kuishima ko kupfa noneho numva binbereye ikibazo . ||| the other feeling of joy for death , turned into a problem .
nravuga @: "@ umh ! njyewe njyenyine ? @" ||| i said to myself , "@ i alone ? @"
nkaumva simbyumva . ||| i would n't believe it .
ubwoba buranyica nravuga @: "@ nti ntahava se aha hantu ? @" ||| i was so afraid and said , "@ will i survive this point of time ? @"

nraza nbahagarara inberae , ndagadwa ariko nta ntegae nfite ... kubera ubwoba . ||| i stood in front of them , trembling and feeling weak due to fear .
nreba ukuntu ngiye kupfa ... kuicwa n' abantu magana angahe bose . ||| i would imagine how i was going to die ... killed by hundreds of people .
nrirebaaga nreba ukuntu ngana , nreba n' abantu b' abagabo n' intwaro bafite , nkavuga nti @: ||| i would look at myself and see how small i was and compare it with all those men carrying several weapons , then i would wonder , "@ how will i die ... ?

nraicara kuhagarara birananira kubera ubwoba , nrinrimo ntitira cyane nikubita hasi . ||| i sat down because i had failed to stand due to fear ; i was shaking so hard and i would fall down .

nuko babwira uwo mugabo bati @: "@ ariko munyagishari wowe uhereye kera utubwira ngo nta bana ba kahaizi bari hano . uyu mwana tubwirae amavu n' amavuko ye utubwirae ibye , ||| then they said to the old man , "@ mr. munyagishari , you have been telling us that there is no gahizi 's child here . so , tell us the background of this kid .

nibwo bagenda bakasohora indi nka , ||| therefore , they went and took out another cow .
kwa kunri na none . ||| and kill it in the same way .
urebye muri make , mbese icyabo ntikiri ukuica , ||| critically , their major concern was n't killing ; they were more interested in eating .
ahubwo kuri ukushaka kwirair . basohora inka bakiyigeza hanze kuyica ni kwa kunri ni ukugenda bayitema , batema amahembe ; bakatema amatwi ; ||| so they took out the cow and killed it like they killed other cows ; cutting off horns , ears , until when it falls off .
bakatema iki ... ? nyuma ikaza kuikubita hasi . umwe icyo aciye ajyana , n' undi icyo akase ajyana ... n' uruhu byose . ||| and then everyone would take what he managed to cut . they would cut they would piece with the skin on .

akibinbwira ubwo ngumbwo nyine nhise nsohoka , nragenda nkomeza kuibera mu masaka , ||| after he told me that , immediately i left and stayed in the sorghum plants in a trench .
mu muferege , imvura ikagwa , nkigira mu muferege , haba ari ku zuba nkibera mu masaka gutyo nicaye . ||| it would rain but i would enter in the trench and whenever it would shine i would sit in the sorghum plantation .
imbwa zo zirazaaga , zaza ... ni nko kugwa muri koma kubera ubwoba ni iki ... nkazicura zagiye , ||| dogs would come and i would faint because of fear and i would come back to my senses when they had left .

uwo mugorae w' uwo mugabo . araza kunreba aza kushakisha ahantu hose mu masaka yabo ... kuko ntabwo njyaaga kure . ||| [ the wife to munyagishari ] she was looking everywhere in there sorghum plantation because , i never used to go very far .
kuko iyo hariya nza kukomeza kure biri kuba ngombaw ko nambuka imihanda kandi iyo nza kuambuka imihanda nibwo nri kuhura n' abanzi noneho bakananyica na nabi . ||| because if i walked very far , it would mean crossing roads . and if i crossed roads , i would have met people who knew me who would kill me so painfully .
noneho ubwo nramanuka , ntakomeza nragenda , eh ... ngiye kubona nbona mpingukiye kuri cya cyobo . ||| i continued walking and reached the other pit hole .
numva abantu barimo bavugamo hasi . ||| i heard people talking from inside the pit .
nravuga nti @: "@ eh , njyaemo ? @" ||| i asked myself , "@ should i get in ? @"
ntekereza ... ntinigeze nrungurukamo , kuko kurungurukamo kuri ukuambuka umuhanda , kiri kiri ku muhanda gutya . ||| i never peeped inside because it was across the road but on the roadside .
nravuga nti @: "@ nrebyemo nhita njyamo , kandi nkapfa nabi numva kandi aribyo nanze . @" ||| i imagined that in case i peeped in it , i would also go inside it and i would die with suffer yet that is what i was avoiding .
ntakomeza nraigendera mu masaka nraicara , ||| i went and sat in the sorghum plantation .

ngiye kaumva numva umuntu ari kuza buhoro buhoro yivugaish , ariko yari umu mama , ngiye kubona nbona ni wa mukecuru ungezeho . ||| i heard someone who was walking slowly and talking to herself .
ati @: "@ rero reka nkubwirae , rwose bamaze kwiyemeza y' uko bazaza bakakuica , bamara kukuica ntawe bakatusenyair bakagenda . ||| it was the other woman , she bumped into me and said to me , "@ listen , they have planned to come and kill you and demolish our house .

ubwo tufata urugendo muri iryo joro nko mu ma saa moya gutyo . ntabwo habonaaga . ||| therefore , we started our journey in that night at around 7:00 p.m. it was dark .
turagenda turaambuka tujya ahongaho muri gitesi . ||| we crossed and went to gitesi .
turagenda anjyanye ku mukobwa we mukuru , uri utuye yo . tugezeyo , nyina arara , ||| she was taking me to her eldest daughter who lived there .

ati : "@ uzajya uvoma amajerikani atatu . @" ||| then she said that , "@ you will be fetching three jeri cans of water . @"
nramubwira nti @: "@ ibyo ntabwo bishoboka . @" ||| i told her that , "@ that is impossible . @"
ntekereza na kabido nta nubwo nri nzi kukatwara . nkaumva urwo n' urupfu ahubwo rwa rundi rurenze . ||| i would imagine how i never knew how to carry even a small jeri can , and just conclude that it was the worst death i would ever experience .

ntekereza ko no murugo iwacu ibyo bintu ntigeze nbikora , ||| i would remember that even at home i never did such work .
nramubwira nti @: "@ ibyo ntabyo nzakora . @" aranbwira ati @: ||| so i told her that , "@ i will never do that work . @"
"@ uzabikora . @" ||| then she bet , "@ you will do it . @"
kikora mu minsi ya mbere bwo nrabikoze . akanzindura mu gitondo cya kare njyewe njyenyine , abana basigaye baryamye , akanjyana aka nyereka umugezi . ||| however the first days i did it ; she would wake me up in the morning while others were sleeping and take me to the stream to fetch water with a big jeri can .
nvomae nvomaishe ijerikani nini . nramubwira nti @: ||| i told her that i could n't manage the big jeri can .
" iyi jerikani ntabwo nyishobora . @" ||| so , she gave me a smaller one .
akampa akabido nkavoma , nkaza nsuka ... nkaza nsuka nkauzuza amajerikani atatu . ||| i would keep fetching until when i fill three jeri cans .
turangiza tukajyana mu muraima ngo tujyane tuhingae . eh ... ! ||| and then after , we would go together in the garden to dig .
nkagenda akahinga nkaicara ahongaho . ati @: "@ noneho biranrambaiye . ||| she would dig as i am sitting , and later she would say , "@ i am fed up .

n' ubwo ngubwo ntiyangaburiraaga . ||| those days she would n't give me food .
yangaburiraaga ari uko nvomye nkaza nkamwemerera tukajyana kuhinga , nkaza nkamurerair umwana , ||| she would let me eat only if i fetched water , allowed to go digging and look after .
bigeze aho ndamwerurira ... eh ... noneho ubwo yanyohereje kujya kuvoma , ||| but it reached a point and i told her my mind . that time she had sent me at the stream and it had rained .
njyezeyo imvura yari yaguye nranyerair nikubita ahantu mu muferege w' amazi . ||| therefore i slipped and fell in a water channel .
eh ... nibwo nhitaaga ntekereza nravuga nti @: "@ ubu buzima nibwo bwa mbere bubi bubaho . ||| that is when i said , "@ this is the worst life ever .

"@ ... ariko harya umuntu yakuiica kutae ? @" nkahita ntekereza uko njyaaga nbona mu mafilime , ukuntu umuntu ashobora kuitera icyuma , ukuntu umuntu ashobora kuiahura akimanika . ||| then i would remember what i used to watch in movies , how one can use a knife to commit suicide or hung himself or herself to death .

nta kibazo numva nta kintu kaerekeraanye n' intambara bavuga . ||| they would not talk about anything like war stories .
ntangira kaumva nyine ko noneho intambara ishobora kuba yararangiye . ||| therefore , i started getting a feeling that the war stopped .

kuko ni umuhanda noneho ndi kugendamo , kandi mbere niwo ngendaagamo nikinga . ||| because i was supposed to go through the other road where i used to pass hiding .
nfata inzira nragenda ... ubwo yari antumye ... yari anbwiye ngo ninjye kuhinga , ||| so i started my journey . she had sent me to go digging .
tumanukaan n' abandi bana tugeze hepfo arabahamagara ngo nibaze ngo ngomba kuhasigara njyewe . ||| therefore , i went with children and when we had reached some where , she called them saying that , i must stay there alone .
‘ eh ! ||| "@ really !
kweri ? njyewe nsigarae muri uriya muraima jyenyine ? ||| i stay in the other garden alone ?
kubera iki iyo umugabo we ahari atabikora ? ||| why does n't she do the same things when her husband is around ?
’ mpita nzamura isuka nyihereza abana , nti @: ||| " i wondered . immediately i took back the hoe and gave it to the kids and i told them that i have left .
"@ njyewe nragiye . @" "@ ... none se ugiye hehe mahoro ... [ bajyaaga banyita mahoro ] ... garuka , ||| "@ where are you going mahoro ?
garuka tukuerekae . @" ||| came back we show you . @"
nti @: ||| they said to me .
"@ oya ntacyo munyereka nragiye nibanyica bazanyicae . ||| [ they used to call me mahoro ] i told them that , "@ no , there is nothing to show me , i have gone and if they kill me , that will be it .
nibatanyica ubwo tuzasubira ikindi kihae . @" ||| and if they do n't kill me , we shall meet some other time . @"
aranbwira ati @: "@ nyamara hari umuntu unbwiye ko ariho . @" noneho binbera ikibazo . nravuga nti @: ||| then he told me that there somebody who told him that she is alive .
"@ uyu muntu ibyo aribyo byose n' umwicanyi wanjye . uyunguyu niwe nzagwaho . umuntu uza kunshinyagurair anbwira ibingibi . ||| so it became another problem and i said , "@ think person is a killer , he is the one who will kill he ; he who is mocking me saying such things .
kandi abandi bose babaga banbwira ukuntu abantu barapfuye ‘ ... birarangiye , nta muntu n' umwe usigaye , wihangane kuba usigaye wenyine . ||| other people would tell how people died , "@ it is over all people died , you have to be strong though you survived alone . @"
’ ariko we araza akanbwira ngo @: kanaka ariho , kandi nzi neza ko yapfuye ? ||| but how could he come saying that so and so is still alive yet i was very sure they died ?
nramubwira nti @: "@ ntabyo nshaka ko uzaongera kunbwira . @" ||| then i told him that , "@ never tell me that anymore . @"
aragenda yari umuturanyi w' aho ngaho . ibyo biratinda biribagiraan , hashize nk' iminsi atongera kugaruka kubinbwira . ||| then he left , he was a neighbor to that family . time passed before he came back to tell me about it .
mu kwa karindwi ... nrabiibuka hari mu mpera z' ukwa karindwi icyo kihae . nri ntaramenya ko murumuna wanjye ariho , ||| in july ... i remember it was in the late july , i had n't known that my sister was alive .
turi turatandukanye nyine ku itariki icumi z' ukwezi kwa kane [ 10 /04 /1994 ] . ||| we had separated in the 10th of april 1994 , that time we saw a group of attackers .
ubwo nyine icyo kihae tubonaaga igitero we akaemera kukihuramo wenda bamwice agenda , ariko ntapfaire ahongaho . ||| the time she decided to go to them so that they should kill her moving rather than dying sat .
ntahaba ahongaho muri urwo rugo , nta kibazo noneho nsohoka , ||| i stayed there in that family and there was no problem i would get out by then .
ngenda ku muhanda , nta kibazo nkagaruka . ||| i would go at the road and come back safe .
nkabona abana b' ahongaho , ariko nkabona abantu bose nri nzi nta muntu n' umwe nbona . ||| i would see children from that family but i would n't see any of the people i used to know .
noneho nabyo binbera ikibazo . ||| so it became a problem to me .
nravuga nti ariko se ubu ... ubu buzima nkareba inberae hariya nkabona biranrenze n' ibintu binri kure . nkavuga nti @: ||| so i asked myself , what is all about such life ? i would try to see the future but i would just go beyond my understanding .
"@ sawa noneho ubungubu reka nicarae ahangaha ... umukecuru aranbwira ati @: "@ wowe ejo bunri mu kwa cyenda uzajya kuiga . @" ||| therefore i decide to stay there . the old lady told me that i wait in september i would go to school .
"@ ... nzajya kuiga ? @" ||| but i would not believe it ; "@ i will go to school ? @"
ariko nkaumva na none ... kubera ko iwacu papa yakundaaga abana baiga cyane , ||| but still i would remember that at home , my father used to like children who liked studying .
kandi ntawe turabikundaaga kuiga . ||| and indeed we liked studying .
yari umwarimu na mama yari umwarimu . ||| both my father and mother were teachers .
noneho bakajya bavuga bati @: ‘ mugomba kuiga ... mugomba kuiga mpaka ... @" noneho , turi n' abana benshi gutyo , ||| therefore they would say that , "@ you must study ... you shall study till when ... @" and we were many kids at home .
mama we akajya atubwira ati @: "@ mugo ... muesae muzaiga , muigae secondaire , muigae universite murangizae , ||| mum would tell us that , "@ all of you must study ; you will go secondary schools and complete university .
wenda mu rugo ... eh , n' umunyu uzaburae . ariko mugomba kuiga . @" ||| even though we miss salt at home , you will go school . @"
ariko nnjyae nkaumva ntashaka kuiga nkagera muri secondaire ... nkagera muri universite . ||| and surely i wanted to study and go secondary schools ... and reach university .
nkatekereza "@ ... ariko se ibi byose nzaiga ndi he ? ||| therefore , i would think , "@ where will be living while i am studying ?
ndi nande ? @" ||| whom will i be with ? @"
noneho nkaumva simbyumva , ||| so i would not understand it .
nkaumva ni ibintu binrenze nkabiikuramo . ||| i would go through all those things .
noneho nramubwira nti @: "@ ntacyo nzagenda njyae kuiga . @" ||| then i told her , "@ it is okay i will go to school . @"
ariko nkaumva ko nzagenda nkaiga nrangiza kuiga , ibya aribyo byose ntinzabura abandi bantu tuzagenda tumenyaan . ||| i knew that i would go to school and maybe meet other people and get to know each other .
yenda niba nrarokotse hano muri rubaengair ndi jyenyine , ntihazabura undi warokokeye i mushubati , ||| i would say that , if i am the only one who survived in rubengera there must be another one who survived from mushubati .
ntihazabura undi warokokeye iyo za kibirizi , ||| "@ there can not miss someone who survived in other areas like kibirizi or somewhere else . @" i would say .
ntihazabura undi warokokeye ahandi hantu . wenda tuzabonaane n' aho yaba ari umwe umwe ariko nta mpamvu yo kuicara mu rugo gutya kusa . "@ ngomba kuiga ... nibyo . @" ||| "@ even though it would be one person but there is no logic in remaining sat at home . i must study , it is a brilliant idea . @"
ariko nkahita ntekereza na none ningera mu ishuri , ko tujyaaga tuinjira mu ishuri ... [ biza kunbera ikibazo ] ... ko tujyaaga tuinjira mu ishuri , bakajya batuhamagara turi abatutsi tukaza turi batanu , ||| and i would immediately think , if i reach in school ... before we used to reach school and as we would be entering [ it bothered me too ] we used to enter in school and they would call upon the tutsi , we would stand up when we are about three .
nkuimuka tukasanga turi icumi . noneho bazajya bahamagara basangae ndi jyenyine , ||| in the following class we would be ten but now they will call and it will be only me .
noneho basubirae n' inyuma bavugae bati @: "@ burya tusigaye tuigana n' umututsi umwe . @" ||| and so they will start saying that , "@ we study with only one tusti . @"
nnjyae bikanbera ikibazo . nbiikuramo ariko kuko numvaaga nta bunri buzima , ||| so it would bother me but i would try to avoid such thoughts because it was the only life i had to lead .
numvaaga ko ubuzima bwanjye ari ukuiga , ||| i knew my life was school life .
ngomba kuiga nkarangiza primaire , noneho ... kandi nkazayitsinda , noneho nkajya kuiga mu kigo nzabamo noneho . ||| i had to complete primary school and pass it well so that i would get a school where i would live always .
noneho ntari kuba mu ma famille [ imiryango ] aya yo hanze gutya . ||| and i would stop living in outside families .
nkazajya kuiga mu kigo nzabamo , ahantu nzaba , tuzaba tuhuraiye turi abantu benshi kandi tutaziraanye . ||| i would go to a school where i would stay and live with people i never knew .
nishyiramo iyo ntego numva ko ariyo ngiyo ari yo kweli . ||| i started aiming at that goal and i felt like it was the best one .
nragenda njya ku ishuri . ||| i went to school .
eh ! ||| eh !
bigera saa yine muri recreation [ umwanya wo kukina ] bakamvugiriza induru . ||| at break time they would make fun of me .
nabo tujyaaga tuganira ... bose , nkabona bose barimo baranyitaza ... barimo baranyikanga . ||| even those we used to talk together , they would avoid me ; they would behave to me as if i was a stranger .
ubwo ni mu kwa cyenda , jenoside yararangiye ? ||| was that in september when the genocide had stopped ?
jenoside yararangiye . ||| it was after the genocide .
ariko nabwo kugenda usibye kugenda ngiye ku ishuri , ndi kumwe n' abandi ... icyo abantu benshi bari bakihisha nta uri ukipfa kusohoka ngo ugendae , mu kihae ino ahangaha ho biri birarangiye nta kibazo . ||| but still moving ... unless i was going to school with other students ... that time people were still hiding ; no one would move out yet these ends things had settled without any problem .
twebwe uri ukihisha da . ||| us we were still hiding .
n' ubwo iyo ntabonaaga abantu tujyana ngo tubonae n' abo tutahana nshakaaga ukuntu ndi butahae ninjoro hatabona . ||| whenever i would not be able to get people to go with or come with , i would find a way of coming back in the dark at night .
ukiba muri iyo famille [ umuryango ] nyine ? ||| you were still living in that family ?
nta nubwo nzaumvaaga habae no kaumva ngo iki ... reka da . nta n' agatekerezo . ||| i had never had of them ; not a small thing ... never . not even a thought .
ibyo ari byo byose wenda bari baranahageze ariko yenda mu kituragae ntibahagerae bakaba bari nk' aho ngaho gutyo mu mugi ... nta n' agatekerezo kuko ntinumvaaga ... nta n' ubwo nzaumvaaga . ||| maybe they had reached but never came to the village . maybe they were all around in town . i never though or had about them .
n' abo tubanaaga ntinkubwira ngo @: nabo bari bazizi . ||| even those we lived together i can not say that they knew about them .
kuko ngo baumvaaga ngo ari abantu ... ngo ari ibikoko bifite amatwi , ||| because they used to here that inkotanyi were n't people , that they were animals , which had big ears with tails .
bifite imirizo ... ntabwo baumvaaga ko ari abantu . ||| they never knew they were people .
noneho ... ahubwo hari igihe zaigeze ... zimaze kugera ahongaho baita ku giti kinini , ni ahantu hari aga centre hariya i rubaengair hafi ya commune . ||| by the way , there is a time they ... when they reached at some place called ku giti kinini ; that is where there is a center in rubengera next to the commune .
bavugaaga ngo babonye ngo inkotanyi ... imodoka y' inkotanyi ngo ihise . ||| they used to say that they saw the inkotanyi ... that they saw an inkontanyi 's car passing .
bati @: "@ tuzibonye zifite amatwi zifite ... @" umh , mbega nkaumva ko ari ibikoko . ||| therefore , they would say that , "@ we saw them with big ears with ... @" umh , generally i would think they were animals .
njyewe nta na kimwe nri nzi . nuko nravuga nti @: "@ basi nti noneho ngiye kupfa noneho urumeze rutae ? @" ||| i did n't know anything but i would wonder the kind of death i was going to die and i would not understand it .
nkaumva zirwumva . kuko kaumva ko ari inkotanyi zizaza , zikaza zikatabara nk' abantu basigaye , ||| i never thought that the inkotanyi would come for the rescue of those who servived .
nta kintu na kimwe nbitekerezaagaho . ||| it never crossed my mind .
ubwo nnjyae ngiye ku ishuri ku munsi wa mbere , nkabona abana barimo baranyishisha , ||| on the first day i went to school but i would see fellow students avoiding me .
muri recreation [ igihe cyo kukina ] nkabona bamwe baranyura aha barimo baranvuga , ||| during break time , i would see some passing by me and talking about me .
ngira uwo nvugaish wapi . ||| i would try to talk to one but things would not work .
nkabona bose bafite ubwoba ntibashaka no kunvugaish . ||| they all looked afraid of talking to me .
noneho nkaicara njyenyine hariya . ||| so i would sit alone at aside .
umwarimu yaza akaambaza ati @: "@ mbese ko wicaye wenyine , ||| the teacher would ask me , "@ why are you sitting alone ?
uri mu biki ... uratekereza iki ? ||| what are you doing ... what are you thinking about ?
tuza , ngwino ukinae n' abandi bana . @" ||| come and play with other kids . @"
nti @: "@ oya ntabwo nbishaka . @" ||| and i would say , "@ no i do n't want . @"
nhitaaga ntaha ubundi saa yine . ||| sometimes i would go back home at around 10:00 .
ziragera nkabona abandi barimo baravugana utugroupe ... utu groupe [ udutsiko ] nkabona nsigaye njyenyine , nkaicara nk' iminota ingahe ubundi nkahita nfata inzira nkataha . ||| break time would reach and then other students would get into groups then i would remain alone . therefore , after a small time i would go home .
noneho muri icyo kihae haza kuza ... hari umugore turi tuturanye yacuruzaaga imyenda akaza kurangura ino aha ... nyabugogo akajya kuyicuruza ku kibuye . ||| then during that time there came ... there was a certain lady we were neighbors . she was selling clothes ; she would come these ends of nyabugogo to buy clothes on wholesale and sell them in kibuye .
noneho hari umutante [ masenge ] nawe yarazaaga ... we yabaga hano ku muhaima , bakaba bari baziraanye . ||| my aunt lived in muhima and sometimes she would come ... and they knew each other .
noneho baza kukubitanair nyabugogo . ||| so one time they met from nyabugogo .
noneho uwo mu mama uzaaga kurangura akaba yari aziko uwo murumuna wanjye ariho . ||| that lady who used to buy clothes from nyabugogo knew that my sister survived .
murumuna wanjye we ahantu yabaga ni ahantu yagiye ... yaragiye ahura n' abantu mu ntuze ... mu ... bari ku mugezi barimo bakura ibijumba , ||| my sister was living in some home where she had gone ... she met some people who were at the stream harvesting sweet potatoes .
uwo mugorae yari umututsi . aramutwara ... amutwara iwe amutekerereza ibye aramutwara , ||| that woman was a tutsi ... she took her home and my sister told her all about her .
aragenda amubika mu nzu . umugabo atabizi . ||| then that lady hid my sister in the house but her husband was not aware .
kurinda mu kwezi kwa cyenda kugera , ||| until september that is when we met .
nibwo tubonaanye . yasohotse tubonaan njyewe . ||| as she got out we immediately saw each other .
ariko umugabo atabizi . ||| but her husband never knew about it .
yari inzu nini aragenda amushyira ahantu , abwira abana bakuru ati @: "@ kiriya cyumba ntimuzigerae mukifungura . @" abari bakuru . ||| it was a very big house and therefore , she hid her somewhere in the house and warned her elder children that , "@ nobody should ever open this room . @"
n' umugabo we ntiyajyaaga ahagera yaragendaaga akiyizira ninjoro , akaza yiryamair . umwana akakarabairmo , ||| and even her husband would never come to the room ; he used to go and come back deep in the night .
bakamugaburiramo , noneho bigera nijoro akiryamair nk' uko n' abandi ... kuko umugabo yabaga atahari . ||| he would come going to bed directly .
yakenera kusohoka agiye hanze nko kuri toilette [ ku musaraane ] abana batoya nyina akabaohereza ahantu ... akabatuma . ||| whenever she would want to go to the toilets , that woman would send the kids somewhere and obviously the man would n't be around . therefore , she would go to the toilets and then come in quickly .
akasohoka akagaruka akiberamo . ||| she stayed in the house all the time .
nta wunri muntu usibye we , n' umuhungu we , n' umukobwa we mukuru kusa , ||| no other person knew that my sister was in their house except her elder son and daughter plus her .
bari bakuru . ||| only the elder children .
nibo bonyine bari bazi ko uwo muntu arimo . ||| they were the only ones who knew that there was some one in their house .
n' umugabo ntabyo azi . ||| even the husband did n't know .
ariko uwo mukecuru ... uwo mugorae uzaaga kurangura imyenda we akaba yari abizi . kuko ariwe umurangiye aramubwira ngo @: "@ ngendae arebae umugore wa katabazi hari ahantu ari hariya , kandi nawe ni umututsi agendae amubwirae ikibazo cye , ||| but the other woman , who used to purchase clothes for sale , knew about it because she was the one who referred my sister to go and look for gatabazi 's wife wherever she was and she was also a tutsi .
wenda aramujyana bamucumbikirae . ||| "@ go and tell her your problems maybe she may give you shelter . @" she recommended my sister .
abimenya gutyo . ||| therefore , that is how she came to know about it .
noneho aza kutuma ahongaho kwa munyagishari aho nri ndi . ati @: "@ nyamara ati @: hari umwana wo kwa kahaizi uba kwa katabazi hariya i kihara . ||| she was the one who sent a message at munyagishari 's where i was living saying that , "@ there is a gahizi 's child in gatabazi 's home in gihari .

noneho bikubitaan n' uko nnjyae nri mpari . ||| and , by coincidence i was alive .
nrababwira nti @: "@ sara rwose arabeshya ... arabeshya ... arabeshya . @" nuko arabibabwira aravuga ati @: "@ kandi nrabizi neza ko ahari . ||| then i told them that "@ sara is telling lies ... she is lying ... she is lying . @"
ati @: ejo nzajya kumusura , ati @: ||| but she said , "@ i am very sure she is alive and in fact i will go to visit her tomorrow .
nindamuka mubonye ... tubonaanye nkamenye neza ko ahari , nyaza kubikubwira . @" ||| and if i see her i will come to confirm to you . @"
aragenda bukeye agaruka kubinbwira , ||| she left and the following morning she came to tell me .
aranbwira ati @: "@ rwose arahari ntugirae ikibazo . @" ||| "@ do n't worry , she is alive . @" she said to me .
umh , ibyo se bibaho ? ||| umh , "@ is that possimble ?

bukeye aragaruka , araza arantwara , ||| the following day she came back and took me .
turaambuka hari umugezi tuambukaaga baita ntaruko ukaambuka ujya hakurya mu yinri secteur ya kihara . turagenda tugezeyo nbona nramubonye . ||| we crossed some river called ntaruko . the other side of the river was gihara sector and when we reached there , i saw her .
bibaye ... ni nk' inzozi . ntinkubwira ngo twarasuhuzanyije , nta n' igihe cyo kubazanya amakuru , ||| it was like a dream ; i can n't say that we greated each others , neither did we ask each others about what we went through .
umwe wese yarebaaga undi akarira , undi yareba undi akarira . ||| we were simply crying by looking at each others .
nmukubita amaso ... umh ... , ubundi nkahita ntekereza ‘ ubu se niwe ? cyangwa n' umuzimu we ? ||| i would look at her and ask myself , "@ is she the one or it is her ghost ?
umuntu imbwa zariye , ||| someone who was bitten by dogs ?

nyuma y' aho nkakomeza kaumva amajwi y' ukuntu yapfuye , ubu se yaba ariho mu buhae buryo ? @" ||| someone i heard stories of her death , how can she be alive ? @"
numva nabyo simbyumva , kandi turimo turebaan gutya . bibaye nka filime yamaze umwanya ariko ... nta muntu n' umwe uvuga ... mu bitekerezo kusa . ||| it was unbelievable though we were face to face . it was like a movie that lasts too long ... yet nobody was talking ... we were talking within our thoughts .
nuko numva biranrenze , numva biranyobeye . ||| it was beyond my imagination and so i got confused .
noneho kuko atashakaaga ko umugabo ahita abimenya , kandi uwo mugorae uzaaga kurangura imyenda we yari yaramaze kumenya neza yuko aba bata ... abatante bariho . ||| but because she did n't want the head of the family to know about it ( the husband of the lady who saved her ) and the same lady who used to purchase clothes for sale , had already known that our aunties were alive .
abatante babiri babaga ino ahangaha . ||| they were two aunts and they were living these ends .
arababwira ati @: "@ noneho mukomezae mumuhishe abatante be nitumara kubonaan nkababwira ko bariho , bazaza babatwarae . ||| therefore , she told them that , "@ keep hiding her , if i get their aunties i will tell them and they will come for them .
ariko umugabo atazi ko umwana arimo , ||| but continue hiding it from your husband so that you do n't get conflicts together at the last moment .

ubwo umugore nawe aragenda . ||| and , that woman too left .
noneho aje kurangura baza kukubitaan . baje kukubitaan n' abo batantae arababwira ati @: "@ muzi ko hari abana banyu , ||| and when she came to purchase clothes , she met our aunties and then she told them ; "@ do you know that your two kids survived ... ? @"

bakaumva ko ari ibintu bitasanzwe . ||| to them it sounded unusual .
aravuga ati @: "@ ku kibuye nyamara barasigaye . ||| but she convinced them , "@ it is true at kibuye some people survived .

baanga kubiemera bo . ||| but they never agreed with her .
arababwira ati @: "@ noneho muzazae njyewe njyae kubaereka ahantu bari . arababwira ati @: ||| therefore , she told them that they should sometime come with her and see where we lived .

ubwo bukeye nmaze kuva kumureba nragaruka mpita nsubira ku ishuri . ||| after visiting my sister i returned home and went to school .
hashize nk' iminsi ibiri , nsubiye ku ishuri , na none nongera kuitahair saa yine nka kwa kunri bisanzwe . ||| after two days i went to school but i would come home at 10:00 a.m. as usual .
ariko kumbi ubwo yaraje arabibabwira , nabo bahita batega baraza . ||| however when she told our aunties about it , they immediately boarded and came over .
baraza uwo mu tantae n' undi mugabo wa tantae nyine umwe baraza , ||| they came ; it was my aunt and the husband to my other aunt .
baza aho mu gacaca bari bahazi . ||| they came to gacaca they knew the place .
bahageze bati @: "@ umwana yagiye kuiga . @" ||| when they reached at home they told them that i had gone to school .
noneho baza baje kunreba ku ishuri . nnjyae kwa kunri kuitahair muri recreation , ||| therefore , they decided to come to school yet i was on my way coming back home , because i was used to going home at break time .
usibye ... hari ukuntu ubona ikintu ukabona ubaye nk' igiti ... ubwo ntaha nigendera mu muhanda ... nbaga nibereye hanze n' ubwo ngendaaga ariko ntinbaga ntekereza ibiri aho . ||| there is a way you see something and become stiff ; i was walking home but even though i was walking , i was careless of what was around me .
nitekererezaaga iby' ubuzima bwanjye bushize n' iby' ubuzima ngiyemo , ||| i would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how i was going to lead it .
nkaumva n' ibintu bimeze gutya ... bitateze kuzahura . ||| it seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part .
kimwe kijya hariya , ikindi kijya hariya . nuko ngiye kubona nbona turakubitanye . nvuye ku ishuri saa yine , ||| therefore , we met as i was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) .
ntahaaga saa yine igihe cyose kuko isaha zirageraaga nbona buri umwe wese yibereye mu bye , n' undi yibereye mu bye , ||| i used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . because i would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me .
nta muntu n' umwe unyitayeho ... nta n' umwe tuvugana . basi . ||| i would talk to no body .
nkahita numva ko ubuzima bwanjye buhagaze ... ari uko .. ||| so i would feel like life has stopped ... so i would finally go home .
ntashye nibwo tukubitaaniye neza mu nsi ya commune . ||| as i was going home , we met next to the commune .
baje kunreba ku ishuri . ||| they were coming to see me at school .
urabiumva bibaye nk' ibindi bintu bitasanzwe . bibaye nk' uko nbonaanye na murumuna wanjye hari hashize amezi atanu tutabonaan , ||| it was an extraordinary experience ; it was like similar to the time i saw my little sister after five months of not seeing each other .
umwe wese azi ko undi yapfuye . ||| each one thought that the other one died .
mera nk' igiti nravuga @: ||| therefore , i was shocked and stood like a tree .
"@ ese tantae ni wowe .... ni wowe nbona cyangwa ntabwo ari wowe ? @" ati @: "@ ni jyewe . @" ... none se uziko doudou ariho ? ||| so i ask , "@ aunt , is it you ? are you the one i am seeing or it is somebody else ? @" she replied that was the one . "@ are you aware that doudou is alive ? @"
ati @: ||| i asked her once again .
"@ doudou ariho , n' aho aba ntahazi . @" ||| she replied me that "@ doudou is alive and i know where she lives . @"
ubwo ntabwo nhise ... ntabwo nigeze nkomeza ngo tugerae n' aho nri ndi , tuhise tutambikaan , mujyana aho hakurya i kihara aho doudou ari [ murumuna wanjye ] . ||| therefore , we never reached at home where i lived , immediately i took her to gihara where doudou ( my sister ) was living .
ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwa cumi , icyenda na kane [ 1 /10 /1994 ] . ||| it was on the 1st of october in 1994 .
mbese kuva mu kwa kane ubuzima busaga n' aho buhagaze . ||| generally , right from april life seemed to be a terrible struggle ?
kuva mu kwa kane kugera mu kwa cyenda , ubuzima buri burahagaze . ||| from april to september life was a terrible struggle .
tuvugae se nko kuva igihe mwabereye kwa munyagishali , intambara isa n' aho itaururutse bwo mwabanye ubuzima nibura bubaye bwiza ? ||| well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ?
uraumva intambara isa n' aho igabanutse , usibye ko ... ubundi yenda nvuga ko mu kwa karindwi ... ukwa munani intambara yari itangiye kaoroha , mu kwa karindwi kunza yari itangiye kaoroha . ||| when the war siezed ... in july , august the war was siezing ... in fact , in july the war was beginning to sieze .
ariko nbaga aho hantu mpaba na none nk' umuntu wihishe [ aho ngaho nbaga i gitesi ku mukobwa we ] . ||| i was living with that family as somebody who was hiding . i was living in gitesi at her daughter 's home .
noneho nkahaba ... kubera ukuntu banfataaga , banfata kubera ko bampishe nkaumva ko nyine ari kwa kunri ko bakimpishe . ||| and due to the way they would treat me , i mean because they hid me i continued believing that they were still hiding me .
simenye yuko hanze hameze neza . ||| i never knew that outside the situation improved .
noneho n' aho mpaviriye ngiye kwa munyagishari nabwo nkaumva ko ari kwa kunri . kikoze bitangiye kugabanuka ubwo nri ntangiye kujya ku ishuri . ||| even the time i left their home for munyagishari 's , i still believe i was going to hide . however , that feeling started disappearing when i started going to school .
nratahaaga mu rugo nta kibazo , nkarya ubundi nkaicara aho ngaho nta kinri kintu nbaga nkora . ||| i could go at home with out any problem , i could eat , there is nothing i was obliged to do .
ejo nkazaongera nkabyuka nkajya ku ishuri nkitahair saa yine , bitewe n' uko nbonaaga ndi jyenyine nta muntu wunri tuvugana . ||| i wouuld wake up the following morning and again go to school . then i would come home at 10:00 a.m. depending on how i would be abandoned .
abana bo kwa munyagishali bo mwari muri ... ubonaaga bakufashe kutae nyuma ya jenoside ? ||| how could you find your relationship with munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? how was it ?
ubwo nyine intambara imaze kurangira urebye uwo mukobwa niwe ukomeje ... tukomeje kubaan , ||| after the genocide , we continued to live with that lady .
n' ubwo ubonaaga ise arakajwe n' uko turokotse kandi akaba nta kintu kihasigaye , inka ziramushizeho kandi yenda ubona ko nawe yari abifitemo inyungu , ||| definitely her father was not happy at all because , we survived but all properties were taken from him ; the cows were gone yet he was considering them as a profit .
hari n' igihe rwose yajyaaga yivumbura akavuga ati @: "@ munsohokaire ahangaha . @" ||| some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream .
mbese nta jambo ... nta kuvuga ngo yenda ... nta kuvuga ngo yenda ngo mbe nmubwira nk' ikintu runaka , yumvaaga ko ndi uwa hariya wowe na bariya ... mbese ubona ko afite umutima mubi . ||| one could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper .
bitewe n' uko ... uko nbibonaaga ubonaaga abiteraw n' uko ibintu byose biri bishize ... inka zashize , ||| and from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him .
kandi nawe yakagombye kuba nawe yari afitemo inyungu , nk' ukuntu yenda yari yatureze ... yari yaraturinze muri icyo kihae cyose . ariko uwo mukobwa we tubanye neza nta kibazo , ||| the cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most .
niwe umenyaaga . niwe umenyaaga ngo nkeneye ikayi niba ngiye kuiga ... ||| she could remember that i need books if it was time for school .
ubungubu se mujya mubonaan ... hari ... ? ||| do you meet often ... is there ... ?
iwabo ho ntabwo nri nsubirayo ||| i have never gone back to her home .
kuva jenoside yarangira ntiurabasha kusubirayo ? ||| since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ?
oya . ||| no !
n' ukutabishaka cyangwa n' ubushobozi bukeya ? ||| is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ?
si ukutabishaka kusubirayo , urebye ni ubushobozi bukeya . no kuba ntekereza ngo nongeye kutekereza kusubira ku kibuye ntabwo ari ibintu bijya binzamo . keretse habaye nk' ikintu runaka , nk' impamvu ngiye ... injyanye yo ku buryo mpita ngaruka . ariko ntabwo nri nsubirayo kujya kubasura . si uko nbanzae ... si uko batanfashe neza se yenda nk' uko nbiifuzaaga , ahubwo urebye ni ubushobozi buke . ||| it is not because i do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means .
ni ukuvuga ko utarasubira rero aho mwari mutuye kuva jenoside yarangira . ||| does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ?
kuva jenoside yarangira tusubiyeyo muri 1995 . ||| since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 .
ubu se iwanyu barahasenyae ... hasigaye ari amatongo ubwo se bya ... ||| has your property been destroyed ... ? are there only ruins left ? ... has it ...
yego neza uko yari iriho n' irangi niyo yafungaishije mu nzu yubatse kandi nayo yubakaishije ya matafari yagiye yegura . ||| yeah ! the doors were still having the same color . you could also see that some of the bricks were from our house .
nonese cya kihae muri ge ... tusubiye mu kihae cya jenoside , ||| let 's think back a little bit on the period during the genocide .
hari iminsi ubaye mu masaka , ubaye hanze igihe kinini . icyo kihae ubaga ... ... ugereranya wenda ukavuga uti ni nk' iminsi ingana gutya ? ||| you spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside ... can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ?
nk' iminsi nvuga ngo nbaye hanze ... ntaba mu nzu ? ||| the days that i spent outside ... it 's about a week .
urebye nko mu cyumweru niba baje gusaka nko muri iyo nzu kwa munyagishari , niba barazaaga kuhasaka nk' iminsi itatu . uraumva niba baje kuwa mbere ku munsi wa kabiri n' uwa gatatu ntabwo ngombaaga kuhaboneka . ||| in fact , if the perpetrators were to come three times in a week to look for me at munyagishari 's place @- for example , if they came on monday , i would n't have to be there on tuesday and wednesday !
kugirango batahita ... baragarukaaga bakaambura . ||| otherwise , they would ... so they would n't get me whenever they would come .
noneho bakagaruka nka nyuma y' iminsi ibiri . na none baje kuirebair inka , bazibura ... ariko baje bitwaje umuntu . ||| then , theyy would just come back after two days but the issue of their come back was just about cows though they would pretend that they were looking for someone .
bakagaruka nkaumva baje , ubwo nkamara iminsi na none ntahari ndi mu masaka . ||| everytime i would be aware of their arrival , i would gao and spend some days in the sorghumfield .
kuko ibyo aribyo byose hari igihe kiumvikana ko umaze igihe kinini cyane wibereye mu masaka . ||| it is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield .
icyo kihae uri uravuye kwa munyagishali basa n' abakuirukanye noneho ... ||| can you tell me about the time that you were chased from munyagishari 's place ?
nragenda nkaumva binaniye , hari aho bigeraaga ukaumva mbese urupfu ntirukushaka ukagenda urushakisha wibunza . ukahita ugenda ukasubira mu rugo na none . naho baza kukushaka bakusohora ukaongera ukasubira hahanri , ukagenda akaba ariho uba . ||| i would just go till ... so many times , one would feel like the doors of death were locked up for him @/@ her as he @/@ she would look for dying ... the next thing was just going back home and flee again in case the perpetrators were back again and so on ... that 's how life was like .
ni ukuvuga ngo igihe ... umaze kutandukana na murumuna wawe bwo nribaza ko ari igihe kishobora kuba kigera nko ku byumweru nka bingahe uba urabayemo . nk' ibyumweru bingahe ... ? ||| i mean all the time right a fter being separated from your sister ... was it like one week or ... how many weeks did you spend outside ?
uraumva tubaye mu masaka kuva mu kwezi kwa kane kugeza mu kwa karindwi . njyewe nvuga ko icyo kihae cyose , ||| we stayed in the sorghumfield from april to july and for me , there was no other hiding place .
nta bunri bwihisho . niba nri ndi mu rugo bakansohora , nta hanri njyaaga . nhita njya mu masaka gutyo . ||| everytime i was chased from where i was living , my refuge was in the sorghumfield . there was nowhere else i could go !
none se iyo wibutse nk' ubuzima mu muryango ... iwanyu mu rugo ukuntu mwari mumeze mbere ya jenoside . ||| how was your life like before the gebnocide ?
unshiramo muri make ubuzima mwari mubayeho ... niba mwari mutunze inka ... ese mwabagaho mutae muri makeya ? ||| tell me a bit about the way your family .
uko mwasabanaga n' abavandimwe . ||| did you have many cows , how was your relationship to your relatives ... ?
muri iyi myaka icumi ishize ubwo turaje nigaaga mu wa kane primaire , murumuna wanjye yiga mu wa gatatu , ||| ten years ago , i was in the 4th class of primary education and my younger in the third one .
nraza nraongera ntangira ishuri nraiga , primaire nrayirangiza nta kibazo . ||| after the war , i went back to school and completed the primary level as long as my younger sister .
tubana n' umutante ubu turabana n' iyi saha niwe tukiri kumwe . turaiga primaire turayirangiza , ||| thereafter , i completed secondary school .
secondaire nrayirangiza murumuna wanjye ubu ngubu ari muwa gatandatu . tuumvaaga nta kibazo . ||| today , my younger sister is in senior six . i lived with my auntie by then till now .
yego nyine ubuzima ntabwo bushobora kungana n' ubaw mbere , n' ubwo mu ntiambara hagati , n' ubaw nyuma . ariko bigiye bitandukanye . ||| of course life is not the same , it is certainly different from the one during the genocide but it not the same as the one before the genocide .
nonese wunva ufite ibyiringiro bihae byo mu kihae kizaza ? ||| are you hopeful about future ?
hari igihe kinini cyane mu kihae cya jenoside ugiye utekereza ... ... wunva wifuza kupfa , wunva wifuza kupfa ... ||| were there times during the genocide where you could feeling like you would better die than ...
cyane numvaaga aricyo gisubizo . ||| yeah , very often ! that was the best solution for me .
none rero uyu munsi bwo wunva iyo uba urapfuye ... wunva bitandukanaiye he n' uko uba uriho ? kuba uriho wunva ... ||| does life make sense for you today or you wish you would die ... what 's your impression about life ?
kuba nriho biratandukanye cyane n' uko nba nrapfuye . kuko kuba njyae ndi umuntu ndi ku isi , ||| being alive for me is very different from dying .
ibyo ari byo byose ntabwo mpora nezerewe , kandi na none ntabwo mpora nbabaye . kuko n' ibintu bibiri kandi bigomba kubaho . ||| of course i 'm human and i do n't rejuice everyday but neither do i feel bad everyday @-@ those are two facts about which we can n't anything about .
noneho ntekerezaho kuba nrapfuye burya ikintu cyo kupfa ... urupfu ntako rusa , ||| on the other hand , when i imagine myself dead , i fell like ... oh !
urupfu ni rwiza . ||| dying is good !
ni rwiza kuko uba uruhutse . ||| it 's good because you rest .
kuko iyo nza kuba nrapfuye , kuba ntekereza kuba nhura n' akantu kakantusha , kuba nhura n' umuntu runaka nkamutekerezaho ukundi kuntu . ||| i think that if it happened that i was dead , today i would n't be worryinng about people because i may meet someone in the street and start questioning myself about him .
yaba ari no muri abo bantu batuiciye , tuhura nkabona yenda ... afite ikibazo . bikatuma mutekerezaho impamvu abaye gutyo . bituma numva ko iyo nba nrapfuye ibi byose ntabwo biri kubaho . ||| when i see that he is not very confortable when we meet , i start thinking that maybe he is the one who killed my people or ... i just become inquisitive about him .
nta n' ubwo ntekereza ngo numvae ngo kugirango bigendae gutya , ngombye kugenza gutya , numvae ni ibintu bishyuhije mu mutawe , mbese ni ukuruhuka niko nbifata , ||| all this makes me belive that if were n't alive , i would n't have all those problems , i would n't think to do this or that according to the situation , i would just rest .
ni nako nbifata . ||| that 's how i think it is .
mu bihae turimo hariho ikintu cya leta ... kuko habayeho kushaka ubundi buzima bushya . ||| the programme that the government has adopted is to emphasize on the fact that people have got to live in a new way .
nka leta hari ibintu bavuga bya gacaca , ibintu byo kufungura abaemeye icyaha ... byo ubibona kutae ? ||| what do you think about gacaca and the system of releasing prisonners who have handed themselves over ?
ndetse n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge muri rusangae . ||| can you tell me what you think about unity and reconciliation ?
ubwo rero nkabona ko biriya bintu byo kuvuga ngo basohoye abantu gutya kusa , kuberako baemeye icyaha hano umwe hariya undi , hano batanu , hano ijana , ||| so , in my opinion , releasing someone just because they admit what they did , releasing a hundred ... a hundred people ... i think it 's a way of simplifying things .
hano ngo magana angahe ... ngo baemeye icyaha hano ngo barasohotse , ||| i do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be .
numva ari uburyo bwo koroshya ibibazo nta n' ubwo njya nnabiiumvaish ngo numvae inkurikizi zabyo , numvae n' impamvu babikoze . kuko niba umuntu atekereza , ||| we should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time .
ntabwo ashobora kumara imyaka icumi muri ntuza ... akabona kuibuka yuko ... akabona kuemera ko hari icyaha yakoze mu myaka yose ishize . ese akainjiramo ukwezi kwa mbere ... umwaka urashize , imyaka ibiri ... yari ataratekereza ngo amenye impamvu ari aho ngaho ? ukareba ko harimo abantu bagenda barebair ku banri , ||| some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail .
kubera ko ba kanaka bigenze gutya , ntawe bigomba kugenda gutya . kandi koko ukabona niko bimeze . ||| at the end of it all , we realize that 's how things work .
mu bya kurikiraanye na jenoside harimo ikibazo cy' ubupfubyi , wowe iyo ureba nk' abana b' ipfubyi ubona iyi leta ibaitayeho kutae ... ? ubona ibafasha kutae ... ? ||| after genocide , the country had to face the problem of orphans ... what do you think of the way the current government takes care of orphans ?
ese ubona bikwiriye ? ||| do you think it is enough ?
ubona uburyo bitwabwaho , ||| what do you think of the way you 're treated by the rest of the society ?
uburyo abandi bantu babasura ... ubona bikwiriye ? ||| do they pay you a visit ... ?
njyewe uko nbibona nbona ntako batari bagize pe ! kuko ubundi umuntu ajya kurokoka cyangwa ajya kusigara muri buriya buryo , ||| i think they really give their best because right after the genocide , no survivor ever thought they 'd one day go back to school or that they 'd even beneficiate from any medical care .
ntabwo yatekerezaaga y' uko cyane cyane kubierekeraanye n' ikibazo cy' amashuri . ntabwo yatekerezaaga yuko yaba yakuiga ; ntabwo yatekerezaaga yuko yarwara akavuzaw ; ||| today , we have the funds of assistance to genocide survivors , fonds d' assistance aux rescapes du genocide ( farg ) in french .
nk' uko bikwiriye bitewe n' ahantu yenda yaba ari runaka . ||| it helps in paying survivors ' school fees .
ariko kuri ubungubu , nbona baragerageje , nka kuriya hajeho ikigega farg [ ikigega kitera inkunga abacitse ku icumu rya jenosidde bataishoboye ] kuriya ifasha abana ikaishyura minerval [ amafranga y' ishuri ] , ||| survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from .
umuntu akaba afite ikarita yarwara akaba yakwivuriza ahantu aho ariho hose bitewe n' uburwayi bwe . biriya nabyo nrabishima cyane . kuko hari benshi batari kuiga , ||| i am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness .
iyo kiriya kigega kitaza kubaho . hari benshi bari kurwara bakabura kirengera , iyo ikigega kitaza kubaho . kimwe n' uko hari benshi batabonye n' amafamille [ imiryango ] babamo bibana , ||| there are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today .
kandi bakabaho neza . bakaiga barwara bakivuza , kandi no mu buzima busanzwe bakaba babapangira nk' ibyo kurya n' iki ... nbona biraho nyine nta kibazo . ||| the government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... i think it 's good .
nribaza nkawe nk' ukuntu usigaye , wunva abandi bana bagenzi bawe n' ubwo umaze kuba mukuru ariko umaze igihe kinini uri umwana , kandi uri umwana w' imfubyi . wunva uha ubutumwa ki abandi bana mwarokokanye mu kihae cya jenoside ? ||| you have been an orphan for quite a long time despite the fact that you 're an adult today ... do you have a message to give to other children who survived the genocide the way you did ?
urebye ikintu cy' ingenzi . nk' ubungubu nkanjyae nihereyeho , kuko kuvuga ubuzima bwo kubaho mu bupfubyi , ni ubuzima bugoye cyane . ||| in fact , the most important thing ... well , it 's a personal comment but it is a difficult life that requires patience and perseverence .
busaba ngo wihangane , busaba ngo ugeragezae kutuza , ugeragezae kukira ibyo ubonye ibyo utabonye nyine ntubirarikirae . ||| it is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that .
niko bimeze . nkanjyae nongeye akantu k' akarusho njyewe numva muri njyewe ... akantu ko kumenya imaan . njyewe nmenye imaan , numva ko imaan ariyo ishobora byose . ||| i have had the grace of knowing god and i know he can do anything !
nkamenya ngo niba imaan yarakurinze , ikakurinda muri buriya buzima bwose , ikakurinda bitari bikwaiye , nta kintu na kimwe ishingaiyeho , ||| i would therefore tell the survivors that it is god who protected them during the wat , nobody else did !
intambara ikarinda irangira . nta wunri muntu ubona ukuitayeho kugirango ukundae ubae urabayeho , ukabona ni imaan yo yonyine yakurinze . nbona inama ngira bagenzi banjye , ||| i would invite them to live a prayerful life because without him , no one would be where they are at today .
ikintu cya mbere ... cya mbere @: ‘ kusenga . ’ kusenga kuko uramutse utekereje ... iyo utekereje ukareba mu buryo bwose , ubona hatabaye imaan yo yonyine yirindiye umuntu n' aho ugeze ngo ubae uhagera , ||| through prayer we find a certain peace that helps us to accept what happened and we understand that it had to happen that way .
ubona ari imaan yonyine yakurinze . ubona ko mu kusenga ... ugira ukuihangana . ibyo byose ubona ubasha kubiihanganair . ukaumva ko n' ubwo bibaye niko bigombaaga kugenda . ||| and also that god is not unaware of what is happening to us .
yego . none se nkavuga yenda ngo ... kuba bikubayeho si uko imaan yari iyobewe ko bikubaho . ariko ishobora no kuemera ko bikubaho kugirango irebae ukuihangana kwawe . aho ni mukihae wenda uba umaze kubimenya . ||| but it 's only when one undertands the importance of prayer that we can be able to reach such a conclusion .
noneho mu bunri buryo numva ko n' ubwo hari abana b' imfubyi wenda bitewe n' ibibazo runaka buri wese aba afite , ntabwo ubona bose batuje . baemera uko ibintu bije bigendae ... wenda uko bije abe ariko bigenda . ||| on the other hand , orphans are confronted to various problems , they are n't stable and ... they do not understand that things come and go .
ukasanga harimo abitwara ukundi kuntu nabi , ukasanga n' ubwo barimo kuiga ntawe utekereza yenda iyi minerval [ amafranga y' ishuri ] irava he ? ||| some of them behave very badly without realizing where the money for the education comes from .
ese iyo biba bitameze gutya biri kugenda bite ? ||| they do not ask themselves how things would be if they were n't the way they are .
ukabona mu kihae cy' ishuri harimo abatabyitaho nk' uko bikwiriye , kandi mu by' ukuri aricyo kintu cya mbere . ||| it is very clear that some students are n't serious about their school work at all and yet it should be their number 1 priority .
nabwo nkabona ko ... inama nbagira nkanjyae ni uko mbese bashikama bakamenya ko ari imfubyi . ntarebae famille [ umuryango ] arimo , ||| my message for them is to be aware that they are orphans and that they should n't so much count on the families with which they live .
ntarebae yenda se ngo ararangije . agomba kumenya igihe cyose ko ari imfubyi . agomba kumenya yuko mu myitwarire y' uburyo bwose agomba kumenya y' uko ari imfu ... mbese ntiiibagirwae , mbese nta kintu cyo kuibagirwa , ||| whatever they do , they should n't forget that they are orphans !
ngo baibagirwae aho baturutse . ngo bagendanae n' aho bari baibagirwae aho baturutse . kandi iyo wibutse aho uturutse bituma n' aho uri ugomba kubigendamo neza , bitewe n' aho uvuye . ||| they should n't forget where they are coming from because the moment one recalls where they are coming from , their behaviour gets better .
ubu butumaw ... ubu buhamya ni ubuhamya buzarebaw n' abantu benshi , cyangwa se nawe n' uzagira abana n' abuzukuru ushobora kuzabibaereka . ||| this testimony will be watched by many people , maybe even by your grandchildren .
nraumva ibyo aribyo byose tutarangiza tutakuhaye umwanya wo kugirango , utangae ubutumwa haba ku bantu bazabubona , cyangwa abandi bantu bazaza nyuma yawe . ||| i would n't want to let you go without giving you an opportunity to give a message to those who will watch it , something that 's on your heart .
kuko nicyo kikuturukamo . nraumva ibyo aribyo byose ufite uwo mwanya , ushobora kuvuga noneho , ukatanga ubutumwa bw' icyo wifuza ||| this is therefore the opportunity to tell us what is on your heart and what your wishes are .
murakoze . ||| thank you very much !
ubutumwa numva ntanga , cyane ku ruhande rwanjye nk' uko nhereye kare nbivuga . ni uko umuntu wese ; aho ari hose , ||| the message i would like to give as i said from the beginning is a message of love , everyone needs to love their neighbour wherever they are .
kandi mu buryo bwose abayemo agomba kugira ikintu cy' urukundo . kuko na mbere hose n' ubwo ibintu bigenze gutyo , iyo haza kubamo ikintu cy' urukundo hagati mu bantu , ntabwo ibintu biba biragenze kuriya , ||| i am convinced that if everyone had shown love for one another , what happened would never have happened .
ngo abantu bapfae , ngo umuntu yicwae na mugenzi we . ise w' umwana abe yamuhagarikair , amubwirae ati @: ||| no father would have killed his own children !
"@ ica kanaka . @" icyo kihae nta rukundo . ||| there was no love at all during genocide .
ahari umuntu wese yagombye kukunda mugenzi we nk' uko yikunda . yego biragoye ariko nibura umuntu akagerageza . kubera ko niba ukunda mugenzi wawe nk' uko wikunda , ||| everyone is supposed to love their neighbour as they love themselves .
ntabwo uzatekereza ko azapfa akaba imfubyi hariya , noneho nawe ukahita wishyira mu mwanya we . ukatekereza uti @: ||| i know it is not easy but at least we should make some effort !
"@ noneho njyewe arijyae uramutse ubaye hariya bigenda bite ? @" niba utekereza ko mugenzi ashobora kurwara akabura kirwaza , nawe ugomba kuishyira mu mwanya we , ukavuga uti @: ||| because when you love your neighbour as you love yourself , you will never think of killing him or her or of making him or her into an orphan but you will have compassion for them instead .
"@ se arijyae urwaye hariya nkabura kirwaza , biba bimeze kutae ? ni ukuvuga ... ikintu nsaba umuntu wese ni urukundo . akaumva akunze mugenzi nk' uko yikunda . ||| you would want to put yourself in their shoes , you would think of a situation where you get sick and there 's nobody to take care of you ... so all i am asking is that people love their neighbour as themselves .
cyane cyane biragoye nk' abantu bicaiyew , abo bana bose , n' abandi bantu bose nbwira babiumva , ko ... biragoye kaumva ukuntu ubabaye ... cyane cyane iyo hatajemo ikintu cy' akakiza . ||| it is very difficult especially for orphans and for those who lost their loved ones ... it is very difficultn for someone who is n't ‘ saved ’ to ... to understand that there 's nothing good in revenging .
wunvae ko ... ... umenye imaan . wunva ko nyine ... niko bigenze , ariko rero nta mpamvu yo kuitura mugenzi wawe inabi yakugiraiye . hagati aho ngaho inama nbagira niba umuntu yaricaiyew ... uricaiyew , ||| it is true that your people were killed but it is over !

ni n' ikintu kitashobora kaumvamo ntibibaho . noneho akaibuka . noneho kuko yibutse ko bigenze kuriya , noneho bikaba ... bitewe n' igihe tugezemo akabona bimeze gutya . ||| and when one remembers how it happened , it becomes ... depending on the period in which we are , things are the way they are .
ntagomba kuibagirwa kiriya kihae yavuyemo , kuko nzajya abiibuka , azajya areba n' igihe tugezemo , noneho akompare [ comparaison / kugereranya ] noneho arebae hagati yabyo , ||| we should n't forget what happened because remembering , looking at where we are at today and being able to that despite everything , there 's some improvement .
avugae ati @: "@ ibyo aribyo byose hari ikintu cyakoretse . @" kuko hariya hari ubuzima buri buri ukwabwo . ||| because that period was part of another life .
n' ubungubu hari ubuzima mbese ... bunri . ||| today , we 're in another life .
mbese ubuzima tuvuyemo n' ubuzima turimo . numva yagombye ikintu cyo kujya atekereza ... akabitekerezaho , ariko bitavuze ngo abibaemo ... abibaemo byo byonyine . ||| the life in which we were and today 's life ... we need to think about it but that 's not a reason to cnstantly live in the past without thinking of anything else .
agomba kubitekerezaho akabiibuka , kugirango atazaibagirwa . mbese uko umuntu atashobora kuibagirwa ko yavutse , ni nako atagomba kuibagirwa ko azapfa . ||| yes , we need to remember , just like it is impossible to forget that we were born and that we shall die one day .
ariko akabitekerezaho ... kandi ashobora kubitekerezaho akashima imaan ku bw' ibyo yakoze , bitewe n' aho ari , naho yavuye . akaba ageze muri iki kihae turimo . ||| but thinking about it ... we need to think about it with the intention to show gratitude to god for what he did , by looking at where you came from and where you are at today , gratitude for the fact that you have reached the time in which we are living today .
kuko numva ashobora kuibuka , ariko bitavuze ngo azaba muri icyo kihae kusa . akatekereza mbese mu buryo bwo kutekereza , ||| i believe there 's nothing wrong with thinking about it as long as we are not living in the past .
kandi ... mbese akabitekerezaho . akagira ikintu cy' urukundo cyo kaumva anababariye . ||| we need to think about it in the sense of ... yes , to think abou tit . and also to have love and to be able to forgive .
nkanjyae njyewe nrababariye pe ! ||| personally , i have completely forgiven them !
nrababariye kuko ... numvise ko barabikoze nibyo . ariko nabo sibo wa mukani ... nk' uko bajya banabivuga . ||| i have forgiven them because i know they did it because ... i know they did it ... but maybe as they say it themselves , they were only tools in the hands of someone else or some other power .
njyae nbona , ntakuntu umuntu ... umuntu muzima ... umuntu utekereza , ashobora kuhaguruka akareba mugenzi we ... baremye kimwe ufite amatwi , amaso , ||| personally , i do not understand how a human being healthy of mind can attack another human being with 2 ears , 1 nose , legs ... just like him or her .
amazuru , amaguru ... eh ! ni umuntu mugenzi we . ||| a human being like him or her !
yarangiza akatinyuka kufata umuhoro akaba yamutema amaraso akameneka abibona , numva ari ibintu birenze ubwenge bw' umuntu atari umuntu ubwe . njyewe ku ruhande rwange nbona ari satani umukoresheje , ||| and they take a machete , hack him or her down and see blood shedding ... it is beyond understanding .
ku buryo umuntu wese ahari hose yaza kunsaba imbabazi , ataza . numva nramubabariye ku mutaima wanjye , njyae nta kibazo na kimwe nfite k' umuntu runaka . ||| personally , i do n't think that person did it by himself or herself , but they were used by satan to an extent where i have forgiven them all , it does n't matter whether they have asked for forgiveness or not .
ibyo birabaye nibyo ntinshobora no kubiibagirwa , ariko ... nrabizi ko bibaye . ubwo rero hagati ahongaho ikindi kintu nbabwira yenda ku bakaiga . ni ukuvuga ngo @: ||| what happened happened and it is true that i can not forget it .
agomba kumenya ko ari kuiga , kandi akiteganyiriza ubuzima bwe buri inberae . kuko hari igihe umwana azamuka yiga bitewe n' ibihe ; ||| for those who are still in school , i would tell them to seriously study and to prepare themselves a better future .
n' ahantu se ari ... umujyi runaka akagerageza kuitwara nk' uko abandi bitwara . ariko ntiyitwarae nk' uko we yakagombye kuitwara . kuko burya hari ukuntu umuntu akora ibintu bitewe n' uko ari , ingeso runaka bitewe n' uko we yumva ko nta kibazo . ||| it happens at times that they want to behave in a certain way depending on the town in which they live or which school they go to , but it should n't be the case .
ariko nibura ukatekereje ... cyane cyane harimo nk' abana benshi bamara kuigira hejuru bitewe n' ubuzima abayemo , yenda abayeho ubuzima bumeze neza famille yifashije ... ariko akagerageza kwiyibagiza bya binri . noneho akashaka kugenda ... ni nko kukata mbese . akagerageza kubiirengagiza ... mbese na none akashaka kuirengagiza uko yakagombye kubaho . ||| a child should not forget what is behind maybe just because he or she is lucky enough to live with a well @-@ off family and thus behave as though he or she should n't live in a certain way .
nraumva ibyo ngibyo bihagije . ||| i guess that is enough .
jyewe banyita umulisa marie claire , ||| my name is umulisa marie @-@ claire .

papa aramubwira ngo @: ishyaka rye riri ku mutaima ntabwo ari ngombaw kubimubwira . ||| my dad replied that his political party was in his heart and that it was n't necesary to tell it to him .
hashize nk' icyumweru mu ... muri secteur y' iwacu haza aba ... abantu bavuye mu yinri secteur , ||| a week later , some people from different neighbouring sectors came to our home sector .

hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , icyo kihae hari ku cyumweru , tugiye kusenga , ||| two days later , it was on a sunday and we had gone to church .
tuvuye kusenga papa ara ... baraza bageze mu rugo bahamagara papa , ||| when we came back , they came home and called my dad .

ubwo batwara inka zari ziri mu rugo baragenda barazirya , ariko icyo kihae ntabwo batuishe . ||| they took all the cows that were at home and ate them but they never killed us as they had said .

ubwo baraje , bamaze kuza , icyo kihae hari mu gitondo , ||| i remember they came home one morning .
bakomanga ku rugi rwo ku irembo , ||| they knocked at the front door .
ubwo abana turi turi mu rugo tuhise tusimbuka urugo na mama , ariko papa we aguma mu rugo . ||| my mother and all the kids who were at home skipped the fence and only dad remained there .

umwe yitwaaga karekezi undi yitwaaga minani . ||| one was called karamage and the other one was called minani .
baraza batwara papa , bamujyana haruguru ‘ ku gacenter ’ kari kahari , ||| they came and took dad to a certain center that was around .
baramwicaza ngo @: baramukubita . ||| they made him sit there and beat him .
ariko ntabwo bahise bamwica . ||| i heard that they did not kill him on that day .

ubwo baragarutse ariko papa yari ikiriho bari bataramwica . ubwo baraza barasambura inzu , bakuramo n' ibintu byose , n' urugo bararutwika . ||| then they came back at home , but dad was still alive ; they had n't killed him yet .
hashize umunsi umwe , ubwongubwo ... papa nyine ntabwo turi tuzi irengero rye , ya masaka turi turimo inyuma y' urugo , turi kumwe na mama n' abana bose , ||| a day later ... we did n't know where dad was . in the millet plantation where we were , behind home ... we were with mum and the rest of my brothers and sisters .
mu rugo turi abana batanu . ||| we were five children .
ubwongubwo ab' abahungu bahise batucika baragenda , ||| the boys left us .

bigejeje nimugoroba turagenda ahantu ku musozi w' iwacu , tugeze ... tuhageze ku musozi tuihisha ahantu mu mwo ... ku mukokwe . ||| in the evening we went to a certain hill in our village and hid in a cave .
ubwongubwo bigejeje nka nimugoroba turagenda , mama aratujyana mu rugo turi tuturanye , ||| and the following evening we left and mum took us to our nieghbours .
tuhageze mama arababwira ngo @: jyewe nibampishe [ kuko ari jyewe uri mutoya mu bana b' iwacu ] . ||| when we reached there mum asked them to hide me as i was the last born .
ubwo mama baramubwira ngo @: "@ ntabwo bemerewe ngo kubika inkotanyi . @" ||| they told my mum that they were not allowed to keep inyenzi .
ubwo tuhise tusubira nanone inyuma , turagenda , turaongera tujya ahantu mu masaka turihisha . ||| we immediately went back to hid in a millet plantation .
ubwo hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , mama aravuga ati @: "@ noneho murekae tugende nanone tujyae ahantu ku kiliziya abe ari mo tujya . @" ||| after about two days ... mum suggested that we go to a church and hide there .
tugeze ku kiliziya ... icyo kihae tugeze ku kiliziya nka saa yine . tuhageze tujya mu kiliziya mo inberae tumaramo iminsi itatu , ||| when we reached the church ... it was around 10 o'clock .. we entered in the church and spent about three days there .
hashize iminsi itatu baraza batukuramo bagiye kutujyana mu ruzi . ||| after three days they came to get us and led us towards the river .
hashize ... ubwo turagenda tugeze ku gacenter , mama baramugumana , twebwe baratubwira ngo @: ||| when we reached a certain center , we were stopped and they wanted to remain behind with mum and told us to go back .
nitugende . tuanga kusiga mama , jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ||| both my sister and i refused to leave our mum behind .
baratukubita . batukubise kubera ko turi abana , turemera mama turamusiga turagenda . ||| they started beating us and since we were young kids , we agreed and left mum there .
tujya ahantu turi tuturanye na none ku rugo , ||| we went to another neighbours ' house .
urwo rugo kubera ko bari inshuti z' iwacu , jyewe na mukuru wanjye turagenda , tugeze inyuma yaho , ||| both our families were friends , so my sister and i decided to go there and when we reached , we hid behind their home .
ubwongubwo tuihisha munsi y' urugo , tubona umukobwa wo muri urwo rugo n' umuhungu musaza we , turabahamagara tugirango wenda baratugirair impuhwe batujyanae mu rugo batuhishe . ||| as we were still hiding , we saw one girl and one boy members of that family and we called them . we thought they would be merciful and hide us in their home .
ubwo turabahamagaye , bamaze kuza baratubwira , ngo @: "@ bene wacu babasize muri he ? @" ||| so we called them and when they came they asked us , "@ how did our people [ the hutu ] leave you ? @"
ubwo bahise batufata jyewe na mukuru wanjye , batujyana ku nterahamwe yicaaga abantu cyane yitwaaga byemayire , ||| they immediately took us [ my sister and i ] to some interahamwe called byemayire , who was a terrible killer .
batugejejeyo ngo byemayire atuicae , ||| they took us there so that byemayire would kill us .
tusanga byemayire ntawe uhari . baradukomezanyije batujyana ahantu ku ‘ gacentere ’ kari kahari , ||| fortunately , byemayire was n't around .
ngo wenda tuhasanga izindi nterahamwe gakushwa , kugirango wenda zibae zatuica . turagenda tuhasanga abagabo babiri , bamaze kutubona , ||| they procceeded and took us to a nearby center , hoping to find there some other cruel interahamwe so that they would kill us .
baratubwira bati @: "@ aba bana ntabwo tubica , papa wabo yari umuntu mwiza yatugirairaga neza , nimubareke bazagwae ahandi . @" ||| when we reached there , two men were hesitant , "@ we can not kill these two kids ; their father was a very good man and he helped us out several times . let them go and be killed elsewhere . @"
turamanuka ... ariko wa muhungu bamwitaga minani , na mushiki we bamwita yansoneye , bo barakomeje baratujyana . baragenda ngo bagiye kutuereka interahamwe ngo zituicae , ||| therefore , we left . but the boy called minani and his sister yansoneye followed us saying that they were going to show us to interahamwe in order for them to kill us .
baragenda batugejeje ahantu baita ku musenyi , jyewe nanirwa kugenda , ||| when we reached a place called musenyi , i failed to walk because i was very tired .
kubera ko nri nrushye . uwo baitaaga minani yarantemye , antema ku kaguru , ngo nihutae . ||| minani then hacked me on the leg and said that i sould hurry .
bamaze kuntema ariko turagenda , ntabwo nhise ncika intege kugirango , wenda ku buryo ntabashije ubugenda , nrakomeje nragenda . ||| though i was hacked , i still we continued to walk ; i was n't too weak to stop walking .
turagenda tumanuka umusozi jyewe na mukuru wanjye , tugeze haruguru ku musozi bahamagara abo hasi ku ruzi ngo @: "@ tubazaniye inkotanyi , ngo @: ||| as we were slopping down the hill , still in my sister 's company , they called some people who were down at the river and told them that they had brought them some inkotanyi , to get ready .
nimuitegurae . @" barakomeza baratumanukaan , batugejeje ku ruzi , bafata mukuru wanjye bamuhekaish igiti , ||| therefore , they continued to slop down with us and when we reached the river , my sister was forced to carry a tree trunk and they made me carry two stones , then they dumped us in the water .
bampekesha amabuye abiri , batujugunya mu ruzi . ubwo mu ruzi tumazemo iminsi ibiri , tugiye kubona ... .... jyewe nvamo ngwa mu bisheke , ||| we spent two days in the water . we found ... i found myself in the sugar cane plants that were around and my sister came out from the other side of the river . the waters threw us in two different areas .
mukuru wanjye agwa hakurya y' uruzi , ntabwo twagu ... ... ntabwo uruzi rutujugunyaiye ahantu hamwe . ubwo hashize iminsi nk' ibiri jyae nri ndi mu bisheke , ariko mukuru wanjye ntinri nzi aho ari , ||| that was after two days and i was in the sugar cane plants but i did n't know where my sister was .
nherukaaga bagiye kututa mu ruzi . ||| i had last seen her when they were trowing us into the waters .
ubwo ngumaye mu bisheke nambaye ubusa , imyenda yose nri nambaye ntayi ... ntaa ... nvuyemo nta mwenda nkifite . ||| i remained in the sugar cane plantation naked ; i did n't ... i came out of water without any cloth .
ubwo kubera ko hari famille turi tufite ahantu baitaaga muri runda , hari umukecuru uri nyirasenge wa mama . ||| some of our relatives were in runda ; an old lady who was my mum 's aunt .
ariko nkaba ntari mpazi neza . ||| but i did n't know the place very well .
ubwo batuta mu ruzi ... batuta mu ruzi , batutereye ahantu baita ku iraro , twiburukiye ahangaha hafi ya kamuhanda , ku kiraro kigabanya kigali na kitaarama . ||| they dumped us in the river from a place called iraro and we came out at a certain place called kamuhada , at a brigde that is between kigali and gitarama .
ubwo bumaze kwira nzamutse ahantu baita ku musozi wa kagina , nragenda ari ninjoro , ||| then when night fell , i went to some hill called kagina .
nka saa saba z' ijoro . ||| it was in the middle of the night , at around 1 o'clock in the morning .
nragenda , ntakomeza nrazamuka ... ... nrazamuka , ||| therefore , i walked and walked .
bujya nko kucya nka saa ... nka saa kumi , urwo rugo nirwo na ... niho nhageze . ||| it was almost morning , at around 4 o'clock in the morning that is when i reached to that home .
nragenda ntakomanga , ||| i went and knocked on their door .
maze kukomanga kubera yuko nhaherukaaga kera ... barankingurair , mpageze nsanga mama yagezeyo . nrabasuhuza , mama akinbona agahinda karamwica , ||| they had n't seen me in a long time . they opened for me and i found my mum already there . and when she saw me , she was filled with sorrow .
araambaza ngo @: "@ mukuru wanjye ari he ? @" ||| then she asked me , "@ where is your older sister ? @"
mubwira yuko bagiye kuturoha mu ruzi turi kumwe , ariko we ntinzi irengero rye . ||| i told her that by the time they drowned us , we were together but i do n't know what happened to her later .
ubwo turahaguma jyae na mama hashize iminsi nk' ibiri , ngiye kubona nbona mukuru wanjye nawe araje turamubaza @: ||| therefore , my mum and i stayed there and two days later , my older sister also came .
"@ ese wowe uje utae ? @" aramubwira ngo @: ||| my mum asked her how she came .
"@ avuye ahantu hakurya y' uruzi , ahantu baita i nyagatovu . @" ||| she told her that she was coming from somewhere across the river , in a place called nyagatovu .
ubwo turagumana uko turi batatu . ||| the three of us remained together .
ariko umugabo wo muri urwo rugo , we ntabwo yahigawaga kuburyo bamwica , ||| actually , the man in that family was not being hunted .
niwe uri utuhishe . ariko umudamu we , yari nyirasenge wa mama , nawe mubaicwa yabaga arimo . ||| he was the one to hide us and his wife was an aunt to mum and she was also among the group of hunted people .
ariko kuko yari yarashatse umugabo w' umuhutu , we nta kintu bamurebaagaho . ||| since her husband was a hutu , he was not threatened .
turakomeza turahaihisha turi batatu , jyewe na mama na mukuru wanjye . hashize icyo kihae hari mu kwaa ... intambara mbese yari igeze hagati , ariko bikiri mu kwa kane . ||| we all continued to hide there ; my mum , my older sister and i. later ... it was in ... it was still in april in the middle of the war .
bigejeje mu kwa gatanu , uwo mugabo aravuga ngo @: ntabwo agiye kuzazira inkotanyi , ||| then in may , the man [ husband to her mum 's aunt ] said , "@ i do not want to be accused of being inkotanyi .
ngo @: tuesae tugende , ||| all of you go . @"
ngo niba uwo mukecuru , uwo turi dufitanye relation [ isano ] ngo niba yumva ko yakomeza akatuhisha , ngo nawe tujyane . ||| he told his wife if she believed she had to continue hiding us , then she should leave with us .
ntahaguma ariko ntinkamenye aho abo turi kumwe bagiye , ||| i stayed there without knowing where the others who were with me had gone .
intambara irakomeza , irakomeza , bigejejemo hagati nko mu kwa gatandatu intambara y' amasasu iraza . ngera ahongaho muri runda , ||| the war went on and at some point they began shooting .
tugeze muri runda , ubwo inkotanyi nyine zaigeze muri runda igihe amasasu yabaga , ubwo turahunga , tuhunga tuesae . ||| the inkotanyi came to runda while i was there . during the time of shootings , we all fled together .
nreba kusigara mu nzu jyenyine biranshobera . ||| i thought of staying in the house alone and thought it would be hard .
turaongera na none tuambuka ahantu kuko runda yari iteranye na taba . kandi taba niho yari iwacu . ||| we again crossed over to a certain place ... runda was next to taba and taba was my home village .
turahanyura turagenda , ||| we passed there and went further .
ngeze ahantu baita i kanyinya tuhunga tuhasanga bariyeri [ barriere ] . ||| we reached a place called kanyinya , where we found a roadblock .
tuhasanze bariyeri barahagarika abantu , noneho bakagenda batureba mu biganza , abana batagiraaga ibyangombwa . bagenda batureba mu biganza , ||| at the roadlock they would stop people and look into the palms of kids who were not yet able to get identity cards .
banrebye mu kiganza baraambaza ngo iwacu ni hehe ? ||| when they looked into mine , they asked me , "@ where do you come from ? @"
nrababeshya nbabwira amazina atari ay' ababyeyi banjye baranreka . ||| i lied to them and gave them wrong names of my parents . then they let me go .
turakomeza turagenda , tugera ahantu za nyabikenke , tugera ahantu za bulinga , ||| we continued our journey and reached nyabikenke and bulinga . we went through all those areas .
hose turahazunguruka , tugeze ku gisenyi turaongera turagaruka , ubwo intambara yari imeze nk' ihosheje . ||| when we reached gisenyi , we turned back as it seemed like the war had calmed down .
turaongera turagaruka tujya ... nyine nsubira aho intambara yabaye ndi , ||| we went back to ... to the place where i was during war .
kuko nta wunri muntu turi turi kumwe . nsubira ahongaho muri runda , maze kusubira muri runda , ||| since i was alone , i went back to ruda .
ubwo intambara yari irangiye . ||| the war had stopped then .
ubwo tusanga wa mukecuru aracyariho , ariko wa musaza yarapfuye . ||| i found when the old lady was still alive but the old man had died .
turagenda tujya ahantu ku ruyenzi mu nkambi , turahakaambika . hashira iminsi mikeya , nkajya ntegereza yuko nibura hari umuntu w' iwacu uza , ||| we went to a camp in ruyenzi and camped there . after some few days ... i thought that maybe someone from home may come to that camp , but no one came .
nramubura ngumana n' abongabo . ||| i just stayed there with those people .
mu kwezi kwa munani muri 1994 , icyo kihae nri ndi ... turi tugiye mu misa , tuje tusa ... nsanga mukuru wanjye yaje , ||| in august 1994 ... i remember we had gone to church , when i came back , i found my sister there .
mubonye nsanga ni nk' ibitangaza bikomeye . ||| it was like a big miracle to me .
mbere yo kumusuhuza nramubajije @: "@ ese uri muzima ? @" ||| before greeting her , i first asked her ; "@ are you still alive ? @"
aranbwira @: "@ ndi muzima . @" ||| she said , "@ i am alive . @"
"@ ntabwo upfuye ? ||| then i asked her , "@ you did n't die ?
cyangwa ni umuzimu wawe ndi kusuhuza ? @" ||| or am i just talking to a ghost . @"
aranbwira @: "@ oya ni jyewe ndi muzima . @" ||| she said , "@ no , it is me , i am still alive . @"
"@ ese ubaga he ? @" ||| "@ where were you living ? @"
aranbwira ngo @: ||| i asked her .
yari ... yageze nyine ahongaho i musambair , ahongaho habaaga amafamilles [ imiryango ] yacu , ||| then she told me that she ... she went to musambira , where we had family members and continued to hide .
arakomeza yihishaanw nabo aragenda agera zairae , araongera aragaruka . ||| later she went to zaire [ congo ] and came back .
tutegereza yuko rero mama yaza , cyangwa tutegereza ko n' abandi bose bo mu rugo baza , turategereza turaheba . ||| therefore , we waited to see if mum or other people from home would come but none turned up .
abantu b' iwacu ntabwo tuzi urupfu bapfuye , nta nubwo tuzi ahantu babiciye . kaereka papa wenyine niwe biciye ahantu ku ‘ gacenter ’ , aho bamujyanye , ||| we neither know how people from home died nor where they died except dad who was killed at a certain center where they had taken him .
niho bamutsinze . ||| that is where they killed him .
ubwo intambara irangiye , ||| then the war stopped .
jyewe mu minsii ... kuva mu kwa munani , icyenda na kane [ 1994 ] kugeza mu kwa mbere , icyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] niho ... nrakomeje nba ahongaho , ||| from august 1994 to january 1995 i continued to live there where i was when the war stopped .
aho narokokeye . njyewe na mukuru wanjye uwonguwo , ||| my sister and i continued to live there together .
turakomezanya . noneho basa nk' aho ... bashaka kutugira abakoroni [ kudukoroniza ] , intambara yabaye niga quatrieme primaire [ mu mwaka wa kane w' amashuri abanza ] , ||| they somehow wanted to make us their slaves ... the war begun when i was in primary four .
baanga ko nsubira kuiga . ||| then they stopped me from going back to school .
noneho kubera ko mukuru wanjye we ... nawe ntabwo yari mukuru cyane , ariko we yari anrushije ubwenge . arareba ati @: "@ ese ubu , ||| though my sister was n't so old , she was slightly wiser than me .
ubu buzima tuzabugumamo kutae ? @" banzae y' uko ujya kuiga , kandi nnjyae banzae y' uko nsubira kuiga . @" bo ikintu bashakaaga , ||| then she asked , "@ how shall we live this kind of life ?
bashakaaga ngo @: tujyae tuhair ibyatsi by' inka zabo , tuhingae , tubavomaire , ||| they can n't allow you to go to school ; neither did they allow me ... all they wanted us for was to collect grass for their cows , to dig , to fetch water , generally to do all the domestic work .
mbese tukorae akazi ko mu rugo , aricyo mbese tubamarair , noneho nabo babonae ko ari cyo baturerair . ||| that was what they expected from us and to them that was the reason why they were taking of us .
mukuru wanjye aragenda ansiga ahongaho , ||| my sister left me there .
turi tufite umu bourgmestre w' iwacu , nawe yari yaracitse ku icumu . ||| the burgomaster of our home area was a genocide servivor too .
aragenda arabimubwira ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ||| therefore , my sister went to him and told him what was going on .
aramubwira ati @: "@ ese nkukorerae iki ? @" ||| then he asked her , "@ what can i do for you ?
muri abana ntabwo mushobora kujya mu nzu ukwanyu ; ese mwajya mu nzu mukatungaw n' iki ? ||| you are still young ; you can not live alone in a house .
mwabaho mutae ? ||| and even if you did , what would you survive on ?
nta na famille mwasigaranye , ngo nibuze iba proteger [ ibarindae ] mu buzima bwanyu ? ||| you have no one left in your family that could maybe protect you in your life . @"
mukuru wanjye aramubwira ati @: "@ aho kugirango tugumae mu buzima turimo , tuba mu nzu yacu tushaka tukanapfiramo . @" ||| then my sister told him , "@ instead of continuing to live the way we are living , we 'd better live in a house alone . we do n't care if it means dying . @"
ubwo hari hari inzu z' interahamwe , interahamwe zari zirahunze . ||| by then there were interahamwe 's houses , which were empty ; the interahamwe had fled .
atuha inzu , amaze kutuha inzu , ||| he gave us a house .
turagenda tuyibamo . ||| then we started living in it .
ubwo yari muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] , nnjyae nsubira kuiga . mukuru wanjye we , ||| that was in 1995 , i went back to school but my sister was confused about what to do .
areba kusubira kuiga biramushobera , kubera ko ntabwo yari kuiga ngo nnjyae nigae . ||| we both went to school at the same time for as hort time .
ubwo hashize iminsi mike , muri mirongo cyenda na ... na gatandatu [ 1996 ] , mukuru wanjye , bourgmestre w' iwacu amuha akazi k' ubu percepteur . ||| later on in 1996 , the burgomaster got her a job as a taxe collector .
aragenda abona akazi , noneho nnjyae nbona ubushobozi bwo kukomeza kuiga . ||| so , when she started working , i was able to continue school .
muri mirongo cyenda na karindwi [ 1997 ] , nibwo ntangiye secondaire , njya muri secondaire , mukuru wanjye arakomeza arakora . ||| in year 1997 , i started secondary school and my sister continued working until the year 2000 .
arakora bigejeje muri 2000 , nri ndi muri quatrieme secondaire [ muwa kane w' amashuri yisumbuye ] ubwo mayor [ umuyobozi w' akarere , uhoze ari ‘ bourgmestre ’ ] wacu avaho . ||| i was in secondary four when our mayor was changed .
haza undi . noneho haje undi utatuzi , utazi ubuzima bwacu uko bumeze , ||| they brought another one who was not aware of our life conditions .
baba obliges [ biba ngombaw ] yuko abantu batafite diplome [ impamyabushobozi ] bava ku kazi . mukuru wanjye ava ku kazi . ||| they stopped all employees who did not have diplomas and my sister was among them .
ndi quatrieme [ mu mwaka wa kane ] . avuye ku kazi , ||| i was in secondary four when she left work .
noneho ubwongubwo kubera ko na farg [ ikigega kitera inkunga abacitse ku icumu rya jenoside ] yari imaze kuza , ||| fortunately , farg was founded .
farg [ ikigega ] ikazajya indihair , ariko mu kibazo cyo mu rugo ubuzima buratugora . ||| therefore they would pay for my school fees but as far as domestic needs were concerned , we got a lot of problems .
ariko icyo kihae ntabwo tubaga mu mugi wa kigali , ||| we were not living in kigali then .
tubaga i kitaarama ku isambu . ||| we were living in gitarama at the farm .
ibwo iyo sambu , kubera ko mukuru wanjye akikora , ntabwo sambu ntiiigeze yangirika , yashyiraagamo abantu bakayikora , ||| our farm was well treated since my sister was working ; she would employ people to work on it and we would live on its harvest .
ibivuyemo bikatutunga . akimara kuhagarara ku kazi , ubwo ibintu biri biri mu isambu nyine birakomeje biratutunga . noneho hashize iminsi , ||| at first when she had just left work , havests from the farm continued to feed us .
ngo haza itegeko rivuga ko umuntu wese , ||| after some time , there was a new policy that was put forward ; everyone had to give everything that did not belong to him or her .
azasubiza iby' abandi . ya nzu bayitukuramo . ||| therefore , we were asked to live the other house .
bamaze kuyitukuramo , ubuzima buratukomeraan . ||| when they took us out of that house , life became hard .
ubwongubwo niho tuhise tuumva isi ihagaze , ||| it was as though life had stopped .
ariko mukuru wanjye agerageza kuegera farg [ ikigega ... ] . yegereye farg , ubwo farg yumva yuko ikibazo cyacu kikomeye , ||| but my sister tried to contact farg and then farg considered our problem .
ikazajya ituha inkunga ya buri kwezi 20,000 frw @/@ mois [ ibihumbi makumyabiri ku kwezi ] . ||| and they would give us 20,000 frw per month .
ubwongubwo muri 2001 , aribwo nyine tubonaaga n' ayo mafranga ya farg , mukuru wanjye nawe ... ubwo nri ngeze muri cinquieme secondaire . ||| then in the year 2001 , which is when we used to get the funding of farg ... my sister too ... i was in secondary five .
abona ko [ mukuru wanjye ] ubuzima ... ubuzima bwe nawe , bumaze ku , buzapondekara [ buzaangirika ] , kubera ko nta kintu yari yigejejeho . ||| my sister realised that her life was also getting worse because she never had any documents [ diplomas or certificates ] .
kubera ko we intambara yabaye yiga deuxieme secondaire [ umwaka wa kabiri w' amshuri yisumbuye ] . ||| the war began when she was in secondary two .
ubwo aravuga ati @: "@ ugeze cinquieme secondaire [ mu wa gatanu wisumbuye ] , kandi urabona ko farg iduprotega [ iturwanaho ] ikatuha ticket n' ibikoresho , ||| then she told me , "@ you have reached in senior five and you can see that farg is helping us ; they provide us with school funds , transport and other school expenses .
none nnjyae ngiye kureba uburyo njya kuiga . ubwo nawe yahise ajya kushaka ishuri , nawe aragenda araiga . ||| it is a high time i also went back to school . @" immediately she started looking for a school and started studying as soon as she got one .
araiga farg [ ikigega ] irakomeza iratufasha , imaze kutufasha bigejeje muri 2002 , ubwo farg [ ikigega ] ituha inzu mu midugudu y' abana bibana hariya kimironko . ||| farg continued to help us until 2002 when they [ farg ] gave us a house in the kimironko residences , which were constructed for children who live on their own [ orphans ] .
imaze kutuha inzu tuyijyamo , ||| we started living in that house .
farg iba decentralise [ yegerezaw abaturage ] , kufasha abantu iba irabihagaritse . imaze kubihagarika , ||| later farg was decentralised and they stopped helping people .
ubwo jyewe nri nrangije kuiga ... imaze kubihagarika ubwo njyewe nri nrangije kuiga ... mbere yo kugirango nyine ihagarikae kutufasha , ubwo ngewe nri nrangije kuiga . ejo bunri , ||| when they did ... i had finished my studies before they stopped helping us .
nbona ikiraka muri ibuka , nrakikora , ubwo kiratutunga , na mukuru wanjye nawe abona ibikoresho byo kugirango ajyae ku ishuri . ||| then i got a temporary job in ibuka . i worked and the money was helpful . my sister was actually able to get some of the school material she needed .
ikiraka kirahagarara , kimaze kuhagarara ubuzima nabwo burahagarara . ||| then the job stopped and life stopped too .
ubwo ubuzima rero , ntinzi ... ntinkubwira ngo ubuzima bwacu bumeze gutya , ||| now i can not tell you hoe exactly life is , all i can say is life is really hard on us .
ubuzima bwacu burakomeye . wenda niba ugize ikibazo , ugerageza kukiihanganair , kuko nta wunri ukiereka . ||| when one has a problem , he or she tries to bear with it because there is no one to solve the problem for you .
ubu uwo mukuru wanjye nawe ageze nawe cinquieme secondaire [ muwa gatanu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] . ||| today my older sister is in senior five .
ariko ngize imaan nnjyae nrangije nbona diplome , ||| i was lucky to succeed and get a diploma .
ariko ubuzima bwacu kuri ubungubu ni ubuzima bugoraanye . ||| however life is currently very hard .
wenda ntinvuga ngo umuntu araiheba , ngerageza kwicalma [ kutuza ] . kugirango wenda ubonae imibereho , ||| well , i can not say that we are desperate ; we always try to be serene and look for a living .
ni uko uba ubonye nk' umuntu akakugirair impuhwe , cyangwa se akakuibuka . akavuga ati @: "@ uyu mwana ibyo aribyo byose reka mufashe muri ubu buryo . @" ||| sometimes we meet good samaritans who have pity on us or remember us and say , "@ i will help these kids in such and such a way . @"
iyo utamubonye nabwo , ubwo nyine urakomeza bwa buzima bubi bukakomeza bukakugendaho . ||| and when you do n't get such people , life still goes on though in such a misarable way .
ni uruzi rwa nyabarongo , ||| it was river nyabarongo .
ariko baraturohaanye jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ariko ntabwo twiburukiye hamwe . ||| we were drowned my sister and i. we did not come out together .
jyewe niburukiye hano kamuhanda , niburuka ino aha . we yiburukair hakurya y' uruzi hirya . aho yiburukaiye ni ahantu baita i nyagatovu , ||| i came out from this side of kamuhanda and she came out from across the river in a place called nyagatovu .
niho yiburukaiye . ||| that is where she came out .
ese yaba yarakubwiye uburyo yambutse , agaruka aho mwari muturutse ... aho mwahuriye nyine kugirango muongerae mubonaane ? ||| did she tell you how she crossed the river in order to go back to where you had come from ... i mean where you all saw each other again ?
yee , ||| yes she told me .
yarakomeje atambika hano ku muhanda w' i shyorongi , araza araongera agera hano ku kiraro kigabanya runda na taba , ||| she walked up to the road that goes to shyorongi and then continued up to the brigde that is between runda and taba .
aza kuri uwo mukecuru turi dufitanye ... wo mu ma famille [ wo mu muryango ] uri nyirasenge wa mama . ||| then she went to the house of the old lady whom we were related ; she was my mum 's aunt .
utubwiye abantu b' interahamwe bari bafunze , nka ba minani , yansoneye n' abandi . ||| you talked about some interahamwe who were prisoned , like minani , yansoneye and others .
nonese uba wibuka ... cyangwa uba uzi amaherezo yabo ? ||| do you remember ... or do you know what happened to them ?
kuko minani we ngirango yanakutemye ku kaguru . ||| because , i believe it is minani who cut your leg ...
umh ! ||| umh !
intambara ikirangira , uwo minani twaraa ... nyine tukiza tugiye kureba ku isambu ukuntu hameze , ||| after the war , we met the so called minani ... well , when we came back , we went to see our farm in the village .
tusanga minani arahari . ||| we found minani there .
akinbona we ubwoba buramuriye , araambaza , ||| when he saw me , he was filled with fear .
ati @: "@ ese muri wowe nrabizi nrakuhemukaiye , nrakutemye . ||| then he said to me , "@ i know i betrayed you , i hacked you .
mu kukutema numvaaga ntakeneye yuko ubaho . ||| and while doing so , i did not want you to live anymore .
none uraumva nkukorera iki ? @" ||| what can i do to make up for what i did to you ? @"
nramubwiye nti @: ku buzima buangae utarashakaaga yuko nbaho , hari amategeko azakuhana . ||| i just told him , "@ there are laws that will punish you for the fact that you never wanted to see me alive again . @"
tugiye kumurega ku karerae , baramufata baramufunga , ||| we went to report him at the district and he was arrested .
ariko yaguye mu munyururu . ||| he later on died in jail .
we na mushiki we bose barabafashe , mushiki we aracyari mu munyururu , ||| his sister too was arrested and she is still in prison .
we afungaiye i kitaarama , ||| she is in gitarama prison .
ariko minani we yarapfuye yaguye mu munyururu . ||| but minani died in prison .
izindi nterahamwe , zo hari n' ubwo usanga ari nazo zakuiciye ababyeyi , cyangwa abandi bavandimwe , ||| what about the other interahamwe ... you never know they may be the ones who killed your parents or your other relatives .
zo ibyabo biba biragenze kutae ? ||| do you know anything about them ?
kubera ko mu gitero kije iwacu bwa mbere , umuntu tubashije kumenyamo cyane ni karekezi . ||| in the group of attackers who first attacked our home , the person we managed to identify was karekezi .
ubwo niwe ugiye ajyana papa , ||| he is the one who took our father away .
kandi papa kuva yagenda ntabwo yagarutse . ||| and since our father left , he has never come back .
niba ariwe wamwishe , niba atari we kubera ko bari abantu benshi , ntabwo nbizi . ||| but i do n't know if he is the one who killed him or his companions because they were very many .
ariko kusa ni uko uwonguwo ari we nmenye mo , uwo baitaaga karekezi niwe nmenye mo kusa , amazina . ||| but he is the only one i knew in the whole group of attackers . he is called karekezi . he is the only one whose name i knew .
yaba akiriho se cyangwa ... ? ||| undefined
ntabwo nbizi ibyongibyo , ||| i do n't know about that .
niba abongabo nabo ... niba abongabo nabo abaemera yuko yabaishe . ||| i do n't know if he actually admits that he killed those people .
ariko we iyo umubajije aravuga ati @: "@ nishe abantu benshi . abo nishe ntinzi umubare wabo , kusa nzi ko nishe abantu benshi . @" ||| but when you try asking him , he says , "@ i killed a lot of people and i can not tell the exact number , all i know is that i killed so many people . @"
none se yaba yaraje kubasaba imbabazi ? ||| did he come to apologise to you ?
oya , ntabwo yaje . ||| no he 's never come .
none se tukaomoje kuri ibyo , wowe utekereza iki kuri gacaca ? ||| well , considering that , what do you think of the gacaca court ?
njyewe kuri gacaca ukuntu nyitekerezaho , abantu baishe , baishe babifitiye umugambi . umuntu rero njyewe aje inberae yanjye , ||| what i think about gacaca court ... people who killed had a goal in doing so .
aje kunsaba imbabazi kubera ko yishe , yaranyiciye . yishe abishaka kandi abikuye ku mutaima , ni uko ubutegetsi bumuhana bukurikije categorie [ urwego arimo ] y' ukuica kwe . ||| therefore , when someone comes to me asking for forgiveness because he killed people , my people ... they killed intentionally with all their hearts ... therefore , the law should punish them according their crimes .
hari ibintu bimwe biku ... hari ikintu kikunze kuvugaw cyane kijyanye n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . ||| there is something that is often talked about , something concerning unity and reconciliation .
ese wowe nk' umuntu ukiriwe nabi bingana gutya , na n' ubu ukaba ukibayeho mu ngaruka zibyo bintu bibaye . ||| to somebody like you who was hurt to that extent and who is still suffering the consequences of their deeds even today .
ubona bishoboka cyangwaa ... wowe ubibona kutae ? ||| do you find it possible ... or what is your point of view ?
njyewe ku ruharae rwanjye , kubera nk' uko nbuze abantu nkaba nsigaye iheruheru . njyewe umuntu unyiciye , ni uko yahabwa igihano nawe kimutoucha [ kimukoraho ] , ||| personally , as someone who lost everyone and is now living miserably , i believe those who killed should be strongly punished in a way that would affect them .
nawe akaumva yuko nawe yagize nabi . ||| so that they also feel how wrong what they did is .
kuko ntinvuga wenda ngo ... ngo nibamwice , ||| because i can not say that ... that they should kill them too .
si njyewe ubivuga yabibwiraw n' amategeko . ||| it 's not my place to say so , it is the role of the law , and i do n't have that right .
njyewe nta burengazira nbona , ariko jyewe ku bwanjye bamwica . ||| but personally i would suggest they kill them .
ariko ku burengazira bw' amategeko , bamuha igihano kijyanye n' icyaha yakoze . ||| but as far as the law is concerned , they should be given punishments according to the crimes they committed .
nonese ... eeh , ibyo aribyo byose iyo umuntu yanyuze mu bintu nk' ibyo unyuzemo , akaba abaho mu buzima nk' ubwo uriho , kubera nk' ibyo unyuzemo , ||| well , when a person experiences some things the way you did and then lives the way you are living due to his or her past , he or she gains some life experience .
aba afite umwihariko we . wowe nko kuba umuntu ucitse ku icumu wunva ari ikintu ... bivuze iki ? ||| therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ?
wunva ubisobanura kutae ... ? ||| could you explain about it ?
nk' umuntu ... nk' umuntu nkanjyae uhuye n' ikibazo , ||| as a person who ... someone like me who got several problems .
ukuntu numva jenoside . hari ukuntu utekereza nk' ubuzima ugiye unyuramo , ukagereranya n' ubwo uriho ubu , ukabona ntaho uvuye , ||| the way i understand the genocide ... there is a time you think about all the things you went through and try to compare it with the life you are leading now ; then you come to realise that there is no difference between your past and your present .
nta n' aho ugiye . iyo ubonye bimeze gutyo , wiha amahoro . ||| and when thing are like that , you just try to ignore it all .
kuko utaihaye amahoro , washiduka ugiye no mu muhanda usaze , kandi noneho ukanezeza babanri bakugiraiye nabi . ||| because if you can not find a way to ignore it , you might end up on the streets , crazy .
ariko iyo wihaye amahoro nta n' umenya icyo utekereza , kusa urabiihorera ukatuza , ukategereza ubundi buzima buri inberae , ||| this would only contribute to making happy your enemies . but when you try to be still and not let even a single person know what you are thinking about . you just have to calm down and think about the future .
ubu twe tuzi ibyashize ariko ntabwo tuzi ibiri inberae . ||| we only know the past ; we do n't know the future .
utegeza nyine ikiri inberae niba ari kiza se , cyangwa se niba ari kibi , ||| we can only wait for the future , if it happens to be good , fine ; if not too bad .
nyine mu buzima ukategereza ibindi biri inberae yawe . ||| in life it is important to wait for what 's ahead of us .
hari ikintu numva tuvugaho cyane cyane ku buryo bw' umwihariko . ||| there is something i would like us to talk about more specifically .
urabona wowe uri umuntu unyuze mu buzima bukomeye , kandi uciye mu ibintu byinshi . ||| you see you are a person who experienced tough times and you have seen a lot of things .
nonese ibyo aribyo byose ibyo uciyemo wabitewe no kubura ababyeyi n' ibyabayeho , ariko hari ubundi buzima ubayeho n' ubwo wenda uri umwana bwa mbere y' intambara . ||| however , all was as a result of the loos of your parents due to the war .
uba wibuka , cyangwa utubwira uti @: "@ jyewe numva mbere y' intambara nkurikije uko iwacu turi tumeze , ||| do you remember how things were before the war ? can u tell us about it ?
biri bimeze gutya ? ||| how were you living ?
utucira muri make ubuzima bw' iwanyu mbere y' intambara ? ||| would you please tell us about your life at home before the war ?
twebwe mbere y' intambara , twebwe turi abana batanu . muri abo bana batanu ni jyewe uri uwanyuma . ||| before the war , we were five children and i was the last @-@ born .
kandi nta kibazo mu rugo tugiraaga , kubera ko ari mama , ari na papa bose barakoraaga . ||| we never used to have problems at home because both mum and dad were working .
nta kibazo tugiraaga pe ! ||| for sure , we never had any problems .
wenda n' iyo no hanze habaaga n' ibibazo , twebwe nta kintu bibaga bitubwiye . kubera ko turi tufite abaturebair . ||| sometimes there would be problems out there but it would n't mean anything to us because there used to be people to look after us .
ariko intambara yararangiye , kubera ko jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ni ntawe turi abanyuma , abari batukuraiye bose baragiye . ||| but after the war ... my sister and i ... yet we were the youngest ; all our elders were gone .
intambara rero irangiye ... intambara irangiye , nibuze nta na famille [ umuryango ] nimawe igaragara , yaba yarasigaye , ||| even though the war stopped , not any family member was left .
ku buryo tuyibwira ikibazo . ||| maybe we could be telling them about our problems .
famille [ umuryango ] na yitwa ngo yarasigaye , ni za familles [ ya miryango ] nazo ziriho zitabashije . ||| those who survived only are those who can neither support themselves .
ubwo rero kugirango ubuzima uri urimo mbere , ubu comparer [ ubugereranyae ] n' ubw' ubungubu , ||| therefore , if we compare this life with life before the war , there is a very big difference .
ubona harimo difference [ butandukanye ] . kuko ubungubu nshobora kugira ikibazo , ntingirae uwo nkibwira . ||| because nowadays i may be having a problem but i can n't find anyone to tell it about .
mbese ubu nshobora kumara n' iminsi ibiri ntari nrya , ariko mbere y' intambara nta n' umunsi ... nta n' isa ... igihe cyose numvaaga nkeneye kurya nraryaaga . ||| for example , i can spend two days without eating , yet before the war , i had never spent even a single day or an hour ... every time i would feel like eating , i would eat .
ariko ubungubu nshobora no kumara n' iminsi itatu , kandi nkaceceka . ||| but now i can even spend three days and remain silent .
kubera ko nba nbuze uwo ntura ikibazo . ||| because there is no one i can share my problem with .
ubuzima bwa nyuma y' intambara , ni complique [ buragoye ] cyane . nta n' icya kane , cya mbere y' intambara . ||| life after the war is very complicated . mathematically , i would say it is not even a quarter of the life i was leading before the war .
undi muntu numva ukomeye cyane muri iki kihae nyuma y' intambara , cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe , ni mukuru wawe . ||| i noticed that the most special person in your life after the war is your sister .
nonese utubwira iki kuri mukuru wawe , angana iki ? ubona afite imigambi imeze kutae ? ||| what can you tell us about your sister ; how old is she and what are her plans ?
ubundi mukuru wanjye nawe , ni umwana ... si umwana cyane yavutse muri 1981 . ||| although she is not too young , my sister is also young ; she was born in 1981 .
ariko ubuzima bwe nawe ni hatari . ||| but her life is also horrible .
kuko aho yari ageze , yari kuba ari umuntu wenda nawe ugize icyo yimarair . ||| at this time she should have been able to do something with herself .
ariko kubera ko yabuze umuntu umusunika ngo yigirae igihe , amashuri ye ayarangizae . ubuzima bwe bubaye nkubusubira inyuma . ||| but because she did not have anyone to push her so that she studies on time and complete her studies , her life seems to have declined instead .
kubera ko we yabonye ko ansigaraanye kandi ndi umwana kuri we , abura ikintu yankorera , ava mu ishuri , kugirango wenda nbonae uko nkuiga . ||| when she realised that it was just the two of us who survived and yet she was the oldest , she had no other alternative but to leave school so that i would go to school .
we yasubiye ku ishuri ari uko farg [ ikigega ] ije . kandi asubira ku ishuri ari uko farg [ ikigega ] yemeye kuzajya itufasha buri kwezi . ||| she went back to school after farg was founded ; that is after farg had agreed to help us monthly .
ibyo byose bitari biba farg [ ikigega ] itaraza , we yemeye kunvunikira , kugirango mbe njya ejuru . ||| but before farg came , she had sacrificed herself so that i also get to some grade .
kugeza na n' ubu ntabwo amashuri ye arayarangiza , ||| up to now , she has n't completed her studies .
kandi intera ye ntabwo imwemereye kuba yaba akaiga secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] , ||| normally at her age , she is not supposed to be in secondary school but that is where she is now ; she is in senior five at the moment .
ariko ubu ari muri cinquieme secondaire [ muwa gatanu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] . kandi n' iyo ageze mu rugo , asanga ibibazo ari byinshi , ||| and whenever she comes back home [ from boarding school ] , she finds several problems .
wenda nkanjyae yaba yarasize ... uba urasigaye inyuma , nta kintu mumaraiye . ndi gutya nnjyae , nta kazi ngira nta ki ... nta n' undi muntu wunri ngira umproteja [ unrwanaho ] wenda ngo nnjyae ngirae ikintu nba nmumarair . ||| and me who remained behind , she finds there is nothing i improved because i have no job , no one to protect me , so that i also can help her .
ava ku ishuri nabwo , akaza akasubira muri bwa buzima bubi , yari arimo mbere . ||| she comes from school and goes back into the miserable life that she left behind .
nta butumaw uha nk' imfubyi za jenoside ? ||| is there any message you could give genocide orphans ?
cyane cyane ari imfubyi zirair , ari n' imfubyi zirairw . ||| especially those that take care of themselves or even to those that are looked after .
kuko ... cyane cyane abana , abakiri batoya . kuko biragaragara ko bagombye kugira uburyo bakuitwara . ||| those young kids should have a way they should behave ...
njyewe nk' inama nbaha , ni uko ubuzima bwose banyuzemo , n' ubwo bakirimo ubu , bashobora kubwitwaramo neza . ||| the piece of advice i would give them is , "@ never long for luxuries because they can turn out to be so dangerous . @"
ikintu cyose babonye , n' icyo batabonye bakaumva ko kibanyuze . ||| if they can appreciate who they are , be it those who are in families or those who are looking after themselves ... it is possible to live in a family and yet live in torture .
ntibagirae irari . ||| if you are not too patient to live with them , is when people start saying you are a spoiled child .
kuko bagize irari bibavairmo n' ibindi bibi . ariko banyuzwe n' uko bari , yaba bari muma familles [ mu miryango ] cyangwa se baba abirera ... burya hariho n' ukuntu uba muri famille [ mu muryango ] aho kugirango ubaeho neza , ahubwo ya famille [ wa muryango ] ikagutesa . ||| and after misbehaving , she or he may suffer the consequences such sicknesses .
iyo utaihanganye rero ngo ubanae nabo , nibwo ujya kaumva ukaumva ngo umwana kanaka yararutse . ukasanga muri kwa kuraruka kwe akuyemo consequences [ ingaruka ] z' indwara , icyo namukonseya [ inama nmugira ] ho ni uko ikintu cyose kiba kiza , ||| therefore , all i can advise them is to look at everything before them positively ; be it good or bad .
kiba kibi inberae ye ashobora kukifata nk' ikiza . kugirango mu buzima bwe buri inberae , ubuzima bwe buzashoborae gufonctiona [ kugenda ] neza . ||| it will all contribute in building a better future .
eeh , urabona iyi cassette izarebaw n' abantu benshi , ||| you know this tape is going to be watched by many people .
izarebaw n' abana bawe n' abuzukuru kuko ni ikintu kizabikwa . nonese nta zinri ... mu kirunri ho bazaita impanuro . ||| your own kids or even grandchildren might one day watch it because it is going to be well kept .
inama cyangwa se ubutumwa utanga kuri iyi cassette yawe ? ||| do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ?
icyo ushaka kuvuga icyo aricyo cyose ku banyarwanda bose , ku bacitse ku icumu muri rusangae . ||| anything you may need to talk about to rwandans at large or survivors in general .
ushobora kugira icyo uvuga . ||| you can say anything ...
jyewe ikintu ngira nk' inama abantu bacitse ku icumu , ni uko tuvugae nk' abantu bakoze jenoside , bakayikorera nk' umuntu . yego ugerageza uburyo bwose bubaho kugirango muvuganae , ||| the advice i can give to the genocide survivors ... let 's talk about the genocide perpetrators ... well , we try our best to talk to them but however much you may try to talk to them , their hearts seems no to be at ease [ ubnormal ] .
ariko niyo mwavuga , muvugana nawe umutima wawe utari normal [ utasanzwe ] . kuko nta untu umuntu yaba yarakuiciye ababyeyi , ngo akuicirae famille [ umuryango ] usigarae umeze nk' igiti , ||| there is no way one can kill your parents , kill you entire family and you remain like a tree [ indifferent ] , and then expect to talk to him or her nicely .
wa muntu uzamuvugaishe neza . uramuvugaish ariko umutima wawe uba wunva ari ibuye . ||| well you talk to him or her but your heart feels like a stone .
yego ... ... njyewe inama ngira nk' umuntu ucitse ku icumu , ni uko atakomeza ngo yikorerae umutwaro , ||| the advice i would give the genocide survivors is ... they should n't always carry that burden .
akomezae avunikae hejuru y' abantu bamwiciye , ||| they should n't let themselves be stressed by the killers .
ahubwo yagerageza ibyo bintu akabiikuramo , akaongera umutima we ukaba mushyashya . umutima w' ibuye nyine , wunva yuko abantu bamugiraiye nabi , ||| instead they should try and ignore those feelings and kind of renew their hearts , i mean they should have a heart of stone .
akagerageza kuwikuramo , ||| they should try to ignore what happened to them .
ndetse akagerageza akanabegera nawe , akaumva igitekerezo kibavamo . ||| in fact they should try to talk to those who hurt them and listen to their opinion .
kuko burya iyo umuntu yakugiraiye nabi akabona utamufitiye uburakari , ahubwo akabona umwegera ugerageza kumuvugaish , nawe ntabwo yishima , ahubwo ubwoba niho bumwica . ||| i believe when someone hurts you and do not react with anger and you talk to them instead , the person will never be at peace , they will always fear you .
njyae niyo nama ngira abacitse ku icumu . ||| that 's my advice .
nk' abana bato ? ||| what about children ?
abana bato bo , ntabwo ... njyewe inama ngira nk' abana batoya nbaumvaish yuko , intambara n' ubwo yabaye , ariko inberae hari ubundi buzima bushyashya . ||| well , concerning children , i can not ... the advice i can give them is , though there was a war , the future will make life new .
kuko nk' umutwe w' umwana umushyizemo ngo intambara yarabaye , ukagenda umushyiramo ibintu bibi , we yakura nta n' ikiza azi . yakura yumva ko mu mutawe we , ||| because if you tell them the history of the war , or tell them those bad stories , they may grow up without enjoying anything in life .
inberae ye , inyumae ye , ibyamubayeho bizaba prolonge [ bizakomeza gutyo ] . ariko nmugira inama y' uko ibintu byose bibaye , ||| they may mature up with a belief that what will happen in the future will be the continuation of what happened in the past .
bizagira iherezo , ||| therefore , i would reassure them that what happened will end .
inberae ye hari ubundi buzima bwiza butameze nk' ubwo yanyuzemo . ||| the future will be very good , unlike what they went through in the past .
ni iyo ngira abana batoya ||| that is the advice i would give children .
ukurikije noneho n' ikibazo cy' ukuntu amahanga uzi yaba yaritwaye ku bibaye mu rwanda ... kuri jenoside yabaye mu rwanda , yo wunva nta kintu uyabwira ? ||| considering the problem of foreign countries that deny that there was genocide in rwanda , do n't you have any message to give them ?
amahanga ? ||| foreign countries ?
ni uko akenshi amahanga yumva yuko nta jenoside yabaye mu rwanda . ||| the problem is foreign countries believe that there was n't genocide in rwanda .
kaereka ahari nbonye ... nk' umuyobozi w' igihugu runaka utajya wemera ko hari jenoside yabaye mu rwanda . ||| unless i get ... a leader from a particular country that denies that there was genocide in rwanda .
nkamwumvisha uburyo jenoside yabaye mu rwanda , ||| then i would convince him or her that genocide did take place in rwanda .
biba ngombaw nkamwereka n' ahantu hagiye hagwa inzirakarengane , bashyinguwe , ||| and if necessary , i would take him or her to those places where they exhumed and reburried those innocent people who died .
ayo magufwa yabo akagerageza kuyabona . ndetse umuntu akajya amwereka n' abantu bamugaye ku buryo bwa jenoside . akagera aho ... ubwo yumva ko jenoside yabayeho mu rwanda . ||| i would make sure he or she gets to see those remains of people and show him or her all those who were handicaped due to the genocide until when he or she ... understands that genocide actually took place in rwanda .
kuko amahanga menshi , ntabwo ajya yiumvaish uburyo umuntu yafashe umuhoro akatema undi . ||| because most countries can not imagine how someone can hold a machete and hack his or her equal .
nonese wowe wunva mu buzima bwawe buri inberae uteganya iki ? ||| what do you plan for your future ?
ufite iyihe gahunda mu buzima bwawe ? ||| what is your plan for the future ?
njyewe ubuzima bwanjye uko nbuteganya , nubwo nbayeho nabi mu buzima bushize , ariko njya ngira ikaizerae yuko uko biri atari ko bizahora . ||| what i plan for life , though i experienced a bad life in the past , i still have hope that things will change .
numva ko hari igihe ibingibi nrimo binyahaza , ibibazo iki ... kutagira uwo nbwira ... yego n' ubundi nzarinda npfa ntawe nbonye nbwira ikibazo , ariko burya umuntu yibuka ikibazo cyane iyo ahuye n' ubuzima bubi . ||| i believe that all this that brings me down , problems ... living wthout someone to confide in ... yes i know i will die without ever getting someone to tell my problems but remember , we only remember our problems when we get into hardships .
ugerageje rero ukabona ubuzima bubi ubuvuyemo n' ibibazo rero hari igihe bigenda bigabanuka nabyo ukabiibagirwa . yego ntibigenda burundu , ||| therefore , if one tries to get ride of hardships , slowly by slowly the problems will also reduce and finally one will forget about them .
ariko hari ikintu kivungukaho , kubyo uba urahuye nabyo . ||| i know you can never completely forget but the burden is lighter .
kandi njyae mu kaizerae cyanjye nfite nziko avenir [ ejo hazaza ] yanjye izaba nziza . ||| and i believe my future will be very nice .
nta kinri kintu ukaongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe ? ||| do you have any additional messageto add to your testimony ?
jyewe nitwa ruyenzi olivier , mwene karasair venuste , na mukakarangaw speciose . ||| my name is olivier ruyenzi , son of venuste karasira and of speciose mukakarangwa .
nvutse muri 1984 . ||| i was born in 1984 .
habyarimana amaze kupfa , nibwo ... hashize iminsi ibiri tugiye muri eto . ||| after habyarimana 's death is when ... two days later is when we went to eto school .
tugezeyo tuhasanze minuar [ ingabo z' umuryango w' abibumbye ] ... icyo kihae niho yari iri . ||| we found the unamir soldiers there .
noneho tugezeyo ... ubwo mu kugenda tugiye mu ma saa saba z' amanywa . mu kugenda tugezeyo , turi tufite umukozi agaruka mu rugo ; aje nibwo yatubwiye ko bamaze kuhatwika mu rugo . ||| we went there at around 1 p.m. when we got there , our houseboy went back home and when he got back , he told us our house had already been burnt .
ubwo tukomeje kuba muri eto , abenshi muri ino quartier ya kicukiro ... aho tubaga nyine . ||| we continued living at eto , many of the people from kicukiro , the neighbourhood where we lived .
nibwo baje muri eto ahongaho bari baizeye ko bashobora kurokoka , ||| people came to eto hoping that they 'd survive .
noneho ubwo hashize iminsi ... le 11 mata [ 11 /04 /1994 ] nibwo minuar [ ingabo z' umuryango w' abibumbye ] yafashe ... bavuga itangazo rivuye muri onu rivuga yuko bagomba kutaha . ||| a few days later , on april 11th , 1994 is when the unamir soldiers made an announcement from the un saying that they needed to leave .
icyo kihae batahanye abazungu n' ababikira bakoraaga ahongaho kigo cy' ababikira , ||| they left with all the white people and the catholic nuns who were working in a convent that was there .
baraambuka baragenda . ariko mbere y' uko bagenda barabitubwira bati @: "@ bagiye kugenda . @" turabimenya . ||| but before they left , they told us that they were leaving ; so we were aware if that fact .
noneho ubwo bamwe batangira kushakisha ukuntu bajyana nabo biranga . ||| some tried looking for ways to leave with them but it did n't work out .
interahamwe ubwo zari ziri kuri cloture hirya no hino ku kigo cya de bosco ... kuri eto . maze bamaze kugenda , nibwo bahise bainjira muri eto , ||| the interahamwes were around the fence of don bosco high school at eto , surrounding it .
bamwe batangira kubica , igikundi kimwe kiragenda kishaka kujya stade amahoro , mu nzira tugeze ... ubwo bapfairiye muri eto biraumvikana , ||| they got in as soon as the unamir left and started killing . a group tried escaping towards amahoro stadium but you understand that some were killed at eto .
abandi bagenda basa nk' abagiye kuri stade amahoro . tugeze muri za quartier za kicukiro hepfo ... tugeze kuri ‘ sonatubes ’ [ ahantu ku kicukiro hitairiyew uruganda ] bagendaaga bica bamwe mu nzira gutyo ... tugeze kuri ‘ sonatubes ’ tujya hamwe , hari abajepe n' interahamwe nkeya tujya ... batwicaza hasi . ||| as we were heading towards amahoro stadium , some were killed on the way , in the kicukiro neighbourhood ... when we got to ‘ sonatubes ’ , there were some gps [ the presidential guard ] and a few interahamwes , they gathered us all in one place and got us to sit down .
kubyo numvise bari bamaze kuvuga ko inkotanyi zirimo kutureba ahongaho turi turi kuri sonatubes . ariko nta bunri buryo bari bafite bwo kutugeraho . tumaze kugera ahongaho bareba icyo batukorera barakibura . ||| we heard that the inkotanyis were seeing us there at ‘ sonatubes ’ but did n't have any means of getting to us .
ubwo bahita batubwira bati @: "@ ni ukukomeza umuhanda tukajya i nyanza . @" ||| as we were there , they could n't figure out what to do with us and that 's when they told us to continue walking towards nyanza .
turagenda inberae hajya abasirikare tujya hagati n' abandi i nyuma , a cote impande zombi a gauche a droite [ iburyo n' ibumoso ] hari hari interahamwe . ||| we left , some soldiers were walking ahead of us and some behind us and we were in the middle .
tukomeza tout droit [ inberae yacu ] umuhanda ujya i nyanza abananiwe bapfa , gutyo gutyo . ||| we walked straight towards nyanza , those who were tired died on the way .
uhuye n' umuntu akasanga akuzi niba atashaka ko umucika ubwo arakusigaraan ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| if somebody recognized you and did n't want you to escape him , he 'd take you with him ... and so on .
noneho tugeze i nyanza tuhasanga bariyeri , hari hari interahamwe , baravuga bati @: "@ nta hanri tubashyira . @" ||| we found a roadblock with interahamwes at nyanza and they decided that 's where they should put us , given that it had been decided that kigali city should be kept clean and that they should stop killing people on the streets .
kubera ko bari bavuze ko bagomba kukora isuku mu mujyi wa kigali , nta kuicira ku mihanda . ariko ubwo ngubwo bahita batubwira ... buri bumaze no kwira harimo no kugwa imvura , batwishaza hasi , ||| it was dark and it was raining ; they got us to sit down and started throwing grenades at us , people were falling all over .
abasirikare bajya hejuru , batangira kutera grenade abantu barahaihitaan bagwa hasi ahongaho grenade imwe [ eclat ] infata mu mutawe uraumva ko nsaga nk' aho nshitse intege . ||| a fragment hit my head and i felt very weak .
noneho abandi grenade zirashira , bararasa birashira nabyo ; ||| when they got a shortage of grenades , they started shooting until bullets got finished as well .
noneho babwira interahamwe zari ziri aho ngo bainjirae batangirae kureba abakihumeka noneho ubwo mu kugenda ... ||| they then told the interahamwes who were there to get in there and look for the people who were still breathing ...
grenade bayikuteye hehe ? ||| where did the grenade hit you ?
mu mutawe [ yerekana hejuru y' ugutwi ] ||| on the head [ he shows above the ear . ]
noneho ubwo batangiye kutera ... nako grenade zishize n' amasasu , interahamwe ziraza zitangira kuica bamwe bari bakihumeka . ||| they started throwing grenades ... i mean , after the grenades and bullets got finished , the interahamwes started killing those who were still breathing .
ariko ubwongubwo uraumva ababyeyi banjye , barumuna na bashiki banjye , turi tusa nk' aho tutandukanye . ||| by then , i was no longer with my parents , brothers and sisters .
ariko njyewe nri ndi kumwe na mama icyo kihae . ||| but i was still with mother then .
baje ubwo jyewe nri ndi n' umwana cyane , ariko rero akaza anbwira ngo nsheceke ibintu nk' ibyo ... kuko nri nrimo kumusakuriza . ||| i was still very young and she kept urging me to remain silent .
arimo kunbwira ngo nsheceke , interahamwe ihita iza , yumva ko akirimo akuka . ||| an interahamwe came and realized she was still breathing .
ihita imukubita inyundo nyinshi mu mugongo , kandi yari atwite ntabwo yahise apfa ariko yarababaye mbese . ||| he hit her on the back with a hammer and she was pregnant ! she was in a lot of pain but she did n't die right away .
ubwo nnjyae imwe isa nk' aho inkubita ikibatira cy' umuhoro , ariko ntacyo ... umuhoro ntabwo uri ... kuri eclat ntacyo njyewe numvaaga icyo kihae . ||| another one came and hot me with the side of a machete but it was n't very painful compared to the pain caused by the fragment of grenades .
bukeye hari mu ijoro icyo kihae ... ibyakurikiyeho simbyibuka , ariko rero ngo icyo kihae papa ntacyo yari yabaye . ||| the following day ... all this happened at night and i can not recall exactly what happened next but i was told that dad had n't been injured !
aratufata ... aratushakisha areba aho turi turi , aratufata atujyana atugeza hafi y' irebero ; ||| so he looked for us and took us not far from rebero where the inkotanyis were .
inkotanyi zari ziri ... bucyeye inkotanyi zahise zitugeraho . ||| the inkotanyis found us the next day .
noneho nibwo abandi baje ... mu kugenda tujya cnd tugiye muri daihatsu , harimo abantu benshi bakomeretse . ||| others came ... we left for cnd in a daihatsu full of casualties .
ariko rero bagenda basa nk' abarasa iyo daihatsu kuko turi tugiye tukikijwe n' inkotanyi hirya no hino . ||| they kept on shooting at it as it was surrounded by inkotanyis .
tugeze aho ku gishushu [ cnd ] abakomeretse cyane bajya muri cnd mo inberae hari abaganga babaitaho , ||| when we got there , the casualties were taken inside where some doctors took care of them .
hamaze iminsi igera nko kuri itatu ubwo n' abandi bahise baza barimo batunda bazana n' abatakomeretse baza ahongaho , ||| more people came to seek refuge there , the ones who had not been injured brought themselves .
kuko ahongaho barimo kuhatera amabombe menshi cyane . ||| many bombs were being thrown there .
noneho tuguma ahongaho 3jours [ iminsi itatu ] ishize nimugoroba nka saa kumi n' ebyiri baravuga bati ... kuva saa cyenda nibwo abatari bakomeretse bahise batangira kujya i byumba , ||| three days later , at around 6 o'clock in the evening , they decided we should ... the non @-@ injured had started walking towards byumba at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon .
bagenda n' amaguru . ubwo umuhanda uri muzima , abatakomeretse bagenda n' amaguru , abakomeretse bagenda n' imodoka . ||| the roads were safe , the non @-@ injured went by foot and the casualties were driven there .
muri uko kugenda papa bakaba bari bamurashe ukuboko , we ntabwo turi turi ... nta n' ubwo nri nzi n' aho ari , ||| by the time we were leaving , i did n't know where dad was . he 'd been shot at the hand .
sauf [ uretse ] njyewe na mama nitwae turi turi kumwe . ||| i only was with mother .
noneho abandi barumuna banjye na bashiki banjye ntituri tuzi uburyo bariho icyo kihae . ||| we did n't know in what conditions my younger brothers and sisters were at that time .
noneho tugeze ku irebero ... nibwo tuhise tuhura na papa mu bitaro by' ibyumba , hafi ya eglise catholique [ kiliziya katurika ] nibwo tuhise tumubona . turamubona turamubaza tuti @: ||| when we got to rebero ... that 's when we met with dad at the byumba hospital , near the catholic church .
"@ se bashiki banjye bari he ? @" ntabyo yari azi icyo kihae biraumvikana . ||| neither did he know where my sisters were which is very understandable .
noneho ... ariko tukihagera tuhise tubona undi mushiki wanjye muto uri ufite imyaka ibiri , ||| then ... but soon after we got there , we saw one of my sisters who was 2 years old then .
icyo kihae we yari muto . nibwo we tusanze icyo kihae bari baramukubise inyundo mu mutawe noneho arangije tusanga yari kumwe n' abaturanyi . ||| she had been hit with a club on the head and she was with some of our nieghbours .
hashize iminsi kuko hari hari i camp y' abasirikare ahongaho i byumba , nibo batugemuriraaga aho mu bitaro . ||| there was a military camp nearby and the soldiers used to bring us food at the hospital .
mama kuko yari atwite , yari ameze nabi biraumvikana , papa biba ngombaw ko bamubaga kuko akaboko kari kagiye kucika kandi ... hari abaganga b' abazungu . ||| mother was in a very bad shape as she was pregnant and dad 's hand was almost being cut off .
kuko yari yarize azi icyongereza akabenforma [ abamenyaish ] ababwira yuko we atashaka ko bamuca ukuboko . ||| there were some white doctors and he told them he did n't want it to be cut off . he could speak english as he had gone to school .
ariko kuko nta kunri biri kugenda barakuca . kandi bavuraaga mu buryo bwihuse bashaka kuvura abantu benshi . ||| but there was nothing else they could do and they ended up cutting it off . they were treating people very fast as there were so many casualties .
barakuca ukuboko kw' iburyo , noneho tusanga barangije kukuca . icyo kihae nibwo tuhise tubona y' uko busa nk' aho ubuzima bugiye kukomera noneho , abandi bana tutazi aho bari n' iki .... hashize iminsi haza abazungu turi turi kumwe n' abandi bana tuva muri quartier zimawe bashaka kuzajyana muri italie . ||| so when we found out that his right hand had been cut off and we did n't know where all my siblings were , we started seeing how hard life was becoming ... a few days later came some white people , we were with other kids from our neighbourhood and they wanted to take us to italy .
kubera ko icyo kihae abo bana bari bakomeretse kurusha abandi barabajyana . ||| since those kids were the most injured , they took them first .
hashize iminsi ... tumaze iminsi noneho twebwe papa atangiye kaoroherwa , kubyarair aho ngaho biri bikomeye tushaka uburyo tujya muri ouganda . ||| a few days later ... as dad was getting better , we thought of going to uganda as giving birth in those conditions was going to be too hard for mom .
turabubonye ubwo buryo , turagenda tugezeyo turi tufite famille yo turagenda tugezeyo baratuakira . ||| we left for uganda and when we got there , some relatives of ours who lived there welcomed us .
hashize iminsi barabyara umwana w' umuhungu ; ||| a baby boy was born a few days later .
ubwo intambara yari imaze kusa nk' irangira we abanza kujya mu rwanda kureba uko situation ... agezeyo aragaruka aratubwira ati @: "@ nta kunri inzu barayishenye . @" ||| the war had ended by then , dad went back to rwanda to check how things were and he came back and told us the house had been destroyed .
ubwo turi tufite inzu y' abaturanyi bari babaishe , ariko rero turi ... tusa nk' aho tusangiye byose . ||| we had some neighbours with whom we shared everything who had been killed but their house was still there .
tuva ahongaho tuhita tuza tuva ouganda tuza mu rwanda , njyewe nawe twenyine . mama n' umwana ... n' uwo mwana wunri bari barakubise inyundo w' umukobwa muto barasigaraan , barahasigara . ||| him and i came back to rwanda but mother , the newly born baby and the child who had been hit by a club remained behind .
tugezeyo nabo turabahamagara ngo bazazae , baje tuhita tubonaan . icyo kihae nibwo tuhise tuba mu buzima ubwo ngubwo busanzwe . muri ubwo buzima buri busa nk' aho bukomeye barasaan , ||| they later on joined us there and we went back to living a normal life although they were still shooting here and there .
hashize igihe tuhita tujya mu nzu noneho yacu . ||| after sometime , we moved back to our own house .
hashize iminsi kuko turi tusanzwe tuziraanye n' aba infirmiere [ abaforomo kazi ] bo kuri centre de sante yo ku kicukiro , ||| we were living near the kicukiro health centre and we knew the nurses there .
haza umuzungu w' umunya italie , ufite nationalite y' abataliyani turamenyaan . ||| they introduced to us some italian doctor .

mubo bafite icyo bapfaan nibwo tuhise tumenya ko nta wunri usigaye tuhita tutangira kuba mu buzima busanzwe . ||| no one of her relatives survived ... so life went on ...
kuzamura idarapo mu gitondo , mukahagarara mukategereza ko barizamura , mukabona kugenda kukora activites [ imirimo ] zanyu . noneho ariko icyo kihae niho yagiraaga ubuzima busaga nk' aho bumugora , ||| the flag used to go up every morning and everyone would stend still until it reaches up and then go about their activities .

mbere igihe cy' amashyaka bwo ubonaaga bimeze bite ? ||| how was it at the time of multiparty system ?
mbere y' amashyaka ... nako nyuma batangiye kuzamura cdr , mrnd , mdr pawa ibintu nk' ibyo ... noneho cyane cyane bitangiye baje [ inkotanyi ] muri cnd ... ||| before the multiparty system ... i mean after , when the cdr , mrnd , mdr power propaganda started ... it started mostly when the inkotanyis came to cnd ...
icyo kihae bigenze kutae ? ||| how was it ?
batangiye kutera mu nzu , baza gusaka buri munsi , mu cyumweru bakaza nka kabiri . nibwo tutangiye kugira ubwoba . kandi ubona ukuntu bameze ubona ko ... babanzaaga kubicaza muri salon gutya ... bakaza bagasaka bakabona nta kintu kihari bakaongera bakagenda . ||| they first attacked the house , they come and search for things , they 'd come about twice a weeks ... that 's when we started fearing ... they were ... they 'd get everyone to sit down in the sitting room ... they 'd come , search around and go back , having found nothing .

wigeze kunbwira ko mama wawe hari eclat za grenade zamufashe , nta ngaruka bijya bimugiraho ? ||| you told me your mom was hit by grenades ' fragments ... does she suffer any consequences today ?
abenshi ni abantu babaga baziraanye . ||| abari bari mu kigero cyo ubu turimo nibo babaga babasigaranye akenshi . most of people knew each other then .
amazina yo ntinkubwira ngo n' aba kuko ntabwo nbaibuka . amasura ubaga uyazi ariko amazina ... kuko ni abantu bo muri quartier [ mu ako kacae ] mwabaga muziraanye . ||| i can not recall their names but they looked familiar although we did n't know everyone 's name ... they were people who lived in the same neighbourhood as us and so we knew each other .
baba bakuruta kandi turi abana tukina umupira abana ku bana abasore kuri twebwe ... abari bari mu kigero cyo ubu turimo nibo babaga babasigaraanye akenshi . ||| we even used to play football together despite the fact that they were older than us . the ones who had our age today were the ones to ...

ntinumvaaga ko hari umuntu bashobora kufata bakamwica . ||| i am not saying that they used to just kill people but as time went , we saw things getting worse ; you could pass by somewhere and witness somebody being taken away to be killed in the open .
usibye ko mu kugenda tubonaaga ko noneho ibintu bigenda bikomera . kuko ucaaga nk' ahantu ukabona baramusigaraanye baramwishe , ureba vis a vis [ imbonankubone ] noneho ukasanga ... birengaaga umutima , ||| so it was ... it was beyond what one could handle , you 'd reach a point where you 'd become insensible to what was going on .
noneho umuntu akamera nk' igiti . kuvuga bikakunanira noneho ukamera nk' aho utakiri umuntu . ||| i t was so much that it was as though one had stopped being human .
ibikomere byanyu bije kukira kutae ? ||| how did your wounds come to heal ?
tubivuraije i byumba , ariko ntabwo bihise bikira kuko hazaagamo infection . ||| we were treated in byumba but they did n't heal right away as they were infected .
ariko hashize ntangiye ... intambara yabaye niga deuxieme [ muwa kabiri ] , ||| but after some ... when i was in ... the war started when i was in primary ii and when i was in primary iv is when those italians took me to italy twice for a check up .
ariko ntangiye quatrieme [ uwa kane ] nibwo abo bazungu twanye muri italie deux fois [ inshuro ebyiri ] bakora controle [ igenzura ] bwa mbere turagiye barambaaga nsa n' uwakize tusubirayo kukora controle [ igenzura ] nibwo bisa nk' aho bikize . ||| the first time i went , i was operated and then when i went back they did a check up .
icyo kihae ariko igufa hafi y' ubwonko ryari rirafashwae na eclat ya grenade barivanamo ... bahita barivanamo baravuga bati @: "@ ubwo nkiri umwana bishobora kusubiraan neza . @" ||| a bone near the brain had been affected by a fragment and they removed it and said it would get back into place as i was still growing up .

abo bazungu ni bantu ki ? ||| who are those white people ?
bazaaga mu ruhae rwego ? ||| what were they here for exactly ?
bo bazaaga ... ni aba docteur ubundi bazaaga baje kufasha ... umwe ni umupadiri , ||| they are doctors who had come here to help out .
abandi ni abadocteur bazaaga baje kureba centre de sante ya kicukiro . baje kusura aho ngaho nyine , no kureba ibyabaye mu rwanda bakabimenya ku buryo bw' invaho . ||| one of them is a priest and the rest are doctors who had come to visit the kicukiro health centre and to see what had happened in rwanda and know more details about it .
ubuzima bw' i byumba buri bumeze kutae ? ||| how was byumba ?
ubuzima bw' i byumba busaga nk' aho ... ni nk' uko turi tutangiye ubuzima bushyashya . ||| life in byumba was like ... it was like starting in a new life .
usibye kubabara , kubona abantu bamwe barira , abandi bakapfair mu bitaro kubera ibikomere , ||| apart from the pain , from seeing some people crying , others dying due to the wounds .
ubundi busaga nk' aho tutangiye ubundi buzima butaumva amasasu , butaumva iki ... induru ... buri ubuzima busa nk' aho tugiye kutangira ubuzima busanzwe . ||| it was a new life after the shootings , bombings , screaming ... it was like going back to a normal life .
wabutugereranyiriza utae n' ubuzima bwa mbere ya jenoside ? ||| how do you compare it to life before genocide ?
kusa ngo yahungaanye n' abandi abo banri ntitushoboye kubamenya tutanga n' amatangazo atandukanye , ariko ntabwo tushoboye kubamenya . ||| he fled with other people but we do n't know who they were , we even tried finding out who they were but we never found out .
n' uwo usigaye kwa marraine we umukobwa we ... nawe ntabwo yamenye uko bigenze . we yatubwiye kusa ko babonye bagiye , aca aha n' undi aca aha we niwe uri usigaye inyuma bose baragenda , niho bahise bapfair . ||| even the godmother 's daughter who survived does n't know exactly what happened ... she just remembers them leaving , each one in their own direction , she was behind and she never saw them again ...
wowe wunva bitakugoye kubaan n' abantu uzi ko bakuhemukaiye , ubwo buzima wunva bumeze kutae ? ||| do you find it easy living with the people who betrayed you , how do you handle such a thing ?
kuri ubwo buzima nyine kububamo ubabona , bifite aho bitusha [ toucher @: bikukoraho ] umuntu ariko rero umuntu agomba kuihanganair ubuzima , akaemera reconciliation kwa kunri babivuga . ||| living such a life is of course affecting us in a way but we need to endure life and accept reconciliation as they say .
ariko rero ... mbese ubuzima urabukomeza n' ubwo uba ufite cicatrice [ inkovu ] ureba nabo babona , ||| but ... life goes on despite the scars that are obvious to everyone .
mbese bifite aho bibatusha [ ubuyo bibakoraho ] ntawe bifite aho bidutusha [ uko bitukoraho ] nyine . ||| they also see them and it certainly affects them as much as it affects us .
iyo reba ubona kuiyunga bizashoboka ? ||| do you think unity will be possible ?
bizaba difficile [ biraruhije ] kugirango bibaeho , ||| it will be difficult to see it happen but it will come with time .
ariko kuiyunga byo bizaba au fur et a mesure [ buhoro buhoro ] y' uko abantu bagomba ... umuntu agenda atanga temoignage akaumva aruhutse mu mutaima , cyangwa avuze ibyabaga bimukomereye inberae y' abantu . ||| as people will get to give out their testimony or get to tell what happened to them in public , they 'll feel released .
nbona kuiyunga bizagera aho bikagerawho . ||| i believe we will one day reach unity .
none se ubwo buiyungae wowe ubona bukorwa butae ? ||| how do you think unity could be built ?
akamaro k' ubwiyunge n' ukuvuga ko iyo wiyunze n' ukuvuga ko ... we niwe uza bwa mbere . ||| the advantage of unity ... meaning that he 's the one to make the first step .
ukareba umutima abizanaanye , niba uri usanzwe umubona , ubundi niwe utera intambwe ya mbere yo kuiyunga . ||| you consider his attitude , the way he usually behaves ... he should be the one to make the first step .
we aba akubona nk' aho ukimufiteho inzika . ||| he most probably will be thinking that you 're still holding grudges towards him .
igihe ukimufiteho inzika ... igihe ukifite inzika rero , we iyo ateye intambwe araza akakubwira ati @: nkoze iki akakubwira historique y' ibyo yaba yarakoze , ||| when you 're still bitter towards him ... he comes to you and tells you in details everything he did and says how sorry he is about it all .
noneho akakubwira ati @: "@ biranbabaje . @" biramubabaje kuko nta kuntu bimushimaish , kandi niba bikimushimaishije ntabwo yahita abikubwira . ||| he is sorry about it because there is no way it would leave him indifferent and if he were n't , then he would n't come to you .
ariko ku mutaima wawe ushobora kumubwira uti ca va n' ubwo wenda batazuka ariko unyeretse ko ushobora kuba urabaye umuntu , ubundi mbere uri igikoko noneho ukahita ... nta kibazo noneho mukaiyunga . ||| from the heart , you 're then able to tell him that it is okay and even though it will n't resurrect them , at least he 's shown you that he 's become human as opposed to before when he was inhuman ; then you ... you can be united without a problem .
ariko ubwiyunge ntabwo buhita buba icyo kihae uko mugenda muganira habaho contact [ kushyikirana ] nibwo ubona ko mwiyunze koko , niko nvuga . ||| but unity will not automatically come , it will be built with time as you talk and keep seeing each other
ubona utae ejo hazaza ? ||| how do you feel about the future ?
urwikekwe ruzagenda rushair gahoro gahoro . ||| suspicion will go with time .
ariko hari ibyo utahanagura mu mutaima kuko nk' uwo hari abadashobora kuhita wunva ko bagomba kuiyunga , harimo abadashobora kuhita babihanagura mu mutaima , ukaumva rero au fur et a mesure bigenda biza gahoro gahoro . ||| but there are some things you simply can not erase from the heart , some people do n't believe we should live in unity , they can not erase it from their hearts but it will come slowly .
hashize imyaka icumu mu rwanda habaye jenoside ... wowe ubona ari iki kihindutse ... ? ||| it 's been ten years since genocide happened in rwanda ... what changes do you see ?
uraumva yuko icyenda na gatanu yari [ 1995 ] imeze , siko deux mille [ 2000 @: ibihumbi bibiri ] imeze . ||| the way things were in 1995 is not the way they were in 2000 .
ni ukuvuga y' uko icyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] bwo umutwe uri ukishyushye ibiki byose ... ureba n' umuntu ukaba ukahita umwikangamo ikindi kintu . ariko uko imyaka igenda ishira , n' ubuzima bugenda bubaho , niko bisa nk' aho bihindura mu buzima ibyo utekereza ; ||| everything was still very fresh on people 's minds in 1995 ... you 'd see somebody and immediately suspect him or her of being something else ... but as the years go by and things happen , as life changes , the way we think also changes as we learn new things .
ibyo wiga . kuko wenda kuiga bwa mbere birangoraaga kuko ubonaaga ukuntu ibintu bimeze , nkahora nbiibuka nryamye cyangwa nrimo kugenda ahandi hantu . cyangwa nicaye jyenyine ukasanga ibintu biragenda bigoraan . ||| maybe at first i had a problem wih going back to school , i kept remembering wherever i 'd be , while sleeping , walking or sitting on my own and that was a big issue .
ariko ubungubu turabiganira , ||| but today , we talk about it for example in aerg .
tukasabana numva nko mu muryango wa aerg [ ishyirahamwe ry' abanyeshuri bacitse ku icumu rya jenoside ] ni urugero . abarescape [ abacitse ku icumu ] muraganira mu bitekerezo , nabo bakakubwira ibindi mukavuga uko mwabayeho muesae . ||| survivors exchange ideas and share each other 's experience and it removes a certain weight and one feels lighter .
ukasanga iyo mubivuga bifite icyo bigabanuraho mu buzima bwanyu . ukaumva utangiye kuba muri societe [ mu bantu ] , ukabaho neza . ||| you start living with others in harmony .
ubona u rwanda rugana he mu kihae kizaza ? ||| how do you see rwanda 's future ?
birashoboka y' uko tufite vision 2020 [ icyerekezo 2020 ] ariko rero ... ||| we have the vision 2020 but again ...
ubona abana bazaba mu rwanda mu kihae kizaza , bazaba mu gihugu kimeze kitae ... ? ||| what kind of a country do you think the future generations will be living in ?
mbere y' uko nvuga ngo abana bazaba mu rwanda rumeze rutae ... u rwanda ukundi rumeze ubungubu na mbere urabona harimo difference . ||| before i even talk about that , i 'd like to say that today 's rwanda is very different from the way it used to be .
nka mbere hari igice cy' abanyarwanda kigomba kuvuga , n' ikindi kitagomba kuvuga . ||| before , only one part of the rwandan population could express themselves freely , while another one could n't .
ariko ubungubu bisa nk' aho bibaye mixte [ uruvangae ] muesae mushobora kuvuga nta kibazo . usibye utagomba kushyiramo amacakubiri . ||| but today it seems more open to both sides as long as there are no divisional ideas into it .
mbere hari amacakubiri ukaba utavuga ikintu , mu ndangamuntu harimo ubwoko none ntibukirimo . noneho ariko ubu avenir [ ejo hazaza ] y' u rwanda uko nyibona , bitewe b' ibyo birangiye bikaba bigenda isa nk' aho bicika , ||| before , there was so much division , people 's ethnic groups were written on identity cards but today it 's stopped .
nbona y' uko bizagera aho bikatera inberae . nk' abana noneho bazatukomokaho , bazabona archive kuko basoma ibitabo bavugae bati @: "@ biri bimeze gutya , ||| about the way i see rwanda 's future , when i look at the things that used to be and that are no longer there , i believe things can only get better .
ese kuki biri bimeze gutya . @" bakabona amakasete , bakavuga bati @: "@ biri biragenze gutya , ||| our children will go through the country 's archives and find out how things used to be and they will want to understand why things were that way .
ariko noneho ubungubu turabona ubuzima busa nk' aho bubaye bwiza kurushaho . @" noneho bavuga bati @: "@ difference [ itandukaniro ] biri muri zero ... none bigeze kuri +15 , cyangwa +20 gutyo . ||| they will also see how things have improved and maybe say that then , things were on level 0 and will maybe be estimating them at +15 or +20 .
wowe rero ubona hazabaho iterambere ? ||| do you believe there 'll be development ?
mu buzima bwanjye nnjyae ndi umunyeshuri nshobora kutera inberae mu byo niga , cyangwa domaine yanjye nshaka kugeraho . ||| i am a student and i can go forward through my studies or in the area in which i 'd like to pursue my education .
niga gestion informatique , ||| i study computers .
nrangije secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] ni ukukomeza amashuri . ||| i have just finished secondary school and i am going on with my studies .
noneho rero emploi [ akazi ] urayishakisha ntabwo ikuizanira . ||| a job is something you have to look for , it does n't just come to you .
noneho ubuzima bukazaba bwiza , ntawe ushaka kubaho ubuzima butari bwiza . ||| then life will be good , no one wants to live a bad life .
ubu buhamya buzarebaw n' abantu benshi barimo n' abana bawe , ||| many people will watch this testimony , probably among them will be your future children .
ni iyihe message [ ubutumwa ] uha abazabureba ? ||| what message would you like to give to those who will watch it ?
message nbaha ni uko nibayibona bazareba message irimo . iyo message niyo nshaka kubabwira yuko ... nkababwira yuko bagomba kubitekerezaho , ||| the message i 'd like to give them is to look for the message that 's in it when they watch it .
ntibizaongerae kubaho . kuko niyo mpamvu tuyitanga , ntibizabaeho . kandi babizirikanae mu mitima yabo , ||| that 's the message i 'd like to give them ... i 'd to encourage them to think it through so it never happens again , to keep it in their hearts so that the same thing does n't happen again or we find ourselves in the same situation all over again .
igihe bazaba babireba , kugirango ubuzima butazaba vice versa [ gatebe gatoki ] cyangwa butazahinduka ngo busubirae aho buri buri . nraumva bagomba kutekereza kubyo babonye kuri cassette zitandukanye bazaba babona . ||| i 'd encourage people to think through the different things they 'll see on different recordings .
ubundi usobanura utae u rwanda ? ||| how would you describe rwanda ?
u rwanda ni igihugu kituwe n' abaturage baitwa abanyarwanda . ||| rwanda is a country inhabited by people called rwandans .
ariko rero babayeho mu buryo butandukanye bagira ... bagize ikibazo cy' uko habayeho ubwoko hazaba kuba ikibazo cy' uko bamwe bashaka kuicana , jenoside . ||| people who have had different lives ... their problem is that there are tribes among them and some of them started killing each other , it 's been acknowledged that genocide occurred .
jenoside ikaba yaremewe ko yabayeho . ni ukumenya ko habayeho jenoside , ||| genocide happened against the tutsi tribe just like there was genocide against the jews .
noneho jenoside yo ku bwoko bumwe bw' abatutsi , nk' uko habayeho jenoside y' abayisiraheri , habaho na jenoside y' abatutsi batuye mu gihugu cy' u rwanda . ||| the tutsis in rwanda were genocided .
ariko bikaba bisa nk' aho birimo kugenda bishira bitewe n' uko abanyarwanda bagenda habaho reconciliation [ ubwiyunge ] . ||| but now it is coming to an end as rwandans are reconciling .
wowe ni iki wita jenoside , ni iki kigaragaza ko yabayeho ? ||| what do you call genocide ? what proves that it happened according to you ?
jenoside ... jenoside yabayeho . kubera ko umuntu atashaka ko mugenzi w' ubwoko runaka ... w' ubwoko bw' ubututsi , atamushakira y' uko yabaho . ||| genocide ... genocide happened ... because one does n't want the other one from a different tribe to be alive ... from the tutsi tribe , he or she does n't want him to be there , he or she does n't consider him or her as a fully @-@ fledged human being .
akaumva we atari umuntu . we uko abiumva noneho ikifuzo cye cya mbere ari uko yamuva i ruhande , kumuva iruhande n' ukuvuga y' uko ashaka kumwica . ku buryo atamubona mu buzima bwe . ||| his or her only wish is that the other person would get out of his or her sight and this happens through killing the other person , as that would make it possible never to see him or her again in his or her entire life .
ntacyo ukaongera kuri ubu buhamya bwawe ? ||| anything you 'd like to add to your testimony ?
nkaongeraho yuko ubwiyunge bushobora kugerawho mu rwanda rw' iki kihae turimo . ||| i 'd like to add that i believe unity will be attained in rwanda in this generation .
nitwa ruhurambuga marcel , ||| my name is ruhurambuga marcel .
nvuka ahahoze ari commune mukingi , ubungubu ni akarere ka ntenyo muri province ya kitaarama , ||| i was born in a place formerly called mukingi commune , but now known as ntenyo district in gitarama district .
nvukana n' abana barindwi , ubwo njyaho nkaba uwa munani . ||| we were eight brothers and sisters in my family .
muri genocide hapfuye bane hasigara abandi bane . hapfuye abakobwa babiri hasigara bahungu babiri hapfa abandi abahungu bibiri hasigara abandi bahungu babiri . ||| during the genocide four died , which means four others remained ; two sisters and two brothers died . and there are two two sisters and two brothers who survived in the whole family .
umukobwa niwe uri imfura , we yari yarashatse , ||| the first born was a girl ; she was then married .
hagakurikiraho umuhungu , hagakurikiraho undi muhungu , jyae nkaza ndi uwa gatanu . ||| then the second and the third born were boys , i was the fifth born .
uw' imfura yitwaaga mukayiranga rose , umukurikiye yitwaaga burabyo gabriel , yarapfuye muri genocide , ||| our first born was called mukayiranga rose and the second born was called burabyo gabriel ; he died in the genocide .
hakurikiyeho rutahunga michel yarapfuye , hagakurikiraho uwitwaga muka ... [ ijwi ntiriumvikana ] hagakurikiraho uwitwaga mukakimenyi marceline yarapfuye . ||| the third born was called rudahunga michael ; he also died , then mukakimenyi marceline who died also .
papa ni hetegekimana kakuba . ||| my father 's names were hategekimana gakuba .
muri make , kubuzima muri genocide , cyane cyane muri kariya karerae ko hagati ka kitaarama , ntabwo bibaye mu matariki ya nyuma , ||| in brief , the genocide in the gitarama area did not start in the last days .
kubera ko ari hagati nraibuka ko indege ya habyarimana yamanutse ku itariki indwi , mu ijoro ry' italiki ya gatandatu , tubimenya ku italiki ya karindwi . ||| because i remember how habyarimana 's plane was crashed on the sixth at night , and we got the news in the morning of 7th .
akarere kacu , kuko kaegereye aka kabagali aho baitaaga muri masango , ||| our district was neighbouring that of kabagali , previousily known as masango .
ahajya hahita abantu benshi baturutse ku kibuye bahunga bajya i kabgayi ndetse bakanyura n' iwacu bamwe tukabafungurair , ariko twebwe genocide , ||| many people used to pass by coming from kibuye heading to kabgayi . sometimes they would pass by home and we would give them food .
kutema bitangiye ku italiki ya makumyabiri n' imwe z' ukwezi kwa kane . ||| the massive killings in our region started on 21st of april .
nibwo batangiye kutema ndetse muri iyo minsi iyo abantu bavaaga ku kibuye bahunga , ||| that was when the killings started and many people were fleeing from kibuye .
hari abantu ... bya bintu byo kurara amarondo abantu bamwe bazaaga bakatwara bakuru banjye bati @: "@ muzae tujyae kurara amarondo bakagenda bakayarara , ||| i remember some people used to go for patrols and some of them used to ask my elder bothers to join them in the tour of duty .
ariko nyuma baje kuigishwa n' abakonseye , ||| therefore , they would join them and make rounds .
n' uwahoze ari burugumesitiri wacu yitwaaga nsabimana basile babivamo batangira kutwika . ||| later on , the people who used to call my brothers for patrols were mislead by the counsellors and the bergomaster who was called nsabimana basile and they stopped making patrols and started burning people 's homes instead .
ngiye nko ku muryango w' iwacu , tutuye muri segiteri yitwa rutagara , ||| about my family , we lived in rutagara sector in bamagayo cell .
serile yitwa bamagayo iyo serile tuteyemo ngirango hafi ya yose nitwae turi tuhatuye ... papa niwe mututsi uri uhatuye wenyine . ||| we were the only tutsis who lived in that cell ... my father was the only tutsi who lived there .
kuko ngirango no muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda ari nawe uhasigaye wenyine , abandi bari bavindimwe bari barahunze , arahasigara kuko yarigaga we , ||| he was the only one who remained there in 1959 ; all his brothers fled but he remained there because he was studying .
arashaka , aba ari nawe uhatura wenyine , nta wunri mututsi uri uri hangaho muri ako karerae , muri iyo serile tuvukamo . ||| and then when he completed his studies he married and ended up the only tutsi living in the area [ where we were born ] .
genocide yaje kuza rero , ahantu bije kubera urujijo kuri twebwe , abantu tuturanye . nk' uko muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda papa yaje kuva ku ishuli , ||| the genocide started but our neighbours confused us ; during the 1959 war , when my dad came from school , he found when all his brothers had fled .
yaraje nta mukuru we yasanze , sogokuru yari yarapfuye mu mateka niko babitubwiraaga , ||| grandpapa was already dead ; that is what we have been told as their story .
abo baturanyi b' abahutu kandi nibo baje baramwakira , baramwubakira inka barazimusubiza , ||| it was their hutu neighbours who came and took him up ; they looked after him , built him a house , gave him back their cows and and when he reached time to marry , they got him a wife .
baramushakira , ||| in other words , they were like his parents or his only relatives .
baramushyingira mbese ari nkabo bavandimwe afite . ||| they were the closest people he had .
uraumva ko ari nabo yagombaaga kwitabaza muri ibyo birori bye , ||| he always used to invite them on all special occasions .
aratubyara turi abana umunani , yatubyaraiye muri iyo serile , ||| after they married , they had eight children , still in the same cell .

baje gusiganira kunyica . bakajya bahamagara umuntu ngo anyicae abenshi bari abanyeshuri tuiganye , ||| however no one wanted to kill me , i had been in the same school with most of the perpetrators .
nakebuka gutya nmureba umwana akagenda . nakebuka gutya nmureba umwana akagenda . ||| therefore , whoever they would tell to kill me would go back because i would look straight in his eyes .

hari hamaze kuba mukajorojoro , hatagaragara neza , ||| it was late in the evening and it was dark ; one could n't see clearly .
afata inyundo azi ko agiye kuyinkubita mu mutawe , ||| then he got a hammer wanting to hit me on the head , somehow i moved the head and he hit on the neck .
ntinzi ni imaan yatumye mpengeka umusaya ataikura hano ku gikanu inshuro eshatu . nkubeshye nkubwira ngo ngeze mu mwobo ryari . ||| he hit me three times and i do n't know how i got into the pit .
niba ari uwansunitse , niba arijyae wijyanyemo simbizi . n' igihe nmazemo ntinkizi . ||| i do n't know if it is someone who pushed me there , or if i went in by myself .
kusa ikintu nibuka , nagaruye ubwenge nsanga nrambaraye nubitse inda mu musaraane urimo amabyi , ||| i only remember the moment when i gained conscious and found myself lying on my stomach in faeces @/ excrements .
bari barawukoresheje . ||| it was a latrine that had already been used .
ariko wa mupira uko bakawunyambitse uri uhambutse amaboko amaze gutya . ||| but the piece of cloth , which they had used to tie me , had loosened and my arms were like this ... i noticed that they had thrown bricks on me .
noneho nsanga banazae ibitafari hejuru yanjye ariko bitanguyeho biguye ku mpande yawo . ||| fortunately , the bricks fell on the side ; they did not hit me .
ikindi nzanzamutse wa mugorae wa mukuru wanjye ibyo basigaye bamukorera hejuru iyo simbizi ibyo ari byo byose baramuviyoye [ kufata ku ngufu ] uko bigenda kose , ||| i do n't know what they did to my sister @-@ in @-@ law , whom we were together , up there .
bamunazemo bamucuritse , ||| but i guess they raped her and then she was dumped into the pit upside down while she was still tied up .
akiboshye . aya magufa , ||| all her bones at this level [ he shows ] were broken ; her pelvic bones were crashed .
izi za os iliaques zose bazimenaguye umugore arimo ahiritira mu mabyi . ||| she was agonizing intensly in excrements .
nrazamutse mpagarara kuri ya matafari . umudamu nramuzamura igitambaro nrakihambura , maze kukihambura , ||| i tried to come out of the latrine by stepping on the bricks . i tried to take her out of it too and removed the piece of cloth that was tied on her .
ariko nmuhagarika nkabona ntahagarara kubera iyi ntuza barayi ... amafuni bari bakubise ahangaha amagufa bayamenaguye . ||| i tried to make her stand but she could n't because these bones [ he shows ] were crashed .
akataka cyanee ! ||| she was screaming a lot !
nrareba nti umuntu urimo kutaka gutya , nkoze hano nu ... yambaye ubusa ahantu hose , nsanga wapi . nta rugingo ruzima afite ari mu mavi , ||| i imagined ; "@ someone screaming like this yet naked , no joints , the knee bones are crashed , nothing ... @" all her bones were crashed .
ari hano hose bamenaguye . nramurekura , kuko nbonaaga nta bunri buzima afite , ||| i left her because i could see she had no life yet i was also dying myself .
nnjyae ubwanjye ntariho noneho nrwana no kuzamuka . ||| then i started fighting to get out of the pit .
uri umusarane ukoze nka cercle [ uruziga ] nrambuye amaguru gutya nrawuheza , nkajya nshinga inkokora nkazamuka nshinga inkokora nkazamuka , ngeze hejuru bya bienda byose uko nri nkibiambaye usibye icyo gikanzu bankuyemo n' umukandara n' inkweto , nta ... nta kinri bigeze banyambura . ||| it was a circular shaped pit and when i was almost reaching the top i slipped and fell back into the pit .
nraongera ntahanuka nikubitamo kuko haranyerairaga uraumva umusarane bakoresheje . nraongera nrazamuka kukunri ngize amahirwe muri ya matafari hagati hari hashinzemo igiti kihagaze , nsa nukizamuka nkisega . ||| i again tried to come out ; i stepped on the bricks that they had thrown in the pit and in the bricks , there was a stick pointing up .
ngeze hejuru hari agati kamwe k' umutambiko nrakafata nohereza amaguru mu kiraire , aba ariyo abanza kujya i musozi nrikurura nvamo . ||| therefore , i got support from that stick and came out .
ariko ubwo bwa kabiri ngwa nkagezemo kubera ibyo bienda biri byajandamye nbikuramo , ||| there was another stick that was hanging across the pit , i held it and finally got a way out of the pit .
ikabutura n' umupira . ||| but when i fell back in the latrine for the second time , it was because all my clothes were wet .
byose mpikuramo nsigaraan aga sous @vetement niko nzamukaanye . ||| therefore , i removed everything and remained only in my underwear .
uguyemo kabiri ? ||| did you fall back into it twice ?
yee , naguyemo kabiri . ||| yes , i feel into it twice .
ngeze hejuru rero nrareba biranshobera , nibaza ahantu ngiye mu by' ukuri , nibaza ahantu ndi buerekezae , ||| when i got on top , i was in dilemma , wondering where i should go .
biranshobera . ||| i started thinking about the way i could go back and save the woman that i had left inside the latrine .
nibaza wa wunri nsizemo hasi , nubwo bamuhondaguye ibyo aribyo byose umuntu yamukuyamo nibaza umuntu njya kutakira , ||| i thought of whom i could ask for help to save the lady . however , i could n't think of anybody who could respond positively to my request for help .
wapi ! mu kihae nkitekereza gutyo , ||| while still thinking , i heard the same group of people who had dumped us in the latrine coming back .
numva ikiriri cya ba bantu bamaze kututamo baragarutse bavuye ku kandi ga centre ko hepfo uvuye aho ... aho baita mu kabuga , ahantu baita mu kajevuba hasi . ||| they were coming from a center called kabuga , in kanjevuba area area .
bazamutse bavuye kunywa inzoga , ||| they came up the hill and all of them were drunk .
bavuga bati @: "@ babantu tumaze kunaagamo [ wa mugorae yari agihirita ] bati @: ‘ ubungubu bapfuye barangije , ||| they were saying , "@ the people we dumped in the latrine must have died . @" they proceeded . the lady was still agonizing .
‘ bati @: ‘ tuzawusiba tumaze kunaagamo abandi hejuru yabo nka makumyabiri . ||| then they said , "@ we should suppress that pit after throwing about twenty more tutsis . @"
’ @" kuko uwo mwobo uri ufite metero nk' umunani . ||| the pit latrine was about eight meters deep .
ngerageje igihe nzamutse kugirango njyae kugera hejuru nicyo gipimo nfatamo cya metero . ||| if i consider the height of the pit , i would fall back into it after climbing up approximately half of it .

noneho ba bantu baraza , bazana amasitimu numvise ko aribo nihisha muri rya tongo rya wa mugabo witwa silas . nikingamo , ||| when i heard them , i hid myself in silas ' abandoned home .
bararunguruka bati @: "@ ubu barangije kupfa birangiye . @" baragenda , ndabakurikira ... ndabakurikira bose bagenda bajya mu ngo zabo ; ||| they lit their torches into the pit and said , "@ they have surely died . @" and then they went back to their homes . i watched them going to their homes but i can n't tell what time it was by then .
ntinzi isaha icyo kihae ariko hari ... ni cya kihae mu ijoro haba harimo utuntu tujwigiraa ... nko mu ... ma saa munani saa saba z' ijoro gutyo , ||| however , it was around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. , about the time you hear small creatures murmuring .

nraongera nyura muri ya nzira ariko noneho hahanri hari hatangiye kujya habyimbuka haje no gushwanyuka havamo igisebe , hatangiye kubyimbuka gakeya . ||| by then my injury was getting better and the swelling was reducing .

ariko aho kugirango njyae kwa wa mugabo aho hari abahungu tuiganye , ||| but instead of going to mr. ndongozi 's home , i went to his young brother 's home .

tufata inzira turagiye . mushiki wanjye yabaga mu nzu ntiiigeze asohoka , turagendaaa ... tuza kugera ahantu anrembairho , ahantu hitwa mu kigarama . ||| she had been inside the house throughout , she never used to go out ; when we reached a certain place called kigarama , she got very sick .
mujyana ku rugo rw' umuntu witwa ntakaiimaan . ||| i took her to a nearby home whose owner was called ntakiyimana .
yafashwae ni iki ? ||| what was she suffering from ?
yahinze umushyitsi kusa ntinzi niba ari malariya ntabwo nbizi . ||| she suddenely shivered . i do n't know if it was malaria or something else .
mujyana aho tura harara nk' iminsi ibiri , ||| we spent two nights in that home .
uwo mugabo aratuakira neza nawe , aragenda amugurair utunini twa chloroquine , n' utundi ni iby' umutwe n' ibiki aramuha , tuhamaze iminsi ibiri nravuga nti tukomezae tugende . ||| he was a good man and he even brought malaria tablets and some painkillers and gave them to my sister .
turagenda nraibuka ko ahantu inkotanyi zari ziri hari ahantu baita mu ngo z' abana . wa mugabo nawe akomeza adushushanyiriza inzira ahantu turi bunyurae , ||| after that , he directed us where to find the rpf members .
aratubwira tuti ariko utubabariye ukaperereza niba ko mukuru wanjye baishe ari ahantu aha n' aha , tukeka ko ari muri ako kacae , k' aho hantu turi tutuye , ||| then we asked him if he knew where our brother could be hiding ; i thought he was hiding around that area since we could n't find him on the other side .
uka mutushakira ukamutugerezaho iyo gahunda . ||| then he told us that , the boy we were talking about had been killed .
aranbwira ati @: "@ rero shahu mukuru wawe bamwishe , " tuti reka da ntibishoboka ntabwo bashobora kuba bamwishe . ati @: ||| i tried to argue that he could n't be dead because i had seen him the previous day .
"@ bamwishe nyamara ati @: si wa muhungu w' iwanyu w' igikara gutya , aramudushushanyiriza . ||| but the man described him for us and assured us that they killed him the day before and his body was thrown in the same latrine where i was once thrown . we were very sad .
naho uwo munsi turi tuhagurutse tugenda bari bamwishe koko . ||| then we left but that man also helped us by giving us proper directions to where the inkotanyi were .
baramufashe hahanri bari banazaemo , nawe niho bamujyanye . ||| my brother was also dumped in the pit upside down .
baje kumunagamo bamucuritse nawe kuko nyuma ya genocide tugiye kutaburura amagufwa nsanga amaguru ye ari hejuru , nbibawiyew n' ipantaro yari yambaye ubwo amagufwa ye tuyakuramo . ||| we noticed it later after the genocide , when we were exhuming his remains ; i identified his bones from the pair of trousers he was wearing during the genocide , and his legs were facing up .
mushiki wanjye turakomeza turagenda tumaze iminsi ibiri amaze kudushushanyiriza turagenda . ||| we spent two days in ntakiyimana 's house then we left .
inkotanyi tuzisanze ahantu baita mu kazinganyoni hafi yo mu biimaan . ||| we met the inkotanyi at kazinganyoni near byimana .
tugera ahantu kuri bariyeri yazo , aranbwira ati @: "@ aba abantu , ahantu nbonye hari bariyeri , ||| when we reached their roadblock , my sister got so scared , she thought the roadblock belonged to habyarimana 's soldiers .
aho ntabwo baba bari abasirikari bo kwa habyarimana bahari ? @"@ nramubwira nti @: hoya abasirikari bo kwa habyarimana babitushushanyairije ni ahangaha . ||| but i convinced her that according to the directions we had been given , habyarimana 's soldiers were not here .
hanyuma turakomeza turegair , turegair turegair tuyigeraho . ||| then we proceeded and reached the roadblock .
tuyigezeho abasirikari ntinzi ahantu bari bari , tugiye kubona tubona batukozeho uruziga . ||| i can not tell where soldiers came from , they suddenly appeared and surrounded us .
baratubaza bati @: "@ yemwe muri abahe , muragenzaw n' iki ? @" ||| they asked us , "@ who are you and where are you going ? @"
baratufata baratuganiriza , turabatekerereza inkuru , uko bigenze , tutangira kubaan nabo gutyo . ||| we introduced ourselves and they started conversing with us . we told them all our experience and they really felt pity for us .
baratufata batujyana mu biimaan tuhasanga abandi bantu mu by' ukuri numvaaga ari ... njyewe na mushiki wanjye , ari twe turiho twenyine . na mukecuru ntabwo turi tuzi ko akiriho , ||| since then we lived with them and they took us to byimana where we joined other people .
kuko nubwo bamurekaaga ngo azaicwae n' agahinda , ariko turavugaaga tuti @: bazamwica nta kabuza . noneho , ||| frankly speaking , i never expected to find any other family member alive apart from my sister and i. even my mother ; though the killers used to live her to suffer the misery of loosing all her family members , i still thought they would kill her one day .
tuba aho mu biimaan , turarokokaanye njyae na mushiki wanjye uko turi babiri , nyuma mukecuru yaje kuza ari wenyine , twa twana tubiri tw' utukobwa batuishe . ||| after sometime our mother joined us at byimana , our other sisters had been killed .
kuko uwo mugabo witwa rusizana ariwe utanze mukuru wanjye bakamwica , kwa se witwaga rutwaza niho ako gashiki kanjye kankurikiraga kari kari . bamaze ... atumaho kuri uwo mugabo ngo amwohereze umwana , yari yihishe k' umugabo witwa ngoboka ahantu baita mu kigarama , ||| one of my sisters was hiding at mr. rutwaza whose son rusizana betrayed my brother michel .
baramumwima . ka kandi gato wa mugabo we yari yarakanabyeho ati @: ||| the same rusizana is the one who asked his father to send him a girl he was hiding in his house .
"@ njyewe nzamuhungaan uyu ni uwanjye . ||| our last born remained at pascal 's house and pascal had promised never to leave the girl , "@ i will always flee with her . @"
nyuma baje kutera uwo mugabo , ubwo twe turi mu biimaan turageze mu nkotanyi kera . ||| later he was attacked but we had already left for byimana . we had joined the inkotanyi way before .
ubwo tugeze mu biimaan nyine na mushiki wanjye turi mu nkotanyi , nibwo mukecuru wanjye yaje kuaka ba bana , uwitwa mukakimenyi marcelline , ni inkabirae clemence barabamwima . ||| when we reached byimana [ my sister and i ] with the inkotanyi , mum went to get the rest of the kids [ mukakimenyi marcelline and ingabire clemence .
ariko ka gashiki , kanjye ahantu tukasize kwa pascal kamonyo , baje kumutera . bamuteye baramuhondagura noneho akana kabonye ukuntu bakubita uwo mugabo karahunga . ||| ] but they refused to give them to her ... and the interahamwe attacked pascal kamonyo who had stayed with our young sister . they beat pascal very badly .
kahunze kahungira muri rwa rugo mukuru we arimo . wa mushiki wanjye nbabwiraaga upfuye . kahungiyemo noneho ah ! baba bagize amahirwe babafata bombi . ||| and when my sister realized the way they were beating the man , she ran away .
mama akababwira ati @: "@ mumpe abana banjye . @" bati @: "@ reka da . @" ||| she went to hide in the home where my elder sister was also hiding .
ati @: "@ mumpe abana banjye , ||| it became very easy for the killers ; they found them and killed both of them at the same time .
" bati @: "@ reka da . @" finalement mama nawe yaje kutusanga aho ngaho mu biimaan abana babamwimye . ||| my mother continued to ask the killers for her children but all they did was laugh at her .
baje kubahungaan , ntituzi urupfu babaishe , kikoze bageze ahantu hitwa mu karambo wambuka ujya ahantu baita i mutara , ||| none of us know how they died but what we learnt later is that they took them to karambo towards mutara and this is where all the children were killed , after killing them , they threw them in river kiryango .
utwana ngo niho batuiciye batujugunya muri uwo mugezi witwa kiryango uwo banazaemo papa . ||| the same river where my father was drowned .
tuba tupfuye gutyo . ||| that is how they died .
ka karumuna kanjye ubungubu kaiga muri cinquieme secondaire kaitwa serubibi guido . ||| now my other young brother is still alive and he is a student in the 5th year of secondary school . he is called serubibi guido .
bamaze kutera uwo mugabo aho yari ari kwa pascal kamonyo nyine , ako kana karahunga kajya kuba aho mukuru wanjye yari ari ... nako aho mushiki wanjye yari ari , ||| after they had invaded mr kamonyo 's home , our young sister ran away and went to the home where my older sister was hiding .
ariko wibuke ko nkubwiye ko uwo mushiki wanjye yari ari muri urwo rugo kwa rutwaza , ariho abahungu be baishe mukuru wanjye kandi bamukuye mu rugo iwabo . ||| but remember i told you that my sister was hiding in rutwaza 's home yet his sons are the ones who killed my brother . they took him from his hide out in their home and hacked him to death .
ubwo maman yaje kubabaaka baramubaima barabagumana bajya kuhunga bo , bahunga inkotanyi biraumvikana , bahungaanye n' utwo twana . ||| my mother pleaded with them to give back her our sisters but they refused and fled with them as they retreated from rpf soldiers .
tuje kugaruka batubwira ko babaishe urupfu babaishe ntawe ntituruzi . babiciye aho ngaho babata mu mazi . ||| when they came back we were told that our two sisters had been killed but we do n't know how they were killed .
nbwira ukuntu abaturanyi banyu . ibyo ari byo byose ukuntu ubavugaaga uvugaaga ko ari bo muryango . ||| what happened for your neighbours to betray you ? because according to what you told us , they seemed to be like relatives .
babahindutse kutae ? ||| how did they change ?
ukuntu baje kutuhinduka , urebye yego bari umuryango , ariko n' umuryango nyine umuntu abamo kubera kubura uko ugira nta ... nta muryango urimo . ||| you see ... even though we had lived together like relatives , it happened that way because we had no alternative . there were no other people to live with .
hari umugani bajya baca mu kinyarwanda bavuga ngo ... ngo @: ||| otherwise we had somehow noticed that they [ hutus ] were malicious earlier .
"@ buryaiyagukanze ntijya iba inturo . @" ||| there is a saying in kinyarwanda , which says "@ you can never treat a leopard that has frightened you once before as a wild cat @" meaning that , once you are born with a weakness , you can never change .
tubanaaga nabo kubura uko kuko nta wunri muntu tugomba kubaan nawe , ||| we lived with them because we had no other choice .
ariko birakaraga ko ari abagome . ||| but one could tell that they [ hutus ] are bad .
kusa bigejeje igihe cyo kuhunga , tugeze icyo kihae cyo kuhunga uraumva ko n' amatariki yari yarangiye nta hantu ugombaaga kujya , ||| when the time for fleeing came ; it was too late to find somewhere to hide .
bo batwizeza ko bazatuhisha bakatuhishaan n' ibyacu byose nta kintu tuzaba . nyuma barya inka , bagira kutae ... baravuga bati @: "@ ni razima tugomba kubica . @" ||| but they assured us how they would hide us and our properties ... they later said , "@ we must kill you ! @"
ariko n' igitekerezo ubarebye no mu maso ukuntu bari bameze , igitekerezo cyo kuica ubonaaga ko nta kunri kuntu usibye ko uburaaga ahantu uhungira . ariko bo bakabura urwaho . ||| but even before , one could tell from the look on their faces that they were capable of killing us but we had no alternative and nowhere to flee to .
bakabura ingufu zo kubikora kubera ya histoire nkubwiye , ||| however , they had n't been able to kill us because of the custom i told you .
bakabura urwako rwo kubikora , ||| [ my father exchanging cows with them .
ariko abahungu babo bakiri bato banyoye amaraso , babaye za kigali , abandi babaye mu gisirikare babatiza umurindi . ||| ] their sons who were young and strong supported and encouraged them to kill us . most of their sons had tasted fresh blood ; they lived in kigali and some of them were soldiers .
noneho nibwo batangiye kutuica . ||| therefore , they went ahead and killed us also .
noneho wowe ubona biri bibarimo kubica kuva kera ? ||| does it mean that you had already understood that they would kill you ?
yee ! ||| yes , they had the desire to kill us before .
ubona biri bibarimo . urebye ni n' amahari bakundaaga kugiraan wenda bakavuga bati @: "@ nicolas afite isambu nini , " kandi ntibibaze ko hari abandi bantu bavukanaaga , ||| they used to have some skirmishes with my father in the past ; it was clear that they envied my father for having a big land .
kuba ayirimo wenyine si ukuvuga ko nta banri bavukanaaga barahunze . ||| but they were forgetting that my dad was n't born alone ; though he then lived there on his own , he had brothers who had fled .
ukasanga rero kenshi n' uwo muturanyi wacu bakuburanaho bakakurengera kuko nko muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , nubwo ngubwo tuvuga ko ariwo muryango data yari afite , ariko ntibibujije ko hariho bamwe baje , ||| they would come and take part of our land without permission ; like the family i told you who were almost like our relatives , they had taken a portion of our land !
nko mukacae k' isambu tuvugae tukaba tutuye ahangaha hakaza umuntu akahita abohoza mo aho hagati akahatura . inberae y' umuryango ni mu kwacu , inyuma y' aho atuye ni mu kwacu , hepfo y' aho atuye n' aho nimukwacu ariko akatura ahongaho . ||| several others had built on our land ; behind our home there was a family on our land , on both sides of our home there was another family , still on our land .
uraumva ibyo aribyo umuntu uje kutura ahongaho , byose nta kunri ubigenza kuko ntawakurengeraga , nta butegetsi buriho bushobora kurengeraaga . ariko uraumva ntabwo muba mumeraanye neza bene uwo muntu . ||| someone would just come and build on our land but there was nothing we could do because the government was not fair to the tutsis .
mubana kuko mugomba kubaan . ariko ntabwo muba mumeraanye neza . ||| therefore , we would just live together but it did n't mean that we were happy with each other .
muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] uraumva ko i kitaarama hariho nka mdr , mwari mubayeho mutae ? ||| in 1994 in gitarama there was a political party called mdr , how was your life then ?
urebye ibintu by' amashyaka byo i kitaarama kuko mdr niryo vuko ryayo rwose . ||| well during the time of multi @-@ partyism in gitarama , mdr was the mother party to all the others .
ariko ibintu by' amashyaka ubonaaga cyane cyane nk' urubyiruko bakunda kubijyamo . ||| it was the youth that got very involved .
ariko nkatawe nvuga ko turi neutre nta ... bon ... nta hantu ubonaaga tusa nk' aho tubogamiye turi hagati nk' ururimi . ntiushoboraaga kujya muri mdr ntibishoboka . ntiushoboraaga kugaragaza yuko uri mu ishyaka runaka , ||| for us , i can say we were neutral because you could n't join mdr and you could n't also show , which political party you supported .
ukariumaho gutyo ariko abandi babaga bayarimo ; abashinze n' amadarapo ya mdr abari muri za psd , cyane cyane mdr yabaga ihari . ||| we would just keep silent but the rest were so involved . people would rise flags for their parties ; like mdr , psd but especially mdr would be present .
ariko twebwe tubaga uri aho wikarumye nta ... ntahantu ubogamiye niko nvuga . ||| we would just pretend to be absent ; that is what i would call it .
ntabwo bajyaaga babatoteza kubera iyo ntuza ? ||| would n't they force you to join those parties ?
ibyo byo birahabaaga kuiba ukabona ari ibisanzwe kuza kutema ibitoki no kugira kutae . ||| such things happened but we would take it lightly ; for example , stealing or cutting people 's banana plantations .
ariko ubikizi bwa nabi bushobora kuba bakubita abantu , ||| but serious torture like beating a person and others ... well there used to be some moral torture like scaring people , nocking on the doors at night .
babatortura ku bunri bu ... kaereka nka torture morale kusa kubentimida [ kubatera ubwoba ] hakaba bibinri baita kuhondagura ku nzugi nicyo kintu bakoraaga kusa ariko ibyo tukaumva nta kintu na kimwe bitubwiye . ||| those are the things that they would do . but to us , it meant nothing .
hari ikibazo kinri kierekana ko biri biturutse ku bwoko bwanyu ? ||| is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] ?
oya , ||| no , there was n't any other problem .
ibyo byo biragaragaraaga ari ku bwoko biraumvikana . nta banri bagombaaga kubikora , kandi ibisobanutse iby' iwacu byo nitwae turi tutuye aho ngaho kusa , ||| however , even what was done to us was due to out ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] it was the hutus who were doing that and we were the only tutsis who lived there .
ku mpande ari bo batuye ari abo bahutu kusa nta banri . uraumva ko abagombaaga kubikora ari abo ngabo nyine . ||| all our neighbours were hutus . definitely one could tell they were the ones to do all those acts !
unbwiye ko usanzwe uri umunyagitarama , ||| you told me that you come from gitarama .
uri kavukire kaho ? ||| were you born there ?
yee , usibye ko aho turi tutuye , ku ivuko n' aho baita ... ni ahantu baita i karama usa n' ugana i kitaarama , ||| yes , but while we lived in mwendo , our home origin was in karama .
ariko aho baita i mwendo niho sogokuru yari yaraimukaiye , ariko yari isambu ya sogokuru yose . ||| our grandfather had shifted to mwendo and we lived on his land .
kuvuga ko yari nini , ||| he had a very large land .
n' uko ariwe uri uyirimo wenyine ariko bari bafite abavandimwe ! ||| the reason i am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone .
ariko kubera ko ariwe uyisigayemo wenyine bigaragaraaga ko ariyo nini kubera iyo mpamvu nta banri bavandimwe bahari . ||| he had few relatives and therefore seemed to own a big land . he was living there with a few of his relatives .
hari ikintu uhoze uvuga , uvuga ku banyakibuye bajyaaga bahungira ahongaho , bahungiraaga iyo za kabgayi . ||| you earlier talked about people who were fleeing from kibuye towards kabgayi .
sa nk' ubisobanuraho gake . ||| would you please elaborate more about that ?
abanyakibuye bazaaga bavuye ku kibuye kuko urebye bo banatwikiye kare , ||| the population fled kibuye because their houses had earlier been burnt .
barabairukana , bajyaaga baza bavuye ku kibuye bakanyura iyo nzira y' iwacu tukababona twebwe tukabakira kuko bari bene wacu , ||| they were chased from kibuye . they used to pass through our home area while fleeing . we used to help them , as we knew we were related to some extent .
tukabagaburira tukagira kutae ... bakakomeza bajya i kabgayi . ||| we would give them food and all we could to help them . then they would proceed to kabgayi .
abenshi ntibanageraagayo kuko abo basore b' iwacu ubundi bashingaaga amabariyeri mu nzira bakabafata , ||| most of them would n't reach their destination because our neighbours had set roadblocks .
abakobwa bakabaviyora bamwe bakabagira abagore babo , ||| they would kill them ; ladies would be raped and sometimes made sex slaves .
ndetse muri iyo minsi bari batangiye kutema nta n' uwarengaga aho ngaho bose baramufataaga bakamutemagura bakajya kumujugunya ahongaho muri urwo rwobo . ||| in fact the killings had started and most people would not go beyond that roadblock ; they would be murdered and dumped into a deep pit that was in this area .
i kabgayi hageraagayo bake cyane . ||| very few would reach kabgayi .
ku buryo nko muri uwo musaraane bantayemo , ||| for example , there were many corpses in the pit where i had been dumped by the time we exhumed them .
harimo abantu benshi twataburuyemo baragenda kushyinguraw muri rusangae tutazi ahantu ... ari abo banyakibuye nyine bagiye batemagura n' abaturuka ku mpera z' akarere baita aka kabakari . ||| all the corpses were reburied together because we could n't tell their places of origin . perhaps they were from kibuye or areas around kabagari .
ariko benshi babiciraaga mu nzira kandi baicwaaga n' abo bantu b' iwacu bose turabazi . ||| most people were killed on the way , our neighbours killed them . and we know them [ the killers ] .
ijwi ntiriumvikana ! ||| q ...
muri uwo mwobo ? ubwo batunagagamo bavugaaga ko bazawusiba bamaze kaongeraho abandi nka makumyabiri . ||| in that pit ... while they were throwing us in the pit , the perpetrators would say they would cover it after adding more 20 people .
ibyo aribyo byose uraumva ntinzi umubare exact [ nyawo ] ariko uraumva ko bari barenze ... nk' abantu nka mirongo itatu bari barimo . ||| well i do n't know the exact number but i would think they were over thirty .
mutaburura se mwasanzemo bangahe ? ||| how many people were in pit the time you exhumed them ?
tutaburura , ||| while exhuming ... we first found my older brother on top , then we found our sister in law .
tutaburura turebye tusanzemo ... mbere uwo mukuru wanjye we yari ari hejuru n' uwo mugorae wa data wacu tuje kubataburura tubakuramo ntitugeramo hasi turabahamba . ||| we found them before digging deep into it . so , we went to rebury them .
tutaburura rero havuyemo nk' abantu bageze kuri ... kuri cumi n' umunani . ||| i think they were about eighteen .
abandi bari mu cyobo cyo hepfo , cyo ntinzi umubare wacyo urimo . ||| there were more people in the next pit but i do n't know the exact number of people who were there .
kuko ho haguyemo umugabo witwaga sematetu umugore we yaraje arahakaotair na sima tuanga gushwanyura sima turahaihorera . tuharekera gutyo . ||| there was a certain man who was dumped into that second pit , he was called sematetu and his wife cemented the pit . we just left it that way as we did n't wanted to break the cement .
ibyobo biri bingahe ? ||| how many pits were there ?
ibyobo biri bibiri ||| two pits .
hagati yabyo hari harimo nka distance ingana iki ? ||| what was the distance between the two pits ?
harimo nka distance ya 300 m [ metero magana atatu ] . ||| about 300 meters .
ubona utae ko abantu bo muri quartier y' iwanyu ... baricaaga abandi bakabasiga , wunva ari iki kibateraaga umutima wo kuica bamwe bakasiga abandi ? ||| people in your area would kill some people and leave others . what was determing their choice ?
yee ! kuko abatuicaaga bo ni abantu b' abaturanyi uba ubazi , ||| actually those who killed us were our neighbours and we knew them .
usibye no kutuica n' aho inka yagiye , n' aho iki cyose ubaga ukizi uvuga uti @: iki kitwaye na kanaka na kanaka ; ||| not only the killers , but also those who looted our properties .
na mukuru wanjye nkuvuga nti @: yishwe n' akanaka na kanaka . ||| for example , i know who killed my elder brother .
ubu mama wawe atuye he ? ||| where does your mother reside now ?
ubu mama atuye , tubanje kutura mu biimaan mu gacentre ntabwo tukituye hahanri turi turi , ||| now she is living in ... at first we lived in byimana centre .
ariko ubu tuimukaiye ahantu baita inbarae hakuno y' i shyogwe hateganyae na kabgayi mu mudugudu wa avega uhari ubu niho turi . ||| we no longer live there ; we shifted to a place called imbare next to shyogwe opposite to kabgayi in avega estate .
abana na wa mushiki wanjye upfakaye muri genocide . ||| she lives with my sister who lost her husband during the genocide .
akora iki ? ||| what does she do ?
ntacyo , yahoze a ... ntabwo yize , ||| nothing , she is illiterate .
yahoze afite akazi ko mu mfubyi ko kurair imfubyi , ariko ikigo cy' imfubyi baje kukihagarika ; ubu araho n' umuhinzi hamwe na mama . ||| before she was working in an orphanage looking after orphans but the orphanage closed and now she is just at home helping mum in the farm .
ababyeyi bawe bari bageze nko mu myaka ingahe ugereranyaije ? ||| how old were your parents then ?
papa yavutse muri mirongo itatu na gatanu [ 1935 ] icyo kihae ashobora kuba yari afite imyaka ingahe , ||| my father was born in 1935 that means that by then he was about 59 years old .
ukarikiraiye ? mirongo itanu n' icyenda . mama yavutse muri mirongo ine na kane [ 1944 ] . ||| while mum was born in 1944 .
wowe uvutse ryari ? ||| in which year were you born ?
yari afite nk' imyaka ... nka myakumyabiri n' umwe , ||| he was about 21 years old .
yaravutse irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] ngira ngo uwo muhungu . ||| i guess he was born in 1974 .
ubwo muri genocide ntiyari afite makumyabiri n' umwe ? makumyabiri ni irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] . ||| maybe he was 20 years during the genocide since he was born in 1974 .
ijwi ntiriumvikana ! ||| q ...
kuko iwacu n' iwabo aho batuye harimo nka cinq cents metres [ 500 m ] turaturanye mu by' ukuri , ||| we were neighbours . the distance between our homes was about 500 meters .
niwe tuhana imbibi . ubu na se arafunze , kuko muri urwo rupfu rwa mukuru wanjye ise yari arimo , ||| presently his father is under custody because he was involved in my older brother 's murder .
uwo muhungu shyaka yari arimo , mukuru we aphrodis munyanziza yari arimo harimo karumuna ke kaitwaaga bukaaka damascene yari arimo n' abandi n' abandi benshi . ariko famille yose y' uwo mugabo n' uwo musirikari ... y' aho uwo musirikari avuka bose bari bahari , ||| he was participated in the murder of my brother , shyaka , his older brother called aphrodis munyanziza , their younger brother called mukaka damascene and several others .
bagize uruhare mu kuica uwo mukuru wanjye . ||| all that man 's family and the soldier were there while my brother was being killed ; they all participated in his death .
igihe bakujyanaaga ku cyobo . sa n' utubwira igitekerezo ugize , ||| the time you were led to the pit , what was on your mind ?
utubwirae experience yawe . ||| tell us a bit of your experience .
njyae kusa igihe bajyanye ku mwobo nbonaaga ko nta kunri nnjyae ngiye kupfa ; ||| when they took me to the latrine hole , i thought my life was over .
ibyo baraye bakoreye mukuru wanjye nrabiumvaaga , kandi nrabibonaaga , uraumva ko nta ... nta bunri buzima . ||| i had just seen and heard what they had done to my brother .
ndetse ngeze hejuru y' umwobo , icyo nziko cyo ntekereje ko ... nkaumva nfite amatsiko yo kujya mw' ijuru nta kinri nrinfite icyo kihae , ||| when i was on top of the hole , i was curious about what heaven looked like , that 's all i could think of .
ahubwo numva barantindaiye kunyica . ||| i was wondering what took them so long to kill me .
afashe inyundo nrinzi ko agiye kuyinkubita mu mutawe ugashwanyuka bikarangira , ||| when he snatched a hammer , i thought he was going to smash my head and finish with me .
icyakoze ngize amahirwe ni ya mana izarokora umuntu nyine ayikubita ku gakanu , nza kurokoka gutyo . ||| fortunately , i guess it was by gods will ; he hit my neck instead of my head and that is how i survived .
ubyutse ubashije ku ... ? ||| when you gained conscious did you manage to ...
nbyutse niho nje kugira ikibazo , nvuye mu musaraane . ntekereje ahantu ndi buganae , ||| when i gained conscious and moved from the hole , i started thinking of where to go .
nreba amajyepfo nreba amajyaruguru , nbona wapi ntakigenda birutaw no kupfa . ||| i looked in the north and in the south and found no direction . i wished i had died !
kuko nravugaaga ngo nibaramuka banbonye , nyuma yuko bankoreye ibingibi , noneho ibyo bari bunkorerae birarenze . bari ku ... bari kuca urutoki bari kuca ugutwi , ||| i thought in case they came across me , they would do worse things than what they had done to me . i thought they would first amputate me or cut my ears or fingers off .
ntinzi ikintu bari kunkorera nuko ngize amahirwe nyine nibambone . ||| fortunately , they never caught me again . otherwise , it would have been like dying twice .
ariko ikintu kiri kinteye ubwoba nravugaaga nti @: birutaw nuko npfa kurusha uko bagaruka bwa kabiri ntinzi uko nbiita ni ukupfa kupfa kabiri ntinzi ! ||| that is waht i can call it .
wunvaaga usa nk' aho utinye ko bagaruka ariko urangije ubagenda inyuma . ||| you were so afraid that they would get you for the second time but you still followed them .
ni iki kitumye ubwo ubagenda inyuma ? ||| why were you following them ?
ntinzi njyewe ubanza ari umugisha w' imaan kusa . ||| i can not tell . maybe it was by god 's mercy .
kuko abo bantu batugiraiye neza , ni abantu mu byukuri tutakundaaga kugenderana , ||| they really helped us yet we were n't friends .
nk' uwo mugabo nkubwiraaga nti @: wenda yari yarabyaye mushiki wanjye muri batisimu , umugore w' ... uwo mugabo pascal . ||| for example , that man i was talking about , pascal ... he was my sister 's godfather .
ariko mu by' ukuri ntabwo ari umuntu tusabanaaga bihaambaye , ku buryo ibintu yakoze , ||| however , we were not so close to his family . we never expected him to help us the way he did .
n' abo banri bose tugiye tuhungiraho biratangaje . abakwaiye kubikora ni abongabo turi tuturanye ko mu by' ukuri ubonaaga aribo dufitanye ... abo tukwiraanye kugiraan ubumwe bari hafi . ||| surprisingly those who were supposed to help us , i mean our neighbours , those who seemed to be our relatives .
ariko abongabo ukuntu baje kuhinduka vraiment , ||| they surely changed !
ngira ngo nbigereranya n' uko ari wa mutaima w' umuntu w' ubwicanyi , basanzwe bafite mu by' ukuri bakashaka kubyorosaho , ariko mu by' ukuri bafite wa mutaima . ||| i would say they had always had a cruel nature , they were killers at heart and they had been pretending throughout . maybe they had been sensitized to kill for ages but they had n't got courage to put it into practice .
cyane ari ibintu biigishijwe imyaka n' imyaka , arabifite ariko akabura imbaraga zo kubikora . iyo ariko une fois abonye ikimutera inkunga akahita ahaguruka . ||| once such a person gets someone to motivate him to killing , he hurries up into the action .
ariko na babanri rero utakekaaga , ko bashobora ku kugirair akamaro kurenza babanri , ||| the strangest thing is that the people we never expected to help us are the ones who did and those we thought would be the first ones to kill us were the ones to save us .
ukabona nibo bakakugiraiye ngirango simbizi bishobora kuba biteraw na kamere y' umuntu cyangwa se za nbaraga z' imaan , ||| i think it just depends on someone 's nature or personality . if not so , then it is by god 's power .
ntinzi icyatumye bahinduka gutyo . ||| i can not tell why they behaved like that .
nyuma ya genocide rero wiretrouva [ wisanga ] uri umwana utagira papa ... ||| then after the genocide you were fatherless ...
nyuma ya genocide ubwo , nje kusanga ndi kumwe n' uwo mushiki wanjye mukuru w' imfura , n' uwo wa kabiri , ||| after the genocide , i was left with my older sister ; our first @-@ born . and then i found my younger sister and brother .
na karumuna kanjye ka nkurukira bwa kabiri . urebye mu by' ukuri ni nkanjyae muhungu mukuru ubwo uri usigaye . nfashe nka responsabilite ya famille mu by' ukuri nta ... nta n' iyo nshobora kauzuza . ||| since i am currently the oldest son in the family , i took upon myself all the family responsibilities yet i can not even fulfill their needs .
kusa ikintu kije kunbaho ni uko nkuze imburagihe . ||| as a result , i ended up growing up prematurely .
ubu nragaragara nk' aho ndi umuntu mukuru muri famille , ndi umuntu ugomba kutekereza , icyo famille igo ... uko iri nkaumva ko ari jyae igomba kureba . ||| now i am considered as an old man at home ; i am the one who makes the decisions in the family . at my early age , i feel denied my freedom .
cyane cyane nkatawe bakiri bato bikatubangamiraho ko tutagira umwanya wo kwisanzura nk' uko ubuto bwawe ukwaiye kubwisanzuramo , ||| i do n't find time to enjoy life like i should have at my age ; things like playing around with fellow teenagers or do other fun things .
nk' uko ukwaiye kukina nk' abandi basore n' ibiki ... ahubwo umwanya wawe ukawutwara mu bitekerezo kenshi bikuvuna , kandi unareba ntubibonerae n' igisubizo . unakishaka hafi ahongaho ukabona nacyo , basi . ||| instead i spend my entire time worrying about things that actually seem impossible to me , problems of which solutions are not easy to find .
none se ubona iyongiyo ari avantage cyangwa ni ingaruka mbi ya genocide ? ||| so , to you fis that an advantange or it is a disadvantage of the genocide ?
n' ingaruka mbi ya genocide kuko iyo nbitekereje , nk' iyo ndi mu ishuri hariho igihe nicara , nkaba nrimo nbitekereza , abandi barimo baraiga . ||| they are genocide disadvantages because whenever i think about it ... for example when i am in class ; sometimes i am absent @-@ minded , busy thinking about my problems while others are concentrating .
ariko ibyongibyo iyo uwo mukuru wanjye aza kubaho simba nbitekereza , nba nvuga nti @: ibyo biri occupe niwe bireba , njyae icyo nreba ni ukuiga . ||| but if my older brother had survived , i would have relaxed a bit because he would be busy with family issues , as i also get busy with my studies .
data we ntinbaye nbireba . cyangwa se undi wunri w' umu membre de famille , banri bari bakuru , ||| not to mention if it was my father who had survived or any other older person in the family .
ntinbaye nbireba ahubwo ni ngaruka za genocide . ||| i know everything is as a result of the genocide .
kuko uwo mwanya ntaye mw' ishuri abandi baba barimo barakurikira ngombye kuba nywufatamo ayo masomo ntinrangarae , ||| i would have been able to use my time in class effectively rather than thinking about family problems while others are studying .
binciyeho ibyo kuiga birananiye za responsabilites nrimo kureba ntinzaujuje , nta ni igisubizo cyazo nzabona muri iyo minsi , n' ubwonko bwanjye burananirwa . ||| but now i am failing to concentrate in class and in the end i will fail in school . at the same time , i can not find a solution to my problems ; i can not meet my family 's needs .
eeh ! ||| eeh !
ni ingaruka mbi za genocide ziba zigaruka ku muntu . ||| those are the consequences of the genocide that are affecting me .
ntabwo zituma wiheba ? ||| do n't you get desperate at times ?
niheba muri iyo minota , nrimo kubitekereza , ariko iyo mpuye n' urundi rungano birashira . ||| i feel desperate but only for the time when i am thinking about my problems . but when i meet friends i forget about it .
kusa nongera kubitekereza ndi muri vacance nreba situation familiale ukuntu imeze , ||| and then the feeling comes back during the holidays when i am at home seeing the situation in which my family is living .
niho niheba kurenza . kuko uba ubana nabyo buri munsi kandi nta na kimwe uri bukemure niho niheba kabisa . ||| i get so desperate because i see everything yet i can not improve anything .
biraguhungabanya ... bishobora kutuma wenda urara amajoro cyangwa usa nk' aho uwutaye [ umutwe ] mo gakeya ? ||| does it disturb you to the extent of spending sleepless nights or getting headaches ?
bon , nrabikumbura cyane ko ntabwo nigae ... uraumva ko genocide yabaye nfite imyaka cumi n' itandatu . imyaka cumi n' itandatu umuntu aba ageze mu kihae , cyo kuidagadura cyo kubyina , cyo kureba imipira mbese ibintu by' imyidagaduro urabizi ibintu bishimaish abasore . ariko kubera situation nri nrimo ntabwo nigeze nbona umwanya wo kubikoresha n' ubu ahondi ntinshobora kubibonera umwanya ntinnabikora , kuko noneho ubu numva ari stade nrenze . ari ukusubira inyuma ahubwo nba nangiza ibintu byinshi , nta n' umwanya nbibonera . umuntu arawukumbura ariko nta kunri kuntu ubigenza , uravuga uti @: tu nrabirenze ngomba kuba umugabo uko bigenda kose . niba bizagaruka umuntu nyuma simbizi ( araseka ) . ||| do you ever miss your childhood ?
wowe ubundi mu buzima bwawe ni iki ushaka kugeraho ni iki wifuza ? ||| what would you want to be in the future or what is your goal or wish in life ?
njyewe ikintu nifuza ahanini , ntinzi niba nkiita icyifuzo , ntinzi . ||| what i wish , i do n't if i should call it a wish .
njyae reka mpere wenda ku bintu binshimaish nk' uko wa mukani mugenzi yavugaaga . ikintu kinshimaish kibaho , ||| let me say first what makes me happy .
ni uko numva ngize icyo marair umu rescape [ uwacitse ku icumu ] . ||| mostly it is to know that i have done something to help a genocide survivor .
yaba ari nama nmugiraiye , yaba ara kantu nmufashije niyo kaba ara kantu kadafatika , ariko nkaumva ko ari njyae ukitekerereje nkagira icyo mufashaish nicyo kintu cyinshimisha . ikintu rero numva nifuza , ||| it may be giving advice or helping with something .
ni uko aba rescape cyane cyane abantu bakiri batoya , kuko bariya bakecuru bacu basigaye , bo imibereho yabo nta esperance de vie bakifite . nta kaizerae cy' ubuzima ubona bakifitemo . ||| however simple it may be , i am happy when i am the one who thought of helping and i actually did it ... i think i wish that all genocide survivors especially the young ones should be given the advantage of a scholarship because the old women who survived do not have much hope to live .
ariko nkatawe bakiri bato , tubasha no kugenda tukajya mw' ishuri tukareba n' ama experience hirya no hino , ukaganira n' abandi bantu batandukanye , nraumva tukomeje tukagira iyo avantage yo kuiga , ||| they are desperate and sometimes miserable but for us who are still young we can go to school , we can exchange ideas with different people .
cyane ko na leta itufasha kiriya kigega . numva ko tuzabaho neza mu minsi itaha . ikintu nifuza rero , turamutse tugize imibereho myiza ari wa mwana , ||| also the government should continue financing farg so that those who were still kids when the genocide took place can continue their studies up to higher levels like we did .
genocide yabaye ar' uruhinja ubungubu akaba afite imyaka icyenda akaiga akarangiza akagera kuri stade yo kugera muri universite nk' aho turi . twebwe wenda bizatugora kwiyadapta mu buzima , wenda tuzaba tumaze kufata umurongo turarangije tureba na barumuna bacu . noneho bya bibazo na ... ntekerezaaga njyenyine , ||| maybe it 's difficult for us to adapt to this new life as we have the responsibility to take care of our young brothers and sisters .
nzaba nrabonye abandi bavandimwe baba rescape , tuigana tuibumbiye hamwe mu muryango ya aerg , nbasha kugisha inama , noneho nkabasha kauzuza na za responsabilites za ba bana bakiri batoya . ||| that 's when we can come together as genocide survivors and help each other in an association such as aerg where one gets advice , which helps me to fulfill my responsibilities of taking good care of my brothers and sisters .
icyo nicyo numva nifuza ni ubuzima bwiza aba rescapes tuzagira nyuma yo kuiga , ||| that 's what i wish for . i wish survivors would get a good life after their studies .
nyuma yo kushyira hamwe , hanyuma tumara kuba stable tumara kuba ntinzi uko nbiita mu kinyarwanda . tukabasha kutekereza noneho tukashyira ibitekerezo byacu ku murongo ariko tufite na moyen materiel . ||| after achieving that unity , then we would organize ourselves and plan to do something together ; that is if we have the necessary material [ financial support ] .
nka famille yawe ushaka kuzayimarair iki , icyo ubakorera ? ||| what do you wish to do for your family ?
ikintu ngeza kuri famille cyo si nkizi kuko , ||| what i can do for my family ?
aho ndi ahangaha n' ubuzima nrimo , ntinzi ko hari cyo napanga ko nzabageza kuri ikingiki . numva gahunda napanga ari uko , nnjyae nfashe ubundi buzima ngeze mu ntera , ||| i am not sure , with the life i am leading now i can n't promise anything .
ubwo ni ukuvuga nrangije ishuri nkabona akazi , nibwo napanga ikintu nzabagezaho . naho ubungubu nbipanze ngo nzabageza kuri iki n' iki , ||| i hope to first finish school then look for a job and that 's when i will be able to help .
kuba ari ukuivunair ubwonko ubusa , ndetse bikajya bihora binrwanairmo ... ukasanga binteye no kuba nsara . kandi nacyo ndibubikoreho numva ko nramutse nrangije , nkagira imibereho myiza nibwo napanga ikintu nzamarair famille yanjye . ||| otherwise if i start promising now , it might stress me or depress me yet i will n't loose anything if i wait until i finish my studies , start working and then help my family .
utazi genocide ushobora kuvuga ko ari iki atazi cyangwa ikintu atamenye ni iki ? ||| what would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? what would you want them to know ?
iyo urebye igihe kishize ukareba n' ubu , n' izihe changement zabaye zishobora ku ... cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe wowe ? ||| when comparing the past to the present , what changes have you experienced in your personal life ?
wenda kubazadukomokaho ku buzukuru bacu n' abo tuzabyara , ||| maybe reconciliation will be possible among our descendants if we will tell them the truth and show them the right path .
ishobora kuzahaba reconciliation . kuko tuzabaigisha tubabwirae ukuntu ibintu bimeze , ariko ugerageza kubakuramo ko ibyo bintu bitazaba . ariko twebwe , ||| however , reconciliation is impossible amongst us in this generation .
ntinzi ko reconciliation ishobora kuba . ntatanga nk' urugero @: umuntu araza akavuga ngo nrireze nemera icyaha . ||| i can give an example ; someone can assure you that he pleaded guilty and accepted what he did .
ariko burya iyo ukurikiraanye , uburyo yirega akaemera icyaha , aravuga ati @: "@ kanaka yarapfuye , ||| but when you follow up the way he pleads guilty , you can hear him say things like @: so and so was killed by some attackers on such and such date , but i never participated in his murder .
agwa mu gitero iki n' iki , kw' itariki iyi n' iyi n' iyi , " ariko nta ruharae rwe mu byukuri agaragaza avuga ati @: "@ njyae nkoze ibi n' ibi n' ibi abiishinja mu by' ukuri , ||| they always plead guilty but never accept their personal role .
buri kihae abivuga abiikuraho . iyo abiikuyeho rero , uraumva ko nta hantu biba bimufasheho usanga ari politique aba agendairho kusa ariko usanga nta nkaimawe biba bimufasheho . yanagera no hanze rero , ||| when someone is like that , it shows that he or she is more concerned about politics but do not really want to show his or her role .
kuvuga ngo araza kukusaba imbabazi ntibishoboka . ||| then if such a person came to me asking for forgiveness , it would be impossible for me to forgive him or her .
aba akureba nk' ... iri ahongaho ; ntinzi ko reconciliation , muri iyi generation yacu , iragoye kugira ngo izageraweho kabisa . ||| they treat us like a ... i think reconciliation in our generation is very difficult .
utaemera genocide umubwira ngo iki , nka bariya bantu bayihakana ? ||| what can you tell people who do n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ?
bayihakana ? utaemera genocide muri bariya bantu bayihakana , ||| people who do n't agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
ntinzi biteraw n' uburyo ayihakana niba ari ukwigiza nkana cyangwa se atayemera by' ukuri . ariko umuntu utayemera , njyae mbere yo kugira ngirae ikintu mubwira , ||| it depends on the context in which they deny it ; some people pretend not to know what happened , while others really do n't know what happened .
nmujyana nk' ahantu za ntiarama , nkamujyana mu bisesero ku kibuye nkamujyana nyamata , n' ahantu hari inzibutso za gikongoro . nkamwereka ayo magufwa , ||| but to those who intentionally deny the genocide , all i can do for them is to take him to places like ntarama , bisesero , nyamata and other places such as gikongoro , which have genocide memorial sites .
noneho nkamubaza nk' ikibazo kimwe nti @: aya magufwa ureba ahangaha ; ni inkuba yaje ikubita abantu , ||| and then after i would ask them only a single question @: "@ what do you think was the cause of their death ? was it a thunder that killed these people and brought them here ?
ikabaandarika ahangaha ? baishwe n' umuyaga se ? ||| were they strong winds ?
ni umwuzure se ? abantu baraiishe ? ||| were they floods ? or did they commit suicide ? @"
ni ibintu bibaye ku manywa y' ihangu , ukaumva ikintu akusubiza . ||| then i would wait to hear their answer .
ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ... nraumva atabona igisubizo akusubiza ahongaho cyane cyane nk' umunyarwanda . ntiyabona igisubizo akusubiza . ||| they would n't get any answer especially when they are rwandans .
nk' umunyamahanga ibyo aribyo byose nabo ni abantu , yareba akumiraw kusa . ||| but if it is a foreigner , i guess he would be surprised and just keep quiet .
nk' umuntu ukiri mutoya , inzibutso zimubwiye iki ? ||| to someone who is still young , what do genocide memorial sites mean ?
inzibutso ni nziza cyane kuko ni urugero rumwe tushingaiyeho , ||| memorial sites are very good .
rwo kutazaibagirwa ibintu bibaye mu rwanda . unbajije ikibazo mu kanya uti @: "@ nk' umuntu utaemera genocide wamubwir' iki ? @"@ ||| because they are basics for our history . they will help us never forget what took place in rwanda . you have just asked me the question " what can you tell a person who does n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ? @"
nkubwira ko nmujyana kuri izi nzibutso nkamubaza niba aya magufa yari ... abo bantu baraiishe , cyangwa se ari umutako uri ahongaho . ||| i guess you heard that the answer was based on the memorial sites ; i told you that i would take such people to the memorial sites and ask them if those people committed suicide or if the bones are for decoration .
ariko urwo rwubitso ruri ahongaho no mu myaka n' imyaka , ruzaba rukihari . ni ibintu tuzajya tuigisha abana bacu , ni ibintu tuzakorera visite ari abantu baiga amateka ari abantu bagize kutae ? ||| these memorial sites will be there for years and years .
ukazagenda ukareba ukavuga uti @: imyaka n' iyingiyi no mu kihae kizaza , uru ni urugero rumwe ku bantu bahakana genocide , ubaereka ko genocide yabaye mu rwanda . ||| our children will see them ; historians all over the world can come for their research and see what happened .
urwibutso rero numva icyo runbwiye ni ukutibagirwa n' umunsi na gato genocide . kuri njyewe nk' urubyiruko ariko ku bw' umwihariko nk' umuntu w' umurescape , ni ukutibagirwa , buri kihae . ||| therefore , memorial sites to me as part of the young generation , especially as a genocide survivor , are there to remind us and make us never forget what happened .
usa nk' aho urwanya ko genocide izibagiraan . ||| it seems like you are fighting against forgetting about the genocide .
ariko se kuibagirwa kuri wowe bivuze iki ? ||| what would "@ forgetting @" mean to you ?
kuki ubirwanya cyane ? ||| why are you really against forgetting ?
kuibagirwa ikintu bishatse kuvuga , ni ukuvuga iyo wibagiwe ikintu , cyane cyane ikintu kibi cya @kubayeho , ni ukuvuga ko nta gaciro ukihaye . niba nibagiwe npfushije data , npfushije bakuru banjye , npfushije abavandimwe npfusha ... , u rwanda rucura imiborogo abantu barapfa barashira . wibagiwe ibyo bintu ukabihanagura kandi ureba noneho usigaye wenyine , ntugira hepfo ntugira ruguru . ntinzi ukuntu ... nkita cya cyaha baita sakirirego rwose . ||| listen ... what it means to me , when you forget things especially bad things that happened to you , it means that what happened meant nothing to you . if you can forget your father 's death , your mother 's death , and your relative 's death , deaths that caused agony to the whole country [ rwanda ] , and rub out all your beloved ones from your brain yet you were left alone in this world , without anyone to talk to or to run to , to me that would be an unforgivable sin .
nbwira . utazi u rwanda urumubwira utae ? ||| what can you tell those who do n't know rwanda ?
iyo mpageze ... ntinzi ! mpita mpinduka ku buryo muri uwo mwanya simba nkiri umuntu , ||| whenever i pass there , i change a bit and behave differently . i feel strange . it is as though i loose my humanity .
kusa ni uko ya kamere yo kuicana ntayo iba ikurimo , ||| however , i do n't have a cruel heart , the heart to kill .
ariko nba numva nta n' umuntu wa nvugaish . ||| i do n't feel like talking to anyone .
kusa iyo mpageze simba nvuga usibye ikintu nkora nkahasengera kusa . nkavuga isengesho niyo riba ari ijambo rimwe kusa ryo kushimira imaan . nicyo kintu nkora iyo mpageze , ||| i just say a prayer , no matter how short it is , i just say one word of thanksgiving to the lord .
iyo mpatekereje . ariko hagati aho nk' iyo nbonye nk' abantu , bene wabo w' abicanyi bari ahongaho , abana babo mpita nnjyae numva nzanye ubugome . ||| but in case i see someone related to the militias at that time , i become aggressive .
kusa nta kinri kintu ukora ukabiikuramo , ukaumva nawe utekereje kugira nabi . ||| sometimes i think of doing something horrible but because it is n't my nature i just get over it .
mbese hantera kutekereza kuri bya bibi bya nbayeho , nkaba na ... ngira nabi nnjyae ariko kubera ko ya kamere ntayo nfite , ||| whenever i reach there , i remember all the bad things that happened to me and then i feel like doing some horrible acts but i just ignore that feeling because i naturally do n't have that nature .
ntabyo nshobora kukora . ||| i can never do that ...
naho iyo utekereje kuri ... uriya mugorae wa mukuru wawe ? ||| and what do you think about the other lady ; your cousin 's wife ?
uriya we ntinjya nkunda no kubivuga kuko na ... na za temoignage ngiye ntanga ahantu henshi , ntabwo nkunze kuvuga amateka ye . kuko numva bi ... biranshoka [ birampungabanya ] cyane . ||| i normally do n't talk about that issue . in all the testimonies that i gave out , i never talked about her because i always get shocked when i remember her .
numva muri njyewe hari ngombye kuba nramukoreye ariko bikananira . ||| i always believe that i could have done something for her but i failed to it .
uko numvise nvuyemo numvaaga nmuvanamo , ||| the way i left the pit is the way i would have got her out .
akaba yavuraw akagira katae ... ariko ntibishobokaaga . ||| then maybe she would have been treated or something else would have been done ... but that is not what i did .
nta n' umuntu wunri nshoboraaga kwitabaza byiibuze ngo mubwirae nti @: ||| there was n't anybody to help me ; maybe if i had got someone , i would have asked him to help me save the lady .
bigenze gutya , tugende dusove [ tutabarae ] uriya muntu . icyo kihae buri kihae rero nko mu ndoto zanjye akenshi image [ ishusho ] ye ihora inzamo cyane cyane na ka gashiki kanjye gatoya , ||| most of the time , i dream about her and my young sister ; i always see their images .
iyo ntekereje abo bashiki banjye batoya tutazi urupfu rwabo . ||| even my two young sisters whom we do n't know how they were killed .
nibo bahora bangarukamo buri kihae . ||| i always remember them .
kuburyo n' ejo bunri nshyingura mukuru wanjye , amagufa ye yashatse kuyobera mu yanri [ uwo mugorae wo kwa data wacu ] mpita nyakuramo , ||| last time when we were exhuming my brother 's remaining , we almost lost his bones among other bones [ mixed with my sister in law 's bones ] but i separated them immediately .
ubu ngubu aho tubashyinguye nbashyinguye nbaegeranyaije . biibuze n' iyo ngiye nkatera indabo kuri iyo hejuru y' imva ye , ||| now we reburied them separately but next to one another .
numva hari ikintu bimpinduyeho . ||| at least now when i plant flowers on their graves , i feel better .
ni bwo bwa mbere utanga temoignage ? ||| is this your first time to give a testimony ?
ntabwo ari ubaw mbere . ||| it is not my first time .
ngirango nyatuye , ntayibwira abantu ku buryo tuganira nka mugenzi wanjye nk' uyunguyu cyangwa abandi , ni ubaw kabiri . ||| besides telling it to my friends , i have given a testimony twice before .
ubaw mbere nyitanze turi turimo ... hari ahantu mu biimaan tucukuye amagufa ; ||| the first time it was at byimana where we were exhuming remainings of people .
ahantu baroshye abantu benshi cyane aho tukoze urwibutso rwo mu karerae kose . ||| many people were killed in that area and now we constructed a memorial site there on the behalf of the district .
uwo munsi tujya kubahamba nibwo ntanze temoignage , ||| i gave out my testimony the day we reburied them .
ubu n' ubaw kabiri nongeye kuyitanga . ||| this is the second time .
ubaw mbere uyitanga nta kintu kibi wumvise ? ||| the first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ?
nk' ubungubu iyo ubivuze wunva umeze utae ? ||| how do you feel now as you talk about it ?
kaereka umurescape wenyine niwe tubisangira kabisa , ntawunri muntu nshobora kubibwira . ||| maybe a fellow survivor ; it is the only person we share the same problems but i can not tell it to any other person . and it can only happen when we talk and find ourselves with common challenges .
nawe tuganiriye tukakahuza urugwiro cyane cyane nk' abantu bo muri aerg , nibo tuicara nk' ahantu hamwe tutangira kukaganira , cyane nk' umuntu w' inshuti . ||| for example the members of aerg ; we sit with them and talk like friends .
nka freddy uriya yanabikubwira tukimara kubonaan , iyo mwicaye mu kaganira , uravuga wisanzuye kabisa ukabona uri muri famille . ||| freddy can testify this .
ariko ku wunri muntu simfe n' uwakoze ... itsembabwoko , ||| the first time we met ... we talked and we were free as though we were from the same family .
n' undi numva tudahuje imyumvire biragoye kugirango njyae kubimubwira kabisa . ||| but telling it to other people or to those who committed the genocide seems too hard for me .
abanyamahanga cyangwa n' abanyarwanda , baba abubu cyangwa abo mu kihae kizaza . ni iyihe message [ ubutumwa ] ushobora kaubaha ? ||| what message can you give to the foreigners or rwandans of today or in the future ?
message nbaha , ||| the message i can give them ... i would like to give a message to especially rwandans who do n't know rwanda .
usibye ko iyo message yanjye akenshi numva nyiha abantu cyane cyane b' abanyamahanga batazi u rwanda , kuko umunyarwanda we kumubwira genocide , ||| because telling a rwandan about genocide is not very difficult .
ntinumva ko uvunika cyane ubimubwira n' aho yabiirengagiza ibyo ari byo byose arabizi . ||| although they ignore it [ genocide ] , they know about it .
ariko nk' umunyamahanga message nmuha uzi yuko akenshi nk' abazungu bakunda kufata ibintu a la legele [ kubyoroshya ] ntibabifatae uko bigomba kuba . ||| but foreigners especially white people take things lightly .
nyamara mu by' ukuri bafite ... bahishe ukuri ... barabibonaaga , bari bafite amacamera . ||| they do n't consider this the way they are . but in actual sense , they shy away from the truth .
harimo n' ababigizemo uruhare nk' ababiligi n' abandi na bariya basirikare ba nations unies ( un ) ni minoir harya ? bafite information [ amakuru ] zose . ||| because they had cameras and some of them participated in the genocide . for example the belgians and those un soldiers of unamir together with others , they had all the information .
ikintu nbabwira ni uko iyo tuvuga ibi ntabwo ari imyidagaduro tuba turimo . ||| all i can tell them is ; when we say this , it is not a form of enjoying life .
iyo tuvuga ibi , ||| when we say this ... consider the time i have spent here !
reba umwanya ntaye aha nkaha . nraiga ngombye kuba ndi mu ishuri kimwe n' abandi , ariko nigomwe uyu mwanya kuza kuvuga ibingibi ngombye kuba maze kufata chapitre runaka nzisoma . ||| i am a student , i am surposed to be in class now with other students . i had to spend my time here instead of learning extra chapters in class !
ariko numva ko ari ikintu kingombaw ngomba kuza nkatanga nka temoignage izabona abantu ku isi hose abantu benshi , cyane cyane abanyamahanga . ||| i know it is very important to give out my testimony so that the whole world especially the foreigners would see it .
ikintu nbona rero ni uko genocide yabaye mu rwanda bagomba kuyiha agaciro . ||| i think the genocide that took place in rwanda should be given its value .
n' ubwo ntacyo batumarair nk' abanyarwanda , ariko bakamenya ngo genocide yarabaye , bakayiha agaciro igomba kugira . ||| although there is nothing they can do to help us as rwandans , they should just believe that there was genocide in rwanda and give it its value .
iyo tuirirwa tubivuga ntabwo tubivuga kugira ngo tubicuruzae . ||| when we spend days talking about the genocide , we do n't say it for sale .
kagame yigeze kubivuga ati @: "@ nk' abavuga ko tucuruza genocide uwamubaza ko ikiro ... litiro y' amaraso igura angahe ? @" ||| president paul kagame once talked about it . he said ; " those who say that we sell genocide , i wish they tell me how much is a kilogram or a litter of blood . @"
ku bwawe kuibuka no kaubaha genocide wunva ari akahae kamaro bifite ? ni iki cyane cyane utashaka ko bakuibagirwa ? ||| to you , what 's the importance of remembering and giving value to genocide ? what would you wish to be remembered forever ?
icyo ntashaka ko bakuibagirwa n' iyo nbaga y' abanyarwanda yapfuye izira akarengaane . ||| what i wish to be remembered is the massive innocent people that were killed .
bagombye kuba ubu bakorera igihugu , igihugu cyacu kikatera inberae kimwe n' ibindi byose . kuyibagirwa rero numva ari amakosa akomeye cyane . ||| now they would be helping the counntry and our country would develop like other countries .
kandi iyo uyibagiwe , uba ufashe na bibinri tuvuga by' uburenganzira bw' ikiramwamuntu ntacyo biba bimaze . ||| therefore , forgeting the genocide is a big mistake . once you forget the genocide it seems like you do n't value human rights .
kuko uzubahiriza uburenganzira se kutae bw' umuntu , utanemera ko ari umuntu . ||| because you can never obey human rights yet you do n't accept so and so as a human being .
kutayibagirwa rero ni ukudafata abantu nk' inyamaswa . ukabaha agaciro bafite nk' abantu . eh , ||| therefore , considering genocide means considering people as human beings and not animals . and respecting people as human beings .
ni icyo kintu numva nvuga . ||| that is all i can say .
hari icyo ushaka kaongeraho ? ||| do you want to add on anything ?
nrabona hasigaye iminota makumyabiri n' itandatu . ||| we still have twenty @-@ six minutes extra .
ikindi nkaongeraho , wenda turenze ibyo ngibyo byo kaubaha temoignage abantu batazi iki gihugu , kuha temoignage abantu bahakana genocide . ||| the additional information i have is for those who do n't know this country , a testimony to people who do n't acknowledge that there was genocide in rwanda .
jyae nkaongeraho nkigarukair kuri cadre y' abarescape , cyane cyane nbwira urubyiruko , kuko abakecuru abasaza barokotse bacu , bo kugira ngo uzanamubwirae ibingibi , ||| what i can add on , i would first go back to the case of the survivors especially the youth because the old ones are too miserable to listen to this .
baraihebye ku buryo burenze . kikoze abantu bakiri batoya , cyane cyane b' aba rescapes , nbaha temoignage ngira nti @: ||| but young people especially the survivors i would give them my testimony saying that , "@ they should never despair . @"
ntibakihebae . ibyabaye birabaye simbivuga nka kwa kunri , ||| we can not change the past .
ngo @: " tubiibagirwae , ngo tuiyungae . @" ||| i am not saying that we forget and reconciliate .
ariko ntabwo tushobora kuheraanw n' ibyabaye . ||| but we should not be taken up by out past .
bitavuze ko tugomba kuibagirwa genocide . ahubwo genocide tuka @yitekerezaho , ikaduh' ingufu . ||| but it does n't mean that we should forget the genocide , instead we should always think about it because it makes us strong .
kutaibagirwa bikaduh' ingufu yo kurwanya ikintu cyose kizatuma genocide yongera kuba mu gihugu cyacu . ||| remembering gives us power to fight against any other thing that would ever cause another genocide in rwanda .
kuba genocide ... kuibuka genocide agaciro bigomba kugira , nitwae tuzabikaha . ||| we are the ones to give genocide its value .
ntitutabikaha nta n' undi uzabikaha , ||| if we do n't value it , no one else will .
tutatanze izi temoignages nta wunri uzaza kuyitanga . tutabirwanaiye ngo inzibutso runaka zaubakawe , nta wunri uzabirwanair . ||| if we do n't give out these testimonies , no one else will give them out . if we do n't fight for the construction of memorial sites , no one will ever stand up for their constuction .
nitwae tugomba kurwanair uburenganzira bwacu , ||| it is our task to stand up for our rights .
kandi tuharanira kubaho . ||| we should get our freedom of living .
kaongera kubaho . ||| to live again .
niyo temoignage numva nha cyane cyane les jeunes rescapes [ urubyiruko rucitse ku icumu ] . ||| this is the testimony i can give to the youth survivors .
asante . ||| thanks .
tubwirae imyaka ufite . ||| tell us your age ...
imyaka ? ||| my age ... ?
nvutse muri mirongo itanu na kane [ 1954 ] . ||| i was born in 1954 .
ubwo amateka ya mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] nri mutoya . ariko nri nfite ngo nk' imyaka ine ngirango , nraumva bikeya nkibiibukaho bike . ||| well about the history of 1954 , i was still young , i was about four years old . i think i can only remember few things like when my family and i were migrating .
kuko nibuka iwacu tuhunga . ibyo nvugaho cyane nzi , ni ibyo muri za mirongo itandatu na rimwe ... na gatatu ... gutyo . ||| but what i remember is the war that took place in the 1961 ... 1963 in the range of that time .
nabwo turahunze , barya inka z' iwacu , ubwo icyo kihae ni abahutu bicaaga abatutsi , banabatwikira barya n' inka zabo . ||| even then we migrated while they were seizing and eating our cattle , burning our houses and still it was the hutus killing the tutsis .
ibindi rero na none nzi , ||| they demolished the tutsi 's houses .
cyane ho nri mukuru nzi ubwenge , nri inkumi , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] . muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] , ||| then other things that i remember well are the events of 1973 because then i was a wench .
na none ni abahutu bicaaga abatutsi . ||| still it was the hutu killing the tutsi .
barabasenyair barabica , ||| they demolished tutsi 's houses and killed them .
bamwe barahunga , ||| some tutsis fled .
icyo kihae tunahungiye muri kiliziya yo ku kamonyi , i kitaarama , mu karerae ka kamonyi . ubwo turahunga , ||| that time we fled to kamonyi church in gitarama [ in kamonyi district ] .
baratusenyair turaongera ... baravuga bati @: "@ intambara ni ihoshae , ||| then they [ hutus ] said that the war should stop .
turaongera tusubira mu matongo , turaubaka turasaan . @" ||| therefore , we went back to our stumbles and reconstructed the houses .
ubwo tuba aho , muri mirongo irindwi ubwo na gatatu . ||| then we stayed there ... that was in 1973 .
birakomeza ntibiba byiza . na none abahutu bakomeza gusarika abatutsi . bigera muri za mirongo inani ... inani n' umunani [ 1980 @-@ 1988 ] , ||| the situation never improved , the hutus continued to mistreat the tutsis .
nibwo hirya no hino bagendaaga nka za bugesair ; za kibirira ; bakomeza kugenda mbese abahutu bakomeza kutoteza abatutsi . ariko bigeze muri mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] , ||| untill that period between 1980 and 1988 when tutsis were menaced so much by the hutus in areas like bugesera and kibirira .
inkotanyi ziteye , na none abatutsi baraicwa . baratotezaw , barafungwa mu byitso , ||| generally , the hutus continued to torture the tutsis .
abandi baraicwa baratwika . za kibirira aho , za bugesair , hariya mu bagogwe , ||| then in 1990 when the ikontanyi [ rpf army ] invaded the country , tutsis were subjected to serious torture ; they were killed , imprisoned accused of being traitors , others were killed , houses were burnt in all those areas of kibirira , bugesera and in the bagogwe in ruhengeri .
mu ruhengeri . birakomeza bigeze muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] noneho , aribwo habyarimana indege ye yahanukaaga avuye tanzaniya , ||| this continued up to 1994 when habyarima 's airplane crashed on its way from tanzania .
bahise bica abatutsi barabatsemba . kuko bavugaaga ngo @: "@ abatutsi nibo baishe habyarimana , ngo none ni babiturae babicae . @" ||| then they started killing the tutsis with all their effort saying that tutsis were responsible for habyarima 's death . "@ therefore , they [ tutsis ] have to pay for it , " they said .
bafatanya n' abasirikare bariho icyo kihae , bafatanya n' interahamwe zatozawaga ... zari zaratojwe kera , baba ... bamwe babatorezaga mu bugesair , abandi mu mutara , ||| with the help of soldiers together with the interahamwe who had been given enough training in bugesera and mutara , they were trained posible methods of killing people .
baratojwe ibintu byo kuica kusa . ubwo hapfaaga abatutsi , baraicwa ni abatutsi baicwaaga . ||| then tutsis died , they were killed ... these were the tutsis being killed .
ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi . ||| and it was one clan killing the other .
ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi , ntabwo ari ukuvuga ngo ni runaka unganye na runaka nk' abaturanyi , ni ubwoko kusa butaotaijew , ||| it was a clan killing the other clan , it was n't like , ‘ a person had a grage with a fellow , ’ it was a certain clan that had been trained to kill the other clan .
haicwa ubwoko bumwe . ||| therefore , one clan died .
barabica pe ! babica urugaraguro . babica nabi @: ||| and , they really killed them ; they killed them so painfuly with a lot of torture .
abo bata mu nzuzi ; abo bata mu misarane ; abo bata mu myobo ; ||| some were drowned in rivers and lakes ; others were thrown in latrines or pits .
kugeza igihe inkotanyi zifataiye iki gihugu bahosha iyo ntiambara ... bahosha ubwo bwicanyi . ||| until when the inkotanyi liberated this country and ceased the war and the killings .
ubwicanyi bamaze kubuhosha , bashyiraho ko , abakoze ubwo bwicanyi babafata ... bafataw bakafungwa . ||| and later they set up a law of arresting those who perticipated in the killings .
barabafunga turabavuga abantu baishe ... baishe tureba , ||| they were arrested ... those ones that we would see , we would report them .
ariko ikintu cya mbere na mbere umuntu yifuza , yifuza ko habaho kuhana by' intangarugero , umuntu wishe undi . ||| but our primary desire is to see people being purnished accordingly .
umuco wo kutahana ukaranduka . kuko icyo kihae ku bwa habyarimana , ntabwo umuntu yicaaga undi ngo abihanairwe . nta muhutu wicaga umututsi ngo abihanairwe . ||| a killer ... the culture of not punishing should be abolished completely . because during habyarimana 's regime no body would be punished over killing someone . a hutu would not be punished for killing a tutsi .
yemwe no kufungwa ntiyafungwaaga . ||| neither would he be imprisoned .
kuko yari gahunda yateguwe kera , bari bayizi . ||| it was an earlier planned program and they all knew all about it .
n' ibyo bakoze , bakoze ibyo bari basanganywe , si ibyo bigiyeho . ||| all they did , they were prepared for it [ genocide ] , it was not a sudden event .
ikintu cya mbere nbona kiza rero , ni umuco wo kuhana . ||| the most important thing is to set up a culture of punishing those who harassed others ... those who killed others .
bakahana uwibasiye undi bakahana umuntu wishe undi by' intangarugero , kandi kumugaragaro . n' abandi bakaboneraho . ||| they should be punished accordingly and in public for others to see and learn a lesson .
ikindi rero kiza ni uko aya mateka , y' ubu bwicanyi bw' abatutsi baishwe bahoraw ubusa ... b' inzirakarengane . numva ko bigomba ... nako sijye jyenyine , ni tuesae . ||| and another important thing is ; this history of the killings of the innocent tutsis , who died for no reason , should never perish .
bitasibangana , bitakwaiye kwibagirana , ||| not only my testimony but also everyone 's . it [ history ] should never be forgotten .
tukwaiye kuhora tubiibuka , ||| we should always remember it .
kandi bikaandikaw no mu bitabo . n' abana ... ab' abana bacu bazabyara bakazakura bazi ... bakavuka ba ... ibyo bitabo bihari babisoma , bamenya icyabaye , bitibagiranye . ||| it must be written in books so that our grand children will be able to read and know what happened .
bakamenya icyabiteye icyo kihae , bakamenya abantu bicaaga abandi , bakamenya ko abahutu baishe abatutsi icyo kihae . ||| they should know the cause , who killed who ... they should know that the hutus killed the tutsis that time .
ariko bakahana ba bantu , by' intangarugero . ||| but they should punish those people accordingly so that the culture of not punishing stops .
ku buryo umuco wo kuica ... wo kuicana ucika . ||| that way , the habit of killing one another will stop .
n' utekereza kuica , akabitinya kubera ko azi ko yabihanairw . ||| even that one who had a thought of killing would stop because he or she knows she would be purnished for it .
numvaaga hari utubazo dukeya numva nkubaza , kugirango tukomezae tusobanukirwae n' ibyabaye . ||| i would like to ask you some few questions in order for us to fully understand what happened .
utubwiye ko muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] uri uriho , ariko uri ukiri mutoya . ||| you told us that in 1959 you already existed but you were still young .
ariko ... utusobanurair niba hari utwo wibuka muri makeya @: uko bateraaga , uko iwanyu biri bimeze , ||| but you can tell us the little you remember about the way they attacked how it was in your area , how you fled or what happened to you .
uko se mbese mwahunze . cyangwa se uko bigenze kutae ... utunyurairmo muri makeya uko bigenze icyo kihae ? ||| just tell us in breif what happened during that time .
umh , turahunze . ||| we fled .
nrabiibuka nri mutoya muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] . ||| i remember that in 1963 i was very young .
turahunze bateye iwacu baratwika , ||| we fled after they attacked our home and burnt our houses .
tuhungira nko ku musozi wo hakurya , hari ishyamba . ||| we fled to a certain hill , which was a bushy .
kubera ko hari inka nyinshi tuhungaan n' inka . ||| we had a lot of cattle ; therefore we migrated with them .
ariko baratusenyair . ||| however they demolished our houses though .
mwavuye ku musozi mwari mutuyeho witwa ... ? ||| what was the name of that hill where you were living before migrating ?
eh , ahongaho turi tutuye ku musozi witwa ... hitwa ikaibanda , ||| eh ... we were living on a hill called ikibanda .
tujya ahandi hantu hirya y' ikinazi , ||| we left that place and went to some place beyond kinazi .
ahantu hari ishyamba baitaaga inyabusunzu . icyo kihae abatutsi benshi barahakoranaiye , kuko bagiye kutwika batwikira rimwe . ||| there was a forest called nyabusunzu . that time many tutsis gathered there because most of their houses were burnt at the same time .
n' inka zabo n' abana . ||| they met there with their cows and their children .
bamwe bahita bagenda bajya iyo za bugesair abandi baza banaza hano za sainte @-@ famille hariya . ||| some people [ tutsi ] went to bugesera and others went to sainte @- famille church .
burya kiliziya nta kihae abantu batayihungiyemo . uretse muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , nibwo bayihungiyemo banayirawmo . ||| in the past , people had been running to church on several occasions unlike in 1994 when people ran there and died from there .
ubwo icyo kihae nabwo birabaye bikomeza bityo ; batera abantu bakarya inka , abandi bakica bakakubita amahiri ... abantu baranapfuye , abandi bajya mu mahanga . ||| even that time same thing happened and continued like that ; they attacked and killed , hit tutsis with club , some people died , and others fled to exile .
ariko bariya bagiye mu mahanga , ntabwo bagiye bagiye ku bunri buryo , ni ku buryo bwo kuhunga abahutu bari babamenesheje mu gihugu . ||| there was no other reason why people [ tutsis ] went to exile ; they were fleeing from the hutus , who were menacing them with in the country .
nta kihae umuhutu atatoteje umututsi . kuva muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] kugeza ejo bunri muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , ||| there is no time when a hutu stopped torturing a tutsi ever since 1959 up to 1994 .
ni abahutu bicaaga abatutsi . ||| it was always the hutu killing the tutsi .
hari abo uzi baishwe , uba uzi amazina wenda ukavuga uti kanaka yaratwikaiyew baramwica ... ||| do you know by names , anyone who was killed ? for example you can tell us that ; so and so , their houses were demolished and later they were killed ...
eh iwacu ? ||| in our family ... ?
... icyo kihae muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ? ||| are you talking about the time in 1959 ?
itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] .... itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] kugeza aho . ||| yes between 1959 and 1963 , within that range ...
eh , hari abasaza ... hari abasaza , barapfuye abo basaza , ||| yes , some old men died .
ariko abandi bagiye mu mahanga banagwayo . harimo na musaza wanjye uguye muri tanzaniya . ||| though some went to exile and died there ; my brother died from tanzania .
yagiye yubatse yitwaaga kamonyo . eh , yari abyaye , yagiye tanzaniya abayo ni naho yapfairiye . ||| he migrated to tanzania when he was already married with children . he lived there untill when he died .
ariko nyuma abana be n' umugore baje kuza , yari afite abana batatu . abana be umwe yanagu ... banamwiciye hano ku mumena muri jenoside . ||| and later , his wife and children came back ; they were three children and one of them was killed during the genocide from a place called mumena .
bagiye bapfa benshi barapfuye , barabaishe barapfa . ||| several people died ; they were killed .
ni uko aba ari na kera umuntu ahari aba atabiibuka cyane . yee , ||| and since it was long time ago , somethings are hard to recall them well .
ariko barapfuye . ||| but people died a lot .
ubwo mujya kuri uwo musozi mwagarutse mu rugo ? ||| when you ran to that hill , did you return home ?
eeh , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] rero , ubwo hari hakiriho kayibanda . ||| well in 1973 , it was kayibanda still on power .
habyarimana yari umusirikare mukuru . noneho nrabiibuka hari muri mirongo irindaw na gatatu mu kwezi kwa kabiri , kuri makumyabiri n' umunani [ 28 /02 / 1973 ] , nibwo bitangiye iwacu . ||| habyarimana was chief commander . i remember it was on the 28th feb 1973 , when they attacked our home village .
barasenya ; baratwika ; bica abantu benshi . ||| they burnt and killed many people .
barabaishe benshi cyanee icyo kihae ... hari ni ... hari muramu wanjye icyo kihae iduka rye bararisenyae , ||| that time they killed so many people . i had a brother @-@ in @-@ law whose shop was destroyed .
bacikair mw' ishyamba , ||| he escaped through a bush .
baramushaka baramubura , ||| they tried to look for him but they never got him .
ariko bamusenyeye . ||| but his shop was already distroyed .
ubwongubwo turanaje turahunga tuza hano i kigali , hariya mu biryogo . ||| that time we fled and came to kigali in biryogo .
tuhageze tuhamaze ... nta mezi abiri ... nta kwezi kushize . ||| we spent there less that a month 's time .
bakora umukwabu wo kutujyana i bugesair , i maranyundo . ||| then they made a patrol of capturing all the tutsis and take them to bugesera in maranyundo .
ngirango ahari ujya wunva babivuga . nnjyae nfungaiyew i maranyundo . ||| i guess you have ever heard about it ... i am among the people who were imprisoned in maranyundo .
icyo kihae bakoze umukwabu baratutwara , ariko nabwo ari mu buryo bwo kushaka abatutsi , ||| even that time they made a patrol but it was just for getting the tutsis .
kuko turangije kubibona tugeze i bugesair . ||| we realised it when we were in bugesera .
baraje ubwo baratutunze batujyana i bugesair , i maranyundo mu ishyamba , batujyanye mu bikamyo , ||| they came and transported us to bugesera in maranyundo in the bush .
mu mabisi na ziriya modokari ... nka biriya bikamyo binini binjyaaga kuzana amayoga za gisenyi , icyo kihae barazifashe , baradutunda . ||| they used trucks , min buses , and those big cars that transport beers from gisenyi [ from bralirwa ] .
batushyiraaga hariya kuri gereza ya muhaima bahitaaga komisaliya [ commissariat ] , hari kuri komisaliya icyo kihae . ||| therefore they gathered us there in t he muhima prison . by then it was a police . it used to be called commissariat .
tukiri ahongaho ... nyuma ariko uje kugezaho urashaka ... ? ||| while still there ... meanwhile , you reached at some point and got married ... ?
yee , nyuma nrashatse hari muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] icyo kihae ... nshatse muri mirongo irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] . ||| yes , that was in 1973 . i got married in 1974 .
noneho ugize amahirwe yo kugira abana ? ||| so you had a chance of getting children ?
yee , ariko umwe yarapfuye , na se . ||| yes , but one died and the father .
noneho mu kihae cy' amashyaka se utunyurairmo uko bigenze k' umwihariko w' iwanyu uko ... niba birabagezeho kubatoteza ... ||| would you tell us briefly what happened in the period of party @-@ struggles , was your family tortured ?
igihe cy' amashyaka ayangaya ya habyarimana ? ||| during habyarimana 's party @-@ struggles ... ?
hari cdr , ||| there was cdr , mrnd there was also another party , which was suppressed or discriminated against , because they considered it to be a tutsi 's party .
hari mrnd , ||| this party was called pl .
hari ... na ... harimo n' irinri shyaka ritotezawaga naryo kuko ryari iry' abatutsi ... bavugaaga ko ari iry' abatutsi nka plariko rero amashyaka yari akazae cyane yari anakomeye mu gihugu ni cdr na mrnd . ||| but the strongest and powerful parties in the country were cdr and mrnd .
twaratotejwe cyane , ||| we were oppressed and tortured very much .
twaratotejwe iwacu mu rugo , bucyaan yapfuye baratuteye . baratuteye umugabo wanjye baramukubita , ||| after bucyana death , we were attacked and my husband was beaten .
bagenda bazi ko yapfuye . ||| they left knowing that he was died .
baratusahura , yemwe turi tutuye hariya haruguru yo kwa kabuga barahatumenaish . tukajya tugenda turaraguzwa nk' i ... nk' abatagira iyo bajya . ||| they robbed us ... by then we were living over there , near kabuga 's building .
ubwo bihereye aho baratutoteza aho tutuye bakatutoteza , ||| but we were thrown out of our house and we started sleeping around like we did have where we belonged .
kubera ariya mashyaka . ||| that was the beging of those tortures ; just from those parties .
iyo cdr yabaga yakoze imyigaragambyo , abantu bakapfa bakakubitaw , yemwe bakanabica . ||| for example whenever cdr would strike , people would be beaten ... i am telling you , people would die .
bari bafite n' amagrenade , ||| they used to have grenades .
barebaaga ahantu nka nk' aka boutike kanywairagamo abatutsi , ||| therefore , they would throw grenades to places like shops where several tutsis would attend or drink beers .
hari umugabo uri uri hariya ku muhaima baitaaga kamanda , yari afite boutique . ||| for example there was a certain man , who lived in muhima and owned a boutique .
boutique ya kamanda rero yakundaaga kunywebwamo n' abantu kuko bo biri ngombaw kugira ngo abe ariho banywair , iyo unywairaga muri ako kabari ka cdr ntiuhavaaga utakubaiswe . ||| therefore , people were obliged to drink from kamanda 's boutique because if they went to cdr 's bars they would not get out still alive .
ntawe b' abagore iyo ujyaaga kuguramo isukari , ||| even if it were women like us , we would be so careful to buy something like sugar from there .
muri boutique usitara ku muntu gato ukakubitaw . ||| because if you accidentaly stepped on somebody you would be beaten .
ubwo rero uraumva ko uwo mugabo kamanda nawe baramutoteje baranamwishe ejo bunri . ||| even kamanda was one of the people who were being menaced . infact he was killed just of recent .
ntiyari n' umugabo , yari umuntu w' umusore yari ataranashaka . ||| he was a young man not very mature ; he was n't even married .
ubwo baratoteza nta kihae batatoteje , ni birebire . ||| generally they menaced people ... there is no single day when they stopped menacing people ; it is a long story .
ubwo cdr nk' ahongaho kwa kamanda bahakubise grenade . ||| therefore , kamanda 's shop was crached with a grunade by the cdr members .

ubwo baza iwanyu ... ? ||| and finally they came to your home ... ?
ubwo nkomeje ntya , nrazamuka nyura iyo mu gakinjiro , nshoreye abana . ||| therefore , i took off throught the gakingiro road with my children .
hari muramukazi wanjye yari ari iwacu ubwo n' abana , nawe igitero kituteye yarasimbutse ajya ahantu munsi yacu , ||| i had a sister @-@ in @-@ law , she was at home with the kids ; the first time they attacked us , she jumped over and hid slightly below our home .
umudamu waho amushyira munsi y' igitanda . ||| and , a certain lady who was living there hid her under her bed .
nrazamuka nyura iyo kuri burigade , ||| i continued and passed via the police station .
kuko kuri manumetal uzamutse hariya ... kunyura hariya munsi ya manumetal hari bariyeri mbi cyane , nta muntu unayisimbukaagaho . ||| because , there at manumental ... there was a horrible roadblock that nobody would escape .
ubwo nravuga nti @: "@ reka nyurae kuri burigade , niba abajandarume bahari banrasa banrase ... banrase batanyishe ... batantemye . @" ||| therefore i said to myself , "@ i rather pass via the police and if there are policemen , they better shot me rather than being hacked . @"
ubwo ntakomeza nrazamuka abajandarume barareba abana . noneho babaza abana nri nshoreye , ||| therefore , i proceeded and the policemen saw the kids .
ngo @: "@ yemwe ba ... @" bati ... nri mpetse n' umwana . ngo @: "@ murajyahe ba sha , ||| then they ased them , "@ you kids , where are you going ... ? i was carrying another baby at my back .
ngo @: ubwo nti muri inyenzi ? @" ||| so , they again asked , "@ are you inyenzi ! @"
abana baravuga ngo hoya ntabwo turi inyenzi kubera ko yabarebaaga . ||| but the kids denied that , they were n't inyenzi though the policemen were seeing them .
ni uko , noneho aravuga ngo @: "@ ese uwo ni mama wanyu ? nti @: ||| then they asked again , "@ is that your mother ? @"
yego . araseka ati @: "@ ngaho nimugendae nimugera iyo mujya nuko ! @" ||| [ they were reffering to me ] i said , "@ yes , i am their mother . @" he mockingly laughed and said ; "@ go and die from other people 's hands . @"
nragenda nracyashoreye ba baba nkata gutya munsi y' isoko , interahamwe z' insoresore zifite n' inkota ... z' utwana nako turi utwana . ||| we continued together with the children approaching the market .
ko ubonaaga se agakuru nka ... umukuru muri bo yari afite nk' imyaka nka cumi n' ine ... ubwo ari we musore urimo . ubwo baba barantangiraiye . bati @: "@ dore we ... bati @: ||| then we met young interahamwe militia who had knives ; the oldest was about 14 years .
niko wa mugorae we ... @" nti @: ye . bati @: "@ uri iki ? @" ||| they asked me ; " who are you ? @"
nti ndi @: umuntu . ||| i replied , "@ i am a human being . @"

umwana umwe anyereka inkota yari iriho amaraso . ||| one of the young militia showed me his knife , which was stained with blood .

"@ nta maraso ureba ho ? @"@ ||| "@ do n't you see the blood stained on it ? @"

kuko hagati aho , iyo ubaga ubagezemo ... iyo ubaga ubagezemo , nta kinri ugombaaga kukora . ||| meanwhile , whenever you would be in such people 's hands , there was nothing much to do .
nta n' ubwoba ubaga ukifite . burya ntabwo ... n' uwapfuye nta bwoba yari afite . ||| you would just become so desperate and fear would disappear . even those who died , they died strong with no more fear .

ntawe utabaza ngo akutabarae , ntawe uganyira ... uravugaaga uti @: "@ imaan inyakirae uko ishaka . @" nuko . ||| no one would come for your rescure or listen to your sorrows . one would just say a simple prayer , "@ god , take my life as you wish . @"
ubwo bigeze aho hahinguka umujandarume umwe ujyaaga aza iwacu . ||| suddenly a certain policeman who used to come to our home appeared .
nramubwira nti @: "@ nyeshya ko bagiye kunyicana n' abana . @" ati @: "@ ni bande ? @" ||| then i begged him , "@ nkyesha ! they are going to kill me with my children ... @" "@ who are those ... ? @"
mu kihae akibaza ngo @: ||| he asked .
ni bande , umwe aba aciye aha , undi aciye aha , undi aciye aha . ||| and , as he was asking , the first boy disappeared and another one followed , in no time we were left only two of us .
tusigara twenyine . niwe unjyanye angeza kuri komine ... nyarugengae . kuri komine nyarugengae turahaba , ||| it was that policeman , who took me to nyarugege commune and we stayed there .
turahabaa ... tusanga icyo gipangu cy' iruhande rwa komine nyarugengae cyabohojwe n' abajepe [ gp @: ||| however , the next get to the commune was , seized by the soldiers [ the presidential guard unit ] .
umutwe uri ushinzwe kurinda perezida ] bamaze kuhunga kimihurura inkotanyi zihageze , zirahabairukanye . ||| they retreated to nyarugenge after the inkotanyi had chased them from kimihurura where they had suffered defeat in the battle with rpf soldiers .
tusanga barakibohoje harimo abagore babo n' abana babo . ||| when we reached there , we found when they had siezed that gate and the house was full of their wives and children .
turi ... icyo kihae turi abantu benshi bahahungiye , abavuye za kivugiza , ||| i remember we were many people , who had got to seek refuge there .
abavuye za ... aho hose za cyahafi za muhaima . turi benshi cyane turi abantu bageze ku ijana na mirongo inani . nuko ubwo baanga ko tuhajya bati @: "@ ntitugiye kuterana na ziriya nyenzi . @" ||| some were coming from those ends of kivugiza , cyahafi , muhima ... we were very many about one hundred and eighty [ 180 people ] they refused to allow us in saying that , we should go and join those nyenzi [ cockroaches ] .
hari , hari interahamwe yitwa katahwema ni umunyagisenyi we yari interahamwe iteye ubwoba , yari n' umutagisimani mbere . ||| in a group of interahamwe who came to kill us , there was a taxi driver called kadahwema , a notorious killer from gisenyi .
katahwema nrabiibuka yari yambaye tenue [ imyenda ya gisirikare ] kuva hasi kugera hejuru . yarabaye nk' umusirikare . yaraje ahakura abantu ... ahakura abantu benshi cyane ... cyane ntazi n' umubare ahari . nuko katahwema yari afite imbunda ; ||| who wore a military uniform and was armed with a gun .
yari afite icyuma ; yari yaravuye mu ... hano kwa bikinri mu ntuza ... zari za nterahamwe zo kwa bikinri . yari umunyagisenyi yari uwo iwabo . nuko , ||| they killed many people mostly men and the rest of us were taken to gakinjiro where we were put on a line and started killing men .
hariya turi turi hari abantu benshi , haguye abantu benshi ... yemwe nnjyae icyo kihae hari baraje baratutwara , ariko bamaze kuica abantu benshi cyane . abantu baitwa abagabo benshi bari bamaze kupfa n' abagore bapfuye benshi cyane . ||| after all the men were killed , our turn came .
ntawe baza kututwara baratumanukaan hepfo mu gakinjiro hepfo . bica abagabo turi kumwe , turi ku murongo . bica abagabo turi kumwe , ||| but before they had killed any of us ( woman ) one of the interahamwe milicious from butaro said ; "@ as you are going to finish them all , who shall escort our parent habyarimana after on the day of his burial ?
bamaze kubica bageze ku bagorae , interahamwe imwe iravuga ngo iwabo ni muri butaro . aravuga ngo @: ||| i order now , do n't kill those ladies .
"@ eh ! ko nreba n' abangaba mugiye kubica , ngo umubyeyi wacu ni tumushyingura tuzamworosa iki ? ngo @: ||| take them back . @"
nravuze ngo nimurekae abo bagorae ... ngo nimubasubizeyo . @" ni uko tuvuye kuri uwo mwobo , n' abandi bagenzi bajyae turi kumwe . ||| that was how we left that pit hole with several other people we were together .
ubwo tuba ahongaho turahanambair , ||| therefore , we stayed there waiting for our fate to come ; each day one would think it was the last da .
mbese buri munsi ubaga uzi ko uri bupfae . uzi ko n' utapfa ninjoro upfa ku manywa . kugeza igihe inkotanyi zizaiye , ||| believing that if you survive at night , you would die at noon .
zirahabohoza nizo zatubohoje , zituryana saint andre . nuko tura ... intambara rero ubwo iba irashize , baba barahosheje ibyo kutuica , ||| we lived in such dilema till when the rpf soldiers invaded and liberated us . they took us in saint andre [ secondary school ] and that was the end of war .
kugeza na n' ubu turiho . ariko rero ubundi umuntu wishe , ukoze biriya ... ariya mahano yo kuica , bari bakwaiye kujya bahanaw by' intangarugero ... by' intangarugero . ||| they stopped those killing but the perticipants should be purnished accordingly .... as an exemplary .
kandi ikindi aya mateka ya jenoside ... y' itsembabwoko ntazarekae kubaho , kandi ntituzarekae kuibuka . ||| and secondly , the genocide history should be maintained and we should never forget .
n' umwana n' umwuzukuruza n' ubuvivi buzaza , azazae azi ko icyo kintu kibayeho . ari ibitabo abisomae ; ||| let all the coming generations ever in life learn that "@ there was genocide in rwanda . @" they should read it from books , hear from the tales of witnesses who will be present by then , but never let the history die .
ari ukiriho ubizi amusobanuraire uko bigenze . ariko bye kucika , kuko tugomba kuhora tuibuka abacu , tukaibuka n' ibyabaye . ||| because we must keep remembering our beloved ones who died and remember what happened .
baramupfuka , nnjyae nbibwiraw n' abantu bacikaiye ku icumu hariya muri chk . babajyanayo hari inkomerae nyinshi nk' izo , ||| this is a story that i was told by the people who survived from chk hospital . that there were several injuries in chk that were injured like him .
bakapfuka kusa ariko ntibavurae ... ntibashyiraeho umuti . ||| that they used to only cover them without applying any medicine .
ngo baza na none kutwaraw n' undi ngo witwa kamashini , ||| later there came another notorious killer called kamashini , who took them away .
niwe ukoraaga muri chk . ubwo niwe wicaga abantu bo muri chk , ||| he was the one responsible for all killings that took place at chk hospital .
ngo abajyana muri camp kigali . muri camp kigali rero niho babiciye , ngo babajombagura ibyuma , babanoboramo amaso . ||| so he took them to kigali military camp , where they were chopped with bayonettes and their eyes were scooped out before thier death . that is part of what i heard .
nabyo nrabimenye . ariko ubwo muri yari ari muri bariya bakoze muri chk babahambye hariya ku irebero . nuko , ||| my husband is among those who died from chk and he was exhumed and reburied in rebero .
ni uko bigenze . ||| that is what happened .
umwana wanjye we yarapfuye ahambye hariya mu gakinjiro , ||| and about my died child ; my baby died and it was buried in gakingiro .
yari mutoya kubera ko yari ku ibere , ||| it was still young fed on breast milk .
yazize inzara ... kubura ikimutunga we yarapfuye . ||| therefore , it died of hunger due to stavation .
icyo kusa . ||| that is all .
ntawunri wawewa ... ? ||| what about others in your family ?
uwunri wanjye amateka yabo numva , ntabwo ntabwo bari i kigali . ariko hari n' undi mukobwa wa mukuru wanjye nawe uri mu cyahafi , nabo babataye muri wc [ umusarane ] , ||| another person of whom i remember , they were not living in kigali . but i remember my niece who lived in cyahafi . they were dumped in a latrine .
ibuka niyo yabataburuyemo igihe baongera kutaburura na none abantu gutyo , babajyana ku gisozi . ||| their bodies were exhumed by ibuka and taken to gisozi memorial site for reburial .
nabo bari ku gisozi , ||| their remains are in their final resting @-@ place at gisozi together with others .
ni we n' umugabo we , n' umugabo wabo , n' abana babo babiri . ||| it is my niece and her husband and their two children .
icyo kihae babashyize muri wc [ umusarane ] yabo . yee , ||| they were dumped in their own latrine .
abandi rero ... ||| other people ...
ntabwo wibuka mbese uko babaishe , ||| do n't you remember how they were killed ?
niba bari babatemaguye se cyangwa ... ||| were they hacked to death or ... ?
yee , ||| yes of course they are there .
barabatemaguye babateraguye ibyuma , ndetse n' interahamwe nkuru yabo ... bari baturanye , iracyafunze kaereka niba yaraemeye icyaha akaba azavamo , ||| they were hacked and others were chopped with knives . in fact , the one who was the chief of interahamwe in their home area was arrested . unless he admit his crimes and get released .
cyangwa se wenda yanavuyemo . mu cyahafi se ... [ arimyoza ] ntinkunda kujyayo . ||| or maybe he is already released ... in cyahafi ... [ she gulped ] i do n't often go there .
haba se ha hari abo mu muryango wawe ushoboye kushyingura ? ||| do you have some of your family members that you managed to exhume and reburry officially ?
oya kaereka abongabo kusa . ||| no .
kaereka umugabo wanjye ugiye hariya nkaba nri nbizi ko ariho yari ari , niwe bashyinguye mu rwe ... mu kihae bwa mbere . ||| except my husband who i knew where he was buried and went there .
n' abongabo bo mu cyahafi . eh , ariko hari na mukuru wanjye ubaga hariya i kitaarama , i musambair umugabo we niwe umushyinguye ... we yaramushyinguye iruhande rw' itongo rye . ||| i also had a sister who lived in gitarama , in musambira district . it was her husband who organised for her reburial ceremony .
ariko abandi bari i butare , ntabwo babashyinguye kuko ntabwo bazi ... ntibazi aho baguye mbese . ntabwo bazi aho ari ho . ||| others were in butare but they have n't been exhumed becausedf no one knows exactly where they were dumped after being killed .
bari hariya i nyamure ... bari i nyamure ... mu karerae ka nyamure . ||| however we know they were killed in nyamure . in nyamure district there was a big number of people who died there . i realised that when i attended a burial ceremony there .
haguye abantu benshi cyane nigeze kujya kushyingura yo . ntinkubwira niba bari muri urwo ruhande , ||| however i can n't tell if my people 's remains were among those we buried that day .
niba bari mu rundi , ||| i can n't even guess if they were in another side .
ntabwo nbizi . ||| i do n't know .
utubwiye uti ... ugeza aho inkotanyi zabagejeje muri saint andre ; ese nyuma y' aho bigenze bite ? kugeza ubungubu ubayeho utae ? mwavuye muri saint andre ... ||| you told us that the inkontanyi helped you ... they took you to saint andre but can you tell us how you left that place and your life experience in sait andre ... ?
oya ntabo . abenshi ... abahari bo mu muryango wanjye , ni abagira ihungabana kusa mbese ryo kutekereza ibya jenoside . no kuba birabaye bareba , ||| no , i would be lying if i said yes .
cyokora hari n' ufite ubumuga , umukobwa wa mukuru wanjye umwe barashe gutya , baraongera bamurasa n' isasu aha rihushura igufwa , rinyura mu nyama riragenda . ||| but still there are some who have been traumatized and one of my nieces who is handicapped by bullets and has an amputated arm ; she was shot and she watched her arm born jumping out of her body through the muscles .
ubwo ni ikibazo nawe arakifite cya jenoside . n' ihungabana ubona ararifite ntabwo ... si neza cyane . ||| so she was also terribly affected by the genocide
murabana ? ||| do you live with her ?
oya aba i nyamirambo aba kwa se . ||| no , she lives in nyamirambo at her father 's place .
ubwo se nawe yararokotse ... se yararokotse . ||| her father too survived .
ikindi hano nkubaza , nyine nyuma y' itsembabwoko ... eh , inkotanyi zikifata igihugu hagiyeho inzego inzego za leta ; bashakaaga kugirango abanyarwanda baongerae basubiraane , ||| after the genocide when the inkotanyi liberated the country , there were several government bodies that came up , whicha emphasis much on unity and reconciliation policies .
mbese habaeho ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . wowe iyo ureba ubumwe n' ubwiyunge hagati y' abahutu baishe abatutsi , wunva bishoboka ? ||| form your personal point of view , do you thing it will work out for the hutus who perticipated in the genocide to reconciliate with the tutsi survivors ?
ariko rero ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge , ||| by the way , the issue of unity and reconciliation is not easy .
nabyo ntibyoroshye . ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge usanga ari ibintu ... nk' umuntu ukorewe biriya bintu kuiyunga n' umuntu wa ukuiciye , ||| those ideas of unity and reconciliation are more like ... sincerely , reconciling with some one who killed your people , is next to imposible ; where would one gain that spirit in order to reconcile ?
ntinzi ahantu bituruka mbese kugirango muiyungae . numva ntinzi ... ubwo ntinzi uko biba bimeze . ntinzi intangiriro rwose yabyo uko biza . ||| i wonder what would have happened , for such people to reconcile . i can n't even imagine the beginning of all the act of reconciliation .
ese ko umuntu yiyunga n' uwo bavugana ; ||| a person can reconciliate with one whom they talk .
ukaiyunga n' umuntu umubwira uti @: ||| let 's say ; one can tell the other that , "@ please i am sorry !
"@ nbabarira nkututse . @" ||| i insulted you . forgive me . @"
ese umuntu ukuiciye akakuicira abantu makumyabiri , azaza akubwira ngo tuiyungae koko ... gutya bishobokae ? ||| but i can n't imagine someone who killed more than twenty people of your family members , standing infront someone asking him or her to reconcile . how possible would that be ?
ko ari ikibazo ! simbizi ntinzi ko ... wenda ntinzi uko bizateguraw , ariko simbizi . ||| it is a problem maybe there is a way they are planning to do it , which i can n't imagine .
ubona iriya commission ibaishijew se izagera ku nshingano zayo ... byo byoroshye ? ||| so , do you thing that the commission in charge of unty and reconciliation will reach its goals easily ?
iriya commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ? iriya commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge rero , ||| you are talking about that commission of unity and reconciliation ... ?
wenda ahari izabigeraho simbizi , ariko se njyae nbona atari vuba . ||| that commission ... maybe it will succeed , who knows ?
nbona bitazashoboka vuba . ntabwo bizashoboka vuba , kuko n' uwakwiciye afite umujinya . ||| though it will require them a lot of time . it seems too impossible to achieve their goals in a short time .
ukanabibona akanabikwereka . ||| because , it is astonishing how those who perticipated in the genocide [ interahamwe malicious ] still have strong hatred and whenever they see you , they try to show you that they still hate you .
ubwo se uwo muzaiyunga mutae ? ko akurusha umujinya ariwe ukuhemukaiye . ||| so , how do you expect reconciliation to take place since he or she , who did those things has more grievance than the one he or she hurt ?
hari urwego rurebaan na jenoside nyine yabaye mu rwanda , ||| there are other organisations concerned with the rwandan genocide , which are non @-@ governmental .
uretse inzego za leta hariho n' andi ma commission menshi nk' ayo y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ... ariko mu rwego rw' ubucamanza harimo , eh ... imanza bazaca muri iyi minsi , ||| plus several other commissions around the contry like that of unity and reconciliation .
ndetse zanatangiye imanza baita iza gacaca , ||| and there are also judicially commissions called gacaca . i guess , are in operation .
zo uba uzivugaho iki ? ||| what can you say about them ?
hari icyo zizacyemura mu rwego rwo kuhana kuhana abazize ... abakoze itsembabwoko . ||| do think they are going to help in purnishing those who perticipated in the genocide ?
igihugu cyacu aho kigana kugirango kigira iterambere , numva nk' abanyarwanda bose bashyira hamwe . bakaubaka igihugu . ||| in order for our country to experience development in the future , all rwandans should put their hands together and try to build their nation .
ariko bizateraw n' iki ? no kuca umuco wo kutahana . niba utekereza kukora ikintu runaka kitari kiza , ||| but this shall be achieved only if they try to eliminate the habit of not purnishing .
cyo ... cyo ... cyane icyo ubwicanyi nicyo kishenye n' iki gihugu , ||| whoever that has plans of doing bad deeds especialy killings because it was one of the deeds that led into distruction of our nation .
ahanawe hariya ku mugaragaro . ahanawe biboneka , ||| should be punished in public where everybody will be seeing in order to frighten those who have the same plans .
n' undi ubitekereza agirae ubwoba . avugae ati @: ||| because they will know that , if they do the same thing , they will be treated in the same way .
"@ nimbikora nrabizira . @" icyo kihae hagati aho ni bicika igihugu kuzaubakaw , kibae kiza . rero kugira ngo igihugu cyacu ki ... kizabae kiza , ||| therefore , if they stop that habit [ not punishing ] the country will be built and will become pleasing .
abakiri batoya bazakomezae mu majyambere , baigae , bagirae icyo baungura igihugu ; ||| therefore , in order for our contry to be pleasing , the young ones will have to continue in the line of development ; they will have to finish their studies and improve our contry .
ni uko mbere na mbere nibabanze baumvaishe ba bantu bafite umutima mubi wo kuica abantu , n' uyu munsi bakiwufite ... kandi barawufite ! ||| first of all , they have to know that the killers still have the intentions of killing .
babanzae babaumvaishe ko bagomba kubaan n' abandi neza , hatarimo ubwicanyi . ||| therefore , they have to first sencitize them and teach them that , they have to live with others peacefully without killing .
nka bariya bantu bo ku gikongoro nk' uko bavuze ko babakataiye urwo kupfa , ||| fir example those people in gikongoro whom they sentenced to death .
kandi bazabarasa kumugaragaro , ibyo ... buriya nibakora biriya ntabwo ku gikongoro ... nraizera ko bitakaongera . nibaramuka babikoze koko ku mugaragaro bahamagaye abantu bose , ntabwo bikaongera . ||| i hope they will shut them in open . and i believe that , if they do it in public , i guess in gikongoro there will be no more killings .
kuko ntawabona bamushyize ku giti hariya , noneho yumvae ko akwaiye kubikora , ngo bamushyirae ku giti . ||| because no one can see his fellow being shot on a tree and then he goes a head with his wrong plans that would take him to the same tree .
ibyo rero ni ukuca ... ni ukurandura umuco utahana nyine nibyo byiza . ibyo baramutse babikoze igihugu cyacu kitera inberae . kuko n' abahungabana , ||| therefore , eliminating the habit of ont punishing is the best . if they do so , our country will develop .
no mu bihungabanya abantu babonye jenoside ... bahuye nayo bataotaijew , na biriya byo ku gikongoro bijemo . kuko twarahungabanye tuesae tutanahaegereye . ||| because those are one of the things that distablise genocide survivors . because when we had about what took place in gikongoro , we were all afraid .
tuhise tuumva ko ntawe tuesae ariko tugomba kumera . ||| we thought the same thing would happen to us ...
ikindi nkubaza , urabona ubu ni ubuhamya bwawe , nk' umuntu tuvuga mukuru . ||| another thing i would like to ask you ; this is your personal testimony as a mature person .
bukaba kandi buzarebaw n' abana bawe , ndetse n' abo bazabyara kuko buzabikwa mu ahabigenewe ku buryo buzamara igihe . ||| and your own children plus your grandchildren will see this testimony because it will be kept in the appropriate place for the future .
tuifuzaaga y' uko ukurikije ibihe unyuzemo ; ukurikije ubuzima bukomeye ugiye unyuramo uri mu itotezaw . hari uko ugiye ubyigobotora ; ||| therefore , according to your life experience ... the hard times you experienced , definitely there must have been a way you found yourself out of it .
hari n' ubwo ababyeyi bawe bakubwiraaga bati @: "@ ntacyo ... kora gutya kugirango twigobotore mu buzima bubi . @" ||| maybe sometimes your parents would tell you to do this or that in order to defeat some tough situations .
ndagirango utubwirae muri make impanuro uha abana @: ||| in brief , please tell us the advice you would give to the young children .
ari abawe ; n' abaza ... n' abazaba abana babo , nka nyirakuru . ||| especially your children and those that will generate from them ; they will be your grand children .
ndetse n' abandi bana b' igihugu . icyo bakora nk' impanuro wowe ubwawe ubaha kugirango babae abantu , bazashoborae no kugira ubuzima bwiza . ||| in general what is your advice to the children of this nation ? what should they do in order to become responsible people in the future ?
impanuro nha rero abana bakiri batoya , icya mbere ni ukugira urukundo . ||| the advice i can give to young children ... first of all they should learn how to love .
icya mbere ni ukugira urukundo ; ||| the first thing id to love .
ikindi bakihatira kuiga , kuko nta buzima bwiza bazagira batize . ||| sencondly they should put much effort in education because there will be no bright future for them if they do n't go to school .
bakaiga bakagira urukundo ; ||| they should study and love each other .
ikintu cyo kungana bakakirandura mw' isi ikibaho . ||| they should avoid hatred among them in all their lifetime on earth .
nihaza urukundo nta n' ikizabura na kimwe . ||| because where there is love , nothing misses .
abana bato nibakundana ... kandi n' ubundi buriya , kugirango n' abo bana batoya bajyae kuba interahamwe babitewe n' abakuru . nibagair urukundo , ||| therefore , the youngones should love each other . i guess even those kids who became interahamwe ; it was due to their elders .
bakaigishwa urukundo , ||| but if the children experiences love , and be taught about love rather than hate .
ntibaishwe ibyo kuanga ... ngo @: "@ uriya mututsi . @" ||| and avoid seeing their fellows and say , "@ look at that tutsi . @"
nk' uko n' ubundi babibaigishije . ||| like they used to learn in the past . in the past .
n' umwana w' umututsi akakura azi ko ari umututsi utotezaw , ||| tutsi children used to believe that they were ment to be menaced .
nko muri jenoside hari nk' u ... nk' abana ... ubwiraaga umuntu ati @: "@ unbabariye ko ntazaongera kuba umututsi . @" ||| like during the genocide , some children would tell the killers that , "@ please forgive me , i will never be a tutsi again . @"
ibaze w' uruhinja ! ni uko yari azi ko bamutoteza kubera ko ari umututsi . ||| just imagine , those were very young children but they already knew that they were menaced because they were tutsis .
bakarandura rero umuco wo kungana . kusa bakamenya ko umunyarwanda ari umunyarwanda . ||| therefore , hatred should be up rooted and they should only keep in mind that there are only rwandans .
bakamenya ko umuntu ari umuntu agomba kubaho , ||| and , every human being has a right to live .
atagomba kuicwa . ||| no one should be killed .
ubwo nicyo kintu kizagirair rero abakiri batoya akamaro . ||| that is the most important thing for the young ones .
nibakundana umuntu akamenya ati @: "@ njyewe ngomba kuiigair amashuli , nkikorera nkazageza ahangaha , " undi ati @: ||| if they love each other , one would be knowing that , "@ i have to study for my own life . @"
"@ ngomba kukora iki . @" ||| and the other one would say , "@ i want to do this and that . @"
nimba ari ubucuruzi ashoboye , ati @: ||| if he or she is good at business , then he or she should run business .
"@ reka nikurikirire ncuruzae ; " niba ari n' uhinga , amenye ko agomba kuhinga . ariko nyuma atagiye muri wa muco wo kuanga umuntu ngo uriya ni uyu . ||| if one is good at cultivatng , then she or he should mean business and cultivate . but forgeting that habit of having second thoughts about his or her fellows .
niyo mpanuro nha abana batoya . ||| that is my advice for children .
ubwo ngirango nink' impanuro y' abana batoya b' abanyarwanda muri rusangae . ariko nifuzaaga ko kubw' umwihariko ku bana bakiriwe itsembabwoko , ko hari icyo uba ... ubabwira mu rwego rwo kuiyubaka . ||| hope that is the advice to the children in general . now can you give any piece of advice to the children who were affected by the genocide ? what advice can you offer them about how to improve on them selves ?
mu rwego rwo kuiyubaka , abana bakorewe itsembabwoko basigaye iheruheru , batagira ababyeyi ; ||| in the flame of development ... children who experienced genocide were left in misery without parents .
batagira umuryango . bakwaiye kuihangana . bakikurikirair kuiga . ||| they were left homeless , they should be strong and patience and , mind about their education .
yego nta buzima burimo bwiza , kuko mu mutawe wabo hara ... haratobamye . iyo umwana atafite umubyeyi burya nta ... nta kiza aba afite . ||| i know there is no good life , their heads had frozen . because , when a child has no parents , life seem to be meaningless .
ariko nibihangane kuko nta kunri tubigenza . ||| therefore they should be strong because there is no alternative .
yihanganae nbona uwo wahuje ikibazo bakundanae baganirae , nbona umubyeyi nkanjyae uhuye n' icyo kibazo , ||| if they come across their fellows with the same problems , they should befriend one another and talk about their problems .
amwegere amubwirae . niba ... wenda umubyeyi aramubwira ati @: "@ ihanganae mwana wanjye uzae kuza tuganirae . @" ||| if it is a parent , she will tell them that , "@ my children come we chat a bit . @"
iteka ryose iyo muhuye mwarahuje icyo kibazo , hari n' aho bikuruhura kubera kubona uwo uwibwira , mubivuganaho unabizi . ||| ever , when you meet with people you experienced the same problem ; you fell relieved just because you found someone to tell about your problems , someone who understands it .
yee , ni icyo nbabwira rero ... abana be ... ese bahuye n' ibyo bibazo ... icyo nbabwira ni uko bakundana nabo ubwabo , ||| that is what i can advise them . children who faced that problem should love and know each other .
baaka ... bakamenyaan , ibibazo bakamenya kuegera wa mukecuru cyangwa wa musaza uhuye n' ibyo bibazo . ||| if they meet challeges , they should learn how to adress those problems to the older people who were once in the same situation .
akababwira iyo uri umuntu mukuru uhumuriza umwana , ukamubwira uti @: "@ ihanganae nta kunri bimeze . @" yaba ari no hafi yawe , ||| because grown @-@ ups know how to comfort children . you can tell a child that , "@ be strong there is no alternative . @"
ukagerageza no kumusura , nawe akakusura . ||| and if you are neighbours , then you try to visit each other .
akamenya ko hari umuntu usigaye bahuje icyo kibazo . ||| that helps the children to know that there are some other people who faced the same problems like they did .
ubundi nk' impanuro uhaga abana , by' umwihariko abacitse ku icumu bahuye n' icyo kibazo . ||| that is the piece of adice that you have passed to the children .
ariko noneho ... ntacyo ubwira noneho abakoze itsembabwoko ? ||| what about those who perticipated in the genocide ?
ni ubuhe butumaw ubaha ? ||| what message can you give them ?
abakoze itsembabwoko ? [ arimyoza ] yewe ! ||| the perpetrators ?
abakoze itsembabwoko ... ibyo se ... ubwo ... buriya rero bariya bantu ... kubabwira se ubwo nbabwira ... umva simbabwira ngo @: ||| i wonder what to tell them ; i can not tell them that , "@ never do it again . @" because if they had a chance they would repeat it today .
"@ ntibazaongerae . @" ||| most of them do n't even agree that they perticipated in the genocide .
kuko ku giti cyabo bashobora no kaongera uyu munsi . bariya rero , abenshi ntibanemera ko babikoze , kandi arabihakana kandi wowe yarabikoze ureba . ||| they deny it yet you witnessed them doing those deeds .
ubu se nmuha mpanuro ki ? ||| therefore , which kinds of advice can one give such a person ?
ahubwo bihanae nabo niba baumva ku mutaima ... niba baumva ku mutaima ... umutima uba ... ubibabwira ... ubacira urubanza . ||| instead they should repent for their sins in they feel it down inside their hearts ... if their hearts haunts them .
ageragezae kugirango wenda yigirae hari asabae n' imbabazi da ! niba asabae n' imaan imbabazi . kuko na bariya baishwe ni ibiremwa by' imaan yiremeye . ||| they should try to say the truth and ask for forgiveness as they say . they should repent before god because even those they killed were god 's creatures .
nibasabe imbabazi mbere yo kunsaba imbabazi . kuko nibemera bakaibuka imaan , bakayisaba imbabazi , ||| therefore they should repent before god because if they do so , they will be able to ask me to forgive them .
nnjyae nibambona ntacyo bazantwara . ||| and i will be sure that if we met somewhere , they would never hurt me .
bariya rero kaubaha impanuro [ arimyoza ] numva ntazi ibyo aribyo . ||| i just do n't know the kind of advice i should give to such people .
ubundi iyo umuntu yahuye n' amahano nk' aya , aba afite ikintu yibuka cya kera . we yumva ko kigarutse kimuha amahoro . ||| normally when someone ever faced such scandles , always there is an event or something from his or her past , which he or she remembers and wishes to see again in order to gain peace of mind .
tuvugae hari ubwo ubanaaga n' umugabo wawe amagambo yakundaaga kukubwira akakunyura ; ||| for example ; in your marriage life , there were some words that your husband used to say to you and those words made you feel so good .
abana bawe ... n' uwo upfuye , ||| it maybe your children ... the one who died ... or your neighbours .
abaturanyi bawe ... muri wowe wunva wibuka iki kikutera agahinda kurusha ibindi ? akaba ari nk' ingaruka y' itsembabwoko . ||| personally , what do you remember that gives a lot of sorrows more than other things yet it was as a result of the genocide ?
ku giti cyanjye ... nk' iyo ngize ibibazo cyane nk' ubu umuntu ... abana baiga , nk' ubu abana baiga ukabona habuze ... ukabona habuze ikaye ukabona habuze ikaramu , ukabona umwana arakubwiye uniforme , ukabona abaiga primaire bo turabaiishyurair . ||| personally , when i get a lot of problems , let us say ; i have children who go to school , then you see them missing books , pens or a uniform ... for example , primary school children we pay their fees .
ukabona ati @: "@ mwarimu aranyirukanye ngo nta gahimbazamuswi utuha ... umpaye , " yee , ||| and then you see your child coming back home that the teacher has chased them because you never sent him money .
aho uraibuka ... aho nrabiibuka . nrabiibuka . ||| i remember ... that is when i remember , when life becomes hard .
iyo imibereho ... hari igihe nshobora kubona nti ... nta ... noneho ejo ntibazarya , ejo ntibazabaho , ejo bazajya kuiga bariye iki ? ||| some times i get worried , "@ what will they eat tomorrow ? what will take before going to school ?
cyangwa se barararair iki ? ||| or what will they have for dinner ? @"
aho nibuka ko iyo baba bafite se , ||| then i say , "@ if they had a father , would n't have been this worried . @"
nba ntabiibaza . ibyo kandi nta n' ubwo biri kuri jyae njyenyine n' ukuntu ... umubyeyi wese ... ibyo arabigira . uwahuye n' icyo kibazo wese . ||| well i am not alone , it happens to every parent who faced that problem of genocide .
wunva se , kugira ngo ugeragezae kubiikuramo , kugira ngo ugeragezae ku ... n' ubwo uhuye n' ubwo buzima bikakubabaza , ||| in order to avoid those feelings though you faced those problems .
ugerageza kubiikuramo utae kuri wowe n' iki ukora ? ibingibi impamvu nbikubaza , ni uko harimo na ... n' uwabona ubuhamya bwawe , ||| how do you fight againest those feelings ? what do you do personally ? the reason why i ask you such questions is , there are some people who may learn from you after they have seen your testimony .
ati @: "@ nzaiganae uriya mukecuru , ukuntu agenda yikura mu makuba . bikaba nk' urugero kuri we . @" ||| the way you stand in tough situations may be a leason to her of him .
dore rero iyo ujya kubiikuramo , uratekereza uti @: "@ hariya hari imfubyi ... muri iriya nzu habamo impfubyi zibana enye cyangwa eshanu . ||| this is what you do to avoid such feelings ; you think about the orphans around you ... in that house , there are about four or five orphans who are living togeher .
ni ukuvuga ngo harimo umukuru umwe ubaye umubyeyi wabo ; ||| it means that , the oldest of all acts as a parent to the rest and she or he is taken to be in charge of the whole home .
witwa nyir' urugo . ukiha urugero uti @: "@ se bariya bana ntibari aho . @" ||| then you reflect their example to your life and say , "@ how come those orphans survive ? @"
ukaongera ukareba na none n' undi mugenzi wawe . ukavuga uti @: "@ ese buriya , ||| and again , you think about your fellow survivors and ask yourself , "@ how are they surviving ? @"
nibabarirae se njyenyine ? @" ni naho kibera kiza ... ninaho bibera byiza . kubona tubana mu midugudu burya ... iyo uri kumwe mu midugudu n' umuntu muhuje ikibazo hari ibikaubaka burya . ||| by considering other people 's lives , it will help you . we live together in the same residence for the survivors , but it is useful for us because we are neighbbouring each other yet we have the same problems .
birakaubaka kuko uhita wibaza ko icyo kibazo atari wowe kireba wenyine . ukavuga uti @: "@ ese ko abandi bihangana , ||| therefore , you refer to your fellows and ask yourself , "@ how come they are still strong ?
reka nnjyae nihanganae . @" ||| let me try and be strong too . @"
ni icyo kibikukuramo nta kinri . ||| that is all that can help someone .
ariko uri wenyine uhae ... ahubwo uhera hasi uhora uri mu bibazoo ... iyo bikugonze uragenda ukaiegerair n' abandi mukaseka . ||| but , if you are lonely you may spend your entire life in problems .
kandi wenda hakaba n' igihe musanga murabihuje , naho ubundi mukisekair mukisengera mukabiha imaan . yee , ||| otherwise , when you are challeged by problems , you join others and laugh , share a drink and dedicate the rest to god .
nicyo kitufasha rero kenshi . ||| that is what helps us most of the time .
nta kinri wunva ukaongera ku ... ku buhamya utuhaye ? ||| do n't you have something to add on the testimony you have given us ?
nk' ubutumwa utanga ku bantu bazareba ubu buhamya . ||| what message can you leave for the people who will see this testimony in the future ... ?
cyangwa se ku ... ubutumwa bwo kuihanganaish se , cyangwa se ... uwo ariwe wese ushaka kuha ubutumwa , cyangwa ubuhamya . ||| it may be a message of comfort to any one of your wish ... it may be a testimony ?
ubuhamya nvuga , n' uko tugomba kuihangana tuesae abahuye na jenoside . kuko turanihanganye ibyo ari byo byose , ||| the message i can give to all those who faced the genocide is to be strong .
turanihanganye . ||| though all the time we have been strong .
imyaka icumi ni myinshi . turi aho , ||| ten years is a big thing !
turimo tugenda n' amaguru . ukabona umuntu ntasaze , ukabona ntasebyae , ukabona uri aho imyaka irashize , ||| yet no one has ever run mad or looking funy .
ni ukukomeza tukihangana . ||| therefore , we have to keep it up and remain strong .
ni ukukomeza tukihangana kuko uko imyaka ishira , uko abana bacu bakura uko baiga , niko imyaka iri inberae tu ... ibibazo bizagenda bigabanuka . ||| because as years go by and as far as our children are growing and going to school , our problems will go on reducing .
ubu ... hari icyo imyaka icumi ishize , ejo bunri hazabaho kuibuka ku nshuro ya cumi jenoside ibaye mu rwanda . ||| ten years have passed and in few days to come there will be an occasion of commemorating for the ten years that have passed after the genocide , which took place in rwanda .
bibaye amahanga yose yaraemeye ko jenoside yabaye mu rwanda . ||| all other nations admmitted that there was genocide in rwanda .
wowe hari icyo bikubwiye kaumva ko amahanga yumvise ko jenoside yabaye mu rwanda . ||| does it have any meaning to you , hearing that other countries agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
biranshimaishije cyane . ||| i was very happy .
kuberako hari ikintu kitubabazaaga . hari nk' a ... nk' abantu b' abanyamahanga bazaaga , ||| because some of the things that used to hurt us ... for example there are some foreigners who used to come here in avega .
akenshi babazaanaga hariya tutuye ... abantu bakaza nko muri avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba jenoside ] kusaba ... kusaba ko bagera hariya iwacu . kureba ngo abo bantu bahuye na jenoside , hari na ... na bariya b' abayahudi baraje , baje iwacu . ||| and they would ask permission to meet us because they realy wanted to see those people who were victimised by the genocide .
harimo n' umudage , yee . ntinibuka n' abandi baje . barahaje nabo bahuye n' ikibazo kisa nk' icyacu . ||| the jews also came to see us ; among those who came , there was a lady ... i do n't remember other people who came with her but some time ago , they also experienced genocide like we did .
ariko hari uwaje aratubwira ati @: "@ njyae ndi umwuzukuru w' abantu bakorewe jenoside . ati @: ||| one of them told us that , "@ my grandparents are victims of the holocaust .
nri nzi ko mu rwanda tubibonye n' uko tubiumvise , ati turi tuzi ko tusanga tu ... mwasaze ... muri abasazi , nta n' umuntu unabageramo . ||| according to what we saw and heard , we thought that in rwanda we would find when people had gone crazy . we thouhght that , it would be very hard to get close to you .
ati @: none rwose ... ati @: nrabona murasa neza , ||| but surprisingly you look good !
muraseka . ati @: muraseka ! @" ||| you are still able to wear a smile ! @"
ukabona aratangaye . ||| and for sure , she was astonished .
hari n' undi rero utubwiye ati @: ||| however , there was another person who came and told us that , "@ we do n't agree that what happened here was genocide .
"@ ntabwo twebwe tuemeraaga jenoside ... ko ibyo uko tuumvaaga ibyabaye mu rwanda ntitubiemeraaga . @" kutabiemera rero kwabo bikatubabaza . ||| according to what we heard that happened here , we do n't believe it was genocide . @" therefore , that denial of the genocide would terribly hurt us because we would n't imagine why they would denay genocide yet it happened !
ntituumva igituma batabiemera kandi birabaye . ||| so what amases us is the fact that all nations agreed and realised that genocide happened in rwanda .
none rero ikintu kidu ... kishimaishije rwose ikintu kinshimaishije ni uko amahanga yose yarangije kuemera ko ... no kubibona , ||| it is so amasing .
ko bibaye koko . ibyo bintu birashimaishije cyane . kuhora iteka tubiibuka . nabyo mu binyubaka biranyubaka . ||| and among the things that keep me strong , is commomerating the genocide all the time .
urarangije ? ||| have you finished ?
ubwo nyine baherako baramukubita , nawe yari ikimuga bari baramukubise muri icyo kihae . ||| so they started beating him yet he was already lame as a result of previous beatings .
ariko icyo kihae a ... batubwiraaga ibyo tuumvaaga ari nka histoire [ amateka ] , ntabwo utekerezaaga ko habaho jenoside nk' iyo tubonye . ||| people used to tell us about those days but for us it was just history , we never thought of something like the genocide we saw would ever happen .
tukaumva ari ibintu bya histoire [ amateka ] mbese nk' uko wenda nk' abana tuzabyara wenda bazaza baumva ko ari histoire [ amateka ] . ||| probably in the same way our children will be taking it as history .
nyuma yaho ubwo nyine ubuzima buragiye bukomeza . ||| later life went on as it used to be .
bukomeza uko bisanzwe turakura , bigeze muri za mirongo yenda [ 1990 ] na ... mirongo cyenda na kabiri [ 1992 ] , nanohe i bugesair hatangira kuza umwuka mubi . tukajya tuumva bavuga ngo abahutu bari kutwikira abatutsi , ||| we grew up until the 1990s ... in 1992 in bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the hutu were burning the tutsi 's properties .
twe kuko turi tutuye ahantu i ntiarama ... ahantu hafi y' i ntiarama atari mu mujyi neza . ||| by then we resided in ntarama , which was out of [ ntarama ] town .
noneho biheraaga za ngenda za gashora kuko niho hari hari abahutu benshi , ||| so it started from the side of ngenda and gashora because many hutus resided in those areas .
urebye twebwe ahantu turi tutuye ni nko ku rusisiro ; ugereranyaije ni nk' umudugudu mbega . ||| the area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration .
n' ahantu bazanaaga abatutsi baaka ... babaga baravuye mukacae kamwe bakaza bakaubaka ahantu hamwe gutyo . ku buryo nta rugo urengaaga atari urw' umututsi . ||| it was a place where they used to take all the tutsis who had migrated . they used to construct houses close to each other ; the tutsi , neighbouring each other in that area , inhabited almost all houses .
ubwo rero hagati aho ntabwo bagombaaga ... biri bitarakomera cyane ku buryo bahamenair , ||| the killings had not yet started in our neighbourhood .
bakahera izo za mayange za musenyi , kuko niho hari abahutu benshi , b' abimukira n' abamerae gutyo . nuko , ||| instead , they started from the side of mayange and musenyi . areas that had many hutus ‘ abamere ’ residing there . some of the hutus living there were locals and some had there .
cyokoze iby' amahirwe wenda ... bikagarukair i nyamata ntibigerae iwacu . ariko tukabiumva , ||| we were lucky they would just stop in nyamata and did not reach our village .
abaho bakahunga , bakahungira aho hakurya iwacu . ubwo birarangira , ubuzima burakomeza bisanzwe ariko bitari neza , ||| but we were well informed on what was going on and the people in the attacked areas would flee from their homes to our home village .
ukaumva umwuka mubi nyine , wunva bavuga ngo @: "@ abahutu batwikiye abatutsi , abahutu batwikiye abatutsi . @" ||| life went though it was so tough , we always used to hear rumours of hutu burning tutsi properties .
muri make mu kubiiruka kwacu tukura , ntabwo tuigeze tuumva ko umuhutu hari umwuka mwiza agiraan n' umututsi . tukuze tuumva umuhutu ari umwanzi w' umututsi mbega . ||| in short , we grew up knowing that there is no sympathy between the hutu and tutsi .
surtout [ cyane cyane ] ko n' ababyeyi bacu batubwiraaga bati @: "@ bana bacu , abahutu ni babi , kuba turiho dutya tufite imibereho nk' iyi . ||| we grew up knowing that hutus are enemies of tutsis . in fact , our parents used to tell us , "@ dear children , hutu are bad people .
ubu turi tukize , ||| look at the kind of life we are living and yet we used to be rich .
tufite inka n' iki ... none ubu turaakae ... ntabwo tukize cyane ariko ... n' iki ... ariko uko tukabayeho ntabwo ariko turi kuba tumeze . ||| we used to own cattle and so many other things but now we are poor , we do not own anything . this is not the life we were meant to live .
bati imibereho mubona tufite tuyiteraw n' abahutu . @" ubwo nyine ntawe tukura tuumva tumeze gutyo , ariko tukaumva ko bishize bitagaruka . ||| we are like this just because of the hutu . @"
ubundi bwo rero iyo niyo mibereho mu bwana bwacu n' ababyeyi bacu . ariko ... mbese kusa tubiirutse tuumva ko n' ubundi nta kaizerae tufite cyo kuzabanaho n' aba ... n' abahutu . no kubera ko na leta uko yajyaagaho ari ko yagendaaga ibatoteza ... itutoteza , ||| we did n't have any hope of living with the hutu in community ; i do n't know why maybe it was due to what every government that was in power subjected us to .
tukibaza amaherezo . ||| we could hardly believe it would one day come to an end .
hanyuma noneho finale iza kuba muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] . ||| we always used to wonder how it would all and end and the final answer came in 1994 .
ubwo turi turi mu rugo ku italiki zirindwi [ 7041994 ] , ijoro ryaho tugiye kaumva tuumva ngi indege ya habyarimana yahanutse . ||| we were at home on the 7th of april 1994 . at night we heard that the president 's helicopter had crashed .
musaza wanjye araza aratubwira ngo noneho karabaye turashize ati ngo habyarimana yapfuye . ||| my brother came in screaming , "@ we are all dead . i heard that habyarimana is dead . @"
twebwe ... kubera ko njyewe nri nkiri n' umwana cya ... ntinri umwana cyane , ariko ntinri na mukuru ku buryo nri kusobanukirwa n' iby' intambara . nravuga nti @: apu , ||| i was still very young ; i was n't mature enough to understand issues concerning the war .
nti @: ahubwo ubwo yapfuye nti @: tugiye kuruhuka . ||| i carelessly said , " oh , if he is dead then we are finally going to get some peace . @"
ati @: "@ yewe ati @: wowe urivugair ibyawe , ati @: ||| he replied to me , "@ those are your wishes .
vuga ngo tugiye kupfa ! @" ||| all i can assure you is we are going to die . @"
nuko ubwo tusa nk' aho tubigira urwenya . ubwo burakeye ariko uwo munsi bawije nta kibazo twebwe tugize , ||| we kind of joked about it . the following day came but we did n't have any problems until the night fell .
ku bukurikiye bawho nibwo tugiye kaumva hirya no hino bavuga ngo imyuka mibi , ngo abantu barimo kubatwikira . ||| the next day we started hearing terrible rumours of houses being burnt here and there .
hashize nk' iminsi nk' ine ... hashize nk' iminsi ine prezida habyarimana apfuye . nibwo abatutsi b' i nyamata batangiye kugenda baza ... bava iyo bagenda mbese bashakisha bahunga . ukajya kaumva ukaumva umuntu umwe aravuze ati @: ||| i think it was four days after the death of habyarimana that the tutsis living in nyamata started fleeing ; you would hear people saying , "@ listen !
"@ mucecekae ibintu bikomeye ngo hano hirya tuhuye n' abantu bahunga . @" uti se bimeze kutae ? ati @: ||| things are getting worse here ! we have met people fleeing their homes . @"
"@ nyine kubera iriya nregae ya habyarimana ya ... habyarimana yapfuye , ati @: nyine ubu nta mahoro nta ki ... nuko ... ||| i wondered why but i heard some people saying that because of the plane crash and habyarimana 's death , there is no way there could be peace in the country .
ubwo rero , ||| people were confused ; they were moving up and down .
ukasanga abaturage ni urujya ... bamwe bakavuga bati @: "@ reka da , bati @: ubwo ni ubwoba bwanyu . @" ||| they would accuse each other to be cowards .
ubwo bamwe bakabahitaho bakajya i nyamata , abandi bakaongera bakabahitaho bakagaruka nyine aho ngaho i ntiarama , ||| some would go to nyamata while others were coming to ntarama .
gutyo gutyo . ||| and things went on like that for a while .
abageze i nyamata rero ubwo barabatwi ... hashira i ... uko bukeye nyine akaba ariko ibintu bigenda bikomera bikomera . nibwo mu kiriziya i nyamata bahatwika ... baraharasa , ||| in nyamata , things were getting worse as days went by . the nyamata church witnessed horrible shootings and killings .
abashoboye kurokoka , ||| the survivors ran back to where they had come from .
baraongera barakimiraan bagaruka iyo bagiye ... iyo bavuye . ubwo rero nibwo iwacu naho ... ubwo mbega ubwo uraumva ko bamaze kuica i nyamata hose barangije , ||| all the people [ tutsi ] in nyamata and other areashad been killed .
bagendaaga baza basatira nyine n' ahasigaye . ||| therefore , they started attacking the remaining areas .
ubwo baba bageze iwacu ... iwacu mu rugo iwacu mbega aho nvukaaga kwa papa na mama . ||| so , they reached home ; i mean my parents ' home .
hari hamaze ... niho hari ... hari hamaze kuhungira abantu benshi kubera ko ... mbese uko turi tutuye , ni nk' aha no haku ... ni nk' uko tuba tutuye hano ... hano hakurya mbega ari ahantu hitwa i kayenzi , wambuka ujya i nyamata . ||| by then several people had reached at home because ; we lived well somewhere like ... as one could be living over there ... it is a place called kayenzi ; when you are crossing towards nyamata .
ubwo twebwe bari bataraza mbega bahitaaga banbukiraan n' i nyamata , bakajyanirana gutyo . ||| by then they had n't attacked us ; they could just pass by crossing over to nyamata .
noneho rero baravuga bati @: "@ hariya hakurya turabona hakiri hazima reka tupfae kuhahungira . @" ||| so they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there .
uraumva aho hakurya hari hatuye ba mama wacu , ||| they decided to try there .
ba oncle , n' iki ... n' abandi baturagae mbese b' abaturanyi . baraza mbese bikabagabanya muri izo ngo zo hafi yo mu ... y' iwacu mu rugo , n' ahandi hake turi tuturanye . ||| my uncles and aunts with other neighbours were living across the valley so they came and scattered themselves in the neighbouring houses .
nuko , bakahamara nk' amajoro abiri , bukacya bikaongera bikakomera , ||| they would spend one or two days then things would worsen again .
noneho ku munsi wa kangahe ... hashize nk' ibyumweru bibiri ahari ari uko bimeze . ubwo interahamwe ziba zamaze abantu b' i nyamata bose zamaze kubica , ||| one day , i do n't remember which day but it had been two weeks since we were in that situation and the interahamwe [ perpetrators ] had finished all people in nyamata .
zaishe muri rya shyamba ry' i kayumba zaishe mu kiriziya , ||| they had killed people in kayumba forest and killed everyone who was in church .
bose mbese barabona ko bamaze kubagerereza , babona ko hasigaye abo baturagae mbese bari muri iyo ntuza ... muri ako kacae k' iwacu . ||| they had killed everywhere else and the next place was my home village .
ubwo nrabiibuka nibwo bavugaaga ngo igitero kiturutse mu ikawa ... ikawa zari hepfo yo mu rugo mbese . noneho njyae nkavuga nti @: ||| i remember some people saying , "@ the attackers have come through the coffee plantation @"@ , which was slightly below our home .
ariko se ... kubera ko numvaaga ibintu by' intambara mbese ... ibintu nk' ibyo bitashoboka . ||| so i was wondering , i could n't imagine things such as killings , i though they were impossible .
ubwo abaturage bakahita bavuga ngo ngizo ziraje . ||| people were screaming , "@ they have come . @"
ubwo bakairukanka bakazamuka bakajya i ntiarama ku kiriziya . ||| and then they took off to the ntarama church through the forest .
bagera mu ishyamba ba ... mbese ubwo abaturage baho ... abaakae ... abari bakihari bari bakibasha ku ... kuirwanaho bafite imiheto ; amacumu ; ||| those who were still able to defend themselves with bows and spears fought them .
bakagerageza kuzairukankaan bakabasha kuzihashya , bakabona akahaengae . ubwo bakahita baguruka bakisuganya mu rugo . ||| at times they were able to defeat the interahamwe and they would get a rest and go back home .
gutyo , bigeze aho ngaho baravuga bati ... ziravuga ziti @: "@ bariya bantu ntabwo tushobora kubashobora tutagiye kushaka imbunda . ||| the interahamwe realized that they were not going to defeat the resistors with no guns .
bati @: harimo n' inyenzi ntibishoboka . @" nuko ... ubwo noneho kukunri abaturage birwanaagaho bairukanka , ||| they said there were certainly ‘ inyenzi ’ among them [ the resistors ] .
ubona batangiye kucika intege , kubera ukuntu bagendaaga bakabicamo icumi , bakabicamo makumyabiri , noneho batangira kucika intege batangira kukwira imishwaro , ||| while fleeing , the resistors used to try and fight back the interahamwe but they started loosing courage as they were seeing about ten , twenty of them being killed , they started scattering .
ab' imbaraga batangira kuhungira za kitaarama , za kabgayi . haba hasigaye ingeraire batafite n' imbaraga . ||| the strong guys fled towards gitarama and kabwayi , there remained very few and helpless people .
nuko , ubwongubwo hari musaza wanjye mutoya wankuriki ... hari musaza wanjye tukurikiraanaga , nawe yabashaaga kuirukanka muri abongabo , ||| my brother was among those who managed to run .
aza mu rugo mbese turi tukihari tutarabasha kuhunga . n' iwacu mbega bakihari . aratubwira ati @: "@ noneho ati @: ||| he came home and told us [ that is when we were still alive ] , "@ now things are really bad .

ati @: bibinri byo kuirwanaho bitunaniye , ||| we can not defend ourselves anymore and they have killed most of us . @"
ati @: kanaka ... kanaka bamwishe niwe uturwanaagaho n' iki ... ati @: ubu nyine ntawe ni ukwirwariza ati @: ||| he told us , "@ they have killed so and so and so and so , who were the strongest men amongst us . @" he went on and said , " everyone should now find his own way . @"
ubwo tu ... @" tuti @: ||| he said so while preparing to live .
ese mugiye hehe ? ati @: ||| then , i asked him , "@ where are you going now ? @"
"@ tugiye kureba iyo tuba nyine ... tuhungira , turebae aho ubuzima buruta ubundi . @" tuti @: ||| he replied , "@ we are going to look for a safer place where to take refuge . @"
ese aho mugiye ho ntabwo muhagwa ? ati @: "@ reka sha , ||| i again asked , "@ will you not be killed there ? @"
ati @: ||| he said he did n't know .
mbega ati @: ni uko bimeze , murabeho niba nkize tuzabonaan niba npfuye kandi ni ibyo . ||| he went on and said " bye for now . if i happen to die ... and if i survive we shall meet again . @"
nuko . iryo niryo jambo rye nyuma rye tuheruka . ||| that was the last words we heard from him .
ubwo aba aragiye , ||| so he walked away and left us .
ubwo noneho ibintu biba birakomeye , ||| things had started getting worse on our side .
tufashwaaga nuko nyine tubonaaga bagenda bakabasha kubasubizayo bakaongera bakagaruka , tukaumva tufite akahaengae . ubwo nyine aho biri bigeze ahongaho mu matariki cumi n' angahe ... umuntu wese yari asigaye yirwariza , yirwanaho . ||| we used to be comforted by the fact that they would fight them back but they had now left us all .
nuko . ku munsi unyuma rero kugira abantu bavae mu ngo bose bose noneho , igitero kiraje kituruka munsi y' ikawa iwacu , ||| at around the 10th or so everyone was minding his or her own life the day when all people went out of their homes , a group of attackers came from the coffee plantation that was in the valley below our home and everybody was gone .
abandi bose nyine bari banagiye ari njyewe nsigaye nravuga nti @: reka sha , nti njyewe ntabwo mpunga nti @: ||| i was the only one left there .
nraguma ahangaha . nuko . ubwo mama ahita avuga , ati @: ||| thinking i could not die , i decided to stay there .
"@ reka da , ati mu ... ati @: ngwino tugende ati @: twe ... nti tugiye kugwa aha twenyine . @" ||| and then my mum called me and told me that we were not going to die there alone that we should leave .
ariko hakaba hari abandi bakecuru bari bari mu rugo n' abasaza n' iki ... batari bafite imbaraga zo kuhunga . bahita bavuga bati @: "@ twebwe ntaho tujya batuicirae ahangaha . @" ||| however , some elderly men and women who were not capable of fleeing decided to stay and be killed there .
ubwo tuba turazamutse turairukanse . tukairukanka tugeze ruguru , hari agashyamba kari haruguru yo mu rugo tuhita tuumva za nterahamwe ziraye mu nka zari mu rugo , ||| we left running and reached a small forest that was slightly below our home . then we heard the perpetrators in our cattle we had left home .
zirazitemye , ||| they hacked them and the people we left home .
n' abantu bari mu rugo bose bababatemagura tuumva ... numva . ||| i heard them hacking them [ the elderly people they had left home ] .
tuihishe hafi y' agahuru kubera ko tubonaaga n' ubundi badusatiriye . ||| we hid in a bush near home because they were already coming near us .
ubwo bahugira mu kutema abongabo tuba turirukatse , tugiye kuri secteur ... ku kiriziya cy' i ntiarama . ||| first they hacked the men and meanwhile , we run to the sector 's offices at the ntarama church .
ariko ku buryo tuumvaaga baturi inyuma n' ubu ... bamwe bari baturi inyuma bavuga ngo @: "@ ngaba sha ngo @: baciye ahangaha sha , ngo @: ||| but even as we were running , we heard some of them behind us saying , "@ they passed here .
baciye ahangaha . @" nuko , ||| there they are . @"
ubwo bamwe birara mu bihuru bajya kushaka , bahita bagwa ku bintu abantu bari aho ... abaturage bari bari aho bahishe @: amavarisi , ibikapu , ||| and others entered the bush to search for us but luckily they found properties such as suitcases , bags and many others that people had hidden there .
bari bahishe mu bihuru kugirango bajyae babihungaan . noneho ukaumva interahamwe imwe ibwiye indi , ngo @: "@ we , ||| we heard them telling each other , "@ hey !
ngo nvumbuye iramba we , ngo nvumbuye iramba ahangaha . @" nuko , ||| i discovered some treasures here . @"
bahugira kuri iyo myenda nyine tuba turahunze uwo munsi tuba tuwukize gutyo . turazamuka tujya kuri secteur i ntuza ... i ntiarama ku kiliziya . ||| so as they were concentrating on what they found we found a way to the sector in ntarama at the church and that 's how we managed to survive that day .
mbese iyo tariki nibwo abantu be ... mbega urebye nibwo intambara yakazae i nyamata , kuko abantu bose bari babashije kurokoka , ||| in fact , that was the day the war in nyamata toughened because all the survivors fled to the schools .
uwo munsi nibwo bagiye ku mashuri . nuko , ubwo icyo kihae bica mama na papa , n' abandi bose ... mbese abantu bose bari bahungiye mu rugo . ||| that is the day they killed my mum and dad and all the people who had hid home .
bahaiciye nk' abantu nka makumyabiri . ||| they killed around 20 people .
ubwo twebwe tuba turagiye tujya kuri secteur , tugeze kuru secteur , ku mashuri ... oya ku kiliziya cy' i ntiarama . ||| we preceded to the sector . when we reached at the sector ... at the school ... sorry , at ntarama church .
nuko , tugeze ku mashuri , hashize nk' iminsi itatu , haza igitero kiitwa ‘ simusiga ’ . ||| while we were at the school after 3 days , came a certain group of attackers called ‘ simusiga ’ [ meaning i can not leave him [ the tutsi ] behind ] .
cyo ku itariki cumi n' eshanu ahari z' ukwa kane [ 15 @04 @1994 ] . ubwo kije kirimo amabisi ishyano ryose . ||| it was on the 15th of april 1994 . the group of attackers came in many buses .
ubundi barazaaga noneho ... babona babashubijeyo bakajya kutabaza , bakavuga ngo @: "@ hariya mu rufunzo ngo @: harimo inyenzi zifite imbunda . @" ||| sometimes they used to come and when they were pushed back , they would go back saying that the inyenzi were in the swamp and that they had guns .
kumbi ni abantu hari umugabo umwe ... nk' abagabo babiri bari baraishe abajepe [ abasirikare barindaaga prezida ] bazaaga kubarasa , bahita babambura imbunda . noneho za mbunda bakazikoresha bitabara . ||| actually two of habyarimana 's soldiers [ the presidential guard ] had come to kill us and two of the resistors took their guns and used them to defend themselves .
interahamwe zaza mu rufunzo bakazirasa ... bakaumva intuza ... imbunda . zikahita zigenda zairukanka , noneho zikavuga ngo @: "@ hariya mu rufunzo ngo harimo inyenzi . @" ||| whenever the interahamwe came towards the swamp they would hear the guns and then they would say there are inyenzi in the swamps .
bamaze kuvuga ko harimo inyenzi rero nibwo bagendaaga bahuruza ya mabisi . ||| so they went and called for the buses .
uraibuka igitero cy' inyanza ; ||| you remember the attack of nyanza ?
umunsi bica inyanza . amabisi yahaje niyo yari aje kuica i bugesair . ||| the buses , which came are the one that came to kill in bugesera .
uwo munsi nibwo nnjyae bantemye . ||| that was the day i was hacked .
ubwo baraza , amabisi araza ageze i nyanza , ahita asanga bari kuica abantu nyine baravuga ... arahagarara barabanza barabica barabica , barangije barababwira ngo , ||| when those buses reached nyanza , they found that they [ the other interahamwe ] were killing people .
ngo @: "@ musigarae muhorahoza abongabo , ngo @: ntawe tugiye kutera renfort [ kufasha ] abanyabugesera [ abagiye i bugesair ] . ||| therefore they said , " keep on finishing the ones ; we are going to reinforce the bugesera people .
ubwo sasa amabisi yahise aza direct [ ako kanya ] ku mashuri ahantu turi turi , akora akazi koko . arica ye ! hasigara ngeraire . ||| the buses came straight to the school building where we were hiding , they really killed many people only few were left .
ubwo twebwe turi twi ... ariko ntabwo yatusanze ku mashuri icyo kihae , izo nterahamwe ntabwo zatusanze ku mashuri . zatusanze nyine hafi yo ku rufunzo , ||| but for us who were near the swamp , that is where they found us .
abaturage bamwe ... ubwo abasaza bamwe batashoboraaga kugira ... baraiahuye bavuga bati @: "@ twebwe tukize imihoro yo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , ntabwo tugiye kuicwa n' iyo muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , ||| some old people committed suicide saying that they survived the machetes of 1959 and that the machetes of 1994 could not kill them .
bakahita binaga mu ruzi bakagenda . ||| they dived into the water and were taken away .
haiahuye nk' abantu barenga abo ... abenshi kuruta abo batemye . ||| people who committed suicide were more than those who were hacked .
noneho ubwo abandi bati @: "@ reka da , bati @: reka tupfae kigabo , ||| others said , "@ let us die like men .
nta kuiahura , kuiahura ni icyaha . ||| committing suicide is a sin @"@ .
ukavuga uti @: "@ reka njyae kuihisha . @" ||| one would say , "@ lets me go and hide . @"
uwo munsi nibwo nihishe mu gihu ... ahantu mu gihuru kiri hafi y' urufunzo , ||| that day i went and hid in the bush that was near the swamp .
mpita ngenda nirukankair mo , ||| i ran into the bush and immediately the interahamwe ran after me .
interahamwe zihita ziza ku manywa ... icyo kihae ariko bwo nta n' imvura yari yaguye , ||| that day it had not rained .
biri nka saa sita ... gutyo saa sita zauzuye . hari izuba ryinshi cyane ariko ... ubona ry' akayagirizo mbega . nuko , icyo kihae ubwo interahamwe ziraza ... zihita ziza , ||| at around mid @-@ day , when the sun was shining bright , the interahamwe came and killed many people .
zaishe abantu ... nibwo zaishe abantu benshi cyane , n' umwana wa mukuru wanjye ariko ntabwo turi tuihishaanye , ||| even my cousin who was slightly older than me .
ntinzi ahantu yari yihishe hafi ahongaho , nawe turamubura . ||| but we were not hiding together ; i do n't know where she was hiding just near by , we also lost her .
ngiye kubona ... nka saa nkahae , numva bantemye ntinzi n' igihe bantemeye . nuko , ||| i found out that they hacked me ; i did not know when i was hacked .
numva bantemye nka saa kumii ... zatashye , ariko nzi ubwenge nyine ntaramenya ubwenge , ariko mu ma saa kumi cyangwa ... yee mu ma saa sita nibwo bantemye . ||| but i guess i was hacked at around 4 o'clock or ehh ... at around mid @-@ day .
nuko , ||| that is when they hacked me .
ngiye gushiduka nikoraho numva nfite amaraso . umh ! ||| then i touched myself and saw blood .
nkajya nivugaish mu mutaima . nti ariko se birashoboka ko bantema nkaba nkiri muzima ? kubera ko tugenda , ||| in my heart , i was wondering if it was possible that they had cut me and i was still alive .
ncaaga ku bantu batemye nkahita ntekereza ukuntu umuhoro uza ... ukuntu umuntu aza bakamutema , yarangiza akagira ... mbese nkahita nimajina [ ntekereza ] ukuntu umuhoro uza uka nyikubitaho , ||| i always used to imagine how they would one day bring a machete and hack me .
niba nba meze kutae simbizi . ||| i did not know how i would react .
kandi ... ariko uwo munsi nbitekerezaaga nibwo bahise bantema . ||| they hacked me on the exact day i had thought about it .
nkairukanka njya kusesair mu masaka , nkaumva biranze . nkaongera nkairukanka . nnjya kusesair mu gi ... nti @: ||| i was n't sure i should hide in a sorghum plantation .
oya , nti @: baranbona . nkaongera nkairukanka . ||| i just kept on running .
nuko uko nkaje kusesair mu gihuru rero , nibwo interahamwe zahise ziza nyine zirantemagura . ||| at some point , i penetrated another bush where the perpetrators found me and started to hack me .
mu kuvamo re ... bigejeje ... uko nvuyemo rero @: byagajeje nyine nka saa kumi n' ebyirii ... interahamwe zagiye abaturage bari kugira ... kutaha , ||| i finally left that bush at around 6.00 o'clock in the evening when the perpetrators were gone and the villagers going home .
nnjyae wenda aka ... ubwo akayaga niba karankubise nkakarura ubwenge simbizi . numva abandi barimo kugendagenda , ||| maybe it was when fresh air [ the wind ] blew on me that i gained back my consciousness and heard people moving around .
noneho nda ... ntaye ubwenge n' iki ... mpita nvuza induru ntahamagara . mpamagaye niba baragize ngo n' interahamwe turi kumwe , ||| unknowingly , i started calling .
noneho n' abandi nabo aho kugira ngo baze barebae , bakiruka . ntinzi umuntu umwe uhaciye aravuga , ||| but maybe those people thought that i was with perpetrators . instead of coming close to see , they ran away .
ngo @: "@ yewe we ! ngo mudahogora bamutemye disi , ngo reba ukuntu yabaye . ||| and a certain person came and said , "@ oh no , mudahogora has been hacked look at how she is hurt ! @"
noneho aho kugira ngo undi ... icyo kihae abaturage nabo babaga basigaye , babaga bameze nk' abahahamutse nyine buri wese yi ... aramair amagara ye . ||| at that time people were running for his or her own life .
baravuga bati @: se ... bakubona nyine , ubaye utyo urabona ko bari bantemaguye ahangaha hose [ mu musaya ] n' iki ... mbese nawe urabiibaza ukuntu biba bimeze . nta muntu babonaaga ahari nk' uwapfuye . ||| when people would see you in such condition ... you can imagine what i was looking like , considering the way you see me now with these scars .
n' amaraso ahantu hose ... mu maso hose nuzuye amaraso n' iki ... bati ... bati @: ||| i looked like a dead body with blood all over in the face .
"@ buriya ahubwo arimo arasamba , nta buzima . @" ||| others would say , " she is taking her last breath she has no life in her . @"
nuko , hari akana ka mukuru wanjye turi turi kumwe gato , kafite nk' imyaka ... kari kafite nk' imyaka itatu , turi tugerageje kuihishaan mu gihuru . ||| i was with my sister 's child who was 3 years old and we had hid together in the bush .
nyine ubwo ... nhise nkaanura gutya nbona kanyicaye iruhande . ||| when i opened my eyes , i saw the child seated besides me .
ariko ko nta kintu bari bakatwaye , ||| but he was not hurt at all .
ariko ko kapfuye nyuma kubera ko ninjye uri usigaye njyenyine nkasigaraanye nta kintu nshobora ku kamarair , ||| actually they did nothing to him although he later on died . i was the only one who had remained with him but i could n't help him to get something to eat .
kaza kugira anemie [ kubura amaraso ] karapfa . ka ... ka ... nuko nbona kaicaye gutyo karakanuye , ||| he developed anemia and died ; he was sitting with eyes wide open just besides me .
noneho kahita ... uwo mugo ... nkavuga nti @: ||| i watched him for a while , wondering what would happen to him .
njyewe rwose se ko nshimye nubwo ndiha ... nk' aka kana se ko karaguma ... ntinzi umugira neza w' umudamu ugize uje kukabona ahita arakafata arakaheka arakajyana . ||| by chance , a merciful woman who lived in that area came and put him on her back and carried him away .
nuko njyewe nsigara ahongaho . nrangije nraicara nravuga nti ese @: abantu bose bagiye nsigaye ahongaho njyenyine nravuga , ||| i stayed there alone ; everyone had gone .
nti @: nta muntu uri bwihe peine [ uri bwigore ] yo kunterura ngo ajyanae , reka da ! ariko chance [ amahirwe ] ngize nravuga nti @: ||| no one could bother to carry me out of there .
reka numvae ko bantemye amaguru . ngize ukuguru gutya numva ni kuzima ; ||| i tried both legs and found that i had some little strength left in them but they were injured .
ngize n' ukundi numva ni kuzima . nravuga nti @: ‘ apu ’ . burya iyo umuntu ... iyo ukifite ibikomere bikishyushye mbega , ||| i knew when the wounds are still fresh ; it was possible to move around .
aho ugera hose uhagera . ahubwo ushobora kuitura hasi nyuma amaraso amaze kukushiramo , ariko ugiye . nkandagi ... ngiye numva birakunze . ||| the only risk was that i could suddenly fall due to over bleeding .
mbese uraumva ko ibisebe biri bikiri bishya imisonga iba itaratangira . nba ntakuruye nrirutse , nnjyae ndabakurikiye . ||| so i tried walking and it worked . you can guess that by then , the pain had not started yet so i started running following them .
nravuga nti @: reka da ! nti @: ntibagiye kumporahoreza muri iki gihuru njyenyine . ||| i was avoiding to be left in the bush alone , so i took off .
nba nrirutse nragiye abo tuhuye bose bakavuga bati @: "@ ye baba we bati @: uyu muntu ubu aragera hehe ? @" ||| the people i was meeting were wondering how far i would be able to run .
ubwo nragiye bose bagiye , nsigara ... nsigaye inyuma , nravuga nti @: ni hahanri , ||| everybody run , i was left behind .
zintemair ahagaragara ntasigaye ahangaha . kubera ko iyo bakutemaaga ntupfae , bakagaruka bakasanga ukihumeka , basubizaagamo . ||| i remembered that when the interahamwe came back and found you still alive , they had to finish you . i survived that day .
ni razima [ ni ngombaw ] nyine . ubwo nba nragiye ndasodotsee ... nanone nbasa ... ngize imaan nbona ... ku mashuri ntahageze . ariko ubwo basaza banjye bose bo bari bara ... baigendeye barahunze baragiye i kitaarama , ||| i pulled my self up to the school buildings but all my brothers had fled to gitarama .
nsigaraanye n' uwo mukuru wanjye umwe , ||| i was left with my older sister , the second born in our family .
mukuru wanjye ukurikiraaga musaza wanjye mukuru , niwe turi tusigaraanye wenyine . abandi bose nabo bari barabaishe . na musaza wanjye wunri wa kane ... oya wa gatatu . ||| the rest had been killed ... my third brother as well .
nuko , ubwo nragiye ndansindagiye ngeze ku mashuri , hari hakiri ... ubwo hari hakiri abantu bakeya babashije kurokoka , ||| so at the school there were still some survivors .
ariko ubwo noneho uwo munsi bahise babona ko intambara noneho ikazae . baravuga bati @: "@ aha hantu naho ni ukuhava tukajya turara ku rufunzo , bati @: ||| they had seen how intense the war had become and they said that we should start sleeping in the swamp because in the school we would be found out and killed .
naho ku mashuri bazahatutsindair . @" kubera ko ubwo ngubwo barazaaga bababura inkono mwasize mutetse zose bakafata bakamenagura zose mukasanga pe ! na matera zose bazitwaye n' iki ... ||| the often used to come to the school and break down the pots we were using for cooking and take the mattresses and everything .
noneho ubwo tuhageze , umu oncle umwe nri nfite kusa w' umusaza , ahita avuga ati @: "@ uyu muntu bagize gutya rero , ||| when we reached there , there is a certain uncle of mine who said , "@ look how injured she is , we can n't live her alone here .
abantu bagiye kuva hano ku mashuri , ntabwo tumusiga aha wenyine . n' ubundi bazaza baka muhaubura bakamuhwanya bakamwica urubozo . ||| because once they find her here they will simply finish her up in torture .
reka tumujyanae tumu ... hari ukuntu , hari abahutu bakeya turi tuturanye , bari batuye bari bagendaaga batura hagati y' amazu ahantu hitwaaga mu bisigara . ||| so let 's take her . @" we used to have some hutu neighbours whose houses were in the centre in a place called bisigara .
ubwo rero intambara yarateye , bahita bagenda bajya kufasha bene wabo . inzu zabo bahita ba ... basiga bazimatseho amakoma . ||| when the war became tough , those people went to help their fellow hutu and left their houses covered with banana leaves on the doors .
kuko iyo basangaaga ... bene wabo babaga baturutse ahandi bakasanga urukoma ku nzu , bahitaaga baumva ko ari inzu ya mwene wabo , ntihagirae icyo bayitwara . ubwo aravuga ati @: ||| so that when perpetrators came they would not destroy those houses .
"@ reka tumujyanae tumushyirae mu nzu yo kwa kanaka , ati @: nibasanga hari ho urukoma , ntawe uzatinyuka kuinjiramo . ||| then my uncle said that they should carry me to one house of their houses [ belonging to the hutu ] where there was a banana leaf on the door , no one would enter there .
ati @: ubwo nyine imaan wenda izaba igira icyo ikora . ||| he said god would take care of the rest .
koko niko bigenze . baragiye banshyira muri iyo nzu , ariko nyine ubwo ku mashuri abaturage bari barahavuye , baragiye n' ubundi bagenda banyanyagira muri ayo mazu yabashije kusigara , ||| that is how it happened ; they took me there and the rest of the people in the school had all left and went to hide in those houses that were still remaining [ the houses with banana leaves ] .
ariho barara ninjoro . ariko nabwo bakarara bafite ubwoba , bavuga bati @: "@ ziraza zituicae . @" ||| they used to sleep in those houses , although they were very scared that they might come and kill them .
icyakora imaan yamukoreyemo nta kintu ... ntiiigeze ankoraho , ahubwo ntinzi ahantu yagiye anzanira umutobe . ||| anyway i do not know the kind of god that worked wonders in him ; he never hurt me .
anzanira umutobe , ngiye ... nrangije ... ntinbashaaga kufata ntaki ... n' iyo bazanaaga nk' ikintu nk' iki , ||| instead he went and brought me some juice . i could not hold anything .
aranfatair gutya , ndagotomeraa ... nri maze nk' ibyumweru nka bingahe nta n' ikintu ngira . ||| so , he held it for me and i swallowed big sips ; i had spent weeks without eating anything .
arangije aravuga ati @: "@ nragiye ... nragiye ngiye ku kushakira umuti . @" nti @: sawa . ||| later he told me that he is going to get me some drugs .
ahubwo yaragiye hasiga ... nta minsi itatu yashize , inkotanyi zihita ziza . zihita ziza , ||| three days after he left the rpf [ inkotanyi ] troops came .
ubwo abandi baragiye ... hashize umunsi umwe ... uwo munsi yaje . ntabwo baongeye kuhagaruka abo baturagae . nravuga umh , ||| i only saw him on that day , the people who inhabited that area too .
ese bamenye ko uyu mupagasi yaje muri yi nzu ra ? ||| then i started wondering if maybe the people who used hide in that house saw the interahamwe entering the house .
kumbi ubwo interahamwe za ... inkotanyi zaje zirakataa zaica ku rufunzo , ziragenda zirabafata zirababwira ngo bahitae baambuka banjye i nyamata . ubwo rero comme ca , ||| in fact , when the inkotanyi troops came , they first passed into the swamp and told them to cross over to nyamata .

"@ ariko rero ibyo ari byo byose n' ubwo tugiye , bati @: hari abantu bacu b' inkomerae batemaguye , bati @: ||| as they were living , they told the inkotanyi that they were some of their people who are terribly injured but still alive .

nuko , ubwo bahita bagenda gutyo , burira ntinbabona , ||| therefore , that is how they left ; i could n't see them anywhere that night .
nravuga nti @: noneho abantu basae bapfuye bashize nti ubu ninjye usigaye . ||| then i said to myself , "@ all people have died . i am the only one remaining . @"
nuko , bukeye hahita haza umugore wa wa mupagasi . ahita anbwira , ati @: ||| so the next morning the wife of the gardener came to me and said , "@ do you know what happened ? all the interahamwe are gone and the inkotanyi have come . @"
"@ umenye se ibyabaye ? @" nti ni iki se ? ati @: "@ nyine ati @: ||| i said , "@ do n't say that !

ahubwo nti abantu barapfuye barashize . ati @: "@ reka da ! ati @: ||| they just took them . @"
zahise ziza anbwira ukuntu bigenze . nuko ati @: "@ noneho wowe ihanganae ngunsindagize , umanukae ujyae ku muhanda , ||| then she asked me if she should carry me to the roadside ... because there were other injured people , who were actually more injured than me [ on the road ] .

turaharara aho ngaho , ubwo iryo joro ntizaza , ||| i spent the night there but they did not come that night .
bukeye nko mu ma saa ine . tugiye kubona tubona ziraje . ||| however , they came the following morning at around 10.00 o'clock .

ubwo , abahutu bari barahunze bagiye za kibungo , secteur kibungo urayizi , ntinzi niba uyizi cyangwa uyumva . ||| then all the hutus had ran away towards kibungo ... kibungo sector ; i do n't know if you know it or hear about it .
ahita aza nyine nibwo yanbwiraaga ati @: "@ umenye ibyabaye ? @" ||| therefore , that is when she came and asked me if i was aware of what had happened .
ariko hagati ahongaho njyewe ubwo nri nzi ko abantu bose bashize ari njyewe usigaye . ||| meanwhile , i thought everybody had died and that i was the only survivor .
nuko arabwira ati @: ko uri hano ati @: "@ uracyari hano ? @" nti @: ||| she asked me , "@ why are you still here ? @"

ariko ibyo aribyo byose buriya mu gitondo ziraza , ati @: zihakusangae . @"@ ubwo nraihangana ndasindagira , ||| then she helped me walk up to a certain house .
turamanuka tugera aho ngaho kuri iyo nzu , tusanga koko harimo abandi bana benshi batemaguye . ari abari kuhorota ; abo batemye amaguru batashobora no kuikura n' aho bari ; ||| in that house i found several other kids , who were in the worst condition compared to me ; some were dying , others did n't have legs and could n't move . others had started rotting from there .
abandi baboreye aho ; mbese muri make mpageze nbona ninjye muzima uhari . ||| in brief , when i reached there , i seemed to be the strongest around .
kandi uraumva ko nnjyae nri nramaze kuiheba amaboko yose yaraboze , ntashobora no kukaterura . ||| yet i too was already desperate that my arms had started rotting ; they were weak , i could n't lift an arm to any angle .

tuumva abantu bari kugenda hanze , babaza bati @: "@ ese ahangaha harimo abantu n' iki ... ? @" noneho , ||| then we heard people walking around , asking if there could be anybody inside the house .
bahita bakubita urugi , bahita bavuga bati @: ||| they hit the door and came in .
"@ hano harimo abantu bakihumeka . @" bahita bainjira , bahasanga umukobwa w' inkumi ugaragara ... kubera ko njyewe ntabwo bari barantemye amaguru , ||| they first saw me because i was the only one who was in better conditions than the others because my legs had not been hacked .

ubwo yahise atubaza niba hari uwunva yabasha kuigenza ngo mbese asangae abandi , ||| then he asked if there was anybody who could try and join others .
ariko nawe arabibona ko nta n' umwe ushobora kugenda . ||| but later he realized that no one was able to walk .
ambaza njyewe niba nbasha kugenda nkijyana nkagera i nyamata . nramubwira ngo ntabwo nbishobora . ||| then he asked me if i could try and walk but i said , "@ no i can n't @"@ .
ahita yohereza wa mugorae ngo @: "@ wowe genda ujyae ku ... i nyamata aho abandi bari , ababwirae noneho bahitae baza ... bazana ingobyi baze kutwara bano bantu . ||| and then he sent that lady to nyamata to bring some people and stretchers to carry us .

avuga ati @: "@ icyampa imaan nkabona ikingeza muri bene wacu . @" kuko yari yabuze aho aca . ||| actually she was praying she would find a way to join her people , she did not have anywhere to pass .
ni uko mpita ngenda , njya aho ngaho iwabo , kubera ko ni nabo banangaburiraaga n' iki ... ni uko hashize nk' igihe ... hashize nk' amezi abiri ... ubwo kangahe ra ? hari nko mukwa karindwi . ||| we stayed together for a while then in july people started going back to their homes , i was asking myself what i would do next .
amahoro asa nk' atangiye kugaruka , nkavuga nti @: ese ubu ... nkatekereza ubuzima nzabamo , nkaumva ntabwo nbuzi . ||| i really needed to know news from my brother but found from people that he had joined the army because he was told that i was dead .
nbariraije ibya wa musaza wanjye , baranbwira ngo @: "@ ngo baramubwiye ngo urapfuye , ngo ahita yigira mu gisirikare . @" ||| but my aunt was also living there , my older sister used to live with her .

ubwo famille yanjye yose niho mbese niho yari iri , nzana na musaza wanjye tuje kumuhamba , ariko we arataha njyae ntahasigara , ||| the whole family came to bury katumba , i was with my brother , but he went back and i stayed there .
ngenda ku wa kabiri , presida apfa ku wa gatatu . ||| i went on tuesday and the president died on wednesday .
ubwo rero ... nje ... intambara yabaye nri nraye mpavuye . ||| i had just spent one night then the war started .
ubwo nkaba nri nsizeyo famille yose mbese ariho bari bari bategereje kurangiza ikiriyo . hari hariyo umutante wanjye tubanaaga i kibungo , n' abandi ba grande soeurs [ bakuru banjye ] bo kwa mama wacu . mpita nvuga nti noneho reka npfae kugira ... nti reka ngarukae i kigali nrebae hari uwaba yarahasigaye , ||| the whole family was there , waiting to end the mourning ... so i decide to come to kigali to see if there could be any survivor i can see since in bugesera there was none .
i bugesair ho nrabona ntabahari . ni uko . hari umugabo uri utuye ... turi tuturanye ahita ampa ‘ lifuti ’ turazana . ||| there was one man who had come from bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at rwampara , i found that one of my aunts was still there .
tugeze hariya rwampara , nsanga uwo mu tantae wanjye arahari , numva noneho nibwo agatima katangiye kugaruka , numva ko wenda nbonye undi muntu tuzabana . ||| that is when i started gaining some hope since at least i was getting someone to stay with .
ni uko , turabana gutyo kugeza ejo ... mu w' ibihumbi bibiri [ 2000 ] nibwo nawe yapfuye . ||| we stayed together until she died in the year 2000 .
ariko uraumva ko turabanye ... na babyara nabo bari bahari mu ntiambara , nbona hari bake bagiye basigara . ||| we lived together until that time and a few of my cousins were also there . i was able to find some people who had survived .
ni uko nbona ubuzima bwanjye bukomeza gutyo , ||| my life went on like that .
n' uko bigenze . ibyo muri genocide bigarukaiye aho ngaho . ||| i think that is all about my life during genocide .
wakomereza na nyuma ya genocide uko ubayeho n' uko mwabanye ... ||| can you continue telling us even the life after the genocide and who did you live with ?
nyuma y' intambara ubwo ngeze aho ... ntabwo nkomeje kuiga kubera ko hagiye habaho kujya mu ntuza ... mu bitaro ibisebe birakomeje birangaruka . ||| after the war i did not continue to study .
kandi noneho nta n' ubwo nri nigeze nvuraw , nza kujya mu ... nkomeje nirukanka mubyo kuivuza mbega , igihe kinini nbayeho , ||| i spent most of my time at the hospital treating this hand as it was still paining me .
nbayeho ndi kuivuza . ntabaye mu bitaro mbese nta myaka ingahe ishize ntivuza kano kaboko . haza kuza umu docteur uturutse muri afrique du sud , ntuza uriya nyaruhirira yari ari muri stage , ||| dr nyaruhirira was on an attachment in south africa .
niwe unvuye birakira . ||| he came back and he is the one who treated me and i got well .
baravuga ngo ... ngerageza kuirukankair muri kanyarwanda nibo bahajyanyeyo barakabaga akaboko igufa bararitransforma [ bararihindura ] ribasha kumera gutya , ubu ntabwo ari ukunguku kari kameze . ubundi kari kameze gutya ... igufwa bari bararitemye bararicoca . ||| later on , i tried to run after the organization ‘ kanyarwanda ’ , they were the ones who had taken me there and i was operated ; they changed the position of my arm bone it was not shaped like this .
ni uko , nragaije rero mara mu bitaro igihe kinini , nyuma yabwo nbona ... nibwo nkomezaaga kujya ... abo bana nta wunri muntu wabarebereraga ni njyewe uri ubafite , niyemeza kugumana nabo ntinbasha kusubira kuiga . ||| then later on , those children had no one to look after them , so that is why i did not go back to school .
ikibazo ntikiumvikana . ||| q ...
ubwo hagati ahongaho nje kubona akazi kuri acrg mpore [ ishyirahamwe ] nkabasha kukorera amafaranga makeya aringaniye nkabatunga , ||| meanwhile , i got a job at "@ acrg mpore @" [ it is an association ] . i was earning some little money , it was enough for me to feed those children .
usibye baje ... bije no kugeraho haza umu oncle wabo ubaga hanze arabajyana . ||| afterwards their uncle who came from abroad took them .
nyuma y' aho ariko nnjyae nje kubyara uwange ubu nramufite yujuje imyaka ibiri . ||| then i gave birth to my own child , she is now two years old .
umaze kutubwira ukuntu ubayeho nyuma y' intambara uburyo bakufataaga muri ‘ societe ’ kubera ibintu by' amoko n' iki ... , ubona itandukanirizo rya mbere y' intambara [ jenocide ] na nyuma y' intambara ari irihae ? ||| you have told us how you lived before the war , how you were treated in the society due to your ethnic or things like that ... what do you think is the difference between @: life before the war [ genocide ] and life after the war ?
itandukanyirizo ryo rirahari kubera ko mbere y' intambara umuntu ubaga wikandagira , ||| there is a difference . because before the war people were scared .
n' aho wicaye ubaga wunva bavuga ibintu by' amoko n' ibiki ... ariko ubu wenda ubona nta bintu by' amoko bihari , ||| wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation .
n' ubwo uba wica ... uvuga uti ... ikibazo ari icya bariya barimo kufungura . ||| maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing .
ariko ubundi ubusanzwe ubona hari itandukanirizo . ||| but in general , there is a big difference .
ubu nta ... ntabwo ari kimwe na mbere y' intambara . ||| life nowadays is not the same as that before the war .
ugerageza kubaan ... mu bantu mubana ... ugerageza kubaan n' abantu bose , cyangwa ugira umwihariko ? wunva abantu bose mwabana cyangwa hari umwihariko w' abantu mwabana ; ||| do you try to live with all types of people or do you feel closer to certain people ? do believe you can live with all people or there are only a certain type of people you can live with .
nravuga abo ushobora kubwira ibibazo byawe wihariye , ||| i mean people you can discuss the issues related to the genocide .
wunva ibibazo by' itsembabwoko abantu bose mwabiganira kimwe ? ||| can you discuss genocide issues with anybody ?
oya nawe , ||| of course not .
quand meme [ ibyo aribyo byose ] biraumvikana ntabwo ibibazo by' itsembabwoko ... ntabwo ikibazo ... ikibazo uhuraiyeho n' undi ntabwo ushobora kukibwira uwo mutakihuraiyeho ! hari uwo ushobora kaumva wishyikiraho , ||| sincerely , you can not discuss genocide problems ... that problem ... a problem you share with someone else , you can not talk about it with someone you do n't share it .
muhuje . tuvugae exemple [ urugero ] nk' umuntu mwarokokanye uri mu rwanda , ntabwo ushobora kumubwira ikibazo cyawe nk' uko ukibwira uwavuye hanze . ||| there are those you fell free with because you have the same problems , but ... for example @: the way i tell it to a survivor who was here in rwanda is not the same as the way i tell it to a person who came from exile .
ushobora kukimubwira kuko wunva muhuje mbese . ||| i can tell my story to a survivor because i know we have something in common .
uzarebae nk' umuntu muvuga ururimi rumwe mbese muhuje ururimi ntabwo mwabivuga kimwe nk' uwo mutaruhuje . ni urugero . ||| it is like talking to someone you do n't share the same language , it is never the same as talking to that one you have it in common ... this is just an example .
wenda wowe imiryango y' abantu ... imiryango y' abantu bakuiciye ubona igerageza kugerageza kugira ngo ubonae ... wihangane wenda kugirango mu kanya tuze kugaruka ku kintu cy' ubumwe n' uubwiyunge . ||| what do you think about the families of those who murdered your family ? do they try to show you any ... i am asking you this because i would like us to talk about unity and reconciliation .
ubona hari ahantu amahuriro n' imiryango y' abantu bakuiciye , ku buryo hari ikintu ushobora kubabwira ? ||| is there any way you collaborate with the families of those who killed your people , to the extent where you can talk with them ?
nkiumva ... nkiumva nta kintu kitashoboka . ||| i simply consider it as an impossible issue .
ese ukuiyunga n' umuntu ... icyokora baje ... kubera ko umuntu nta n' icyo uba uri bumutwarae , atinyutse akaza akakusaba imbabazi , umubabarira . ||| how can one reconcile with a person who ... well , since there is no alternative , if he comes to you and ask for forgiveness you may forgive him .
ariko rero uraumva nk' ibi bavuga mbese uba ubona arinko ... nka kwa kubura uko ugira n' ubundi . urabona nka bariya bavuga ngo @: "@ muri gacaca ngo birega ibyaha ngo baga ... @" nyine ni kwaku ... buriya se uribaza ko babiemera ari uko bibavuye ku mutaima ? ||| it is the same as those who say that , in gacaca courts people admit their crimes and then are forgiven .
cyangwa ni uko uba wunva bavuga bati @: "@ nitubyemera turafungurwa . @" niyo mpamvu rero nta ... ku mutaima wanjye ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge numva ubwange baita ... ||| but do you think they say it from the bottom of their hearts or is it so they may be forgiven ? that is why for me unity and reconciliation is impossible .
hari ibintu leta yashyizeho wenda byo ku ... byo kubwira abantu barokotse ngo bajyae bazenguruka mu magereza bajyae kukangurair bariya bantu bakoze ibyaha kuirega . ||| there is a new government policy of asking the survivors to go round in the prisons and sensitize the killers to admit what they did and report themselves .
ibyo bintu urabishyigikiye ? ||| do you support that idea ?
oya njyae sina ... nta n' ubwo nnabishobora njyewe ntinkishyigikiye , ntinnabishobora kubikora . ||| never , i can not handle it ! i can not manage to do that ; i am a 100 % against it .
tusubiye inyuma gatoya ku buzima bwa mbere ya jenoside , ||| let 's go back a bit before the genocide .
hari abantu tugiye tuganira tubabwira yuko haba mu mashuri ; habaaga hari bianze bikunze ibibazo by' abahutu n' abatutsi ibintu nk' ibyo . mwebwe ntabyo mwagiraga ku buryo ubonaaga yuko biriho ? ||| some people we met told us that there was an ethnic problem in schools , everywhere ; did you face the same problems ?
bibaga bihari kubera ko ... uraumva ko abarezi ba ... nibo banabisho ... ntakuntu uba uri muri classe [ mu ishuri ] ngo ubwirae abanyeshuri uti @: "@ abahutu nimuhagurukae , ||| yes it was there and it was brought by the authorities . you could n't expect good result when you tell the hutu to stand up and after tutsi to do the same , for what purpose ?
nibarangiza bavugae ngo n' abatutsi nibahaguruke , ||| we were asking ourselves what was all that for ?
ubwo se finalement [ amaherezo ] baumvaaga ko iryo barura rigamije iki ? nyine ubwo ntawe tusigaraaga ... usigaraaga wibaza icyo ibyo bintu rigamije . kandi kuko wa mu ... n' ababyeyi bacu babaga batubwira ko baje bahunze abahutu , ||| and our parents used to tell us that they were survivors of hutu persecutions in the previous years .
batubwira ukuntu babatotezaaga , usanga bigize , bitutumba donc . ||| they always used to complain about it .
umh ... nravuga ngarutse inyuma gato tukiri kuri izo nyigisho , evenement [ ibyabaye ] za mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] zitangiye mwakomeje kubona byoroshye ? cyangwa byahinduye isura ? ||| ... did you see any changes after 1990 or were things the same ?
ahubwo nibwo bitangiye gu ... inkotanyi zitangiye kutera hatangiye kujya ... hatangiye kubaho kujya mu nkotanyi , ||| that is when things got worse , the time the inkotanyi attacked . that is the time people started joining inkotanyi .
ahubwo hari icyo nibagiwe kubabwira ko ... ubwo nyine hari musaza wanjye uwo nguwo , yari agiye ... yagiye mu nkotanyi bamufatair ku ntuza ... muri ngenda , bamufungair ... baramufunga habaho kumukubita , ||| i forgot to tell you that my brother had wanted to join the rpf , they caught him while he was in ngenda and put him in prison after seriously striking him .
iyo mbese babaga baumva ko ngo umuntu wo kwa kanaka yagiye mu nkotanyi , byo bibaga ari ibindi bibi , batotezaaga famille [ umuryango ] ye cyane . ||| for them joining the inkotanyi was a big mistake and that would make them harass the families [ of the young people who would try to or manage to join the rpf ] .
famille yanyu barayitoteje ? ||| was your family ever harassed ?
yahise ihinduka nyine , ubwo abasirikare bakahora mu rugo baje kukoresha enquete bavuga ngo nibo bamwohereje n' iki ... ariko bigeze aho bira ... mbese ... kubera ko twebwe ... urabona burya ibintu byose biva mu nzego zo hasi . ||| of course it changed ; for days , soldiers kept coming home investigating on dad , saying that he is the one who had sent him .
kubera ko inzego inzego zo hasi zayoborawaga n' abatutsi mbese twe nta bahutu turi tuturanye nabo , bigeze aho babaumvaish ko ababyeyi nta ruharae bafitemo , ||| in our area , the lowest level [ of the administration ] was led by tutsi , there was no hutu among them . so these authorities convinced the soldiers that the parents were not involved in it and that cooled down things .
bi ... bisa nk' ibaicishije make . usibye ko hari igihe kishize nyine kugira ngo jenoside ibae , bikakomeza bika ... noneho bikaba muri rusangae . ||| despite that , the genocide was later on generalized .

hari harimo mama wanjye na papa na mukuru wanjye . ||| there was mother , father and my older sister .

murebwayire veneranda papa yitwaaga hakizimana fidele , mukuru wanjye yitwaaga hakizimana rosine . ||| murebwayire veneranda , dad was called hakizimana fidele and my older sister 's name was hakizimana rosine .
noneho muri make tubwirae uburyo babamanuye hano uburyo babazanye hano , n' uburyo babafashe kugeza kubica , hano hari hameze hatae mbere ? hari icyobo kimeze kutae ? ||| could you briefly tell us how they were brought down here … how they brought them here … what happened from the time they were caught until the time they were killed .
hano hari icyobo bamenamo imyanda , turi tuhungiye haruguru mu kigo cy' ababikira baza kubatwara ari interahamwe zigera nko kuri makumyabiri . ||| here was a rubbish tip , we had sought refuge in a convent up there .
abenshi baambaye imihoro , bafite imbunda barabamanura , tuesae baratumanura batwicaza mu muhanda hagati nuko uwari ukuraiye interahamwe aravuga ngo ntihagirae uwica umwana , ||| they came looking for them there , they were about 20 interahamwes . many of them had machetes , guns and they got them to go down , they got us to go down and sit in the middle of the road .
ngo bicae abakuru kusa . ||| the head of the interahamwes said they should not kill the children , that they should only kill adults .
nuko bamaze kubamanura nibwo batangiye kubatemagura , abo bashyize muri kiriya cyobo ku itariki icumi , ||| and so after they went down , they started cutting them down , on april 10th , they threw them into this pit .
bo babashyizemo basahura n' amamatela yari ari mu rugo , n' ayarari hirya no hino bashyiraho esanse barabatwika . ||| they also stole mattresses at home and in other houses in the neighbourhood , they poured fuel and burnt them .
barabatemye , babata mu cyobo barangije babashyiraho n' amamatela barabatwika , ||| they cut them down and threw them into a pit , and then they put mattresses on top of them and burnt them .
nyuma nibwo baje kugaruka gusaka mu kigo cy' ababikira , ||| later on they came back to the convent .
ari nabwo batwaraaga papa wanjye . ||| that 's when my dad was taken away .
bwo baje ari interahamwe eshanu , ||| there were 5 interahamwes this time .
harimo babiri bafite imbunda undi afite inyundo n' abandi babiri bafite imihoro , nibwo nabo babamanukaanye nabo barabica . ||| two of them had guns , one had a hammer , two of them had machetes , that 's when they took him down and killed him as well .
abantu bose babaishe mu buryo bumwe cyangwa papa wawe biri bikabije ? ||| were they killed the same way or was his situation worse ?
papa we barabanje bamukubita inyundo mu mutawe , ubundi bamutwara bamukurura hasi . ubwo uraumva deja bari barangije ni nkaho ari ukumwica , ||| first , they hit him on the head with a hammer ; they took him pulling him across the ground . so you can understand that it was as though they had already killed him .
nyuma rero baranamutemaguye kuko nyuma tubataburura ku mutawe hagaragaraho imihoro na hano ( ijosi ) ku magufa biragaragaraaga . ||| later again , they slaughtered him , because when we exhumed them , there were traces of a machete on his head and here [ on the neck ] , revealing the bones .
nibo noneho bashyinguye hano ? ||| so they are the ones who buried them here ?
nibo bashyinguye hano . ||| they are the ones who buried them here .
hari abandi bantu uba uzi , bari abaturanyi banyu baba barimo hano ? ||| do you know anyone else who is in here , perhaps your neighbour ?
yee , barahari . ||| yes , i do .
ubatubwira ? ||| could you tell us who they are ?
hari nk' umuryango wa bazaiga aloys , hari n' abandi bari abaturanyi umuryango wa semana pierre n' umugore we , hari n' umwana witwaga mutama . ||| there is baziga aloys ' family , some of them were our neighours , semana pierre 's family and his wife , there is also a child called mutama .
ni benshi ni benshi harimo nabo ntazi . ||| there are many in there and i do not know them all .
aha hantu iyo uhageze hakubwira iki ? ||| how do you feel when you come here ?
aha hantu iyo mpageze , hantera ku babara kuko hanyibutsa byinshi nk' ibyaba birabaye mu ntiambara . ||| i feel pain when i come here . this place reminds me of the many things that happened during the war .
uko hameze wunva bikushimaishije ? wunva aribyo , cyangwa wifuza ko hari ukundi bigenda ? ||| do you like the way this place is kept ? do you think it 's the way things should be or do you have a different opinion ?
uko hameze ubu , ||| i do not appreciate the way it is now , i do not like it .
njyae uko nbibona nbona bitanshimaishije kuko numva babajyana nko mu nzibutso kuko n' ubundi aha ni mu rugo rw' umuntu , ||| i think they should be taken to a memorial site since this is somebody 's house anyway .
nta n' ikihamya kaerekana ko ari n' abantu bahaguye mu ntiambara . ||| there 's nothing that shows that these people were killed during the war .
numva ikiza ari uko bajya nko mu nzibutso umuntu akajya abasangayo . ||| i believe it would be better to take them to a memorial site and people would visit them there .
nitwa bizimana theodore , ||| my name is theodore bizimana .
nkaba muri 1994 nri ntuye aha mu nyakabanda , nri umuntu mukuru ukuze nzi ubwenge nri nfite imyaka mirongo ine n' ibiri ( 42 ) . ||| in 1994 , i was living here in nyakabanda , i was a mature , grown @-@ up person . i was 42 years old .
ushobora kutubwira icyabereye hano ? ||| could you tell us what happened here ?
ibyabereye aha ni akahoma munwa , ||| what happened here goes beyond imagination .
uru rugo ruri urw' umuturanyi , ||| this was a neighbour 's family .
abantu bahaguye turi kumwe muri eto , ||| those who were killed here were with me at eto .
hanyuma igihe kiragera barabashuka akantu k' akahumurae ab' umutima ( ari myoje ) nako ni abagejeje umunsi . ||| they were deceived , and told that things had cooled down ... in the end , their day had come and they were killed .
bafata inzira barataha bageze aha ntibaharaye barabica , ||| they headed back home but did not spend another night alive , they were killed .
tusigara muri eto tuza kuhava tujya i nyanza ariko abo tusigaraanye barahaguye , ||| we stayed at eto and we left there for nyanza . but those who had remained behind lost their lives .
biraumvikana benshi barahaguye , niho nahonokeye njyewe ariko ubundi abo bantu turi tuturanye muri icyo kihae . ||| it is evident that many people were killed there . i escaped death then . those people were our neighbours .
abantu bicaiyew hano ushobora kutubwira umubare wabo ? ||| could you tell us how many people were killed here ?
hano hano , ||| right here .
bari batabaye mu mwobo uri aha . ||| they 'd been thrown into a pit that was here .
ushobora kutubwira uburyo babaishe ? ||| could you please tell us how they were killed ?
barabatemaguye , barabarasa , babatera amagerenade barangije babajugunya muri uyu mwobo , ||| they hacked them , shot them and threw grenades on them .
uyu mwobo uri umusarane , uri wagenewe kuba umusarane ariko uri utarakoreshwa . ||| the pit was a septic tank ... they had planned to make it into one , but it was not yet completely built .
hanyuma barabica babajugunyamo rero . ||| so they killed them and threw them in .
yari nyiri urugo n' abana be , n' umugore we ? ||| was it the head of the family together with his children and wife ?
yeee , nyiri urugo ni mama w' abana ise w' abana yari yarapfuye yari yarashaje , ||| yes , actually the mother was the head of the family , as the father died , of old age .
hanyuma ni nyina w' abana n' abana ndetse n' abuzukuru . ||| therefore , it was the children 's mother , the children and the grand @-@ children .
nyuma ya jenoside habaye iki ? ||| what happened after genocide ?
nyuma ya jenoside habayeho kuhunga , ||| after the genocide , people fled .
tuhungutse tugarutse mu ngo tugenda tumenya aho abantu baguye ino aho bagiye bagwa . abantu turi turakoze neza uyu mwobo , turahoma tubarekeramo . ||| when we came back from exile , we went back to our homes and we slowly found out where people had been killed . we arranged the pit , cemented it and left them in .
hanyuma igihe kiragera biba ngombaw kushyingura mu cyubahiro , tubakuramo tubajyana ku gisozi bagiyeyo umwaka ushize . ||| later on , we wanted to bury them with respect and we exhumed them and took them to gisozi , last year .
murakoze . ||| thank you .
mu 1994 rero umuntu avuze ukuntu bigenze kuhera mbere hose amashyaka atangiye , ukuntu interahamwe zafungaaga imihanda zikabuza abantu kuhita , inaha tukabura uko tuhaha tukabura biba ari birebire cyane bifata igihe cyo kubivuga . ||| in 1994 ... if i start telling you from the beginning ; from the time political parties rose , how roads were blocked by the militias to stop people from moving from place to place , how we failed to find way to the market places , the story would be so long and it can take much time to say all of it .
ariko nrababwira kusa nko mu cyumweru cya nyuma cyangwa se mpereye nko kuri katabazi amaze kupfa , na bucyaan wa cdr , ||| i will tell you old the events , which took place in the last week or i will begin from the death of gatabazi and bucyana , who was a cdr member .
aho niho tutangiye kugira ibibazo cyane , ||| that is when we started getting many problems .
niho bicaaga abantu cyane bakica abatutsi . ||| that is when many people ( the tutsi ) were killed .
bakafata nk' abantu b' abasore bamanutse bataha mu ngo zabo , bakahita babavanamo imyenda baambaye , bakabaambika iniforome z' igisirikare , bakabaambika baotae , ||| they used to get young boys who would be going to their homes and take their clothes off and force them to wear combat and boots .
bakabashyira amagerenade mu mufuka bakavuga ko ari inkotanyi , kandi ari abantu basanzwe bazi bahangaha . ||| they would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them inkotanyi , yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well .
baragendaaga bakajya kubicira hirya ahangaha bugufi , ||| then , they would be killed just over there .
umusaza witwa theodore bizimana ku buryo bigombye kumuvairmo kuimuka , barahunga bahunga ino kubera imirambo bataaga inberae y' iwe buri gitondo . ||| a certain old man called theodore bizimana decided to shift ; he fled and left this place because of the smeil of corpses , which they used to dump in front of his home every morning .
icyo kihae rero bainjiraaga mu ngo uko bishakiye bakainjirair igihe bashakiye yaba ku manywa yaba ni njoro , ||| during that time , they used to enter people 's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted @: either at night or daytime .
bakatwara ibyo bashatse , bakica abo bashatse , bakakubita abo bashatse . ||| they could take any thing they wished from people 's houses and beat anyone they wanted to beat .
rimwe nraibuka hari kuwa kane mutagatifu pasika igiye kuba nzamutse ngiye mu misa , ngeze haruguru hariya nsanga hari umwana w' umusore bahafataiye , ||| i remember sometime , it was on the hory thursday towards esther .
hari abasirikare bo kwa kinani bari ahongaho ubonaaga basa n' abajepe , ||| i was going to church and as i reached just in front , i saw a certain boy who was caught by the presidential guards .
ahantu bugufi aho mushiki wa nsabimana w' umusirikare yari atuye , nsabimana baitaaga castar . ||| it was close to the home of nsabimana 's sister , this nsabimana was a soldier and he had another name ; he was called castar .
aho hari aka butike banywairagamo , hari umuhungu nbona baramufashe bafata ikintu k' ikibuye kinini iki baubakaish fondasiyo z' inzu , ||| around , there was a shop where they used to gather and take alcohol , there was also a certain boy , so they caught him and reached a very huge stone ; these stones used for making foundations for houses and hit it to that boy .
barakimukubise ntataka noneho umukecuru umwe uri utuye hano haruguru witwaga dina yazamukaaga kuko numvaishije ntamenye ibibaye , ||| i sreamed but a certain old lady who was living around here , she was called dina , she was also moving in the same direction like me and besides hearing , i never knew what was taking place .
ahita ankurura akaboko ati hoshi tugende n' interahamwe zirimo kuica uriya mututsi . ||| then she told me while she was pulling my arm , "@ let 's procced , it is the interahamwe ( militias ) killing the other tutsi . @"
nravuga nti ese arazira iki ? ||| then i asked her "@ what did he do ? @"
ati arazira ko ari umututsi , ati we kubivuga batakuica nawe , ||| "@ he is accused of being a tutsi and stop talking about it , otherwise they will kill you too . @"
nzamuka numva nfite ubwoba , ||| i procceded but i was very frightened .
noneho ngeze mu ikorosi nbona abasirikare nrababwira nti hari umuntu barimo kuica . ||| however , as i reached at the corner i saw soldiers . i told them that there was somebody who was being killed .
barebye babonye barebye afite isura y' abatutsi bati ... kuko nbabwiye mu gifaransa noneho aranbwira ati laisse @le , ||| but when they realized that he had a tutsi appearance , they replied to me in french because i had talked to them in french , so they said , "@ laisse @- le , lui il a le droit de mourrir . @" meaning , "@ leave him , he has right to die . @"
lui il a droit de mourrir ni gutyo uwo mugabo yanbwiye ntakomeza . ||| that is what that man told me . so i procceded .
nibwo rero ku itariki ya gatandatu ni njoro tuumvaaga urabona tutuye bugufi y' ikibuga , ||| and then , on the sixth at night we heard that ... hope you can see that we are neighbouring the airport .
numva explosion y' indege ariko ntitumenya ko ari indege , ||| i heard an explosion of an europlain , however we did n't know it was a europlain .
noneho nyuma yaho nk' amasaha nk' angahe nk' abiri cyangwa imwe muri iyi karaitaiye hatangiye kuvuga amagerenade ya yanri atasanzwe menshi cyane menshi cyane kuko ntinzi ahantu umuntu yatakaiye hano muri karaitaiye arataka atatse tuumva gerenade irakubise hakubisemo iya kabiri ahita aceceka ntiiongera kutaka , ||| then later in about two or one hour 's time we started hearing grenades around the neighbourhood . they were terribly many and unsual in fact somewhere in the neighbourhood , someone screamed and when he screamed we heard a grenade exploded . when the second grenade was exploded , that person stopped screaming and never screamed again .
kugeza mu gitondo mbese bigeze nka saa cyenda z' ijoro tuziko tuyobewe ibyabaye kuko nta nubwo turi tubimenye twebwe . ||| the trend continued until deep in the night at around 03:00 a.m. and we had not known what had happened .
ikinani kipfuye bahise bajya haruguru hariya batukatair kaburae y' umuriro , ||| when president habyarimana . j. @"@ ikinani @" died they cut the cabble , which supplied electricity in our area .
ngo tudakominikana n' ambasade baumvaaga ko tufite ahantu tushingaiye kuri ambasade tuhita duhuruza tukahamagara tukababwira uko biifashe muri karaitaiye , ||| they cut it in order to stop us from communicating with embassies because they knew that some how we must be in tough with a certain embassy ; therefore , they knew we could call the embassy and tell them the situation around our area . therefore , they cut the cabble that used to supply up to this place .
bakata rero kaburae yageraaga ahangaha . ||| frankly speaking , i can not clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time , there were no electric phones .
ntinzi icyatumye bakata amashanyarazi kuko mu by' ukuri telephone zikoresha amashanyarazi zari zitarabaho wenda bari kukata insinga za telephone ariko ntibakatae umuriro . ||| at least they would have disconnected the communication system and leave the electricity .
nuko mu gitondo nibwo tumenye yuko yapfuye nabwo tubibawiyew n' abaturanyi kuko radiyo ntitubashaaga kuyumva kubera amashanyarazi , ||| then in the morning we heard that the president died . we got the rumours from the neighbours because we could n't listen to the radio because we had no electricity .
tubona ahantu hose batangiye kutwika , batangiye kuica abantu . ||| they had started burning people 's houses and killing people .
babanje ruguru hariya ku mudamu w' umupfakazi witwa claudette muteteri yari umudamu wa mutsinzi , ||| they started from up there at a certain widow 's home . she was called claudette muteteri . her husband was called mutsinzi .
umugabo we yari yarapfuye mbere ariko ari umuhutu . ||| mutsinzi was a hutu but he died before the war .
kuburyo icyumweru kimwe mbere yuko bapfa nbisimbutse nramuvuze mpita biibuka , inberae y' iwe iruhande rw' iwe hagati y' iwe no kwa aloys ngirabatware uri perezida w' interahamwe hari ikintu k' ikibuga ariho abaturage bose tukoreraaga inama , ||| a week before her death ... ( i had forgotten to tell you this but i have remembered as i mentioned her name ) between her home and aloys ' ( ngirabatware aloys was the president of the militias ) home , there was a field where all of us would gather for meetings .
muri iyo nama nibwo abantu bavuze ibintu by' umutekano . ||| in that meeting , it was where the security problem was mentioned .
noneho umugabo wanjye pierrot niwe uteye urutoki aratinyuka arabaza ati ariko se njyewe ntashaka kubaza aloys ko interahamwe ze arizo zifata abaturage zikabica zikabicira muri karaitaiye hano kandi babazi yuko ari abacu , ||| therefore , my husband pierrot acted so brave and raised his hand and asked , "@ i would like to ask aloys some question @: the militias he lead are the ones who are killing people of this area and kill them from here . yet everyone knows that those people belong here ! do you want tell us that you do n't know where the inkotayi are living ?
bayobewe inkotanyi aho ziri ko ziri muri cnd kuki mutazisangayo ngo muzaicae ? ||| they are in cnd . why do n't you find them there and kill them ?
ahubwo mu katera nk' uyu mupfakazi claudette akaba ariwe muza kubuza ... kuko ntibatumaaga asinzira na gato buri kihae babaga bari iwe bamwatse amafaranga , ||| in stead you attack this poor widow ‘ claudette ’ and menace her . @" they could never let her sleep for a minute .
bamwatse ibyo bashaka , ni nawe rero bahereyeho igihe cy' intambara . ||| everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish .
icyo kihae rero muri iyo nama rero nibwo we n' undi mugabo ntiibuka izina w' aha haruguru abaturage babatoye uwitwa modeste nibagiwe izina rye rinri abaturage bati ni mugendae mugiraane imishyikirano na aloys , ||| when the genocide begun , she was killed first in our area . and then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called modeste ( i do n't remember his other name ) to go and face aloys about that issue .
ariko tuumva tugize ubwoba kuko umuntu abantu barajya kwa aloys ntibari bugarukae tuumvaaga ko bari bupfae . ||| however , we were very worried ; we knew that no body goes to aloys ' home and comes out alive . we thought they would die .
ubwo babaha gahunda ko ari bugeyo bukeye bawho , ||| therefore , they decided to meet him the following day .
ariko kuko ariwe utinyutse kubaza icyo kintu mu nama tugeze hano mu rugo tuvuye mu nama igihe tukaicara tubona noneho umuntu wese wunvaaga icyo kibazo kimureba cy' umutekano muke yahise aza hano , ||| but since my husband was the one who was brave to ask that question , as we had just reached at home tracing somewhere to sit , we saw everybody who was affected by the security problem coming to our home .
abazaaga benshi bari abatutsi ubwo tufata umwanzuro wuko muri icyo cyumweru tuimuka . ||| most of the people who would come were tutsis . therefore , we came up with a dicision of shifting in that same week .
umugabo wanjye yatangiye kwimura yari afite ikamyoneti niwe ubimuraga ni njoro , ||| my husband started shifting people ; he had a track , so he would shift people at night .
tuhaengairaga ni njoro umuntu akapakira ibintu ni njoro tukabimura bakajya mu zinri karaitaiye , ||| at night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas .
babanje hirya hano mu baturanyi abaturanyi benshi bagiye babimura babavana muri karaitaiye hano abahoraaga bateraw cyane . ||| they begun from across there , that is where they would always attack .
ubwo ntawe turi tufashe gahunda yo kuimuka ari ku wa gatandatu tubonye inzu i kabgayi , tugomba kuzagenda , ||| we had also planned to shift on saturday ; we had got a house in kabgayi for rent .
nibwo bitangiraaga ubwicanyi butangiye tutagiye araitwae tusigaye n' abandi bakeya . ||| unfortunately , that was when the serious killings begun . others had left ; it was a few families and us who had stayed .
kuko abaturanyi bacu bari bahungiye hano bavuga ngo hano ni mu bazungu nta muntu uri buhakekae nta muntu uri buhagerae , ||| because all our neighbours had sought refuge in our home with a belief that , since it was in a white family no body would guess they were there or bather to come .
nnjyae rero nkaumva ko aribyo bose nkabasunika mu byumba no munsi y' igitanda twebwe tuguma muri korodori nibaza bakatusanga muri korodori ntibari bushakae gusaka . ||| personally i thought so . therefore , i would put them in the bedrooms and under the beds .
nramubwira ngo sohoka vuba vuba ugenda nugera hanze biratuma bataza kuza kuko nibinjira hano baradusaka , ||| then us , we remained in the colidor thinking that , "@ if they find us in the colidor they would n't bather to check . @" therefore , i asked him to get out , "@ if they find you outside , they will not have a chance to enter because if they enter they will search around the house . @" i explained to him .
arasohoka ageze hano arababwira ngo nrarwaye koko yaranarwaye malariya ngo vayo tuzamukae . ||| finally , he got out and when he reached out there , he told them that he was sick ; truly he was sick . therefore , they told him that , "@ let us go . @"
bageze haruguru hariya bati hano muri uru rugo harimo ibyitso , ||| as they had reached in front , they said , "@ in this home there are traitors ! @"
noneho umwe arababwira ngo mubae muretse gusaka tubanzae tugende tukomezae tugerae haruguru kubera ko inkotanyi zari zimaze kufata hariya kuri sitade bituma batagera ahangaha , ||| but one of them said , "@ do n't search them now . let 's first go up to the end . @" he said so because the inkotanyi had already captured that area of remera at the stedium . and fortunately they did n't come home .
bari bafite ikintu cy' ubwoba barashorera bageze haruguru gato hariya imihanda ihurair batangira kuvuga ngo muri twebwe harimo ibyitso . ||| they looked scared and when they reached in front at the juction of the roads , they started saying , "@ among us they are traitors and suddenely the shootings from the inkotanyi increased .
noneho amasasu y' inkotanyi aba menshi bituma bakata baravuga ngo non musubirae mu ngo zanyu mucungire umutekano hariya tuzabireba bagaruka gutyo , ||| therefore , they went back and said that they should ensure security right from their homes .
igihe akainjira hano nibwo tuumvaishe batuteye gerenade ikubita hano hejuru y' ibati ariko ntiyagira umuntu ikomeretsa amabati niyo yashwanyutse . ||| "@ about that home , we shall see it later . @" they said . that is how they left without searching our home . and , as he had just entered in the house , they throw a grenade to our house ; it landed on the roof , however no body was hurt ; it affected the roof only ; the roof split into pieces .
bwarakeye rero ku wa gatanu turagenda turahunga , ||| the following morning ... on friday we fled .
tubonye abantu bose bari hanze bamanuka hakurya hariya tubona barahita mu nzira ntawe tufata icyemezo cyo kugenda , ||| we saw very many people fleeing therefore ; we also decided to join them .
hano ubwo turi hamwe n' abaturanyi bacu nri hamwe n' umugabo wanjye n' abana banjye batanu , nfitemo n' uruhinja rw' umwaka n' amezi abiri na musaza wanjye umwe . ||| we were with our neighbours ; i was with my husband , my five children and one of them was a one year and two months old baby and my brother .
turagenda tugera za rubirizi , niho tubashije kusanga abandi bantu turakomeza turinda tugera i butare , tugeze i burunri ku itariki 05/05/1994 . ||| we went and reached those ends of rubirizi , where we found other people and joined them . we continued together up to butare . we reached in burundi on the 05th may 1994 .
ariko n' inkuru ndende kugera i burunri ni birebire , ||| however it is a long story about the experience in burundi .
noneho mu kugaruka hano ngeze aha ku itariki 16/07/1994 nvuye i burunri , kigali imaze iminsi ifashwae nibwo tuhise tugera aha , ||| therefore , we came back and reached here on the 16th july , 1994 . when i left burundi , it was a few days after the inkotanyi had captured kigali .
nza nihuta n' imfunguzo nyine nvuga nti biibuze ngiye kureba n' imyenda ntahae n' imyenda n' iki , ||| therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind .
nibwo nsanze hano hashenye n' iriya nzu yacu yo haruguru ishenye . ||| but i found when this part was demolished . even the other house of ours was demolished .
noneho bamaze kukuramo imodoka , basanga harimo icyobo kijyaagamo amazi yo muri dushe kiri puis perdu , ||| after they took off the car , they saw a pit hole , where water from bathrooms used to flow .
icyo cyobo rero batangira kuvuga ngo turi kurundamo ngo turi turakicukuraiye abahutu , ku buryo bahise bafata icyemezo cyo kurundamo abatutsi bose baishwe . ||| then they said that it was dug for the hutus so , they dicided to bury there the tutsis .
barabazanaaga ngo bakabageza aha bakabambura imyenda bamara kubambura imyenda bakabajugunyamo , noneho bakabica ku buryo utashoboraaga kubatandukanya nyuma y' intambara . ||| they could take their clothes off and kill them in a way that , one could n't identify them after the war .
ubwo hatawemo umudamu umwe uri ufite inda nk' amezi umunani uri uhungiye muri iyi karaitaiye , ||| there is a certain lady who had sought refuge in this area ; she was dumped in that pit yet she was pregnant . she had eight months pregnance .
abo bantu ntitubazi amazina ntituzi aho baturutse , ||| we never knew their names or where they were coming from .
baramuzanye ngo bamutamo amaramo iminsi nk' itatu ataka atapfuye ku buryo umugabo yaratuye mu nzu iri hano hirya tuturanye aho mu rugo rwo hirya yafashe ikintu k' ikibuye aka kimutaho hejuru akapfa ||| the interahamwe dumped her in the pit where she spent five days agonizing before dying . later a certain man who was my neighbour ; he lived in the house close to ours . he got a very big stone and threw it to her in the pit and killed her finally .
noneho nyuma yo kutaburura tugeze igihe cyo kutaburura , tumaze kusaan hano tuifashaishije minisitere ya affaire social ngo batufashe kuvanamo abantu , ||| after some time we wanted to exhume their remains for proper reburial .
ariko barabirangarana ntibatufasha tubona tutakomeza kuba ahantu mu nzu tukodesheje tucumbitsemo , ||| after reconstructing our house , we asked the ministry of social affairs to help us in the act of exhuming and reburying those remains of people . however , they seemed not to consider that as an agent issue yet we could n't continue living in someone 's house .
hari umuvandimwe uri utucumbikiye kukomeza kucumbika kandi tufite inzu yacu . ||| a certain relative had sheltered us but we did n't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house .
tufata icyemezo cyo kuza nubwo bari barimo , ||| we came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there .
ariko turavuga tuti ngo ibyaribyo byose ni abacu ntawareka kubaan nabo nta kibazo , ||| we would consol on ourselves that , "@ after all they are our people , we can live in the house while they are still there . there is no problem . @"
turaza tubamo hashize imyaka ine ubwo ni 1998 , nibwo mu rwego rwa komini yacu ya kicukiro bafashe umwanzuro cyo kutaburura abantu bose bari baguye muri iyi karaitaiye , ||| we started living in our house and four years later ... in 1998 that is when in the name kicuciro district there was a decision to exhume and rebury all the remains of people who lived in this area .
baza rero hano , ||| then , they came to our home too .
twarataburuye harimo tuvanyemo ututawe nka tune turi turabaye decompose . ariko tumaze kugera munsi tubonyemo bavanyemo imirambo mirongo itatu n' icyenda ariko yo ikifite umubiri , ||| we first found about four skulls but when we scooped deeper , more fifty @-@ nine bodies were found , which still had fresh .
uwo mudamu uri utwite ubashaaga kumubona afite inweri afite inzara , ||| and , one could easily identify that woman who was pregnant ; she still had braids and nails .
umubiri ukiriho unabona n' inda yarahombaanye ubona koko ko yari atwite , ||| she even had fresh and one could see that she was pregnant although her belly was deformed .
tuvanyemo abana , tuvanyemo abagabo n' abagore , ||| we found children 's remains inside , men and women .
abagore bo ahanini ubibiirawaga n' imisatsi kuberako ahanini bo bari bakiyifite . ||| one could tell women from their hair ; they still had hair .
ariko ntago tubashije kubamenya , abantu bose baje aho uwunvaaga yarabuze umuntu muri karaitaiye yaraje areba hano , ||| however , we could n't tell who was who ; most people from this area , who lost their beloved ones , came here to see if they would find them .
ikibabaje rero n' uko ababirebaaga banzae kutubwira abantu bahaicaiyew abo aribo , ||| the worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people 's death could n't tell us the names of people who died there .
kuko harimo abo muri karaitaiye hari abaturutse kure , ||| among them , they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas .
ariko ntibashobora kutubwira . ||| however , the people who witnessed them the day they were killed could n't tell us who they were .
tugerageje no kureba umuturanyi ahangaha uwo tufatanyaije urugo , we yanze n' umunsi wo kutaburura yanze kugera aha , ||| we even tried to contact my neighbour ( our houses are next to each other ) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim 's remains .
yahagaze iwe kusa akajya arebair mu miyenzi ntatinyukae kuhagera . ||| he stood in his home and could peep through his fencing ; he did n't want to come here .
ntinzi rero ukuntu kugira ngo umuntu amenye abantu , ||| it is hard to know the people who died here .
uko bizagenda n' ubu ntakubwira aravuga ngo n' interahamwe nbonye kanaka na kanaka kusa aribo bahahita , ||| up to now he can not tell you the truth ; he says that he saw the interahawe so and so passing by .
ukaumva ariko abantu niho barunze abantu igihe cyose n' ahangaha tuhinga hano muri jardin tutangiye kujya tushaka kubakararair biriya biti ukubita isuka ukasanga umutwe , ||| people 's remains are everywhere ; just in front here , there are remains , even in our gardens they are others . there is a time we wanted to dig in our garden but as one would dig in the soil , could fine a skull .
kuburyo mbese tubanje kubanza kuhahamukair hano kubera ibintu tuhasanze . ||| in fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here .
nraumva aricyo nvuga kuri icyo cyobo , ||| i guess that it all i can say about that pit .
icyakora nyuma yaho ibyo babaicishije nbigumaishijemo nk' ibintu by' ibyuma by' ibishasi by' imodoka , ||| but i left all the weapons they used to kill them in the pit .
ibibuye ubonaaga hauzuyemo amaraso nraongera nsubizamo igitaka turahataba turahaihorera ariko ntikiuzuye neza , ||| knives , the car chassis , stones ... all those weapons were stained with blood .
turahareka . ||| therefore , we just buried them in the pit although we never covered it completely .
mu maze kutubwira ko hano hakozwe n' interahamwe z' aloys ese uwo aloys yari muntu ki ? ese hano haje interahamwe zingana iki ? ||| as you said that it was the interahamwe who were led by aloys , who did all those deeds . which kind of person was aloys ? and , how many interahamwe ( militias ) came here ?
aloys yari perezida w' interahamwe yitwaaga aloys ngirabatware , ||| aloys was the president of the interahamwes . his full names were aloys ngirabatware .
akaba yarakomokaaga i gisenyi , akaba ari umuntu wo mu kazu kuko yari yarashatse umukobwa wa mbonabaryi . ||| he was an origin of gisenyi and closely related to the family of the ex @-@ president ; he had married mbonabaryi 's daughter .
mbonabaryi noel yari muramu wa habyarimana , ||| mbonabaryi noel was habyarimana 's ( ex @-@ president ) brother @-@ in @-@ law .
uwo nguwo niwe uri ufite umutwe w' interahamwe zose z' ahangaha . ||| he was the head of all the interahamwe of this area .
ubundi ikindi nkaongeraho nbabwira ko iwe nyuma y' intambara hasanzwe amasanduku y' imbunda , hasanzwe amasanduku y' amasasu , hasanzwe amadokima ( documents ) , hariyo za corresondance , ||| additional to that , after the genocide , in his house people found there bags of guns , bullets , corespondance documents , lists of people who were supposed to be killed , lists of interahamwe ... there were so many things .
hari amalisiti y' abagomba kuicwa , hari amalisiti y' interahamwe , hari ibintu byinshi biri bihari . ababohoje nk' iwe bimwe barabitwitse , ||| but people who seized his properties burnt some of the things ; they never knew the value of those things .
ntibamenya valeur yabyo nadukeya nbashije kukurayo ni udupapuro nbashije kukurayo udupapuro duke nbashije kuvanayo nutwo umuntu waho yarunze kusa wahabohoje araturunda arabwira ngo hariya habamo ibintu abwira ibyahabereye , ||| i just got a few of the information on small papers and the little information i got , was from some body from that home who had gathered them and called me .
mpita ngenda nrazitoragura nrazizana . ||| he told me abiout what took place there and so i rushed for the remaining information and brought it here .
ushobora kutubwira amazina yanyu ? ||| could you please tell us your name ?
njyewe nitwa murekatete serafina , nkaba mbere y' intambara mu ntiambara nri ntuye hano mu kagali , mbere kari gasharu ya kabiri ariko ubu ni kagina , umurenge wa kicukiro , ||| my name is murekatete serafina , before the war , i mean during the war i was staying here in this cell , before it was known as gasharu ‘ ya kabiri ’ ( gasharu 2 ) but know it is kagina , kicukiro sector , kicukiro district .
akarere ka kicukiro . nbaga kwa marume noneho intambara ibaye , turahunga tuva mu nzu tubagamo turahunga tujya mu yinri iri hirya yayo , noneho interahamwe ziraza zihita zitushorera ziratuzana marume bamwicira kuri etaje iri hirya hano . ||| i was staying at my uncle 's place and when the war started , we fled , got out of the house we were staying in and went to another that was close by , and then the interahamwes came and made us walk , they brought us and my uncle was killed in a building that is close by .
baratuzana abandi turi kumwe babicira hano nraumva bararengaaga barindwi . ||| they brought us , they killed some people who were with us , they were more than seven .

babarasaiye ahangaha inberae ku cyapa , aha ku cyapa cya taxi ku muhanda . ||| they shot them from here in front of the bus stop sign , here at the bus stop sign , at the roadside .
hano hantu turabona ko ari ku muhanda , iyo muhaciye cyangwa muhanyuze mwigendera , murabiibuka ? ||| we can see that it is at the road side , when you pass here do you tend to remember ?

bamwe twarabataburuye tubajyana i nyanza , abo ba marume tubashije kubajyana iwacu aho tuvuka . ||| we reburied some and took them to nyanza , we managed to take my uncle where we originate from .

baishwe n' interahamwe kubera ko abasirikare bo ntago bari bakunze kuba bari hano , bari hakurya muri camp gp , abandi bari hirya hariya kwa majyambere hano hari haiganje interahamwe nyinshi cyane . ku buryo arizo zabazamukaanaga zibatunyuraanho hariya hirya aho turi turi . ||| they were killed by interahamwe , because soldiers were rarely here , they were in republican guard barracks , others were on the other side at majyambere 's place , this place was mostly occupied by many interahamwe , who walked the peope who were going to be killed .
ushobora kutubwira umubare w' abantu baje kubafata uko banganaaga , ugereranyaije niba mukibiibuka ? ||| can you please tell us the number of the people who came for you , approximate if you remember ?
umubare w' interahamwe , izakoraaga hepfo hariya tubanje , ni nazo zakomeje kukora na hano kuko zari zimawe , zari nyinshi rwose ku buryo zakabaga igitero ukabona ari nyinshi . ||| the number of interahamwe , the ones who worked down the road , are the same ones who worked even here , they were very many , they would make a big squad .

hano hepfo ku muhanda ku cyapa cya taxi haicaiyew abantu barenga barindwi , baishwe n' interahamwe , izo nterahamwe zabaicishije imbunda , babatabaye munsi y' umuhanda wa kaburimbo , mbere hari inzu ariko ubu hari ikibanza , hari na atelier yo kusudira ariko bigaragara ko mbere hari hari ikibanza . ||| down the road at the bus stop sign , seven people were killed from there , they were killed by interahamwe , those interahamwe killed them using guns , they buried them below the tarmac road , there was a house before but it is now empty land , there is a tailor shop but one can clearly see that there was an empty land .

ni ikintu kirekire cyane ku buryo birananiraanye kugira ngo bakivanaemo abo bantu . ||| it is so deep that it has n't possible to exhume the bodies of the victims that are inside .
turagerageje rero tugerageje kukicukura ariko bavuga ko bamennyemo za acide , ||| we tried digging but we were told they poured acid into it .
bamennyemo harimo inka nyinshi , ||| there are even remains of cows inside !
mbega ku buryo ministere yatubwiye y' uko ubwo kinaniraanye tuzahashyira urwibutso , ||| we tried in vain and the ministry told us we shall build a memorial site there .
tuzakiubakair tukazakiibukairho , tukajya tuza kuhaibukair hafi buri mwaka ariko hakoze neza . ||| that way , we will be able to visit the place every year after it 's been built .
hari umugabo witwa rurangiraw damascene ku buryo n' ababyeyi be bose ariho babashyize , ||| damascene rurangirwa is a man whose parents had been thrown into this pit .
yari yaragerageje ku kisukura neza kukikora neza ngo bazajyae bakiubaha kuko yabonaaga nta bunri buryo buhari bwo kuvanamo abo bantu , ||| he had tried to make it look better so people can show a bit of respect towards the place . he had realized that there was no other way of exhuming the corpses . he got it concreted .
ahitamo kuki betona ariko nyuma ministere itutije imashini bafatanyaije n' akarere ka kicukiro na kanombe baragerageza bageze nko muri metero umunani birananiraan . ku buryo harimo za gaz n' ibindi bintu n' inka bari baranazaemo , icyakora tubashije kubonamo abantu nka batandatu kusa amagufwa yabo bagiye kuyashyingura hamwe n' abandi . ||| later on , the ministry lent us a machine and people from kicukiro and kanombe dug it up , but they were unable to go over 8 meters because of the gas and the cows remnant ... they were at least able to exhume the remains of 8 people that they buried in respect with other bones .
abantu bicirwaaga hano baicwaaga mu buhae buryo ? ||| how were these people killed ?
barabarasaaga ? ||| were they shot dead ?
babazaanaga ari bazima bakabanaagamo ? ||| did the perpetrators throw them alive into the pit ?
abantu babazaanaga ari bazima bakabicira uruhande rw' uru rwobo hanyuma bakabanaagamo , ||| the perpetrators brought them alive to the pit , killed them and then threw them in .
harimo n' abo banazaemo ari bazima , ||| some were even thrown in alive !
njyewe nzi nka mukuru wanjye bamunazemo ari muzima yamazemo iminsi nk' ibiri arimo kuvuga ngo bamuhae amazi ngo bamuhae amazi , ||| for example , my older brother was thrown in alive . he spent 2 days agonizing and begging for drinking water !
bamaze kumuca akaboko bamunagamo ari muzima baramubwira ngo niyihambe . ||| the perpetrators cut up his arm and threw him in mocking him and saying he should bury himself .
abandi bararasawaga ? baicishawaga amahiri ? ||| what about the others ? did they shoot them or did they use clubs to kill them ?
hano akenshi n' imipanga , ||| here , most of the people were killed with machetes .
n' imipanga cyane cyane harasawaga nk' uwageragezaga wenda kuiruka , ariko n' imipanga ahanini n' impiri abandi bakabanaagamo ari bazima hano bapfuye urupfu rubi cyane . ||| only those who tried escaping were shot . the rest were killed with machetes and clubs or even thrown into the pit alive ! people were subjected to horrible deaths here and it was n't just here because there were other pits .
ariko ntago ari aha honyine hari n' ibindi byobo barimo ariko uru nirwo barwitaga urwabayanga , ||| this pit was called ‘ urwabayanga ’ and many cows were thrown in .
kubera ko ni ahantu bashyiraagamo inka nyinshi cyane kandi murabona ko inka z' ahangaha zari inzungu zari inka ziriya za kijyambere , ||| i believe you saw the cows that were here . they are from a very productive race ... we were n't able to do anything about it !
ku buryo zananiraanye hano harimo abantu benshi cyane . ||| there are many people here .
ugereranyaije haba haratawemo nk' abantu bangana iki ? ||| about how many people were thrown in here ?
akimara kupfa iryo joro , ||| the night he died .
ku buryo bamwe bari bamaze n' iminsi bahungiye muri eto , ||| there were people who had already sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro .
biri biratangiye kera abantu bari baratangiye kuhunga mbere mu byo mu kwezi kwa gatatu 94 . abantu bamwe bari barahungiye ku ma paruwasi , ||| it had started way before ! people had been displaced since march 1994 . then , they 'd sought refuge in parishes .
kuva ku itariki ya karindwi nibwo abantu batangiye kuhungira muri eto , ||| it 's only from the 7th of april that they fled to eto .
ariko muri eto abashoboye kuva muri eto bageze i nyanza nabo barabica , ||| the ones who were lucky to survive the atrocities at eto went to nyanza . when they got to nyanza , they were killed .
harokotse bake cyane kandi muri eto harimo abantu bageze nko ku bihumbi nka bitanu . ||| very few survived . there were about 5,000 people at eto .
aba ni abashoboye kuva muri iyi misozi bajya za kahanga baraongera nanone bamwe barabica abandi baragaruka , baziko bagarutse babatangirair ahangaha , ||| the ones you see are those who were hiding in the hills of gahanga . some were killed and others came back . when the interahamwes got to know that these people were going to come back here , they trapped them .
babatangirair ahangaha bose interahamwe zari ziri kuri iriya misozi yose zabazengurutse . ||| it was all the interahamwes from all the hills around here .
ibyaribyo byose nk' umuntu utuye muri aka kagali ka biimaan , kandi ukaba uri umwe mubaba bararokotse ngira ngo ufite icyo uzi ku bantu bataagamo abantu ahangaha , ||| i believe that as a survivor and as somebody who lives in this cell of byimana , you know something about the people who were dumping people into the pits .
ntinzi niba utubwira mu magambo makeya kubierekeye abo bantu ? ||| i 'd like you to tell us about them if possible .
inaha hari interahamwe zizwi cyane , hari interahamwe hari uwo baitaaga gerard karangaanw , hari abo baitaaga ba kabagabo , hari abo baitaaga ba bizimungu , ||| among the most popular interahamwes were gerard karanganwa , kabagabo , bizimungu , idi and kagarara .
hari abo baitaaga ba idi , hari abo baitaaga ba kakarara . mbega hano hari interahamwe nyinshi cyane , inyinshi ntago zagarutse , ||| in fact , there were many interahamwes but most of them did n't come back .
abenshi ntibagarutse ndacyeka bakiiri muri congo . ||| i think they are still in congo .
abo bose barababuze , ||| all those interahamwes disappeared but maybe there 's still a chance with the gacaca jurisdictions .
ariko nitugair amahirwe ahari gacaca zikazaba tuzakomeza tubaririze kuko nnjyae abo bantu nrabaumvise kuko njyae nhungiye hariya hafi kuri eto nnjyae nnyuze mu mirambo yo muri eto , ||| we will continue to get more information . i did n't personally see the people i told you about as i had sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro .
ariko hari abantu bamwe bagiye basigara kuburyo izo nterahamwe zafatanyaije n' abaitwaaga ngo ni abazuru bavaaga za kanombe , ||| i crossed over dead bodies ... but some people still survived .
kuko iyi misozi yose ndetse nuko arinjyae utanga ubuhamya njyenyine ariko hari abandi benshi babizi bazi nizo nterahamwe . ||| i heard that those interahamwes were working in association with those of kanombe who were called the ‘ zulus ’ because all these hills ... maybe it 's because i am the one giving you this testimony but there are other people who know better than i do and who even know those interahamwes .
tuza kucukura uru rwobo abenshi bari abaturage bo muri iyi misozi itukikije yose , abenshi barabazi bazi n' abagiye babanaaga ahangaha . ||| we dug this pit ... most of the victims were from neighbouring sectors . those people know them and they know they threw them into this pit !
ariko cyane cyane abo nbabwiye ba bizimungu , ba kabagabo , abaitwaaga ba karangaanw gerard , ||| but the interahamwes such as kabagabo , karanganwa gerard , such as ... are known because they lived here in byimana !
abaitwa ... ibyo aribyo byose izo nterahamwe zirazwi bari batuye kuri uyu musozi wa biimaan aba kanombe bo bazwi nabo bahaturiye hariya . ||| i suppose that the interahamwes from kanombe are known by the people from kanombe .
ariko ku buryo hano hapfairiye abantu barenze nk' ibihumbi nka bibiri , abo muri uru rwobo n' aha iruhande barahari mushobora kuza mukabareba hari n' abatarashyingurwa , ||| over 2,000 people were killed at this pit and nearby . you can see it , some of them have n't even been properly buried yet .
muraza kubona ibisigazwa byabo tugenda tubibona buhoro buhoro . ||| you will see their remains as time goes .
hano bakazahakora neza tukazahaubaka mu nyuma buri mwaka ntawe tukazajya tuza kuhaibukair abacu . ||| we 're planning to build this place so that we can come and commemorate every year .
bacibiciye hano mu rubirizi kuko nzi hari umugabo nzi w' umuveterineri uri wihishanye na mukuru wanjye hano nk' ubu tuzamubaza kuko yaramubonaaga bamutwaye baje kumwicira ahangaha . ||| they were killed here in rubirizi . there was even a veterinary who was hiding with my brother . we will ask him because he saw him being taken away to be killed .
ni damascene ? ||| are you talking about damascene ?
oya yitwa rwagapfizi . ||| no , he is called rwagapfizi .
rwagapfizi ? ||| rwagapfizi ...
muri aya mazu , ayangaya hariya muri laiterie ( ikaragiro ry' amata ) kuko yarahakoraaga . ||| yes , in those houses over there , the houses that belong to the diary . that 's where he was working .
ubungubu tuvugaeko abantu benshi bazaaga ahangaha bazaaga mu ma ( pick up ) baje mu camionette bazanye n' abasirikare bakabarasair ahangaha ? ||| if we agree that people were brought in pick ups ... were they accompanied by soldiers who shot them afterwards ?
abasirikare bari bavanze n' interahamwe , ||| the interahamwes were mixed with soldiers .
bari bavangavanze abasirikare bavaaga za kanombe kandi bose bari bafite n' imbunda na za gerenade n' imipanga n' impiri byose . ntago ari turiya twonyine , ||| they all came from kanombe and were armed with grenades , guns , machetes , cudgels ... not the ones you sae , check on the other side .
dore ziriya n' imbavu n' ibiki n' ukuvuga ko no hasi harimo n' abandi kuko bari ... buriya bariya ni abantu . ||| there are others there ! yes ! human beings !
umuntu witwa ndiramiye ntago ujya umumenya ? ||| do you know a certain ndiramiye ?
ndiramiye . ||| ndiramiye ?
ikibazo ntikiumvikana ||| ...
gacaca bamwe izabatubwira tu , ||| but i know gacaca will let us know .
hano hari umuhanda rwose munini n' imihanda yaragaragaraaga neza mbese bamaraaga kuba benshi bakabamanura hariya , ||| there was a big road here ; the killers would put the victims together and whenever they reached a big number , they took them over there .
abo nibo bahageraaga bapfuye . ||| the victims were already dead by the time they got there .
nitwa nzaramba justin nkaba nvuka hano mu kagali ka biimaan , umurenge wa niboye , akarere ka kicukiro . ||| my name is justin nzaramba and i was born here in byimana cell , niboye sector , kicukiro district .
ndi mu myaka mirongo itanu n' ibiri ( 52 ) , nfite umugore n' abana . ||| i am 52 years , i am maried and i have children .
hano mu rubirizi haguye abantu batagira ingano ku buryo hakiboneka ibisigazwa , ||| a big number of people were killed here at rubirizi .
hakiboneka amagufwa aho ariho hose kuko mu rubirizi hari ibyobo binyuraanye bagiye bashyiramo ibiryo by' inka . ||| they were so many that we still find their remains till this day , there are still bones all over . in fact , there were many pits in rubirizi , they served for the feeding of cows .
ariko imyobo miremire cyane ku buryo abantu babavanaaga aho babaga bihishe mu kituragae ariko abenshi nshoboye kumenya nabo bavanye kwa conseiller baitaaga biziyaremye babazaanaga ari ninjoro abantu b' abasirikare , ||| however , the people who were hiding in their villages ... i did n't see the ones who were taken from biziyaremye 's house , he was the counsellor . the soldiers used to kidnap them and take them to rubirizi .
ku buryo bazanyemo abantu turi tuturanye abenshi bari biganjemo abakobwa , ||| among them were our neighbours , most of them were women .
bakabazana hano muri rubirizi hano . hari umuhanda unyuze hano uvuye hariya za kicukiro ukambukiranya rubirizi ukagera samuduha aha hantu ni mu cyobo hano iruhande niho hanyuze umuhanda . ||| there was a road from kicukiro that passed here , near this put and that went up to samuduha .
hari hari imihanda miremire bakabicira ahangaha noneho bakaongera bakazamukair hano hari imihanda myinshi bakazamukair hariya haruguru bakataha , ||| there were big roads here . the perpetrators were bringing them , killing then and then use a different road to go home since they were so many of them .
bahigaaga hose n' abavaaga , ||| they were chasing all over !
hari n' amabeni ( camion ) yajyaaga avana abantu bapfuye hariya i samuduha nabo babazaanaga ahangaha kuko hari umugabo witwa gafaranga yanbwiye yuko abantu bakoraaga muri minitrape bajyaaga bashyira abantu muri bya bimodoka bya minitrape bakaza kubamenamo hano rubirizi . ||| they ... there were even trucks that brought corpses here from samuduha . there 's a man called gafaranga who told me that drivers from the minitrap [ ministry of transportation ] put corpses into the trucks and then came to throw them here at rubirizi .
baicwaaga mu buryo ki ? ||| how were the victims killed ?
oooh , ||| oh !
barababatemaguraga abo barashe ni bakeya , ntibabarasaaga cyane kuko bafataaga umuntu bakamutema imirambo bangaga yuko iguma ahongaho iwabo , ||| they cut them down into pieces . very few were shot . they mutilated their victims and then got rid of them because they did n't want to see the corpses of their victims near them .
ariko imyinshi n' iyariwe n' imbwa nanone hano . hari iyo batashoboye nibura kushyira muri ibyo byobo abenshi bariwe n' imbwa bapfuye nabi , ||| however , most of the dead bodies were devoured by dogs . they did n't throw all the corpses into pits , the rest was eaten by dogs .
bamwe bapfuye baumva bamwe bapfuye ntago babicaaga burundu barabakomeretsaga kusa bakazaicwa n' ibikomere , ||| in fact , some people were n't completely killed , they mutilated them and then left them to die of the wounds , after suffering greatly . they died a horrible death .
birababaje cyane ino habereye ibintu bibi cyane nubwo bavuga ibyabereye i nyanza , ||| what happened here is so atrocious !
cyangwa ibyabereye muri za eto hano rubirizi naho habereye ibintu bikomeye cyane ibintu bibi . ||| it was terrible even if it 's not spoken about as much as the nyanza and eto @- kicukiro events . there were dreadful scenes of atrocities here at rubirizi !
abacitse ku icumu ni bakeya nkubu kubona abantu barokotse muri iyi segiteri cyangwa iyo hakurya ni bake cyane ukurikije ukuntu bari batuye ni bake cyane abenshi ni bashyashya , ||| very few survived here ; when we consider the number of inhabitants of this sector or of the neighbouring ones , we realized that it 's very low compared to the number of the people who lived here before . most of those who live here today are new .
kandi abo bantu b' interahamwe abafunzwe ni bake abandi bashobora kuba bari muri congo . ||| in addition , very few interahamwes are in jail . the rest are probably in congo .
icyakora bamwe bigeze kuza bashobora kuirega abandi baranangiye ariko ubirebye hapfuye abantu benshi muri kicukiro no muri rubirizi cyane cyane . ||| but some did surrender themselves ; the rest are not there anymore ... in fact , mostly the kicukiro and rubirizi inhabitants lost their lives here .
ibyo aribyo byose nubwo uvuga ngo hano haguye abantu benshi , ||| obviously , if there was a big number of victims , that means the perpetrators were many as well .
biraumvikana ko ibyo aribyo byose abo bantu nabo baishwe n' abantu benshi ngira nkubaze niba hari abantu mwaba muzi baba baragize uruhare muri ibi bintu baba bakihari bakidegembya ahangaha ? ||| i 'd like to ask you if you know some of the people who participated in those acts ... maybe they 're free ... ?
kwidegembya abenshi ntibakihari cyane cyane abari muri cdr , ||| free ... most of them are no longer free . those perpetrators were members of cdr and mrnd [ political parties ] .
abantu bari muri ya parti ya cdr na mrnd nibo babanri nbabwiraaga baitwaaga ba idi , ba kabagabo bari bafite n' ama modoka yabo bagenda bakafata ama modoka nibyo bairirwaaga bakora kusa , kusahura no kuzana abandi bantu abaitwaaga ba bizimungu n' abaitwaaga ba kakarara bari bafite n' andi mazina baiita ariko abenshi barazwi n' imiryango yabo irahari . ||| people like idi , kabagabo whom i told you about were driving their cars , looting and looking around for other guys such as bizimungu , kagarara ... they had given themselves nicknames but we know their names and their families are still alive !
