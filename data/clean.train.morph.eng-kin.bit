n- ba n- ra- ba- ihoreye kuko ubu nibwo muri make ... ubu nibo ba- ka- gombye ku- gira isoni , kuko ba- n- yi- ciye cyangwa ba- ishe n' abandi . ||| i would have let them go because this should be the time when ... they should be shameful of their deeds ... but when i see them , i am the one who is ashamed because they killed my family and others as well .
ariko ubu n- ra- ba- bona n- ku- ibuka ukuntu n- bi- ruka -aga -ho ngo ba- ba- funga -e ... ariko n- ra- ba- bona n- ka- umva a- ri- jya -e u- fite isoni . ||| today i see them and i remember how i pursued them , wanting them to be arrested and i feel ashamed .
n- ka- umva a- ri- jya -e umwaye , n- ka- umva i- ya- ba n- ri n- fite aho n- ku- i- hisha , cyangwa n- fite ahandi hantu n- jya n- ta- ba- bona , n- genda . ||| i see them and i am so dishonored i could hide myself or i wish i could move to a place where i would n't be seeing them anymore !
n- jya -e kuko bi- teye isoni ku- iruka ku muntu u- ku- gira -iye nabi ngo ba- mu- funga -e , ejo ba- ka- mu- fungura . ||| it 's so shocking to run after somebody who killed your people so they can be imprisoned and then see them released !
iyo n- bi- menya ntabyo n- ba n- ri- riwe n- jya -mo . ||| had i known it was going to be that way , i would n't have gotten involved .
ha- ri ikintu leta i- kora cyo ku- fungura abantu ngo bi- reze ba- ka- emera icyaha , kugirango baze mu banyarwanda , ba- ongera -e ba- iyunga -e . ||| the politic of the government consists in releasing the people who have acknowledged their crimes so they can live with the rwandan nation again and be united with them all over again .
icyo kintu u- ki- bona ku- ta -e ? ||| what do you think of that ?
wowe u- bona bi- genda bite ? ||| and how do you think things should be ?
ku bwanjye ntabwo n- vuga ngo ... u- rebye bariya bantu barampombeje . ||| personally , i can not say that ... i have lost so much because of those people .
kuko ba- n- bujije umuryango , bahombya n' u- wu- n- ri wese u- buze abe . ||| they took away my family and everyone else who lost his or her people lost in the same way .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo n- vuze ngo @: n- tekereje ngo ba- ba- komeza -e ba- ba- funga -e wenda ngo ba- ba- guma -ish -e mu munyururu , ibyo aribyo byose n- jya -e ha- ri abo nasabonuje , kandi n- umva ko aribyo ... a- ri nabyo n- vuga ngo iyo menya ha- ki- ri kare ntabwo n- ba n- ri- riwe n- bi- ruka -ho ngo ba- ba- funga -e . ||| if my opinion is that they should be imprisoned and remain there - i have asked some people - and i believe that would be the right thing to do ... and that 's why i am saying that if i had known it from before , i would n't have spent so much time running after them for them to be put in jail .
kuko hariya ba- funze ibyo ba- rya ni leta i- bi- ba- gaburira . ba- gira -e kuba ba- ra- yi- ciye abantu , ibyo aribyo byose ibyo ba- rya bi- ra- henze ! ||| in jail , it is the government that feeds them .
n' ubuzima bwabo , iyo ba- rwaye ... bu- ra- henze . n- ra- umva rero igihugu ki- ra- homba kandi n' ubundi ki- ra- na- homba -ye . ||| not only did they kill my people - i 'd expect that their meals are expensive , their lives , their health , all that is costly - so the country is losing and it 's already lost anyway .
ubwo rero i- bi- i- za n- ra- umva ko kuba ba- ra- ba- retse ba- ka- genda ba- ka- jya hanze , ba- ka- genda ba- ka- kora bakanakorera n' igihugu n- ra- umva jya -e ntabwo n- vuga ngo ba- gize nabi . ||| so in my opinion , releasing them so that they can be working for the country is n't bad .
nta yi- n- ri solution nta ki- n- ri ki- boneka . ||| there 's no other solution anyway .
kuko ubundi nk' iwacu ku kibuye ahantu i ru- ba- enga -ir , abantu hafi ya bose ba- ra- ishe . ba- ra- ishe abantu hafi ya bose , n' u- ta- ra- fashe umupanga ya- tunga -iye mugenzi we agatoki aho umututsi ya- ri a- ri . ||| because if i take the case of my home area in kibuye , almost everyone in rubengera killed ; even the one who did n't take a machete pointed at the place where a tutsi was hiding , showing his or her friend .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo ku kibuye ho ha- geze n' aho abana bi- ca . ba- fite n' imyaka icumi ba- fite irindwi ba- ka- genda ba- ka- jya mu masaka ba- ka- jya ku- higa abandi . ||| it reached a point where even children killed in kibuye , a ten year old child or a seven year old one were busy looking for people in the bush .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo abo bantu bose u- ka- gombye ku- genda u- ka- ba- fata , u- ka- ba- shyira ahantu bose u- ka- ba- funga . ariko ntabwo bi- shoboka . ||| meaning that all those people should be taken to jail which is impossible .
igihugu se ki- tera i- n- bera -e ku- ta -e abantu ba- ri mu munyururu ? ||| how would the country develop if everyone is in jail ?
ntabwo bi- shoboka . ||| that 's not possible .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo tu- gomba ku- bi- emera nta ku- n- ri . ||| so we just have to accept , there 's no other solution .
ku- sa i- ya- ba ba- bi- emera -aga , ba- ka- saba imbabazi kandi bose . ||| but it would be so much better if all of them would accept their crime and apologize .
nti- biba -e ngo nimbyemera n- ka- saba imbabazi n- za- fungwa igihe gito , nzagabanyirizwa icyaha . kiriya kintu nicyo kintu ki- n- babaza . ku- genda ba- ka- ba- igisha ngo nimusaba imbabazi ngo muzagabanyirizwa icyaha , ||| not so much because they know acknowledging it and apologizing is a means of being in jail for a shorter time . i have a problem with it ! they teach them that if they accept their crimes , their punishment shall be reduced .
biriya byo bi- ra- n- babaza . kuko ubundi umuntu ya- gombye ku- saba imbabazi bi- vuye mu mu- ta- ima we , a- ta- ri undi u- giye ngo a- bi- mu- tera -e -mo . kuko ba- ra- bi- ba- fasha bakabibatsindagiramo , ||| one should first of all apologize from the heart , it should n't be because someone else has instilled it in one 's mind .
ba- ka- ba- bwira ngo nusaba imbabazi wishe abantu ba- ngana gutya u- za- fungwa igihe gito , ||| they keep telling them how when they apologize even after killing many people , they 'll be in jail for a short time .
n- ta -ho ba- va n- ta -ho ba- jya . ||| it 's useless .
kuko kuba bonyine ba- ta- bi- i- kura -iye mu mu- ta- ima wabo ngo ba- bi- kura -e -yo kubera ko ba- biba -w -iye -w n' umutima wabo , ni u- ku- vuga ngo ejo , ejo ba- shobora ka- ongera ka- bi- kora . ||| the fact that they did n't make the decision on their own , it 's not something they do after giving it much thought shows that it 's something they could easily do again .
none se a- ba- ishe sogokuru wanjye , nibo nyuma ba- ishe mu- saza wanjye nibo bamwishe ? ||| are n't the people who killed my grandfather the same ones who killed my brother ?
ha- ri ha- shize imyaka myinshi kandi bamwishe muri 1959 . ||| it was many years ago , he was killed in 1959 .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo niba bo bonyine ba- ta- vuze ngo tu- koze nabi tu- ica abaturanyi , tu- ica abantu tu- saga nk' aho tu- va inda imwe , ntacyo tu- ba- ziza , none koko reka tu- saba -e imbabazi ; ||| meaning that they never apologized for what they did , they never acknowledged that killing their neighbours for no reason was wrong .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo n- ta -ho ba- va n- ta -ho ba- jya ejo ba- za- ongera ba- bi- kora -e . ||| so , it 's all pointless and they 'll do it again .
u- ra- vuga uti @: « ku- ba- funga n' uguhombya igihugu . » ||| you said that imprisoning them is a waste for the country .
ese u- bona ku- ba- fungura igihugu aribwo ki- za- unguka ? u- bona ha- ri agaciro ha- ri icyo bi- za- mara -ir abanyarwanda ? ||| do you believe the country will gain when they are free ? do you think it will be of any use for the country ?
n- ra- umva njyewe ku- ba- funga ... none se umuntu wishe ... umuntu wishe abantu nka kuriya abantu ba- ishe impinja , a- ka- fata uruhinja a- ka- kubita ku ru- ku- ta uruhinja ru- ka- pfa , a- ka- fata umubyeyi akamwica amwicishije igisuti ! ||| putting them in jail in my opinion is ... a killer ... someone who killed infants , who got an infant , hit it on a wall and killed it ; who killed a mother with a shaped stick of wood !
ubundi ... u- ra- umva wa ... ku- mu- funga ubundi n- jya -e n- ra- umva a- ta- na- fungwa . ||| actually ... you 'd ... i do n't think they should even be imprisoned .
n- ra- umva ya- pfa ... n- ra- umva ya- gombye ku- jya hariya a- ka- pfa , a- ka- cirwa urwo ku- pfa , a- ka- pfa . ||| i think they should die ... they should just die , they should be sentenced to death .
ariko se niba hafi ya bose ba- ra- koze ibintu nk' ibyo ? n- ra- umva ku- ba- funga ntacyo bi- ba bi- maze , ||| but if almost all of them did that , what 's the point of imprisoning ?
n- ra- umva ba- ba- rekura ba- ka- jya hanze ba- ka- jya ba- na- tu- bona , ba- ka- tu- bona kuko bo ba- umva -aga ko tu- za- shira . ||| they should let them free so they can be seeing us on the streets ; they thought we would be wiped out !
ba- umva -aga ko ngo umwana a- za- jya a- baza ngo ariko umututsi ya- saga a- ta -e ? ||| they thought their children would be asking what a tutsi was looking like .
ba- ka- jya ba- na- tu- bona ... ba- ka- tu- bona . ||| let them see us !
ku- sa ikintu ki- n- babaza , ni nko ku- bona umuntu u- citse ku icumu a- ka- umva ko ya- sigaye a- ka- jya mu n- za- oga a- ka- ba umusinzi . ||| one thing that hurts me is seeing a survivor becoming an alcoholic .
ntabwo tu- ka- gombye kuba abasinzi , cyangwa ngo tu- cika -e intege . ahubwo ibyabaye bi- ka- gombye ku- tu- bera impamvu yo ku- va hasi , tu- ka- shaka uburyo bu- n- ri bwo ku- va hasi , ||| we should n't turn into alcoholics or get discouraged .
tu- shaka ukuntu twakwiteza i- n- bera -e a- ba- bi- shoboye . abatabishoboye nabo ba- ka- jya ba- egera bagenzi babo nta ku- n- ri ... nta ki- n- ri n- bona , nta ki- n- ri . ||| on the contrary , what happened should be a reason for us to stand up and develop ourselves as much as possible for those who have the means to attain that development and those who do not have comfortable life , they could approach their friends ... that 's all i can think of .
u- bona ubuzima bw' a- ba- citse ku icumu bwitwaye ku- ta -e muri kino gihugu ? ||| what do you think of the lives of the survivors in this country ?
ibintu bya gacaca n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ubu- umva ku- ta -e muri make ? ||| how do you feel about gacaca , unity and reconciliation ?
( ya- ba- n- je ku- seka ) ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ! ||| [ she laughs ... ] unity and reconciliation !
ubundi ntabwo u- ka- bwiye abantu ngo nti- ba- ka- iyunga -e , n- tu- shobora ku- bwira abantu ngo nti- mu- ka- iyunga -e . ||| of course you can not tell people not to be united , because if you say so , you 'd be like the people who killed the tutsis .
kuko u- bwiye abantu ngo nti- mu- ka- iyunga -e nawe u- ba u- baye nk' a- ba- ishe abatutsi . ||| you would n't be any different from them .
n- ta -ho u- ba u- tana -iye nabo . ariko ubundi ubu se ngewe u- n- bwira ngo n- genda -e n- iyunga -e n' umuntu wishe alphred ? ||| on the other hand , would you dare tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed alfred ?
ubu se njyewe u- n- bwira ngo n- genda -e n- iyunga -e n' umuntu wishe data ? ||| would you tell me to be reconciled with the person who killed my father ?
ni u- ku- vuga ngo tu- gomba kuba -an kugirango tu- ubaka -e igihugu , ariko ku- vuga ngo n- genda -e n- iyunga -e n' umuntu u- n- yi- ciye ibyo ntabwo bi- shoboka . ||| yes , we have to live together in order to build the country but you can not tell me to reconcile with them .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo ni u- ku- ku- saba ... ni u- ku- saba ibintu bi- ta- shoboka . u- ri u- bona umuntu a- ku- saba ibintu bi- ta- shoboka n' u- ku- ku- saba ibidashoboka , ||| you would be asking for the impossible !
ibyo nti- bi- shoboka ... ntabwo bi- shoboka . ||| that 's just impossible !

mu rugo tu- ri abana umunani n' ababyeyi bombi . ||| we were eight children in my family with both parents .
genocide i- tangiye tu- ra- hunga tu- hungira ku bitaro mu bushenyi , ||| when the genocide started we fled to the hospital in bushenyi .
interahamwe zi- tu- sanga -yo aba a- ri -ho za- icira n' ababyeyi banjye n' abana tu- vukana -aga , ||| interahamwes found us there and killed my parents and all my siblings .

muri uko ku- irukanka n- je ku- hura n' interahamwe zi- n- fata ku ngufu . ||| while running , i met other interahamwe militiamen . they raped me but did n't kill me .

barampisha igihe ki- ra- gera ba- ra- za ku- ha- n- kura aba police ngo n' uko tu- ri tu- fite umwana mu nkotanyi . ||| later , the police took me out of that house saying that i had a son in the rpf .
ba- n- jyana ku- n- funga -ir ku- n- funga kuri commune ha- ri commune gisuma , ||| then they took to be jailed at the commune office of gisumu .
aba police ba commune nabo ba- ra- n- fata ku ngufu , igihe ki- ra- gera ba- n- jyana i cyangugu ngo ba- fashe interahamwe nako inkotanyikazi , ||| policemen at the commune office raped me ... then at some point i was taken to cyangugu saying that they caught an interahamwe ... sorry an inkotanyi woman instead .
njyeze i cyangugu naho ba- n- fata ku ngufu abasirikare . ||| when i reached cyangugu , the soldiers raped me again .

ha- ri ukuntu bi- giye bi- genda . ||| it must have happened in a way .

ba- n- sanga mu bitaro n- rembye cyane ba- gerageza ku- shaka avega nibo ba- ri ba- yi- zi nyine kugirango i- basha -e kunkuriikirana no ku- ba- bwira imibereho yanjye , ||| i do n't know how they found out that i was there but after visiting me , they started to look for avega ... they were the ones to know about avega . they said that they would contact avega and let them know about my status and also so they follow me up .
ariko igihe ki- ra- geze banyijyanyira i kigali n- jya ku- rwara -ir tribunal nako n- jya ku- rwara -ir roi faycal . ||| after some time they took me to kigali to be admitted to the tribunal ... no rather to king faycal hospital !
avega rero ni ni nk' uburyo bwo kusha ku- n- shakira u- n- yi- ta -ho mu ki- ha -e n- ri i cyangugu n- n- jya -e ntabwo n- ri n- yi- zi . ni muri ubwo buryo nti- n- zi , ||| that 's how avega started taking care of me . i never knew it before then when i was in cyangugu .
n- n- jya -e nti- n- ba- bwira uko ya- menye kuko n- ri n- rembye cyane . ||| i do n't can n't tell you how they knew about me ... i was way too sick .
nonese abantu bo muri tribunal ba- kuba -w -iye -w n' iki ? ||| how did the people at the tribunal know about you ?
ese ba- ri ba- ku- zi ? ||| did they know you before ?
n' abantu nyine kubera ko n- ri n- rwara -iye mu ka- ca -e n- vuka -mo n' abantu ba- ri ba ba- ri baje ku- menya ibintu by' ihohoterwa nabo , ||| in fact those people were working on rights abuses and ... in the area where i lived ... they asked people and they were told that i was at the hospital .
baza ku- ba- bwira ko n- rwara -iye ku bitaro nyine baje ku ngo n- ba- ha -e ubuhamya , u- sibye ko icyo ki- ha -e n- ri n- rembye n- ta- basha -aga ku- vuga ariko nyuma yaho n- ra- bu- tanze nabyo . ||| so they came to collect my testimony but ... i was so sick then that i could n't even speak but later , i was able to tell them my story .
ni muri ubwo buryo baje . ||| that 's how they came .
hanyuma icyo ki- ha -e u- ri mu bitaro n' i- n- y- uma y' ibyo bintu u- tu- bwiye by' ibyo b' ifata -w ku ngufu . ||| during that time at the hospital it 's all after being raped .
u- ba u- ra- igeze u- jya kwa muganga ku- gira ngo wipimishe u- menye niba u- randuye ? ||| did you ever go to the hospital to be tested for hiv ?
icyo ki- ha -e ndi kwa muganga nibwo ba- n- pimye ba- sanga n- randuye . ||| i got tested during my admission period and that 's how i found out i was infected with hiv .
francoise n- gira ngo n' ubwo a- ri ibintu bitoroshye nagirango u- tu- sobanura -ir -e ese n' ubwo bwose u- ri u- rwaye u- rembye ariko u- shobora -aga no ku- keka yenda ko bi- ba bi- ra- turutse kuri ririya fata -w ku ngufu ri- baye muri genocide no guhohoterwa bi- kabije . ese ikintu cyo ka- umva u- randuye u- ki- akiriye u- ta -e muri wowe ? ||| francoise , i know it is not something easy but i would like you to explain ... i guess when you were very sick , you could think and ... after realizing that it was the result of the raped that you went through during the genocide ... i mean how did you receive the fact of being infected with aids ?
kubera ko mbere y' intambara n- ta- ri n- ra- igeze n- bona -an n' umugabo n- hise menya ko a- ri mu nti- ambara , ||| i had never been with a man before the genocide so i immediately realized that i contracted it during the genocide .
n- ki- mara ku- bi- menya ba ba- n- shize ku miti kuko n- ri n- geze igihe , ||| immediately after figuring that out i was given medication because i had the right stage for the cure .
n- tagira ku- bi- fata -ir roi faycal kubera ko a- ri -ho n- ri n- rwara -iye . n' ubwo bi- goye n- ra- bi- akiriye ariko ntabwo byoroshye . ||| i started taking them at king faycal hospital where i was ... even though it was hard i had to accept it .
hanyuma , ihangana -e . ||| sorry but you have to be strong .
na n- enda -aga , n- enda -aga ku- ku- baza u- gerageza -e ku- ihangana rwose u- n- babarira -e kuko si nta ku- n- ri bi- genda . ||| i wanted to ask you ... please try to be strong and bare with m but ... there is not another way .
n- shaka -aga ku- ku- baza nt' ese avega nta nta wu- n- ri muntu n' umwe w' umuterankunga wigeze u- basha kuba ya- gira ikintu a- ku- fasha nyuma ya genocide ? ||| i want to ask if there is anyone else other than avega who has supported you after the genocide .
n- tawe . ||| there is no one .
wenda n- ta- ri ninzira cyane mu bintu bya avega n' uburyo i- ba- fasha . ||| maybe before i go into details about avega and how they help you .
u- ra- umva genocide ya- ra- baye i- ku- twara -ir abavandimwe i- rangije irarangaza i- ku- fata no ku ngufu , n- ta- shaka ku- ku- baza . ha nta muntu n' umwe u- sibye ni n' abongabo ba- ku- fashe ku ngufu u- ra- igeze u- menya ba ba- ba ba- ra- gize uruhare mw' i- icwa ry' umulyango wawe . ||| the genocide happened and it took away your relatives and you were raped ... the question that i would like to ask you is @: is there not anyone apart from the men who raped you that were involved in the killings of your relatives that you recognized ?
ntabo n- menye nti- n- menye n' uko ba- pfuye kubera ko tu- ta- ri tu- ri kumwe icyo ki- ha -e tu- ra- tata -an -aga ntago tu- ri tu- ri kumwe kuko iyo tu- ki- ba tu- ki- ri kumwe n- n- jya -e n- ba n- ra- pfuye . ||| i did n't even know how they died because i was n't with them . we were all scattered and i was n't with them . i were with them i would have also been killed .
hanyuma u- ba u- ra- igeze n- i- bura u- pfa ku- menya n' aho ba- ba- jugunye ngo n- i- bura ba- ba -e barashyinguwe ? ||| were you able to know where they threw them at least ? that could have helped burying them ?
uhh bashyinguwe hariya ku ku rwibutso rwo rw' igashirabwoba . ariko papa we ba- mu- taye mu mu kivu kubera ko abo bose ba- rasa -iye -w ku kibuga cy' umupira ba- ba ba- ba- jyanye mu kivu . ||| yes they buried them at the memorial site of gashirabwoba . my dad was drowned into the kivu lake . in fact all the people who were shot at the football court were thrown into the kivu .
ese uyu munsi abaturanyi bawe ahantu mwari mu- tuye ubundi ubu mu- banye mu- ta -e ? ||| today your neighbours from where you used to live ... how is life like together today ?
n- i- bura u- bona nyuma ya genocide ha- ri ubwo u- jya u- ha- gera n- i- bura uka u- ka- basha ku ku- gira icyo u- hura n' abaturanyi bo mwari mu- turanye ? ||| at least after the genocide when you go there , do you ever meet with people who used to live nearby ?
huuu ntabwo n- jya -yo , ||| no i can not return there .
ntabwo n- basha ku- vugana nabo nti- n- bi- shobora . ||| i can not be able to talk to them .
reka noneho genocide i- ra- rangiye , ha- ri ingaruka nyinshi za genocide ubuzima bu- ta- ri bwiza nyuma ya genocide . ||| now that the genocide is over , there are many consequences after the genocide like misery .
muri ubwo buzima bwose u- gize nyuma ya genocide bwumvikana ko a- ta- ri bwiza , avega nayo i- ka- ba u- tu- bwiye ko ya- giye i- gerageza ku- ku- fasha uko i- shoboye . ||| your life after the genocide ... it is clear that it was not good but you told us that avega tried to help you as much as they could .
ese u- bona n' iki kintu u- tu- bwira ? ||| so what can you tell us ?
ese avega u- ra- bona ibyo aribyo byose n' ubwo i- ku- fasha , ||| with the help from avega , do you sometimes feel that it is enough ?
ha- ri igihe u- ba u- vuga uti ubu- fasha burampagije , ha- ri igihe u- ba u- vuga uti n- ra- bona inkunga a- ri i- ica nti- kize . u- bi- vuga -ho iki ku- geza ubu ? ||| or do you feel like the help is kills more than it can save the situation ?
ubuzima nyuma ya genocide iyi myaka cumi n' itatu i- ra- shize u- tu- bwira bi- meze bite ? ||| can you tell us about that ?
kubera ko avega ifasha abantu benshi inkunga i- genda i- ha umuntu ntabwo i- mu- haza . n- kata -w -e tu- ba tu- na- fata imiti tu- bona ntacyo bi- tu- mara -iye kubera ko tu- ba tu- keneye ibintu byinshi . ||| because avega supports many people , the support it gives to individuals can not satisfy them . for people like me who are also on medication , it does n't help because we have lost of needs .
none ha ha ngirango a- honga -ho u- shobora ku- tanga inama . ese inama u- tanga se n' iyihe ? ni -yo ka- ongera ubushobozi avega n' iyo ku- shaka indi milyango i- ba- fasha ? ||| now i would like you to share your opinion ... what kind of advice would you give ? is it to increase the capacity of avega or to look for other organizations to help you ?
mwongereye avega a i ubushobozi bi- rusha -ho kuba byiza kubera ko cyangwa mu- tu- shakiye nindi milyango uko mwabishobora kuko avega nayo irageragera nta nta kibi i- jya i- tu- korera . ||| increasing avega 's capacity would be much better because ... or you could find other organizations if you can . avega does the best they can and there 's nothing negative that they do .
ikibazo ahubwo n' uko inkunga zayo aba nke cyane zika kandi zi- keneye abantu benshi , nk' ubu tu- ri tu- fite ishyirahamwe ri- ri -mo abantu ba- geze kuri mirongo hafi mirongo cyenda . ||| the only problem is that the support is very small and a lot of people need it . for instance , we have an association that has almost ninety people .
abo bose ba- reba avega kandi u- ka- bona nti nti- ba- shoboye nti- ba- fashe uko bi- kwiriye . ||| all those people have their eyes on avega and it is clear to see that it does n't help them much .
ehh iryo shyirahamwe n' ishyirahamwe ryi ri- itwa ngw' iki ? ||| what 's the name of that association ?
tu- hoza -an -ye . ||| duhozanye .
u- tu- sobanura -ir mu magambo a- rambuye n' ishyirahamwe ri- kora iki ? ||| could you repeat for us in detail what this association does ?
ese a- ba- ri -mo ni bande ? ||| who are the members ?
ha- ri -mo abantu benshi amazina yabo ntabwo n- basha ku- y- ibuka , ba- ri ba- na- tumiye presidente waryo niba ya- je simbizi . ||| there are many people . i can n't remember their names ... they invited the lady who is the president the association but i do n't know if she came .
a- ri n' ishyirahamwe nyine ry' abarwayi ariko nta n- ka- unga ri- fite i- hagije . ||| it 's an association of patients . it does n't have enough support though .
nta ki- n- ri kintu ibyo a- ri ibyo byose u- sibye no ka- umva ko ibibazo a- ta- ri ibyawe ariko ku- hura na bagenzi bawe mu- shobora ku- gira igitekerezo wenda cyo kuba mwagira ikintu mu- kora koko bi- ra- umvikana ko niba a- ri ishyirahamwe ry' abantu benshi ha- ri igihe mu- shobora no ku- n- gurana ibitekerezo . ||| is there nothing else apart from the fact that the problems are not just yours but meeting with your friends ... you might come up with an idea because it is clear that if it is an association of a lot of people , there are times you might be able to discuss and exchange ideas .
u- gerageza ku- tu- bwira ubuzima bwo mw' iryo shyirahamwe niba ha- ri ikintu u- bona bi- shobora ku- fasha umuntu u- sibye no ku ka- umva ko ya- ba a- ta- riwe u- fite ibibazo ku- sa . ||| would you try and tell us about life in that association if there is any help that it provides to you other than knowing that you are not the only one with problems .
tu- bonye inkunga tu- shaka icyo ku- kora nicyo kiza cy' ishyirahamwe kandi duhuje . ||| if we ever get support , i am sure that we can find what to do . that 's the good thing about this association ... we would do it together .
none mbere wenda y' uko tu- rangiza n- umva -aga ha- ri ikindi kibazo n- ifuza -aga ku- ku- baza . ||| now before we finish , there is another question .
u- ra- bona ha- ri ha- ri ha- ri abadamu benshi ha- ri abana nabo ba- giye ba- hura n' ibibazo mu nti- ambara byo ku- fata -w ku ngufu , ||| i would like to ask you ... you see , there are lots of women and children who confronted lots of problems in the genocide .
ha- ri -mo uyu munsi abarwayi ba- rembye ha- ri -mo a- ba- giye ba ba- na- tera -w n' inda bakananduzwa , ba- ka- byara abana uyu munsi nabo ba- randuye . ||| that is to say rape ... and today , they are very sick , some woman got pregnant and infected ... they gave birth to children who are also infected with aids .
donc ibibazo byinshi u- ra- bona bi- ra- ha- ri , nyuma ya genocide ku nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu genocide i- rangiye tu- vuga ko ibibazo bi- ri kuba kubadamu bahohotewe mu nti- ambara na n' uyu munsi bi- ki- ri ingorabahizi . ||| it 's clear that there are lots of problems . thirteen years after the genocide , it 's obvious that women who were raped during the genocide still face a number of problems today .
none ni iyihe message cyangwa n' ubuhe bu- tuma -w wu- n- va u- ha abo bantu bose ba- vuza -w -e haruguru ? ||| now what message would you send to all the people mentioned above ?
ubutumwa n- ba- ha cya n' uku n' u- ku- ba- bwira ko ba- kwiriye ku- ihangana . ||| the message i would tell them is that they should n't give up .
huu n- ra- umva nta ki- n- ri , u- sibye ko ku- ihangana bi- ra- goye cyane cyane iyo nta nta n' imibereho u- fite bi- ra- rushya . ||| i do n't think there is anything else although patience is not easy especially when you do n't have good welfare .
tsuu ariko u- sibye n' ikintu cy' avega ifasha bano bantu a- ri nayo i- ba- ita -ho wenda n- vuga nga ni -yo yonyine , mwumva ubundi u- bu- sanzwe , ubundi mwumva leta ya- kora iki ? ||| apart from what avega helping those people and looking after them ... maybe it is only avega that takes care of them ... what do you think the government should do ?
ese nka leta u- ra- bona ha- ri igihe umuntu u- na- vuga uti genocide ya- ra- tu- ishe nyuma ya genocide abantu n- i- bura ba- gerageje ku- itaba -w -ho , ||| do you think that sometimes ... after the genocide has destroyed someone 's life , that people have some kind of care at least ?
ba- ra- vura -w cyangwa se ba- bona ubushobozi leta i- shyira -ho farg . ese reka n- jya -e nkwibarize ikibazo . nyuma ya genocide , genocide i- maze ku- rangira u- bona ha- ri ikintu n- i- bura ki- kozwe u- sibye n' avega ku- gira ngo n- i- bura abo bantu ba- giye ba- hura n' ibyo bibazo haba mu buryo bw' uburwayi , ||| let 's say , the government established an institution called farg ... the question is @: after the genocide , do you think that there is any effort done apart from avega regarding people confronted with diseases , regarding the issue of education , rebuilding lives ... could you say something about that ?
haba se mu buryo bwo ku- iga , ||| if you believe that something was done , what is it ?
haba mu buryo bwo ku- i- sa -an ku- gira ngo ubuzima bu- komeza -e . gira ikintu i- bi- n- bwira -ho niba u- bona ha- ri ikintu ki- kozwe niba u- bona ha- ra- kozwe iki . niba u- bona ha- ra- kozwe iki u- vuga -e uti ha- kwa -iye ku- korwa iki ku- gira ngo abo abantu ba- rusha -e -ho ku- itaba -w -ho ? ||| and if you know it , could you also tell us if the help improved people 's welfare ?
ibyo ba- koze byo ni byinshi kuko abantu , ||| what they did is a lot .
abana ba- bashije ku- iga n' aba bamwe na bamwe ba- basha ku- i- bonera amazu yo kuba -mo u- sibye ko a- ta- ri bose . ariko ha- ri -ho ikibazo cy' amacumbi abantu benshi ba- ta- ra- fata , ba- ta- ra- bona n' ikibazo cy' imibereho mibi . ||| children were able to go to school ; some people were housed though it 's a few of them because housing and poverty are still the major problems .
n- ra- umva nti- n- zi . ||| i do n't know ...
aaa aba abadamu ba- giye ba- fata -w ku ngufu ndetse bakananduzwa mu nti- ambara ba- keneye ku- bona imiti kandi tu- zi ko iriya miti i- henda tu- zi ko n' ubuzima bu- jyana n' iyo miti bi- saba ko umuntu aba yi- fashije a- ka- ba -ho mu ubuzima bwiza . nti- n- zi niba wenda niba muri iryo shyirahamwe ryanyu cyangwa n' abantu mu- rya mu- hura -ir muri avega . ese avega ibyo bintu byose i- basha ku- bi- shobora mu- ka- basha kuba -ho muri ubwo buzima bu- kenera n' ibyo bintu byose , ||| all these women who were raped and also infected with aids during the war [ genocide ] need medication and we know that the medication is very expensive and we know that the life that goes along with that medication requires that you are self sufficient and a certain level of good life ... i do n't know if in that association or the people you meet in avega ... is avega able to do all of that to allow you to live a life that requires all of those things ?
n- ra- bi- umva nkubu u- vuze ngo ntabwo inkunga i- hagije . ariko se u- shobora ku- tanga nk' igitekerezo u- ka- vuga uti ha- kozwe ibi ku badamu ba -ho ba- huye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi bi- genda bitya . imiti i- ta- bonetse aba bantu ba- meze batya . mbese u- ka- gira nk' ikintu u- bi- tu- bwira -ho . ||| i understand ... you have already told us that the support is not enough but can you give us an idea and you maybe could tell us that if any of the woman facing these challenges could do this or ... if there was no medication for them ... just tell us something about that .
i- bi- erekera -an -ye n' imiti , ||| concerning the medication , most of the people who have reached the stage to take the medication have already started to take them .
imiti yo abenshi a- ba- geze ku ki- ha -e cyo kuyifa ba- tangiye ku- yi- fata nta kibazo ki- ri -mo ariko iyo miti ku- bera -ko ba- yi- fata mu buzima bubi nabyo nti- bi- ba- buza ku- pfa kubera nyine ko iriya miti iba i- saba ubuzima bwiza nk' uko u- bi- vuze , kuba -ho neza ku- rya ibintu bi- fite gahu , ||| that 's not a problem but because they take the medications in poor conditions , they end up dying because those medications require a good life as you said .
akamaro kandi abenshi ntabyo ba- bona . avega nayo ntiyabasho , nti- ya- ba- fasha ngo i- ba- shobora -e , ||| most of them do n't realize its efficiency . avega is also not able to help them .
ha- gize icyunganira avega bi- ba byiza ku- rusha -ho kuko ubuzima bwabo n- i- bura bu- genda bu- rusha -ho kuba bwiza . ||| if there was something else to support avega , that would be good because their life would be much better .
cyane cyane ko n' umuterankunga wa avega ya- ha- gaze ubu noneho nta n' icyo avega iri ku- ba- mara -ir . ||| plus , since the donors of avega stopped funding it , avega does n't help them anymore .
nti- n- zi n' iba ha- ri ikintu wenda wu- n- va -aga wifuza kuba u- ka- ongera kuri iki kiganiro tu- gira -an -ye niba ha- ri icyo n- ta- ku- bajije wu- n- va -aga u- shaka ku- tu- bwira , nabyo ibyo aribyo byose . ha- ri ikindi kibazo mbere y' uko n- vuga ibyo ngibyo n- ri n- giye ku- ku- baza , nti ese ni nubwo bwose ha- ri ibyo bibazo byinshi bi- meze gutyo u- ka- ba u- bona ha- ri ibibazo by' ubuzima ha- ri ibibazo by' imibereho , donc ibibazo ni byinshi bi- ra- umvikana . ese n- i- bura wu- n- va ha- ri ibyiringiro by' ubuzima ? ||| i do n't know if there is anything you would like to add to this discussion that we had but if there is something i did n't ask that you would like to say , whatever it is ... there is another question before you say something , i would like to ask you ... although you have all these problems ... problems of health ... do you still have hope in life ?
ibyiringiro by' ubuzima byo , nonese u- gira ibyiringiro by' ubuzima u- ta- ri ku- bona u- ri kuba -ho neza ? ||| hope ... can you have hope in life when you realize that your current life is not good ?
nta byiringiro by' ubuzima ndi ku- bona cyane cyane nta n' aho kuba n- fite . ||| i do n't have any hope ! i do n't even have a place i can call home .
avega ya- ri i- giye ka- ungura -ir inzu yo kuba -mo ariko kubera ko umuterankunga wa wayo ya- ha- gaze bi- hise bi- bu- ri- za -w -mo , nta bu nta ka- izera -e cy' ubuzima n- fite . ||| avega was going to buy for me a house but because the funders stopped their support ... i do n't have any hope today .
ese k' ubu tu- reba ha- shize imyaka cumi ni tatu genocide i- rangiye ubuzima n- vuga bu- ka- ba bu- ri mu ku- genda bu- rusha -ho ku- genda bu- gora -an , n- i- bura tu- izera -e ko nyuma y' igihe runaka ha- ri igihe ibi bibazo u- bona , ||| it 's now thirteen years after the genocide and obviously life gets more and more challenging but do you believe that at some point , all these problems will end ?
u- bona bi- za- shira ba- iga bi- ka- va -ho bi- ka- shira ubuzima bu- ka- ba bu- genda kuba -ho kuba bu- rusha -ho kuba bwiza ? ||| and that people will have a better life ?
icyo ka- izera -e se umuntu ya- ki- kura he ? ||| where would one get that hope ?
ko nyine bi- genda bi- rusha -ho kuba bibi , keretse mu mu- gize icyo mwatumarira n- ra- umva bu- genda bu- rusha -ho kuba bwiza buhoro . ||| living conditions are even getting more challenging ... maybe if you could do something , i think that would be help somehow .
u- sibye na n- ta -w -e nka leta y' u rwanda mwumva yo i- shobora kuba ya- kora iki ? ||| if not individuals , what do you think the government of rwanda should do ?
cyane cyane by' umwihariko kuri bano bantu ba- fashwa n' avega cyangwa se n' abandi badamu bose ba- giye ba- hura n' ibibazo mu nti- ambara . ||| especially for those supported by avega or even others who faced similar problems during the war [ genocide ] .
by' umwihariko leta y' u rwanda i- kwiriye ku- twita -ho kubera ko n- ra- umva hi i- ta- tu- itaye -ho nta ki- n- ri ki- twita -ho , ||| most especially i think the government of rwanda should take care of us because if they do n't , no one else will .
ntabwo tu- tegereza i- bi- vuye hanze kandi leta y' u rwanda a- ri -yo izi n' ibyatubayeho i- ta- basha ku- twita -ho kandi ntabwo i- jya i- twita -ho nk' uko bi- kwiriye . ||| we can n't wait for foreigners when the government , aware what happened to us does n't take care of us as it should !
hanyuma tu- rangiza wenda dusoza ha- ri ikintu wu- n- va mwifuza wenda ku- gira icyo mu- vuga niba ntacyo n- bashije cyangwa se ikindi kintu mwumvaga mwa mwatubwira ? ||| in conclusion is there anything you would like to say that i did n't ask or you would want to tell us ?
icyo n- umva -aga n- ba- bwira n' uko mwagerageza gusha ku- shaka uburyo ubuzima bwacu bwa bu- gerageza kuba -ho kuba bwiza buhoro kuko kuba bwiza cyane bwo ntabyo ariko n- i- bura no muri icyo ki- ha -e cyo ku- fata imiti tu- ka- basha ku- bona ibyo ku- rya n' ibindi byose bi- jyanye nabyo n- i- bura tu- ka- bona ko ubuzima bwacu n- ta -w -e tu- fite aba abo bu- babaje . ||| what ... i would like to tell you is that you could try and see if you could find a way to help us to improve our lives at least as we are on medication ... so we can get food and all the other things that are related to that . then we can really feel that there are people who empathize with our sorrow
aho tu- giye ku- ganira amateka y' ibintu bi- baye muri jenocide ..... twagirango mu- tangira -e mu- tu- ibwira . ||| we would like you to introduce yourself to us as we are about to talk about what happened in the genocide .
n- itwa murebwayire josephine n- tuye mu kimironko mu kagali ka nyagatovu mu ka- rera -e ka gasabo . ||| my names are murebwayire josephine i live in kimironko in the sector of nyagatovu in the district of gasabo .
ese twagirango noneho u- tu- bwira -e mbere ya jenocide i- ta- raba umuryango wanyu mwari mu- baye -ho ku- ta -e ese u- ri u- fite umuryango u- ngana iki ? ||| we would like you to tell us about your life with your family before the genocide , how big was your family ?
u- tu- sobanura -ir -e umuryango uko u- ngana -aga abana umugabo noneho nurangiza u- za -e ku- tu- ereka ishusho cyangwa se isura yuko uwo muryango wanyu u- ri u- baye -ho mbere ya jenocide . ||| explain to us and tell us how big your family was ; your children , your husband and then after try and give us an idea or paint an image for us on how your life was before the genocide .
mbere ya jenocide tu- ri tu- tuye ahantu ba- ita imasoro icyo ki- ha -e ba- hita -aga muri secteur ya n- rera . ||| before the genocide we lived in a place called masoro at that time it was called ndera sector .
komine rubungo ni -ho tu- ri tu- tuye ubu ni akarere ka gasabo n- ri n- fite umugabo n' abana batandatu . ||| commune rubungo is where we lived , nowadays it 's called gasabo district , i had a husband with six children .
abahungu batatu n' abakobwa batatu tu- ri tu- fite nundi mwana twara -ir -aga mwishywa w' umugabo wanjye . ||| three boys and three girls , we also had a child that we had adopted , my husband 's niece .
tu- ri tu- banye neza tu- ri tu- fite urugo rwiza tu- ri tu- fite imibereho ishima -ish -ije umugabo wanjye ya- ra- kora . ||| we were living in harmony , we had a nice house , our standard of life was good , and my husband was working .
yeee hanyuma abana ba- anga -e ba- ri bakuru ba- ri ba- maze ku- kura ba- ri muri sogonderi umukuru ya- ri a- ri mu wa kane sogonderi umuto ya- ri mu wa kane primaire . ||| my children were growing up and were in secondary school , the oldest was in senior four and the youngest was in primary four .
hanyuma n- ri n- fite n' abandi bavandimwe tu- bana -aga ba- saza banjye babiri . ||| we also lived with my two brothers .
umwe tu- ri tu- maze ku- mu- shyingira a- tuye hafi yacu mbese tu- ri umuryango munini u- shima -ish -ije hanyuma jenocide ya- tangiye mubyukuri muri mirongo icyenda nibwo tu- umvise ko inkotanyi za- teye . ||| one had just gotten married and he lived near us , we were a big nice family , the genocide rally started in 1990 , that 's when we heard that the inkotanyi [ rpf ] had attacked .
ba- vuga ko za- turutse ibyumba ku itariki ya mbere z' ukwacumi mirongo cyenda tu- esa -e tu- bi- umvise kimwe n' abaturanyi bacu ntabwo tu- ri tu- zi ibyo aribyo . ||| they said they came from byumba on the 1st of october 1990 , we all did n't know what it was when we heard about it with our neighbours .
ariko itariki ya karindwi z' ukwacumi mirongo icyenda ni -ho umugabo wanjye baje ku- mu- fata -ko a- ri ikitso k' inkotanyi . ||| on the 7th of october 1990 that 's when they came to arrest my husband saying he was a spy for the inkotanyi .
ba- sanze a- ta- ri no murugo kuko ba- ba- n- je ku- vuga ko nta bantu ba- gomba ku- va murugo ariko twebwe ku- bera -ko tu- ri tu- fite iyo butike ya- ri i- ri -ho mu- saza wanjye . ||| they did n't find him at home , because even though they had said that nobody should leave their homes , my brother went to the shop to work because it was near the house .
a- zamuka a- giye ku- reba uko bi- meze kuri iyo butike a- baje ku- mu- fata ba- sanze arijyewe u- ri murugo n' abana . ||| so my husband also went to see how things were at the shop , the people who were coming to arrest him only found me and the children at home .
ni njyewe ba- ba- n- je ku- twara ariko ba- ba- n- je ku- kora ibindi bi- ta- ri byiza gusaka ku- kubita , ba- ka- jya ba- n- kubita ibibuno by' imbunda ba- ambaza ngo imbunda tu- ri tu- fite i- ri- ha -e ? ||| so they took me first but before that they were doing bad things ; searching the house and throwing things around , hitting me with their gun @-@ butt asking me where i had hidden the gun that we had .
ba- yi- bonye ba- vuga yuko a- ri -yo tu- reba -ir -mo inkotanyi ba- ba ba- bonye urwitwazo ha- ri gurude za mazi abana ba- jyana -aga -mo amazi nubwo ha- ri hafi ariko ha- ri ubwo ba- twara -aga -mo amazi . ||| when they saw it they said that we use it to look at the inkotanyi , they had just got a reason . there were also water bottles that my children used to take water in , even though it was n't far , they used them .
ba- vuga -ko a- ri izabasirikari ba- ra- n- kubita ariko ba- ita babaje cyane ba- ambaza ngo ninerekane ibyo n- hishe ngo ninerekane izo nkotanyi . ||| they said it belonged to soldiers and they started beating me but not too much , telling me to show them everything else i had hidden and show them the inkotanyi .
imbunda zabo hanyuma ba- bi- buze ba- ra- n- twara mu modoka ba- n- bwira ngo nibamubona ba- ra- n- rekura tu- ra- zamuka tu- geze hafi yiyo butike tu- ra- mu- bona . ||| when they did n't get the guns they took me in the car and said that if they get my husband they will release me and let me go , when we reached near the shop we saw him .
n- ra- ba- bwira nti dore umugabo wange nguriya a- ra- je ba- ra- hagarara ba- ra- mu- bwira ngo n- i- injira -e -mo a- jya -e ka- ubaha imbunda nabemereye ngo ariko njyewe n- anze ku- zi- ba- ha atampaye uruhushya . ||| so i said to them , there is my husband , he is coming . they stopped and told him to enter the car and go give them the gun i had promised them but could n't give it away without his permission .
n- ra- vuga nti mu- ra- n- beshyeye ba- ra- n- bwira ngo ninsohoke n- sanga -e abana ngo we ba- ra- za ku- mu- ka- rura . ||| so i protested that they had just lied and they told me to get out of the car and watch over the kids saying that they will bring him back later .
umugabo ba- ra- mu- jyana n- anga -e n- ra- manuka n- sanga abana ariko u- bona ko abaturanyi bacu ba- bonye -ko koko tu- ri inyenzi ako kanya ba- tangira ku- tu- ha akato . ||| they took my husband and i went back home to watch over the kids but at that moment you could see that our neighbours started looking at us like we were cockroaches and stigmatizing us .
n- ra- genda n- jya murugo n- egeranya ibintu byose ba- ri bavangavanze n- egeranya amasaka n- egeranya n' amasukari ntabwo ba- gira gahunda . ||| i went home and rearranged everything they had disorganized and thrown around , wheat and sugar . they were very confused .
nuko bi- rangije abana n- ra- ba- egeranya n- ra- ba- humuriza n- ra- ba- bwira n- ri- n- giye n- anga -e na papa ya- giye nubu ba- garuka ba- ka- n- twara ariko mu- hura -e . ||| i called all my children and started comforting them telling them that they almost took me , dad was taken , they might come back and take me too but do not be afraid .
nta muntu u- ri u- ki- gera murugo yewe nuwo n- egera -aga u- bona -aga a- fite ubwoba yuko ndibumukoreho . ||| nobody was even reaching our home anymore ; if i came close to someone they would seem afraid that i was going to cause them trouble .
nuko n- ka- jya n- byuka n- genda murugo hariya irubungo ni kure ya kigali n- ka- bura u- n- bwira ati a- ra- ha n- ha . ||| so i would wake up and go home , rubungo is far from kigali and nobody would direct me where he might be .
bi- geze mu kwezi kwa cumi na bi- ri baza ku- tu- bwira -ko tu- za- jya ku- baza kuri seyiseyeri ba- ka- tu- bwira amakuru y' abantu bacu bafunz . ||| in december we were told that we can go ask at cicr about our people who were put in jail .
nti- n- ri n- ha- zi n- za- ku- jya -yo umuntu a- ra- n- yobora icyo ki- ha -e n- ra- yobye nti- unguka -ir kwa perezida habyarimana hariya mu kiyovu . ||| i did n't know the place so someone directed me but i got lost and went to president habyarimana 's house in kiyovu .
abasirikare banyicaza hasi ba- ambaza ibyangombwa ba- ambaza indangamuntu nuko ba- ra- n- bwira ngo ndi inyenzi n- ra- ba- hakana -ir ko n- ta- ri -yo . ||| soldiers made me sit down and asked for my identity card and then they said that i was a cockroach but i denied it telling them i was n't a cockroach .
ba- ra- n- bwira bati u- giye he nti n- giye kuri seyiseyeri bati ubwo u- fite inyenzi ubwo u- fite ibyitso nti n' umuntu wampamagaye u- shaka kumpa akazi . ||| they asked me where i was going and i told them cicr so they said i was going to see spies , no someone called me to offer me a job , i said .
nuko n- ra- genda ba- n- bwira ngo ningende n- ikoreye amaboko n- genda -e n- ririmba ko nta n- zira iri aho . ||| so they told me raise my hands and walk away singing there is no way here .
n- genda n- bi- vuga ariko uwo musirikari arahanyereka a- ra- ha- n- geza mpageze rero n- ra- baza ba- ra- n- bwira ba- ri reka tu- reba -e niba a- ri muri computer nti- n- ri- n- zi na computer icyo aricyo . ||| one of the soldiers showed me the place and i walked away saying what they had asked me to say , when i reached there i asked and they told me they were going to check in the computer , i did n't even know what a computer was .
nti umugabo wanjye ba- ra- mu- twaye none ba- ra- n- bwiye ngo n- tawe a- ra- n- bwira ati noneho genda nyuma y' iminsi itatu u- za- garuka -e ku- reba n- ra- genda . ||| my husband was taken , now i am being told that he is not on the lists . so she told me to go home and come back in three days .
nyuma y' iminsi itatu n- ra- garutse a- ra- n- bwira ngo nimusigire amazina ngo azambariza n- ra- garutse n- sanga umugabo ya- n- y- andika -iye nyine a- n- bwira amakuru ye nyine ko a- ri muri gereza . ||| after three days i came back , she had asked me to give her the names of my husband . she told me that my husband was in prison .
hariya 1930 n- tangiye ku- jya n- jya -yo ngirango n- ra- mu- sura ariko ya- rinze a- fungurwa nyuma ya mezi atandatu n- ta- ra- mu- bona kimwe n' abandi . ||| so i started going to visit him at the 1930 prison but did n't see him until he was released six months after just like everyone else .
ntabwo abantu bacu tu- ba- bona -aga ba- ra- vuga -aga ngo n- i- tuza -an -e ibintu ba- ba- shyira -e tu- ka- jya -yo kuwa kane wa nyuma w' ukwezi . ||| we were not allowed to see our loved ones ; they told us to just bring whatever we were bringing for them on the last thursday of the month , telling us that it would be delivered to them .
icyo tu- jyanye tukagihereza aba suruveya ariko baducunaguza ariko ba- tu- kubita nti- u- menya -aga niba bi- mu- geze -ho cyangwa bi- ta- mu- geze -ho . ||| so whatever we would take we would give it to the guards as they were threatening and beating us , there was no certainty that our loved ones would get it .
ya- funguwe ya- ri a- maze -mo amezi atandatu a- ra- za tu- ba murugo umuntu a- ki- baza ese bi- za- genda bite ariko tu- bona ha- baye a- ka- ha- enga -e umuntu a- subira mu- bu- zima bu- sanzwe . ||| he was released after six months and came back home , but from that point we were not sure what was going to happen next , but after a while it was peaceful and life seemed to return to normal .
bi- geze muri mirongo icyenda na kabiri nibwo tu- tangiye ka- umva ba- ishe za bu- gesa -ir bigogwe a- ka- vuga ati ubanza bi- ta- za- gera hano mbese tu- ka- umva ninko ku- toranya nk' abagabo . ||| in 1992 that 's when we started hearing about the killings in bugesera , bigogwe and he would say that may be it will n't reach our region , we thought they were just selecting and killing men .
u- ka- vuga uti noneho n- genda n- ta- garuka ariko tu- ka- umva bi- ta- za- fata i- n- tera ndende nkiyo bi- fashe muri mirongo icyenda na kane . ||| when he would walk out i would keep thinking that he will n't return but we never thought that it would be as bad as it was in 1994 .
ariko uko ya- giye i- tangira bi- tera -w -aga na ka- rera -e ese wowe iwanyu ahantu mwari mu- tuye ese mwabwiwe niki ko jenocide ya- tangiye ese mwaba mwaramenyeko iyo n- rega -e ya habyarimana ya- guye . ||| but i think the way it started depended on the region and the place where one stayed . how did you know that the genocide had started in the place where you stayed ? did you know that habyarimana 's plane was shot down ?
ese bi- ba- geze -ho bite twagirango u- tu- sobanura -ir -e ? ||| how did all the events unfold in your lives , i would like you to explain and tell us ?
twebwe aho tu- ri tu- tuye ha- ri ha- teganya -e na kanombe mubyukuri a- ri mu kabande ariko ibyaberga ikanombe u- shobora -aga ku- bi- bona . ||| the place where we stayed was just opposite kanombe , it was in the valley but you could see everything that happens in kanombe .
indege ya- ra- hanutse nti- tu- menya ibyo aribyo ariko tu- umva ikintu ki- ra- turitse ha- ri ni joro tu- i- ryama -iye nta mashanyarazi tu- ri tu- fite ngo turatarama cyane . ||| when the plane was shot down we did n't know what it was but heard a loud explosion , it was at night and we were sleeping , we did n't have electricity so that we can stay up late .
tu- ri tu- ryamye ariko kwa ku- n- ri abantu ba- ba ba- ki- ri maso abantu ba- ganira nti- tu- bi- ita -ho tu- ra- komeza tu- ri- ryama -ir . ||| we were in bed but not really asleep , in fact we were still talking but when heard the explosion we did n't give it much thought and we went on sleeping .

ba- ba ba- ca -ish -ije -ho itangazo niba ar' ingabo niba a- ri i- rya perezidanse ivugango indege ya- ri i- twaye umukuru w' igihugu ya- hanutse . ||| there was an announcement on the radio am not sure if it was from the president 's office or the military command but it said that the plane carrying the president had crashed .
ubwoba bu- ra- tu- ica tu- ra- byuka n- ra- mu- bwira nti tu- ra- shize a- ra- n- bwira ati reka reka ati uwaduhigaga a- ra- pfuye none ngo tu- ra- shize n- ra- mu- bwira nti oya nti ntabwo tu- kize ahubwo tu- ra- shize . ||| we were terrified and woke up , i said to him that its over for us but instead he said no the one who wanted us dead is gone and you are saying its over for us , i replied and said that we were not going to live instead it was over .
ngo ba- ra- jya kwa nde ba- ri- ca kwande ahubwo ba- bi- teguye kera indege iba imbarutso . ||| they knew where to find everybody and who to kill , it was planned long ago , the plain just marked the beginning .

ni nabwo jenocide ya- rangiye nubwo aribwo ya- tangiye ubwo abasirikari ba- ra- je ba- zana n' umwana w' iwacu a- je ku- ba- yobora . ||| that 's when the genocide was over even though that 's when it started , so the soldiers came with one of our children showing them the way .
ba- mu- fashe mu- n- zira ya- ri umwana w' abatutsi kuko ha- higa -w -aga abatutsi ariko niwe u- ba- zanye ba- ri ba- fite liste y' abantu benshi ariko a- ri twebwe tu- ri ku isonga . ||| they found him on the way , tutsi 's were being hunted and him being one they got him and he brought them . they had list with many names and ours were at the top of the list .
ba- ra- za n- kinguye nyine tu- ra- kubita -an barambwirango mwishimye se ngo abantu ba- hanuye indege y' umukuru w' igihugu ba- ri- ha -e hehe ? ||| when i opened i saw them and they said that i must be happy and they asked for the people who shot down the president 's plane .
n- ra- vuga nti se ba- ri hano ngo ariko mwishimye nti se tu- ishimye umuntu yi- shimira ko undi ya- pfuye . ||| i said there was nobody here and told them that we can not be happy because someone else died .
ngo nti mwamwangaga se nti se tumwanga tu- ra- mu- zi cyangwa we a- ra- tu- zi nti ntabwo tu- ishimye nti tu- bi- menye nkuko abandi bose ba- bi- menye . ||| did n't you hate him , they said ? can we hate someone we do n't even know or does he know us ? we heard it like everyone else .
ntabwo bi- tu- shima -ish -ije ntawishimirako undi ya- pfuye ngo kandi a- ra- ima -w -e mwamuhanuye ngo kandi inyenzi za- mu- hanuye a- ri zenewanyu . ||| nobody is happy that he died especially when you are the ones that shot down his plane and the cockroaches who did it are your relatives

ba- ra- mu- bwira bati umugore wawe a- shobora kuba a- bitse amafaranga menshi abagore nibo ba- bika amafaranga . ||| they said to him , your wife must be keeping a lot of money ; women are the ones that keep money .
ba- ra- za ba- ra- n- kingura -ir abana ba- ra- ongera barabakingirana n- ra- genda bati tu- ha -e amafranga umugabo wawe a- vuze -ko a- ri wowe u- ya- bitse . ||| they opened the door for me and kept the children locked up , and then they told me to give them the money that my husband had told them that i was the one keeping it .
nti nta mafaranga n- fite rwose bati tu- ha -e n- ra- ba- bwira nti se u- bu- n- ri -ko mwaje mu- fite ibyo mu- shaka mwakwihaye ibyo mu- shaka ariko mu- ka- tu- bisa . ||| i told them that i did n't have any money as they kept asking for it . so i said to them , why do n't you take whatever you want and leave us in peace , it is clear that you came for a purpose .
nuko ba- fata i- bi- ba- banguka -iye ba- ra- genda ba- rangije ba- ra- vuga ngo yemwe tu- ri tuje ku- i- shakira ibintu ngo a- ba- bi- ca ba- ri i- n- y- uma . a ||| so they took whatever they could manage as they were going away and said that they were only there looking for what to take but those who were going to kill us where on their way .
ba- hita ba- genda ba- maze ku- genda bi- maze kuba hafi saa tatu abantu bo kugasozi ka batutsi abagore babo bose tu- bona ba- ra- manutse baje iwacu . ||| they went away and then around 9h we saw the wives of all the tutsis on one of the hills coming towards our house .

n- itwa -e ba- ba- n- je bwa mbere bati oya wenda tu- pfa -an -e cyangwa bi- genda ukundi ariko tu- ra- guma hano . ||| we were the first ones to be arrested . no , may be we 'll die together or something like that but we are not living this place .

tu- geze hakurya abantu ba- tangira ku- tu- kumira ba- tu- buza ku- genda naho za- ri interahamwe zi- hunze inkotanyi i remera . ||| when we reached a bit farther some people started blocking our way stopping us from moving forward but we did n't know that they were interahamwe fleeing inkotanyi from remera .
kuko nti- tu- ri tu- zi ibyo aribyo tu- tangira ku- ta- tana bamwe ba- ka- ca murutoki abandi ba- ka- genda u- ra- umva tu- vuye murugo a- ri ku manywa ariko tu- geze ahantu tu- shaka -aga ku- jya i- n- rera ariko bi- ra- tu- nanira tu- hura n' umuntu a- ra- tu- bwira ati hariya ha- ri bariyeri . ||| but we did n't know what was happening and started separating some going through the banana plantations , others going on along the way . we left home during the day but almost reaching our destination , a place called ndera it was n't possible because we met someone who told us that there was a road block just ahead .
abandi ba- ra- komeza ba- jya ahantu hitwa ijurwe ngewe n' abana tu- jya ahantu ha- ri imyumbati tu- i- hisha -mo tu- bonye imodoka y' abapolisi tu- ba -mo tu- geze k' umugoroba ha- ta- ki- bona . ||| the others continued to a place called jurwe , me and my children we went and hid in a place where there was cassava when we saw a police car , we stayed there until it was dark in the evening .
tu- ra- genda noneho ya- n- zira y' i- n- rera tu- ra- yi- reka tu- fata inzira y' ahantu hitwa i musave u- ri ba -w -ije ha- tabona tu- sanga abantu bose ni -ho ba- hungiye ha- ri hara mashuri . ||| we went on but decided not to go to ndera but instead went to a place called musave , it was dark and we could n't see but reaching there found that that 's where everyone took refuge , there was a school .
n- bwira abantu tu- ri tu- ri kumwe nti n- n- jya -e nimunyicire ririya shuri n- anga -e niga -ir -e -mo n' abana n- ra- bona hariya ha- uzuye . ||| so i asked the people i was with to force the door open of one of the classrooms since all the other classrooms seemed full .
naho ubwo n- ra- bwira interahamwe n- zi -ko a- ri abantu b' iwacu tu- turanye ishuri ba- ra- ri- ishe tu- rara -mo n' abakozi ||| i did n't know that i was telling interahamwe , i thought i was telling my people . they forced the door open and we spent the night there with the workers .
n' abandi bana babaturanyi mu gitondo hafi saa mbiri n- bona abandi ba- ra- tetse nta kintu n- ri n- jyanye ki- kora n- ri n- twaye isukari yo n- ri n- y- ibutse jya ku- tira isafuriya . ||| with other children that were our neighbours , in the morning around 8 am i saw that the others were cooking but i had n't taken anything except for sugar that i had remembered , i went to borrow a saucepan .
ku- bera -ko n- ri- n- fite souvenir mbi cyane ngewe natakaye mu ishyamba iwacu ba- hunga muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu . ||| i had very bad memories because i got lost in the forest when my family was fleeing in 1963 .
n- toragura -w n' abantu noneho n- ka- hora n- umva umwana wange mu- rekuye nawe yatakara ubwo n- ra- ba- kuruye tu- geze i- n- bera -e gato tu- hura n' imodoka y' umuhungu w' iwacu ariko nawe ya- ri interahamwe . ||| i was found by some people , so i felt that if i let go of my child they would also get lost . so i pulled them and when we reached a little bit further we saw a car and inside was a guy form our region but he was an interahamwe .
ya- ri umushoferi w' imodoka ya komini ya- ri a- je ku- twara umuryango we u- ri uraho ngaho tu- ri tu- ha- rara -an -ye . ||| he was a driver of the commune and was coming to take his family which had also spent the night in the same place with us .
n- bona n- ra- mu- zi noneho n- ra- mu- bwira nti none se n- anga -e mwanshyizemo mu- ka- n- twara n' abana a- ra- n- cira mu maso a- ra- n- bwira ngo u- ra- jya hehe se ko akanyu ka- shobotse ubwo a- ra- ba- pakiye ba- ragiye . ||| i recognized him and i asked him if he could also take me with my children , he spit in my face and asked me where i was going since it was over for us . he packed his family in the car and left .
n- n- jya -e n- ta- komeje n- kurura -an n' abana tu- genda n' amaguru tu- gana i- n- rera tu- geze mu n- zira ahantu ba- ita imusave u- giye ku- gera i- n- rera . ||| so i kept pulling my children behind me as we walked towards ndera , when we were almost there at a place called musave .
tu- hura n' imodoka i- ri -mo burugumesitiri wa rubungo a- ri kumwe nundi mugabo wiwacu nawe u- ru- je ku- reba umuryango we u- ri uraho ngaho abana tu- ri tu- rara -an -ye . ||| we saw a car with the head of region of rubungo and another man that was also from our region who was also coming to see his family which had spent the night in the same place with us .
nti abana ba- giye nti ba- ba- bwiye ko maman wabo a- ri -ho nti abana ba- giye nuko a- tu- shyira mu modoka a- ra- tu- jyana a- tu- geza i- n- rera kuri paruwasi . ||| i told him that his children had left ; they were told that their mother was alive . so , he put us in the car and took us to ndera at the catholic parish .
a- ra- vuga ati umugabo wawe n- ba bahungu bawe ba- ri i- n- rera kuri paruwasi ngwino n- ba- ku- shyira -e tu- ra- genda tu- ta- ra- gera kuri paruwasi tu- gera ahantu hitwa -aga mugahoromani tu- ha- sanga bariyeri . ||| he said , your husband and sons are at the catholic parish let me take you there . we went but before reaching the parish we reached a place called mugahoromani and there was a roadblock .
y- itwa rugengamanzi niwe u- ri padiri mukuru a- ra- tu- akira a- zana ya- ri ya- ba- haye nibyo ba- teka ba- tetse ba- ra- tu- akiriye ba- ra- tu- gaburiye tu- bona -ko tu- bonye ubuhungiro . ||| he is called rugengamanzi , he was the head priest . he welcomed us ; he had even given them food to cook . so they welcomed us and gave us food and we were comforted that we had got refuge .
ariko ngewe kuri paruwasi n- ka- umva simpashaka kubera ha- ri umugabo tu- hora -aga tu- hanganye ku- va umugabo wanjye ya- fungwa mubyitso . ||| but personally i did n't want to stay at the parish because there was a man that we were not at good terms with since my husband was imprisoned among the spies .
umupadiri witwa ka- kuba ya- hora -aga ampiga a- n- bwira abantu ko ndi ikitso ko tu- ri inyenzi mbese a- ka- hora a- shakisha ikintu ki- tuma ha- ri n- cika no mu kiriziya ahari ki- ka- tuma n' abantu ba- angirira nabi . ||| a priest called gakuba always looked for me telling people that i was a spy , that we were cockroaches , always looking for a reason that i would stop me from coming to church or cause other people to harm me .
nuko noneho n- bwira umugabo nti ariko aha hantu ntabwo bahakorotiriye nti kandi dore abantu ba- ri -mo ba- ra- ha- gendagenda nti kandi na ka- kuba n- tu- bona a- ra- ha- tu- tsinda ||| so i told my husband that the place had no fence and people were walking in and out at ease and also told him that if gakuba sees us he will kill us .
nti tu- i- gira -e mu iseminari ubwo ha- ri ku itariki ya munani nuko ducunga abandi ku jisho tu- i- gira mu iseminari abandi t . ba- siga aho ngaho ariko bi- ri bi- egeranya -e . ||| so i told him that instead we go to the seminary , it was the 8th . so we made sure nobody saw us and then went to the seminary which was not very far away .
n' abana banjye bose na ba- saza ba- anga -e bose tu- ra- genda tu- jya mu iseminari tu- ra- ha- raye ha- ri ahantu ha- ri isale tu- icaye tu- raye tu- senga mbega tu- bona -aga ibintu bi- ta- meze neza . ||| with all my children and brothers we went to the seminary where we spent the night . there was a hall and we spent the night praying because things were not well .

rwose ha- ri -ho intambara ati reka ba- guma -e aha n- ka- ha ntacyo babaye nibirangira ba- za- taha ati mwanze mwanze ku- ba- rekura -e ati se mwabaretse ko ta- ubaha abasirikare bo ku- ba- rinda . ||| there is still a war going on out there , let them stay here they are ok when its all over they will go back home . so you do n't want to let them go ? let them go and we will give them soldiers to protect them , mbonapeka said .
ba- ra- vuga bati ariko abo bantu bo ku- ba- rinda ntabwo ba- jya ba- rinda bu- ri muntu ati nibabarindire ahangaha aho ba- ri . ||| those people who are going to protect them can not protect every single one of them , let them protect them from here .
mbonampeka a- ra- genda ha- shize akanya gato cyane tu- bona a- ra- garutse n' abasirikare ba- ba padiri ba- ba ba- ra- ba- rashe . ||| mbonampeka went away and after a short while he came back with soldiers and shot the priests .
ba- ri abapadiri babahutu umwe ya- ri na mwishya wa musenyeri nsengiyumva y- itwa -aga naniya ru- ka- sa -ir undi we ananiya ubwo ya- hise a- pfa ako kanya . ||| they were hutu priests ; one was bisop nsegiyumva 's nephew , he was called naniya rugasira and the other was ananiya , he died on the spot .

baradupopera ba- ra- tu- bwira ngo tu- za- hura -ir mu ijuru bo ba- koze icyo ku- simbuka igipangu ba- ri- ruka bagwa i- n- y- uma na mu- saza wange umwe . ||| they waved goodbye at us and said that we weill meet in heaven , they jumped the fence and ran away with one of my brothers .
nyinshi cyane ba- ra- za ba- ra- tu- baza bati amafaranga ya habyarimana mwayikwije muri inkotanyi muri inyenzi mu- tu- ha -e amafaranga y' umubyeyi wacu . ||| there were very many and said , you took all of habyarimana 's money when your inkotanyi and cockroaches , give us our father 's money .

noneho grenade haza umukobwa u- ri u- n- baye ibintu by' amashara nundi mugabo u- ri u- fite umuheto n' imyambi ha- ri amazina ba- ri ba- fite . ||| and then a lady who was wearing clothes with pearls came in with another man who had a bow with arrows , they had a list with some names .
ha- ri uwitwa pasteri na ru- ka- anika n' umugabo wange na nkundabarashe ariko we nti- ba- mu- hamagara -aga cyane ba- hamagara -aga pasteri na ru- ka- anika . ||| on the list was a man called pastor , rukanika , nkundabarashe and my husband , but they did n't call out my husband a lot , they called out for pastor and rukanika .
noneho ha- ka- ba ha- ri undi musore witwaga mutsinzi nawe ba- ra- mu- higa -aga noneho bamwambika kuvureri ba- ra- mu- twikira a- mera nk' umudamu . ||| there was also another young man called mutsinzi that they were looking for , they put a bead cover on him which made him look like a woman .
a- rangije we a- ba- sohoka -mo a- ri- ruka yi- rutse ba- ra- mu- rasa noneho ba- ba ba- bonye umugabo wanjye ngo dore nayanyenzi i- ruta izindi ngo haguruka ba- ra- mu- hagurutsa . ||| he tried to run away but they shot him , and then they saw my husband and said , here is the head of all the cockroaches , stand up , they said .

noneho uwo mu- kobwa a- bambura imyenda yabo a- hita a- y- ambara ba- ri ba- ambaye amapantalo a- rangije a- ra- ba- bwira ngo ni- mu- genda -e mu- ra- pfa -ir rimwe n' abandi n- tawe u- giye ku- pfusha umwanya ubusa ||| the woman removed their clothes and wore them , they were wearing trousers . she said to them , go back you will die at the same time with everyone else no one is going to waste anytime .
ba- ba- ka- rura munzu babagaruye munzu wa mu- kobwa aba a- ra- n- bonye ati tu- sohoye umwana tu- ibagirwa nyina ati kura -mo iyo myenda barampagarikiye imyenda n- yi- kura -mo nta muntu wayinkuragam . ||| they brought them back inside the house and then the lady saw me and said , we took the child and forgot the mother remove all your clothes . they watched as i removed all my clothes .
n- kura -mo imyenda yose n- sigara -an agakanzu n- ri n- ambaye ndayimuhereza ba- ra- genda nka nyuma y' iminota nk' icumi nibwo ba- garutse ba- rasa umugore witwa makurata ni n' umugore wuwo mugabo witwa pasteur . ||| i removed all my clothes and gave them to her as they walked away and only remained with a small dress i had on . after around 10 mins that 's when they came back and shot a woman called makurata , the wife of pastor .
ba- mu- rasa amaguru ba- ra- mu- bwira ngo n- haguruka -e kandi ba- mu- rashe amaguru ba- genda ba- mu- kurura n- ta -w -e ba- ra- tu- sohora . ||| they shot her legs and asked her to stand up when they had shot her legs ; they dragged her as they took us all out .
mubyukuri bu- ri muntu ngirango ubanza ya- ri a- fite abantu babiri bo kumwica ba- ri benshi cyane baradusora ba- tu- jyana mu kibuga ba- ra- tu- bwira ngo nituryame . ||| they were so many i think each one of us had two people to kill him , they took us in a field that was there and asked us to lie down .
u- n- za -e ku- ryama ba- ka- ku- tema u- ha- gaze byose bi- ri kimwe tu- ra- ryamye mperuka uko n- ryamye n- ramye n- fatanya -e mu- ki- ganza n' umwana wanjye w' umukobwa . ||| if you did n't lie down they would hack you with a machete , it was all the same whether you lied down or stood , we lied down . my last memory is that i lied down holding hands with my daughter .
abandi nabo n- ba- shyira iruhande rwange mbese n- umva -aga ba- ta- n- va iruhande nuko tu- ra- ryama tu- ubitse inda ba- tu- ereka -aga position tu- ri bu- ryama -e -mo ba- ri ba- fite ukuntu ba- ri bu- bi- genze . ||| and i put the others on my side , i did n't want to part with them , they told us to lie down with our stomachs on the ground , they knew how they wanted it done .
ikintu mperuka nuko ku- ryama n- ongeye ku- gira ubwenge n- bona barantemaguye ubwo ba- tu- temye a- ri nko ku itariki cumi n- ima -w -e bi- geze nko mu ma saa kumi nebyiri nibwo imvura ya- guye n- umva n- baye nk' umuntu u- kangutse ||| my last memory was lying on the ground i regained consciousness only to see that i was hacked , i think it was on the 11th , at around 6pm is when it started raining and i felt like i was waking up .
nuko ba- ra- genda bi- geze nijoro n- genda negura n- bona bi- anga ubwonko bu- ri bu- sohotse n- n- jya -e aho ba- temye bu- gomba -aga kuba bu- sohotse . ||| so they walked around and then at night i tried to lift myself up but it was very hard , i think my brain was out where they had hacked and cut me .
nuko a- ri ima -an ya- n- kijije kuko aho ba- n- temye ni nkaho ba- ri ba- temye abandi bose . ||| it 's just that god kept me otherwise they had hacked me just like everyone else .
nuko n- ra- vuga nti ubu nabo ba- ra- za guhembuka nti jyewe se ko nahembutse kandi ba- ri ba- n- temye . ||| so i thought to myself that the others will also wake up since i had also woken up after being hacked .
n- icara aho ngaho muri iyo mirambo n- giye ku- bona n- bona za nterahamwe zi- ra- garutse . ||| i sat there among all those corpses and then all of a sudden the interahamwe came back .
n- genda n- giye kumywa amazi i- giye ku- n- kubita umupanga indi i- ra- mu- bwira iti ariko se uyu mu- gora -e igihe u- ta- emeye nti- u- haze . ||| i went to drink water and then as one of the interahamwe was about the hack me with a machete another asked him , you have hacked this woman so many times are n't you satisfied ?
ngo ntago a- ri -ho ngo n- na- ba -ho ngo a- za- icwa -e n' agahinda ngo mu- reka -e . ||| she is n't really alive and even if she lives let her die of sorrow , leave her alone .
ba- ra- genda n- rangije n- bona umupadiri u- ri u- ha- gaze i- n- bera -e ya chapelle ubwo umurambo wuwo nguwo ananiya ni -ho ba- ri ba- wu- shyize a- ha- gaze k' umuryango . ||| they went away and then i saw a priest standing in front of a praying room that 's where they had put ananiya 's corpse .
n- genda mu- sanga tu- zira -an -ye ariko a- ra- n- yoberwa kubera ukuntu n- ri n- baye n- ra- mu- bwira nti se wampishe aho ngaho nti ko hano ba- ri kuza kandi ko ba- ri bu- n- yi- ca -e nabi . ||| i went towards him , i knew him but he did n't recognize me because of the way i had become , i asked him to hide me inside since the interahamwe were coming back and they were going to kill me badly .
n- injira -mo niba a- riwe u- n- twikira -iye uruyuzi ni a- ri ima -an icyo nzicyo nzicyo nuko ba- garutse ku- n- shaka ngo ba- n- rangiza -e ba- ka- ambura . ||| i went there , i do n't know if he is the one that covered me with those plants or god but all i know is that they came back looking for me to finish me off and they could n't find me .
ba- hita ba- genda ba- vuga ngo ariko se wa mu- gora -e u- ri u- ra- ha ngo a- giye he ngo a- ciye he se ko a- ta- kinguye ? ||| they walked away saying , where is the woman that was here , where did she go since the priest did n't let her in ?
ba- ra- n- shaka ngo yewe ngo niba a- ki- na- ri -ho ngo ntago ejo a- za- garuka n- rara muri urwo ruyuzi bi- gejeje mugitondo nko mu ma saa kumi n- ima -w -e . ||| they looked for me and then said , even if she is still alive she is not coming back tomorrow . i spent the night there and then in the morning around 5am .
n- subira muri ya mirambo n- ra- ongera n- reba abana banjye bose n- ka- sanga ubwonko bwabo bu- sohotse n- reba umugabo . ||| i went back and looked at the corpses , looking at my children and i could see their brains , i looked at my husband .
we n- ka- bura ahantu ba- mu- temye ariko ya- pfuye ya- ri a- fatanya -e nundi mugenzi we mu ntoki ba- pfuye ba- fatanya -e . ||| i could n't see where they had hacked him but he died holding another man 's hand , they died holding each others hands .
nuko n- ra- garuka n- icara -mo muri iyo mirambo n- ra- icara n- geze aho n- ra- vuga nti ariko se ubu n- ra- icara . ||| so i sat among the corpses and then after a while i asked myself what i was doing .
n- geze aho n- ra- vuga nti ariko se ubu n- ra- icara aha n- ta- ha- kora iki noneho nzenguruka ha- ha- n- ri hose n- geze aho n- ra- vuga ngo reka ba- si n- jya -e hariya muri toilette . ||| so i asked myself what i was doing among the corpses and then i walked around and then decided to go in the toilet .
mbe a- ri -ho n- jya noneho n- ra- vuga -aga nti noneho n- i- baza uretse no ku- n- yi- ca ba- ra- n- korera n' ibindi byose bi- renze no ku- ica n- ka- umva n- fite ubwoba bwa viol . ||| let me hide in the toilet , i was thinking to myself that if they return except killing me they were also going to do other bad things , i was really afraid they were going to rape me .
ba- ra- komeje ba- ka- jya baza aho ngaho ba- kaza ba- ki- tuma ariko ya- yi- n- ri nti- ba- y- ize -mo . ||| they kept coming to use the toilets but they did n't enter in the one i was in .
noneho ha- shize iminsi nk' itatu ba- genda -aga ba- subira muntumbi ariko ba- reba niba nta u- rokotse . ||| after around three days they were still going through the bodies checking if there were no survivors .
ha- shize nk' iminsi nk' itatu nibwo mbonampeka ya- zana -aga essence arabarundanya ba- ra- ba- twika n- ka- umva ba- ra- bi- vuga ndaho muri toilette . ||| after three days is when mbonampeka brought fuel , piled up all the corpses and then burnt them , i heard them saying it from the toilet .
bararundanya ba- ra- twika ba- cukura aho ngaho i- n- bera -e ya chapelle ba- ba- shyira -mo barenzaho i- taka ba- ra- genda . ||| they piled and burnt them and then dug a hole in front of the praying room and threw them in and then covered it and left .
ariko ubwo n- ka- jya n- vuga nti wenda ha- ri umwana wanjye u- ri -ho nkuko n- n- jya -e n- ri -ho kuko ukuntu ba- ri ba- n- gize ntago n- gomba -aga kuba n- ri -ho . ||| but i kept saying to myself that may be one my children was alive just like i was , because the way they had made me i was n't meant to be alive .
ubundi n- ka- vuga nti ba bana banjye buriya ba- irukanse bo ha- ri uwarokotse mbese n- i- hisha -aga n- vuga ngo ha- ri uwarokotse . ||| and then i would say that may be my boys who ran away at least there is one who survived , i hid myself because i thought there was a survivor .
nuko n- baye aho muri toillete iminsi ibiri itatu nta kintu nywa amaraso ya- n- vuye -mo ya- ra- vuye ya- ra- kamye . ||| so i stayed in that toilet two three days without drinking anything , i had lost so much blood till there was no more to bleed .
nuko k' umunsi wa gatanu nibwo ha- je umwana wi- gaga aho ngaho mu iseminari nawe ba- ri ba- ra- temye intumbi zi- ra- mu- gwira ariko nti- ba- mu- tema ariko ba- sa nabamukomeretsa akantu gatoya . ||| on the fifth day is when a student from that seminary came , they had hacked people and corpses fell on him but they did n't really hack him but he was wounded a little bit .
a- ra- runguruka a- rungurutse a- ra- n- bona niwe u- tangiye kumpa amazi yo kumywa a- ka- jya a- koza akantu ku rurimi agatonyanza . ||| he peeped through and saw me ; he is the one who gave me water to drink . he would give me tiny little droplets on my tongue .
a- ka- n- bwira ati numywa menshi a- ra- ku- ica tu- baye aho ngaho muri toilette haza kuza -mo n' abandi bana . ||| he would say to me that if i drink a lot , the water would kill me . we stayed in that toilet and were joined by other children .
mbega tu- ha- vuye tu- ri nk' abantu nka batanu ba- haza buhoro buhoro ubwo tu- baye -mo ku- geza ku itariki ya 01/05 nibwo ba- tu- rokoye ba- ra- genda umwana umwe u- je wi- gaga mu iseminari nawe u- ri u- turutse i- ru- hanga . ||| more people kept coming slowly ; by the time we left we were around five people . we stayed there until may 1st , that 's when they helped us from there ; we were also joined by another young boy @/ girl who also studied in the seminary .
nti- n- zi aho ya- kuye ikintu niba a- ri icyuma niba a- ri urwembe ru- shaje niwe u- n- y- ogoshe imisatsi ya- ra- fashe mu bisebe ariko imisatsi ku- yi- kura -mo bi- ra- mu- nanira . ||| i do n't know where he got a knife or a razor blade , he is the one that shaved me , my hair was stuck in my wounds and he could n't remove it .
abaganga b' inkotanyi nibo ba- n- vuye ba- tangiye ku- n- vura -ir i- n- rera ha- ra- boze n- anga -e ubwange nti- n- ri- n- zi -ko n- za- kira cyangwa ngo ni n- kira ngo mbe muzima . ||| the inkotanyi doctors are the ones that treated my wounds ; they started treating me from ndera . my wounds were rotten and i did n't think that they would heal or even if they healed that i would be normal again .
ariko rero ba- ra- n- vuye ba- geze aho ba- jyana n' ibyumba ni -ho n- vura -iye -w ubwo rero abana banjye bose uko a- ri batandatu n' umugabo wanjye na ba- saza banjye n' umugore wa mu- saza wange . ||| but they treated me and then they took me to byumba , that 's where i was treated from . so all my six children , my husband , my brothers and my sister @-@ in @-@ law .
bose ba- ra- pfuye ariko muri uko ku- pfa ntabwo n- ri- n- zi -ko bose ba- pfuye n- umva -aga abana babiri ba- shobora kuba ba- ri -ho n- ra- vuga -aga nti ntago ba- pfuye rwose ba- ri- rutse . ||| they are all dead , but i did n't know that they were all dead . i thought that my two sons were alive , i kept saying to myself that they ran away , they are not dead .
wenda buriya babaye -ho n- ka- jya mpora n- ra- umva ba- ri -ho ndetse umuntu a- za no ku- n- bwira ngo ha- ri umwana wange w' umukobwa u- ha- ri . ||| i kept thinking that maybe they are alive , there is even someone who told me that my daughter was alive .
noneho mu- saza wanjye wo kwa maman wacu ya- ri a- ri ibyumba a- kora kuri prefecture niwe u- je ku- ha- n- kura a- ra- n- jyana a- ra- n- fasha . ||| so one of my cousin @-@ brother from my mother 's side is the one that moved me from there and started helping me .
ariko ubwo ngubwo tu- va i- n- rera n- bonye ukuntu abana banjye ba- pfuye n- ra- vuga nti . ||| but when we were coming from ndera i saw they way my children had died and said .
kuko ha- ri n' abandi bana ba- rokotse n- ka- vuga nti ha- ri a- ba- rokotse wenda ba- ra- ba- twaye n- anga -e reka n- twara -e aba ba- ba- n- ri . ||| maybe someone took my children adopting and helping them , even me let me help some .
mbese n- ri n- ra- hahamutse n- umva abana nta mwana u- gomba ku- babara nuko ubwo n- geze ibyumba n- fite abana ba- gera kuri batanu ubwo mu- saza wange a- giye ku- n- twara . ||| i had been traumatized i did n't want any child to suffer so i reached byumba when i had around five children when my cousin @-@ brother was coming to take me .
bamwe n- ba- jyana muri orphelinat undi umwe mu- ha umuntu w' umusirikari a- ra- genda amwigirira kadogo . ||| i took some of them in an orphanage ; i gave the other one to a soldier who turned him into a kadogo @/ child soldier .
nuko intambara i- rangiye rero n- garuka mu matongo ariko n- sanga ba- ra- ha- shenye ba- ra- ha- maze hanyuma rero umwana n- bereye nyinawabo . ||| after the war i came back home but they were just ruins , they had destroyed everything , one of my nephews .
niwe watubohoreje inzu n- jya -mo n' abandi bana babavandimwe be jya -mo tu- ra- bana . ||| he is the one that got a a house for us , i went in with some of his siblings .
n- ba- bera nyina bamba -ir abana hanyuma baza ku- bona umuvandimwe wabo a- ba- twara hanze . ||| i became their mother but they got a relative who took them abroad .
u- fite ukwamera ni muri ubwo buryo rero n- giye n- shaka abana b' imfubyi tu- ka- bana u- bonye abe a- ka- ba- sanga u- ta- ba- fite a- ka- n- sanga . ||| that 's how i got orphans and took care of them and when they would find their family they would go and stay with them and if not they stay with me .
aha u- n- bwiye -ko igitero ki- je ku- bi- ca mwari muri i- n- rera ? ||| you told me that the people that came to kill you were in ndera ?
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu mu iseminari . ||| hummmm , at the seminary .
noneho n- reba noneho n- reba n' ahantu mwari mu- tuye bi- ra- garagara -ko ha- ri -mo akanya aho ba- bi- ciye izo nterahamwe nizari zi- vuye aho mwari mu- tuye cyangwa n- i- za ha- n- ri ? ||| looking at where you lived its evident that it 's a long distance from where they killed you from . were those interahamwe from the region where you lived or from somewhere else ?
yewe iby' interahamwe rero ba- ra- gurana -aga abi n- rera ba- ka- jya i kanombe ab' i kanombe ba- ka- jya i kanombe nkubwo ngubwo rwose interahamwe za- ishe aho ngaho mu iseminari u- rebye nizikanombe . ||| the interahamwe would take turns , those from ndera would go to kanombe , and those from kanombe would go to ndera . the interahamwe that killed form the seminary must have been from kanombe .
n- i- zi ikanombe za- ri kumwe n' abasirikari ariko rero nab' iwacu kuko abana banjye bakuru ba- ra- hunze ba- subira kumusozi w' iwacu . ||| even those from kanombe were with soldiers , also those from our region , because my eldest sons fled and went back on our hill where we lived .
na mu- saza wange umwe ni -ho ba- guye , ni -ho ba- guye ariko ntabwo n- ri n- ra- igeze n- bi- menya . ||| with my one brother that 's where they died from but i did n't know about it .
n- hora -aga n- shakisha muri mirongo icyenda na karindwi ni -ho tu- giye mu- ki- korwa cyo ku- shyingura amagufa ya- ri yandagaye k' umusozi . ||| i kept looking for them , in 1997 is when we went to bury the remains that had been scattered on our hill .
ba- n- bwira ngo ba- ri aha n- ha aho ba- n- y- eretse amagufa n- ka- genda ku- toragura nta bimenyetso n- shaka -aga n- hita -aga n- vuga nti ubu nibo rwose . ||| they would tell me that they are in this particular place , wherever they would show me bones i would not look for signs and i would think to myself finally i have got them .
ejo bu- n- ri mu bihumbi bibiri na gatanu ngirango nibwo tu- shyinguye ha- ri mukwezi kwa kane . ||| recently in april 2005 is when we buried .
umuntu aranyemeza ati nihariya noneho rwose ni n- anga -e u- na- bi- shyingura -iye ngwino n- jya -e ku- ba- ku- ha n- ra- genda ndataburura abantu makumyabiri na batatu n- ba- shyinguye ku gisozi . ||| someone convinced me that he knew where they were buried saying he was the one who had buried them , lets go i show them to you . i excavated twenty three people and buried them at gisozi .
nama sanduka manini cyane n' imisaraba y- anditse -ho ayo mazina yabo nuko ariko biza ku- garagara ko ya- n- beshya -aga nti- n- zi icyo ya- ra- gamije . ||| they are very big graves with crosses written on their names but i realized that he was lying to me .
niba ya- ri a- bi- zi cyangwa a- ta- ri a- bi- zi nti- n- zi ngewe nayobowe ibyo aribyo . ||| i do n't know if he knew what he was doing or not but i was really shocked .
mu makuru ya gacaca ni -ho ha- je umwana u- bana -aga n' abana banjye ba- ngana niwe u- vuze ibyo aribyo ni nawe u- vuze uko ba- ba- taye muri toilette . ||| n gacaca si where child who knew my children , he @/@ she was there age mate , he @/@ she is the one that clarified and said that they were thrown in a latrine .
nibwo babatabururaga mu kwezi kwa cumi tu- ba- shyingura mu kwa cumi na bi- ri noneho a- ri ariko n' ibimenyetso byabo n- ra- bi- bona n' amarangamuntu . ||| that 's when they were excavated in october and we buried them in december and i saw signs that it was really them , like identity cards .
amakarita y' ishuri imyenda yabo u- retse -ko ku- sa ba- ri ba- ra- baye utugufa barashengaguritse . ||| school cards and their clothes but they were just bones because they had decomposed .
twataburuye abantu magana abiri na mirongo itanu icyo ki- ha -e kandi abantu bahariya iwacu ba- ra- tu- beshya -aga tugataburura abataribo bu- ri ki- ha -e . ||| that day we excavated two hundred and fifty people , before that people kept lying to us and we would excavate the wrong people .
tu- shyinguye inshuro nyinshi tu- shyingura abntu ba- ta- ri abacu ariko n' abanyarwanda tu- shyingura -aga . ||| we buried a lot of times burying people who we were not related to but we were burying rwandans .
ntabwo tubyicuza u- retse -ko ba- tu- shinyagura -iye bi- hagije ku- hora u- shyinguye wataburuye u- shyinguye . ||| we do n't regret it but they toyed with us , always excavating and burying .
u- shyingura abataribo . ||| burying the wrong people .
noneho ikintu n- garutse kuri icyo kintu cyo ku- shyingura incuro nyinshi u- shyingura abantu bataribo abantu ba- ba- rangira abo bantu n' abantu mwari mu- turanye ? ||| let 's talk again about burying a lot of times burying the wrong people , the people who were directing you on where to excavate were they your neighbours ?
iyo mwitegereje mu- bona nti- n- zi ukuntu mwabisobanurira umuntu ngo ya- guye aha wenda a- na- ku- beshya . ||| looking closely , how would someone say that somebody died from a certain place even when they are lying to you ?
abantu ba- ba- rangira -aga n' abantu mwari mu- sanzwe mu- turanye ? ||| the people who were telling you where to excavate where your neighbours ?
n' abantu tu- bana -aga rwose tu- ri tu- turanye cyane uwo we wandangiiye a- ka- n- bwira ko ya- ba- shyinguye ni numucikacumu . ||| yes they were our neighbours ; the one who even told me that he had buried my children himself was even a genocide survivor .
nti izi ningaruka za jenocide zi- komeje kunkurikirana ariko noneho we u- ra- umva ko bu- ri incuro ya kabiri kandi n' ubwambere n- ra- mu- bwira -aga nti n- giye . ||| i said that these were the consequences of the genocide on me , it was the second time , before i use to tell him that
n- giye ku- ibuka nta kintu n- kora -aga nta mu- bwiye nk' umucikacumu mwenewacu n- ka- mu- bwira nti uyu munsi n- za- kora amasengesho yo ku- ibuka a- kaza . ||| i am going to remember , i did n't do anything without telling him as a fellow survivor , telling him that today i am going to pray and remember and he would come .
noneho n- ra- mu- baza nti ariko se kubera iki u- geze iki ki- ha -e cyo u- ta- ra- n- bwira ko aba bana ba- shyinguye aho hantu a- ka- bwira abantu ko ngo ya- n- gaga ko mpahamuka . ||| i even asked him why he had taken so long without telling me where my children were buried and he said that he did n't want me to get traumatized .
n- ka- mu- bwira nti se n- ri ku- hahamuka nti nubundi mu kwa kane bu- ri tariki cumi n' imwe n- kora amasengesho yo ku- ba- ibuka . ||| and i told thim that i could n't get traumatized it was all the same since every 11th of april i would have prayers to remember them .
kuki u- ta- retse ngo mpahamukire kimwe ariko n- ba- shyingura -e nuko muri gacaca rero uwo mwana a- bi- vuze byaho ba- ba- shyize noneho . ||| why did n't you let me get traumatized once and for all but atleast bury them , so in gacaca that child said where they were buried .
mu- hamagaye ngirango uwo mwana niwe u- n- beshya tu- ri tu- giye ku- tongana nukwitesha agaciro n- anga ku- tongana nawe no ku- hangana nawe . ||| i called him and even thought that the child is the one who was lying to me , we almost started arguing but i realized i would be disrespecting myself and did n't want any confrontation with him .
ndamwihorera n- ra- vuga nti ibi byose n' ingaruka zinga -ir -ho reka mpangane nabyo nkuko n- sanzwe ariko ikindi cyo nuko muri za mirongo cyenda na karindwi . ||| i ignored him and said that i was just feeling the consequences of the genocide so i decided to fight them they way i normally fight but the other thing is that in 1995 .
abadutaburuje iyo misozi yose tu- yi- ruka n' abaturanyi ni n- ba- bi- gize -mo uruhare mu ku- bi- ca a- ta- ri no ku- ica abanjye ku- sa no ku- ica abantu bo kuri ako gasozi bose . ||| those who misled us in excavating all those bodies on the different hills are the ones who participated in killing the not only my people but all the people on that hill .
ku- sa gacaca i- ri -mo i- ra- genda ibatahu a- ba- funzwe ba- ka- rega abatarafunzwe a- ba- funzwe ba- ka- shinja a- ba- funguwe . ||| but gacaca is exposing them all , they are turning on each other , those who are in jail denounce those who were not put in jail and those who are in jail also denounce those who are being released .
niko iwacu bi- meze . ||| that 's how things are in our region .
reka n- garuka -e kuri abo bana abandi bo tu- umvise ko ba- guye i- n- rera nyuma ba- kaza no ku- ba- twika ubwo bi- ra- umvikana ........ ||| lets talk again about the other children who were killed from ndera and were later burnt , we can tell that ...
aho ba- shyinguye rero ngewe niba a- ri uko n- ri n- ki- hahamutse cyane muri mirongo cyenda na karindwi nibwo tu- ba- koreye amasengesho ya- n- bera -e . ||| where they buried them , i do n't if it 's because i was still very traumatized in 1997 is when we first said prayers for them .
ariko ubwo ni n- anga -e werekanye aho ba- ba- shyize ha- ri ikigunda rwose n' amafoto yaho . ||| i am the one who showed where they were thrown there is a bush even pictures of the place .
y' ukuntu n- giye mpufira niki bi- ra- ha- ri ariko ba- vuze ngo mu- ta- bu- rura -e ngewe n- ra- vuga nti oya nti- n- shaka ko mudaburura u- rebye rero n- ta- ba- n- ri bantu benshi baharokokeye . ||| and the way i watered the place but when they said to excavate the bodies i said no , i do n't want you to excavate them ; they were n't many other people that survived from there .
ninge nuwo mwana umwe ubu a- ri mu busuwisi ubu a- ri no muri ibuka yahariya y- itwa sezari tu- ra- vuga tuti mwikwirirwa mubataburura rwose ba- ra- na- ba- twitse . ||| it was me and the one boy who is now in switzerland , he is a member of ibuka there , his name is cesar . we asked them not to excavate them since they had also burnt them .
nimuhakore neza hanyuma abapadiri ba- tu- emera -ir ku- ha- ubaka urwibutso rwiza rura -ho ru- ra- ha- ri iteka kuri cumi na rimwe z' u- kwa kane tu- jya ku- ba- ibuka . ||| we asked if they could make the place look good and the priests promised us they were going to build a beautiful memorial , its there and every 11th of april we go there to commemorate .
yewe ba- ri nka magana ni hafi magana ane u- rebye kuko amashuri yose ya- ri y- uzuye ha- ri n' a- ka- sara -e ka- ri ka- uzuye ku- sa abari abahutu baje ku- sohoka -mo ba- ra- genda ariko ntago aribo ba- ri benshi . ||| they were in hundreds around four hundred because all the classrooms were full , there was even a hall that was full , the hutus later went out but they were few .
abari benshi n' abatutsi ba- ri ba- ha- hungiye . ||| the majority were the tutsis seeking refuge .
nukuvuga ko mu bantu magana ane ba- ri ba- ha- ri a- ba- rokotse -mo ntabwo ba- renga icumi . ||| so you mean that in the four hundred seeking refuge the survivors are not more than ten ?
aho ngaho mu iseminari oya ntabo nuwo mwana sezari n- anga -e ha- ri nutundi twana tu- ba- n- je ku- genda tu- iruka ariko abo tu- zi tu- i- bara tu- ri babiri . ||| at the seminary it 's just me and cezar , they are some kids who also ran away , but the ones we are sure of and count are me and cezar .
muri izo ntumbi n- itwa -e tu- vuye muri izo ntumbi . ||| we are the only ones who came out of the corpses .
n- garutse kuri ba- bana bawe ba- guye hariya imasoro u- ba u- ra- igeze u- menya abantu ba- ba- ishe cyangwa se n' uburyo ba- ba- ishe -mo wenda uretse no ku- ba- ta muri toilette ? ||| if we talk about your children that died in masoro did you get to know who killed them or how they were killed except the fact that they were thrown in the pit latrine ?
muri gacaca rero ba- ra- bi- vuga ariko iyo ba- bi- vuga ba- vuga a- ba- pfuye mubyukuri n' a- ba- zima ba- ha- ri mubyukuri nabo ba- bi- gize -mo uruhare ki- kora i- ki- garagara nuko abo ba- sa -e a- basha -ije -w ubu ngubu ba- ra- fashwa -e na gacaca . ||| in gacaca they talk about the people who died but even the ones who are there played a major role in it but what is clear is that whoever is involved were arrested because of gacaca .
u- sibye ha- ri ikintu cyo ba- banza -aga ku- tema umuntu ba- ka- mu- ta mu mu- sara -an -e nti- n- zi niba u- ra- igeze u- menya niba ba- ra- ba- taye mu musarani a- ri bazima cyangwa niba ba- ra- ba- n- je bakabatemagura . ||| they normally first hacked people before throwing them in the pits , did you get to know if your children were thrown in the pit alive or after being hacked .
tu- ra- banye tu- ra- pfuye aho tu- giye nta nkweto ba- ambara ati akira izi nkweto u- jya -e uzinyibukiraho . ||| we 've been very good friends and we are going to die ; where we are going they do n't wear shoes , take my shoes and remember me whenever you look at them .
ati kandi u- za- jya -e u- bi- vuga . ||| and please tell the story .
ati hanyuma ngo noneho ba- n- bwira abari ba- giye ku- bi- ca bati ni- mu- ba -e mu- retse ku- tu- ica tu- banza -e tu- senga -e , abana ngo ba- ra- senga ngo ba- rangije ba- ba- ta mu musarani . ||| and then they told those who were about to kill them to wait so that they can first pray , and when they had finished praying they threw them in the pit .
niwe u- tu- haye -mo ayo makuru . ||| he is the one who told us all that .
ariko ngewe n- ra- umva nukuva ngo niba uwo mwana aba ya- ra- bashije kuba ya- ra- hawe inkweto n' umuhungu wawe nukuvaga ngo n- ba- ba- temye a- ra- ba- zi . ||| but personally i think that if that boy was given shoes by your son it means that he even saw the ones who killed them .
a- ra- ba- zi mubyukuri we a- ra- vuga ngo ya- hise yi- ruka ntabwo ba- emera ku- vuga ngo ba- bi- hagarara -e -ho neza . ||| he knows them but he says that he ran away , they do n't agree to say everything clearly .
ngo mbese bemeze i- ki- ri -ho kugirango n- ba- sigaye ba- ta- ba- gira -ir nabi a- ra- vuga ati ngewe n- hise n- iruka a- ka- vuga ngo nuwamwirukankanye ngo a- ka- mu- kubita inkoni mubitugu . ||| they do n't want to state facts i think of fear that the remaining ones will hurt them . he says that he ran away and says the one who chased him away and hit him with a stick on the shoulders .
ku- vuga ngo rero ngo ntago ya- bonye uwamutemye ariko noneho abandi ba- ka- vuga ko ngo ba- tema -w -e n' umuntu witwaga ha- ba- ri n' umuntu u- pfuye . ||| so he says that he does n't know who killed them but others say that he was killed by a man called habari , he is dead .
we nta nubwo a- ra- ongera kubura ngo kuko ya- na- funzwe a- ri umwana ariko wenda a- za- burana gacaca ni -yo izi uko i- za- bi- genza ntabwo nge n- bi- zi . ||| he has n't even come back to court because he was imprisoned when he was still young but may be he will . gacaca will deal with it , i personally do n't know .

ya- ri a- teye a- ta -e mu mibanire ye n' abandi bantu ikintu u- jya wu- n- va umwibukiraho u- ta- shobora ku- pfa ku- ibagirwa ? ||| how did he relate with other people and what is the one thing that you remember about him that you can not forget ?

ya- ri umuntu u- ca -ish make ariko u- bana n' abantu bose cyane cyane nawe ya- kunda -aga abana ngirango ni nayo mpamvu ya- jyana -e n' abana . ||| he was avery humble man who easily related with everyone but especially he loved children , i think that 's why he went with our children .
be simbizi ya- ri umuntu wumvikana kandi u- gira impuhwe cyane kuburyo ya- shobora -aga ku- i- ibagirwa cyangwa a- ka- ibagirwa abandi . ||| he was very easy to relate to and was very merciful ; he could easily ignore himselfo or others .
niko ya- ri a- teye uuuuuuuu ya- ri umuntu u- kunda umuryango we cyane ngirango iyo a- za kuba umugabo w' igisambo a- funguwe mubyitso ya- ri ku- hita y- igendera akanadusiga . ||| that was his nature , he was a man that really loved his family , i think if he had been greedy when he was released from jail he would have abandoned us .
ariko ntago ya- bi- gize ya- kunda -aga bose nta muntu ya- n- gaga ya- kunda -aga abantu ba- ciye bugufi abantu ba- ba- kena -e . ||| but he did n't , he loved everyone , he did n't hate anyone , he loved the poor and humble .

nti- n- zi ukuntu n- bi- vuga noneho ngewe n- ta- shaka ku- vuga aha n- ka- ha ba- ishe abantu ba- ku- mara -ho abantu ese ..... bi- rega ba- ka- emera n' icyaha baje ku- ku- i- rega ba- ka- emera -e n' icyaha abo bantu baje ku- ku- i- rega u- babarira ? ||| i do n't know how to say it , but here they killed all your family and finished it , if they came and confessed their fault , would you forgive them ?
ku- babarira ha- ri amagambo abantu ba- ihuta -ish ku- vuga u- ka- bona u- ta- zi nibyo aribyo a- ri wamuntu u- manuka a- ka- ku- sanga a- ri nawe u- vuga ngo u- ra- mu- babariye n' ibintu bi- komeye cyane . ||| to forgive , they are words that people are quick to use but it does n't even make sense . the person who asks it and you who says that you have forgiven him it 's not something easy .

noneho n- ka- vuga nti ngewe aho kugirango n- remera -ir -w -e n- sabye ima -an kumpa umutima wagutse u- ri -mo impuhwe n- ka zi- ki- i- rira uwo n- bona a- zi- keneye . ||| so instead of being burdened i asked god to give me a big heart so that i can offer mercy to everyone who needs it .

kuko ngewe ubwange n- tawe n- riwe nta nicyo n- ba ndicyo pe ariko kuba ima -an ya- ra- bonye -ko abana ba- n- shize -ho umubiri u- ka- n- shira -ho . ||| because on my own i am nothing and i would be nothing but the fact that god saw that my children and body were dead .

n- ka- gombye rero ku- emera uko n- jya n- kunda ku- bwira abantu nti josephine ya- ra- pfuye haba -ho ta- n- ta -e . ||| so i have to accept the way i always tell people that josephine died and aunty lived .

bi- turuka kuri jenocide ndetse u- bona bi- na- komeye cyane uyu munsi koko nkubungubu umuntu yi- koreye umutwaro w' indwara izamwica igihe iki niki . ||| as a result of the genocide , it is very difficult because you find that someone has a sickness that will kill her at some point .

ikintu u- n- bajije ki- ra- komeye ubundi ngewe n- ba no mu muryango w' abapfakazi ba jenocide avega agahozo . ||| you have just asked me a very difficult question , i am part of a widows ' association called avega agahozo .
ndi vice presidente wa kabiri ku rwego rw' igihugu ni umuryango tu- shinze kubera ibibazo abapfakazi ba- ri ba- fite abapfakazi ba- ri -mo ingeri nyinshi ha- ri -mo a- ba- fashwa -e ku ngufu koko ba- rwaye bandujwe sida . ||| i am the second vice @-@ president on the national level , it 's an association that we set up because among widows there are many categories . there are some who were raped and infected with hiv & aids .
ha- ri -mo abana ba- ba- kobwa ba- byaye abana ba- ta- shaka ha- ri -mo abatemaguwe ba- ta- fite i- bi- ca -e byo ku- mu- bi- ri umwe u- ka- sanga nta kaboko a- fite . ||| there are some girls who gave birth to children they did n't want , they are some who were hacked and do not have some limbs , some do n't have hands .
uwo ijisho ri- vuye -mo mbese ha- ri -mo ubumuga bu- tandukanye noneho rero reba aba bantu ba- fite ubu muga bwo mu mu- ta- ima . ||| some do n't have eyes , they are different handicaps and then they are those who are emotionally handicaped .
n' umubiri ba- ta- fite aho ba- taha ba- ta- fite inzu yo kuba -mo kenshi na kenshi ba- egamiye aba bahekuye . ||| and physically they do n't have a home , without a house to live in , many times they are next door to the ones who kileed their families and injured them .
u- ra- umva ko a- ri agahinda ka- geretse ku kandi ariko nka association yacu icyo tu- kora nukubatera ingabo mubitugu tu- ba- bwira tuti mu- humura -e . ||| you understand that its adding more sorrow to an already broken heart , so our associationts goal is to stand by them and confort them telling them not to loose heart .
kuba u- ki- ri -ho nejo u- za- ba -ho tu- gira amahirwe amahirwe tu- bonye umushinga u- ba- fasha ku- bona iriya miti i- gabanya ubukana bwa sida . ||| telling them that the fact that they are still alive that they will continue to live , we are lucky that we got a project that helps them with anti @-@ retro viral medication for hiv & aids .
abatarapfuye kuko ha- ri benshi ba- ra- pfuye kuko iriya miti ije vuba kuko ha- ri benshi ba- tu- citse . ||| there are many who died because the medication just started coming in recently , they are many who passed away .
nayo ikamuzonga ku- bonera ikintu umuntu a- rya bu- ri munsi n' ibintu bi- komeye kuko u- ra- bona tu- ri abapfakazi bagenzi babo . ||| and it can really affect her because the medication is strong , to get food everyday is not easy because you can see that we are widows like them .
nta kazi tu- fite bamwe na bamwe ba- ka- fite nabo ba- fite izindi charges mungo zabo ariko turafashanya turahumurizanya . ||| we do n't have work and those who do sometimes have other responsibilities in their home , but we try to help and confort each other .
icyo tu- kora nubuvugizi u- ra- umva mubyukuri benshi ba- ba -ho ba- ihebye ariko noneho avega ikintu i- kora nubujyanama guhumurizanya ku- egeranya . ||| what we mainly do is speak out because most people live in despair , so avega advises , conforts and brings us together .
ni nayo objectif y' umuryango wacu ku- egera -an , guhumurizanya , guhozanya umuntu ukamwumvishako niba a- babaye ejo a- shobora ku- humurizwa niba a- rwaye ejo a- shobora ka- oroherwa . ||| that is our main objective of our association , to bring us together , confort each other , convincing someone that if they are in pain tomorrow they might be conforted , if they are sick tomorrow they can get better .
sida yo nikimungu ki- ba mu mu- bi- ri ariko bi- maze ku- garagara -ko i- ta- ki- n- ica kuwabashije ku- bona iyo miti . ||| hiv & aids is bad disease in the body but its clear now that it does not even kill when one gets those medication .
icyo rero tu- kora ngewe ibyiringiro n- ba- ha nuko ku- babara a- ta- ri -ko ku- pfa ariko nbuvugizi na leta kandi ubwayo undi twebwe icyo tu- ba tu- ifuza nuko aba bantu ba- ta- rekura -w . ||| so what we do is tell them the fact that they are in pain does n't mean that they die , and we speak up for them to the government , our desire is that these people are not given up on or forgotten .
aba bantu ba- taha aba bantu ba- habwa imbabazi mbese u- sanga biduhungabanya kuko u- sanga ba- sa naho aribo bi- tawe -ho . ||| these people who are sent home and forgiven really traumatizes us because it seems as though they are the ones who are cared for .
twebwe u- ka- sanga ubuvugizi bu- tu- vuga -ir yego bu- ra- ha- ri ariko u- ka- sanga nta n- ba- raga u- bona bu- shyira -w -mo kugirango ibibazo bi- rangira -e yego n- tawe u- za- ka- rura abantu . ||| but with us it seems as though those who advocate for us do not have strength or there is no emphasis so that the problems are solved , of course nobody can bring back the people who died .
ngo tu- fashwa -e tu- fashwa -e i- ka- rangira . ||| if they help us it can be over .
ariko tu- maze imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide i- rangiye aha ntawavuga ko uko abantu ba- ri ba- meze jenocide i- ki- rangira ariko ba- ki- meze . ||| but it has been thirteen years after the genocide , can we say that people are still the same way they were when the genocide had just ended ?
nyuma y' imyaka cumi nitatu ese mwebwe iyo mu- rebye uko bi- ri bi- meze jenocide i- ki- rangira mu- ka- ongera mu- ka- reba uko bi- meze nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu . ||| thirteen years later , if you compare the way things are now and the way they were immediately after the genocide .
mu- bona n- i- bura ha- ri ikintu ki- baye -ho cyo kuba abantu ba- ragiye ba- va mu gihirahiro ku- geza ubu umuntu ya- vuga ngo ubuzima bu- ri -mo bu- ra- garuka . ||| do you think that atleast people are moving from the state of turmoil and life is being restored ?
nukuri wenda u- retse -ko ntawarangiriza ibibazo rimwe cyangwa wenda niba tu- bonye abantu ijana ngo tu- vuga -e ngo abantu ba- ra- shize ariko ibintu bi- ra- hindutse none se iyo u- bona abana b' imfubyi ba- rize ba- ka- ba ba- ra- rangije . ||| it 's just that no one can solve all the problems at once , or if we see a hundred people go on to say that everyone died but things have really changed a good example is the orphans that went to school and now have completed their studies it is evidence .
ba- ka- ba ba- ri muri universte abandi ba- ra- rangije ha- ri umwana u- vuye mu mwobo a- zi -ko a- za- iga . ||| and now they are in university and some have finished , is their a child who came out of a pit thinking that he was going to study .
abapfakazi bamwe niba ba- ra- bashije ku- bona aho ba- egeka u- mu- saya ubwo uwo muntu ya- vuga -ko ntacyakozwe . ||| the widows did n't have a place to stay , can that person say that nothing was done .
biba a- ri bikeya ariko wenda mu mikoro make ariko ntago n- rahira ngo nsembe ngo ntacyo tu- korewe . ||| it 's not enough may be because of limited means but i can n't say that they did n't help us .
n' abanyarwanda bose muri ru- sanga -e ntabwo ba- meze neza nkantswe nuwakuwe mu- ta -w -e burundu . ||| generally rwandans are not doing great now imagine those who were taken out of their own .
ariko buhoro buhoro ngewe n- bona ha- ri icyahindutse ku- sa ha- racya- ri -mo a- ba- meze nabi cyane bi- na- n- babaza iyo n- umvise ba- vuga ngo ba- tanga inkunga y' ingoboka ya farg . ||| but slowly i think something has changed but there 's still a long way to go . they problem is that there are some people who are doing very badly and it huts me when i hear that they support farg .
u- ka- sanga ba- ra- vuga ngo mu mezi atatu ibihumbi icumi ha- ri nutabirya mu mezi icumi icyo kintu rero ki- ra- n- babaza icyo ki- umvise ha- ri nubwo n- umva a- ri agashinyaguro . ||| they say that in three months there are people who do not even it ten thousands francs , i am hurt whenever i hear this , sometimes i think thats its mocking us .
ba- kwa -iye ku- iga uburyo ba- ka- reba ukuntu umuntu a- fashwa koko bi- hora -ho bi- ta- hora bi- irukanka ba- jya ku- saba . ||| they should look for a way that a person should be supported continually so that they do n't keep going to ask for help .
ha- ri ikintu n- enda -aga ku- babaza ki- jyanye n' ibintu byo ku- ibuka abantu bacu ba- giye bambura -w agaciro muri jenocide . ||| i wanted to ask you something in line with rememebering our loved ones that were degraded and humiliated in the genocide .
ba- ba- jugunya hirya no hino nyuma ya jenocide habayeho ku- genda umuntu a- shakisha ..... noneho ba- ka- shyingura -w noneho nagirango mu- tu- bwira -e mwumva abantu bacu ba- shyingura -w ku- ta -e ? ||| they were thrown in different places after the genocide , someone has to go searching ... and then they are buried , so i wanted to ask you how do you think our people should be buried ?
abantu bacu ba- giye ku- ba- ibuka kwiza icyambere nukumenya aho ba- jugunya -w -e tu- ka- ba- shyingura tu- ka- ba- vana mu myobo . ||| the first and best way to honor our people is to know where they were thrown and we bury them taking them out of the holes .
tu- ka- ba- vana mu misarane tu- ka- vuga tuti abantu bo muri aka ka- rera -e ba- shyinguye aha tu- ki- kora tu- ka- jya -yo tu- ka ha- ba- ibuka -ir ariko noneho ku- ibuka kwiza nukwibuka babantu basizwe na ba- ba- n- ri nti- ba- jya -e ku- ibuka umugabo w' umuntu . ||| to take them out of pit latrines , to be able to say that teh people in this district are going to be honored and buried and all of us get ready and go there remember and honor them . but rememeber well is to remember well is to remember the ones that remained behind . do n't go to remember a man
ngo tu- ba- kangura -ir -e ku- i- twara neza no ku- gira imico myiza nkiyo ababyeyi babo ba- ri kuba ba- ba- ha tu- jya -e ku ma sites memoriaux ariko tu- ibuka -e na babantu ba- size na ba- ba- n- ri . ||| we teach them good manners just like their parents would have done and then go the memorial sites and remember all the people who passed away .
ubundi ha- ri ukuntu n- jya -e n- umva -aga ibintu n- umva -aga tu- ka- baye tu- ibuka abantu bacu tu- ka- ba- shyingura neza tu- ka- hora tu- na- ba- ibuka . ||| personally there is a way i feel that we should remember our people and bury them in such a way that we would always remember them .
ariko ibyo bintu byombi bi- ka- jya bi- gerageza ku- jyana nkuko u- ri u- bi- vuze kuri abo bantu ba- sigaye nta kuntu umuntu ya- sigara muri ibyo bibazo byo kubura aho aba n' inzara . ||| but both things work together just like you have said , about the survivors . there is no way that someone can remain in that kind of trouble without knowing where to live and starving .
ngo bu- ri ki- ha -e tu- jya -e tu- ibuka kuko ikintu n- shaka ku- bi- vuga -ir aho kugirango n- za -e ku- ba- saba ko mwagira ikintu mu- bi- vuga -ho . ||| so that we may always rememebr them , i want that you will make your comment and say what you think .
ngirango nyuma y' imyaka cumi n' itatu jenocide i- rangiye ngirango ni mike cyane ariko iyo witegereje uburyo inzibutso zo mu rwanda zi- fashwa -e . ||| i think that after thirteen years that the genocide has ended its not a lot of years , but when you look at the way the memorial sites are maintained .
u- bona ko ha- tabaye ikintu cyo ku- hindura uburyo zi- fashwa -e -mo u- bona ko ha- tabaye ikintu cyo ku- hindura uburyo zi- fashwa -e -mo ubunako nka nyuma y' imyaka makumyabiri zi- shobora kuba zi- ra- angiritse muburyo bu- garagara . ||| it is evident that they are not well taken care of and nothing is done about it , clearly if nothing is changed about the way they are managed then after twenty years they will be in a visibly bad condition .
noneho ahangaha n- ka- ba n- shaka kugirango n- vuga -e ngo ku- ibuka nibyabande nibyabacitse ku icumu nibyabaturanyi bacu se bo mu- bi- n- ri bihugu ? ||| so here i want to ask , remembering is for who ? is it for the survivors , is for our neighbouring countries ?
kuko kenshi abantu ba- gira ikintu cyo ku- ibuka a- ri uko ukwezi kwa kane ku- geze ntabwo ha- ri -mo akantu ko ku- shishikara izo site memorial zi- ka- ba za- korerwa . ||| because many times people remember in april , there is no initiative so that memorial sites are always mintined and in good condition .
wagirango tu- ba tu- ra- ibagiwe aho ba- giye tu- ka- vuga tuti n- za- jya ku- sura abantu ba- anga -e mu kwezi kwa kane . ||| you would think that we forget where they went and say , i will go visit my people in april .
ariko uwawe u- mu- hoza -ho umutima u- ka- hora u- shaka ku- reba aho a- ri naho yi- riwe hariya hantu rero munzibutso arizo mubyaro a- ri n- i- zi zi- komeye . ||| but your loved one is always on your mind and heart and you always want to know where they spent the day and where they are but those memorials in the provinces and even the strong ones here .
ahubwo ngewe imyaka makumyabiri u- vuze n- ra- bona a- ri myinshi kuko ha- ri naho u- bona zi- ta- n- ta -iye no ka- ononekara . ||| you said twenty years but i think twenty is a lot of time because they are some that are already getting spoiled .
ha- ri a- ha- ridutse ha- ri ahari ibigunda u- sanga ba- ragira -mo amatungo ntago rero ku- ibuka ariby' a- ba- citse ku icumu nta nubwo a- ri ibya leta kuko leta ni abaturage . ||| some places are crumbling , in other places there are bushes where animals are taken to eat grass , remebering is not for the genocide survivors only , its not even just for the government , because the government is people .
niby' abanyarwanda bose ku- ibuka simbona rero impamvu umuntu a- turanye na site n- jya n- gira urugero rwa hariya ikanombe . ||| it 's for all rwandans to remember , i do n't see how some one who is neighbours with a memorial , i always take an example of kanombe .
kuri kaburimbo bi- geze ku- ha- shyira cloture y' ibyuma ariko ba- ra- y- ibye ba- yi- maze -ho umuntu u- jya ku- iba kuri site memorial a- ba- giye ku- koresha iki ibyo bintu ? ||| at the main road they had put there a metallic fence but they stole them and finished them off , i do n't understand how some one steals from a memorial site , what do you do with those thinks ?
u- ki- baza uti uru nurugo ru- ba bantu bantu ba- ta- ki- reba ku isi ariko n' urugo rwabo . ||| it is the home of those people , they may not be here on earth but it is there home .
ngewe rero n- ka- bona abantu ba- ka- gombye ku- bi- shyira mu nshingano zabo noneho tu- ka- gira n' amahirwe ha- je inzego zo hasi umudugudu . ||| i personally think that people should make it their purpose and we are also lucky that now we have lower levels of government the umudugudu @/@ village .
kugirango wenda tu- gana k' umusozo nubwo habayeho jenocide ariko ntabwo tu- za- y- ibagirwa . ||| as we are winding up , even though the genocide took place , we can n't forget about it .
kandi nta nubwo tu- umva tu- ku- ifuza -ko ya- ka- ongera kuba -ho hagati aha rero nagirango n- saba -e ese mwumva dukurikije ibihe tu- nyuze -mo nibyo tu- bonye tu- umva tu- ifuza -ko bi- ta- za- ongera . ||| and we do n't wish for it to happen again , so i would like to ask you , according to the hard times we went through and saw we do n't want it to happen again .
wu- n- va u- raga abana ba- za- vuka ejo ha- za- za uko b' u rwanda rwejo ba- ta- igeze ba- ba muri ibi bintu . ||| what heritage would you like to give to the rwandan children who did n't go throught these things ?
u- ba- raga ku- za- ba- raga mu rwanda ru- ba ru- meze ruta -e u- gereranije nuru tu- baye -mo ? ||| what kind of rwanda would you like to give to them as a heritage compared to the one you lived in ?
mubyukuri ahubwo n- bona umurage u- ra- tangiye ku- korwa nuko haba ha- ri -mo za kidobya iyo n- tekereje ko nta mwana u- ki- hagurutsa -w mu ijuri kubera ubwoko bwe . ||| i think that the new heritage has started already , there are still problems but i am really glad that no child is asked to stand up in class because of their ethnicity .
uko bi- ta- korwa mu ishuri bi- ka- gombye no ku- ta- korwa mu ngo z' abantu kuko burya imico mibi yigishirizwa munzu . ||| the way it 's not being done in schools it should also be the same in people 's homes because all the ad influence takes place at home behind closed dooors .
ku ishyiga niko ba- kunda ku- bi- vuga abaturage ababyeyi n- itwa -e tu- raga abana bacu i- bi- i- za cyangwa ibibi . ||| on the cooking stove that 's how they always say , we parents are the ones that offer as a heritage good or bad things to our children .
mwarimu a- habwa inshingano a- habwa ibyo y- igisha ariko n- tawe u- jya gu controrwa ariko n- tawe u- jya gukontrola urugo rw' umuntu . ||| the teacher is given responsibilities and a syllabus to follow but no one controls someone 's home .
ni -ho habi kandi n- tawe uzahacontrola ngo a- menye ngo ba- ra- igisha iki ariko buhoro buhoro u- ra- bona jenocide ba- y- igishije imyaka mirongo ine ubu tu- maze imyaka cumi n' itatu tu- igisha kuba -an mu mahoro . ||| are the ones with a problem and nobody will control and know what is being taught . the genocide was slowly taught for forty years but we have just spent thirteen years teaching to live at peace .
tu- gize amahoro bi- ka- komeza abana bacu ba- za- bana mu mahoro ba- ka- bana mu rwanda ru- ta- ri -mo umwiryane ru- ta- ri -mo nubwoko . ||| if we continue to live in peace , our children would live together in peaceful rwanda with no turmoil and ethnicity .

tu- bona inzu i- ra- ha- gaze ; ||| we finally completed the house .
ni cyo ki- ri ikibazo ki- komeye ku- bona aho u- taha ; kuko ubundi bi- ri bi- komeye ku- rara mu ngo ; ku- mara umwaka u- genda mu ngo z' abantu kandi nabo ba- ta- ri bafi ; ||| it was a big problem to have where to live ; it was hard for us to stay in several places , spending the whole year changing houses to live in when sometimes the people in there are financially unstable .
bi- fite ; u- ka- sanga ; ntabwo u- ri ku- jya mu bantu bi- fite kuko abari bi- fite bose a- ha- n- i- ni ba- ri abana b' a- ba- ki- zi ba nabi ; twebwe abacu ; ||| the ones who are financially stable are mostly bad people .

u- ka- sanga ni ibintu bi- komeye ; u- ka- sanga ku- jya ku- mu- tera ibibazo ; u- ka- emera u- ka- pfa -ir mu ; u- ka- pfa -ir i- n- bera -e . ||| so asking for help when they also have such problem , we preferred to let it go .
eeh ; twa ; tu- maze ku- sa -an inzu mushiki wanjye ya- je kwimaria we ; ubu n- jya -e ndi jyenyine n' umukozi bi- ra- umvikana ; ||| after completing the house , my sister got married and i stayed with the housekeeper .

ntabwo abacikacumu muri iki gihugu cyacu rwose umutekano wacu u- gera -w ku mashyi . ||| in this country the security of genocide survivors is insufficient .
kandi uretse ko wenda twebwe ubuzima tu- gomba kuba -ho kubera ko nyine a- ri nacyo tu- haranira ; tu- haranira kuba -ho ; ariko ibyo bano bagabo ba- tu- korera ntabwo ; ntabwo bi- tu- nanira . ||| we can not forget that we have to live and we are aimed at living but what these men did for us , it is not that hard for us to do it too but we were not created for that .

umuntu yidegembya ngo ; ngo y- ishe abantu ijana a- ka- ba- rondora a- ka- ba- vuga ; a- ka- vuga uko ya- ba- ishe urubozo ; ariko ngo ya- vuze ku- sa ngo ; ||| another thing that hurts me , you find a person really confessing proudly of the a hundred people he killed , the horrible way in which he killed those innocent people , and the next day he is realized because of that .

wenda twebwe tu- ri abasore ariko i- ka- banza i- ka- reba abantu ba- babaye ; a- ba- fite ibikomere ; aba ; a- ba- fashwa -e ku ngufu ; ||| okay for us we are still young men , they should care about weak people , wounded people , raped people and old women so they could die happily because the ones who betrayed us die happily .
abakecuru ; ba- ka- banza ba- ka- ba- humuriza nabo ba- ka- za- saza neza . kuko abandi bo ba- tu- hemuka -iye bo ba- saza neza . ba- ra- je ba- ba- subiza imitungo yabo ; ||| they came back and were given their properties .

ariko bi- ka- babaza ku- rusha -ho iyo umuntu yagusenyeye a- kaza u- ka- bona a- ri muri cadastre ya se ; ||| it is sad to see someone who destroyed your house living in a very nice house of his father .
n- ta -yo tu- keneye twebwe ariko leta nayo ; niyu ; n- iyubaka -ir -e wa ; ||| we do n't want those nice houses , the government should build for genocide survivors houses to live in .

n- umva icyo kintu nikidahinduka rwose ntacyo leta i- za- ba i- tu- mara -iye . ||| if this is not changed so the government will n't be helping us .
mu byifuzo byanjye rero eeeh ; nibahane abantu ba- tu- hemuka -iye ; kuko nibatadu ; ||| here is what i want ; all people who hurt us should be punished .

cyane cyane ko ha- ri n' imvugo mbi ba- vuga ngo nidusabane imbabazi . ||| there is this thing of asking forgiveness between each other and i find it bad .
mbese nk' ubu ngubu twebwe tu- za- ba- saba izihe n- ba- ba- zi ? tu- za- ba- saba imbabazi z' uko ba- tu- ishe ? ||| what are we going to ask forgiveness for ? it is because they killed us !

ni benshi n- ra- ba- zi . ||| they were very many and i knew them .
kuba u- ri umuntu u- citse ku icumu , kuri bwawe wu- n- va bi- vuze iki ? ||| freddy , what does it mean to ... be a survivor , what did you feel when you survived ?
ngewe kuba n- ra- citse ku icumu , u- sibye ko a- ri n' amahirwe ariko ubundi ni n' inshingano . ||| personally i believe having survived ... being a survivor is luck yes but it is also a big responsibility .
n- bi- bona mo inshingano kuko a- ba- citse ku icumu benshi , ba- ta- fite uko ba- meze . abakeya muri bo ba- ka- ba aribo bi- fite , ba- shoboye no ku- gira icyo bi- geza -ho ku bi- erekeye no ku- tunga ubuzima n- ra- vuga nk' ibyo ku- rya nibyo ... mbese n' ubuzima bw' ibanze a- ba- bu- fite ni bakeya . ||| i look at it as responsibility because many of the survivors are very poor and do not even have the least necessary for life [ food and a shelter ] .
ni inshingano rero cyane , z' a- ba- bu- fite , ubwo ubuzima bw' ibanze ku- bu- sangira n' abatabufite . ||| that 's why those who have something to share need to feel responsible for the ones who do not have anything .
n- vuga ko arero amahirwe ... kuko iyo u- rebye ibyabaye mu rwanda , u- ka- reba n' ingufu bi- ri bi- fite n' abari ba- bi- ri -mo ; a- ri leta y' u rwanda ; ||| and i call it a privilege because when i consider what took place in rwanda , with all the determination that was put in and when you consider all those who were fully motivated such as the government of rwanda or other governments of powerful countries , like the french government .
a- ri leta z' ahandi , ||| we can easily say that it is a miracle that some people survived .
kandi z' ibihugu by' ibihangange nk' ubufaransa . u- bona -aga yuko kugirango umuntu a- saguka -e bi- ri bi- goye cyane . n- umva -aga rero kuba uwacitse ku icumu n' amahirwe kandi ni n' inshingano zi- komeye . ||| therefore , i believe that it is a privilege to be a survivor and i believe it is a big responsibility .
ese wiyumvaga ku- ta -e muri1994 ? ha- rya u- ri u- fite imyaka ingahe cumin' itandatu ... ok , ||| what did you feel in 1994 ... ? how old were you ... 15 , 16 .. ?
cumi n' icyenda . none se wiyumvaga ku- ta -e ? ||| oh 19 .
wu- n- va -aga u- fite umujinya , wu- n- va -aga se u- meze nk' igishushungwe ... wiyumvaga u- ta -e mu mu- ta- ima , u- tekereza -aga iki ? ||| what did you feel ? did you feel angry , did you feel empty ? did you feel ... what was in your mind and in your heart ?
njyewe icyo ... uko n- umva -aga meze muri icyo ki- ha -e , ha- ri igihe ubungubu n- ta- shobora ku- bi- subira -mo , ||| how i felt during that time ... maybe i can not say exacty how i felt .
ariko ubundi bwa mbere n- gira -aga ubwoba bwinshi . ||| but i was so afraid .
n- ka- hora n- tekereza ukuntu umuhoro u- giye ku- za- kubita igikanu ki- ka- gwa , ||| i used to imagine a machete cutting my neck all the time . and i would imagine my neck on the floor .
n- ka- hora n- ki- bona hasi ki- guye , ||| i would always imagine seeing my mum being killed [ i mean the period from the 8th to the 14th of april .
n- ka- hora n- bona ukuntu ba- giye ku- ica mama [ n- ra- vuga nka periode yo ku- va ku itariki umunani ku- geza kuri cumi n' enye mu kwezi kwa kane ] n- ra- anzwe n' ubwoba ahantu n- baga ndi muri plafond z' abandi bantu . ||| ] my heart was full of fear while in the cieling where i was hiding in someone 's house .
n- ka- konja ba- ka- n- jyana ku zi -ko ba- ka- n- shyira i- n- y- uma y' urutaro , ||| they used to allow me to sit near the fire as i would be freezing in the cold .
kugirango umuntu u- canye a- ta- za ku- n- bona . n- baga -ho ku buryo n- umva -aga n- ranga -w n' ubwoba , ||| i was hiding behind a big sieve [ used for sorghum ] so that whoever was making the fire , would n't be able to see me .
nta ka- izera -e cyinshi cyo kuba -ho n- fite . ||| i was so afraid and i lost hope of survival .
ariko nyuma y' aho n- geze aho ubwoba bu- ra- n- shira -an neza neza ku buryo n- umva -aga n- pfa , n- ta- pfa , n- umva -aga ntacyo bi- n- twaye . ||| i reached a point where i was no longer scared . i was no longer afraid of death ; death or life meant nothing to me anymore .
ku buryo ha- ri igihe njyewe na mushiki wanjye tu- genda -aga mu n- zira kuko tu- koze urugendo rurerure , ||| sometimes my sister and i would walk on the road ... we walked a lot but we were not afraid of passing where there were roadblocks .
nti- tu- tinya -aga ku- nyura ahantu ngo ba- ri bariyeri , ngirango tu- bi- tinye rimwe kandi tu- bonye ko a- ta- ri na byiza , kuko ha- ri ahantu n- geze ... ||| we only feared to pass a roadblock once but we realised that it was n't good , because there is a certain place where i reached ...
... ubwo n- geze a- honga -ho kuri iyo bariyeri , tu- shatse ku- yi- nyura munsi , ||| when we reached that roadblock we tried to hide and used a way down that road but we were found out .
ni ahantu ba- ita muri mwendo ku kibuye . ||| that was in a place called mwendo in kibuye .
tu- shaka ku- nyura hepfo gatoya , kugirango wenda abantu bo kuri bariyeri ba- ta- za ku- tu- bona ba- ra- tu- zamura ba- tu- zana kuri bariyeri , ba- tu- baza niba tu- ri abatutsi tu- ra- bwira tuti @: ntabwo tu- ri abatutsi . ||| they took us up to the roadblock and asked us if we were tutsis and we said we were not but they looked at us and told us we must be tutsis because of our soft hair and all .
ba- tu- bwira byinshi ... bi- geze aho bati @: "@ u- rebye iyo misatsi yanyu , u- rebye iki ... bati @: nti- mu- za -e ku- tu- beshya . @" ||| they said many things and told us to stop lying to them .
ba- ra- n- bwira ngo @: "@ wowe u- gomba ku- i- cukura -ir , " ariko n- ra- bi- anga . bi- garagaza ko icyo ki- ha -e ntabwo n- tinya -aga , ||| they asked me to dig up my own grave and i refused which shows that i had reached a point where i was no longer afraid .
tu- ri tu- geze aho tu- ta- tinya urupfu . nyuma baza ku- tu- kura aho ngaho ba- ra- vuga bati @: "@ bourgmestre wa mwendo niwe u- za ku- ca urubanza , " ba- tu- shyira kuri commune ba- ra- tu- funga . ||| we were taken to the commune . they said the borgamster would be the one to judge our case .
ba- tu- funze ariko kuko bourgmestre tu- sanze ya- sinze , a- ra- vuga ati @: "@ ba- ba -e ba- tu- funze . @" ||| we ended up spending one night in a cell as we found when the borgmaster was drunk .
ariko muri icyo ki- ha -e n- umva -aga nta bwoba , ||| but i was n't afraid anymore at that time .
n' ubwo n- ri n- fite n- ri n- bu- fite ababyeyi ba- ta- ra- pfa . kandi tu- ri tu- maze ku- genda mu n- zira tu- simbuka intumbi nyinshi , ku buryo tu- umva -aga twebwe nta bwoba bi- tu- teye kuba tu- pfa ku- geza ubwo . ||| all my fears died up after my parents were murdered and after seeing so many dead bodies on the way .
wi- baza ko abantu ba- umva cyangwa ba- sobanukirwa ibyo mwanyuzemo . ||| do you think that people understand your experience ? .
bake ba- ra- bi- umva . ||| a few people understand .
ibyo n- baye -mo ntabwo ba- bi- umva bose biramvikana , ||| obviously not everyone can understand what i went through .
ha- ri -mo n' abatifuza y' uko n- ba -ho , kandi na n' ubu ba- ta- bi- ifuza babaza -w n' ukuntu ba- bona umuntu a- genda a- tera i- n- bera -e . ||| some people did not even want me to live and they still do n't want me to be alive today and they 're not happy when they see me prospering .
ariko abandi tu- ri kumwe ba- ra- bi- umva , cyane cyane abo tu- sangiye ubuzima bwa bu- ri munsi . ||| those who are with us do understand , those who went through similar things , especially those who share our lives daily .
wu- n- va u- ra- babariye a- ba- ku- koreye ibyo u- tu- bwiye ? ||| can you forgive people that carried out these problems ?
ku- ba- rira bi- ra- goye . ||| it is difficult to forgive .
ku- ba- rira bi- ra- goye kuko n' iyo n- zira n- umva n- ta- ra- yi- tangira , kuko n- jya -e n- umva n- ta- zi aho n- yi- hera . ||| it is difficult to forgive and i have n't gone down that road yet because i do n't even know where to start .
ese n- tangira -e n- babarira -e leta kuko nayo ya- ri i- bi- fite -mo uruhare ? ||| who should i forgive anyway ? the former government as it contributed to it very strongly ?
n- tangira -e se n- babarira -e umuntu ku giti cye ? ||| do i forgive people individually ?
n- tangira -e se n- babarira -e ... n- reba a- ba- bi- gize -mo uruhare bose n- ka- bura uwo nti- angirira -ho . ||| do i start from forgiving ... ? i look around and i do n't know where to start from , as so many people were involved in it .
ibyo aribyo byose , bi- ra- komeye ariko bi- ra- shoboka . ||| it is certainly hard but it is possible .
impamvu n- vuga ko bi- shoboka ni uko umuntu u- kunda igihugu ... ... a- ba- citse ku icumu ba- ki- sigaye -mo ni bakeya , amaboko yabo ni ma ... ntabwo bonyine ba- shobora ku- za- zamura i gihugu bonyine . ||| the reason i say it is possible is because patriots ... the survivors in this country are very few . and their strength is ... they can not develop the country on their own .
ni n- gomba -w ko abari mu gihugu bose ba- fatanya ingufu zabo kugirango igihugu ki- zamuka -e . ||| therefore , all people in the country should put their energy together and develop the country .
ariko ku bwanjye ntabwo iyo n- zira n- teganya ku- yi- tangira vuba , mu ki- ha -e n- ta- ra- menya uwo n- hera ho n- babarira . ||| personally , i am not ready to begin that journey [ of forgiving ] soon .
bi- ri bi- kwa -iye ko uwabikoze uwo a- riwe wese ya- tangira ku- saba imbabazi , ||| first i do not know who i should forgive . it is better those who committed the crimes start asking for forgiveness .
tu- ka- n- egera -an a- kaza tukanabiganiraho wenda . ||| they should come to us and we talk about it .
a- ri umuhutu wishe a- kaza a- ka- vuga ati @: n- jya -e n- ra- ishe , ariko mu- n- babarira -e . ||| let 's say if it is a hutu who killed , he should come and say , "@ i killed people and i am really sorry . @"
bi- kaza a- ri ibintu u- bona ko bi- fite umutima wihariye wo ku- saba imbabazi . ||| they should do it in way one would really see that somebody is truly sorry .
bi- ka- genda bi- genda , bi- ka- gera no mubihugu bi- bi- gize -mo uruhare . ||| then things would proceed and finally reach the countries that participated .
ndetse no muri ibyo bihugu bi- bi- gize -mo uruhare ukurikije ubuhangange bwabyo , bi- ka- n- itaba -ir ku- fasha i- n- babara -e z' a- ba- sigaye . ||| and they [ those countries ] should use their power to help the survivors who are needy .
njyewe nti- n- ri mo kuko n- jya -e nti- n- ri ikimuga , ||| i am not among them because i am not handicapped , i am able to work for myself .
njyewe n- shobora ku- ikorera . n- shobora no ku- hangana n' abandi , n- ka- jya muri competition [ i- rusha -an -w ] y' ubuzima njyewe n- umva ndi ta- ya- ri [ n- iteguye ] . ||| in fact i could compete in healthy competions ... i am very ready .
ariko se izo mfubyi , abo bana bi- bana ba- ta- ra- geza imyaka , ba- fite inshingano nyinshi ba- ba -ho ba- ta -e ? ||| but what about those orphans , those other kids who look after themselves with several other responsibilities , how do they survive ?
aho ibyo bihugu bi- bi- gize -mo uruhare bi- ra- bi- zi ? ||| the countries who participated in the genocide know about that .
kugirango wenda nabo ba- tangira -e ka- umva ko ... wenda nubwo ... ba- citswe ba- ka- bi- kora , ba- ki- fite umutima wo ku- ba- kunda . ||| they should do something to show that although they participated , it was involuntarily ! they need to do something to show that they care about them [ the orphans ] despite everything that happened .
n- jya -e n- umva gahunda yo ku- babarira i- ra- komeye ariko i- ra- shoboka . ||| i believe the process of forgiving is hard but possible .
tu- zi ko u- baye mu muryango a.e.r.g , ni iki uwo muryango u- wu- vuga -ho ... u- bona ko a- ri iki ki- tumye u- shinga -w ? ||| why did you start to be involved in a.e.r.g , why did you do that ? why did you think it important to try that ?
a.e.r.g. ni umuryango njyewe kubwanjye n- umva ... a- ba- wu- tekereje n- gomba ku- ba- shimira . ukurikije intego zawo , ibikorwa byawo , n- sanga a- ri umuryango n- gomba ku- shimira , ||| i personally would like to thank those who founded a.e.r.g. when you look at its objectives , its deeds , you ought to thank a.e.r.g. it is the only association with so many people willing to help the genocide survivors , starting with young kids and themselves .
kuko niwo wonyine n- ibonye y' uko ... ha- ri -mo n' abantu benshi ba- ri -mo u- bona ba- fite ubushake bwo ku- fasha a- ba- citse ku icumu . ba- hereye ku bana bato kandi nabo bi- hereye -ho . n- jya -e n- bona a- ri umuryango ... kubera ko n- ra- wu- koreye , n- wu- baye -mo igihe kirekire , ||| i think it is an association worth ... i even worked with them and lived with them for a long time .
u- bona a- ri umuryango u- shobora ku ... ku- tuma umuntu y- i- umva -mo yuko kuba ya- ra- buze ababyeyi ... ariko inshuti cyangwa umunyeshuri bi- gana a- shobora ku- rangiza inshingano umubyeyi we ya- gomba -aga ku- kora . ||| it was an organization that helps people believe that , although they lost their parents , some friends or a fellow students can try and do as much as a parent as much as possible .
i- ka- izera -e nywufitemo rero n' uko igihe cyose u- za- ba u- ki- ri -ho , abana ba- za- gabanya ka- umva ko ba- ri imfubyi . ||| and my hope is that as long as that association is still operating , orphans will stop looking at themselves as orphans .
abana ba- za- umva yuko umuryango witwa a.e.r.g u- ba- bereye aho ababyeyi n' inshuti za- ba- kunda -aga ba- ta- ri . ||| that they will find that , in the absence of their parents and friends , a.e.r.g. is there for them .
kuko ba- wu- bonera -mo amahoro , ||| that they 'll find peace in it .
n- jya -e n- ra- bi- zi kuko n- wu- baye -mo n- n- jya -e n- wu- boneye -mo amahoro . ||| i know this from experience ; i once lived there and found peace in it .
ha- ri ikintu u- bona jenoside i- tu- igisha ... ha- ri isomo u- bona tu- yi- kura -mo ? ||| do we learn anything from the genocide ? do we learn anything from the genocide ... ? does genocide ... does it teach us anything ?
ubundi kuba jenoside ya- ra- baye , y- igisha byinshi . ||| the occurency of the genocide teaches a lot .
ya- tu- igishije byinshi , ||| there is much we learn from it .
nti- tu- ishima kuba ya- ra- baye , ariko nyuma abantu ba- kuze ba- ta- ra- kura . abantu ba- fashe responsabilites [ inshingano ] a- ri abana kandi ba- bi- i- kura -mo neza , bikurikije na experience ba- gize . ||| we are not happy that it occured but it has helped people grow before time . people became responsible while they were still young and they forgot they were young due to the experience they went through in life .
nti- n- vuga ngo ni nziza , ahubwo ha- ri icyo ya- tu- igishije ki- komeye , cyo ku- menya yuko u- gomba ku- imenya . ||| well it was n't a good experience but it taught us great lessons .
cyo ku- menya yuko ... ku- menya aho u- geze , ukanamenya n' icyo u- korera undi , ||| a lesson on knowing who you are , how far you can go , how to behave with others and where you belong in this world .
no ku- menya uruhare rwawe muri iyi si . ibyo a- ri byo byose n- umva jenoside ya- baye ya- tu- igishije byinshi ku bi- erekeye na responsabilites [ inshingano ] umuntu a- gomba ku- fata . ||| generally genocide taught us a lot of things as far as being responsible is concerned .
u- gira icyo u- tu- bwira ku muryango mpuzamahanga ? ni i- ri- ha -e somo umuryango mpuzamahanga u- kwa -iye ku- i- gira ku bi- baye ? ||| what do you think the international comunity should learn ?
ibihugu by' amahanga cyangwa se abanyamahanga , ba- kwa -iye ku- menya yuko icyo ba- vuze ba- ta- gomba ku- i- subira -ho . ||| the international community needs to know that it is very important to keep one 's word and that they can not take it back .
ba- gomba ku- menya kandi ko ba- gize intege nkeya zo ku- tabara , a- ba- pfa -aga mu gihugu cyacu . ||| they also need to know that they did very little to save the people who were dying in our country .
ba- gomba ku- menya kandi ko ha- ri a- ba- sigaye , kandi abo ba- sigaye ba- keneye ubuzima nk' ubwabo . ||| they also need to know that survivors are there and that these survivors need to live a good life .
ba- gomba ku- ibuka y' uko jenoside ya- baye -ho , kandi ba- ka- ha icyubahiro a- ba- yi- zize kuko ba- ta- giye a- ri imbwa . kandi ba- ka- menya yuko ba- zize ubusa . ||| they need to know that the genocide actually happened and they need to show respect to its victims and to acknowledge that these victims were actually innocent .
wu- n- va wifuza ku- za- gira umuryango umunsi umwe ? ||| can i ask you the same question again .... would you like to have a family one day ?
n- umva mu ntego zanjye nazo n- fite mu munsi iri i- n- bera -e , no ku- gira umuryango nabyo bi- ri -mo . ||| in my future plans , i plan to have a family .

ikintu cya mbere , ni u- ku- menya y' uko ijambo ry' umubyeyi ri- ba ri- fite agaciro ka- komeye . icyo ba- gomba ku- ki- fata , ||| what they first need to know is that the word of a parent is of great value .

hanyuma nyuma ya jenoside ... u- pfushije abantu bangahe mu muryango wawe muri jenoside ? ||| and after the genocide ehh ... how many of your family were killed in the genocide ?
mu ki- ha -e cya jenoside ha- pfuye ababyeyi banjye ha- pfa n' abavandimwe banjye bane ... ubwo bose hamwe ni batandatu . ||| during genocide , i lost my parents and my four sisters . in total , i lost six people in my family .
u- n- bwira kuri mama wawe ? sa n' umunshushanyiriza mu magambo , n- bwira mama wawe . ||| can you describe for me ... eh , describe for me your mother ?
maman wanjye ya- ri ... n- vuga ngo ya- ri umubyeyi u- tangaje cyane , kuko n- mu- bonye -ho urugero ru- komeye . ||| my mother was a wonderful parent . because i learnt strong lesson from her .

ariko ya- ri umubyeyi u- zi ku- tu- rera neza , ||| but she was a parent who knew how to look after her children .
a- ka- menya kuba -an neza n' abantu , cyane abantu bose n' ubu tu- umva ba- bi- vuga , n' ubu a- ta- ki- ri -ho . ||| she was very sociable and people still say so today .

icyo n- vuga kuri papa ni uko nawe ya- ri umubyeyi u- tangaje . ||| all i can say about my father ... he was also a wonderful parent .
tu- bi- bonye wenda akenshi nyuma ya jenoside , aho tu- umva bose ba- ba- vuga neza , ||| we realized it after the genocide as people say a lot of good about them .

ubwo abana .. abato ... ba- ri bato kuri twebwe . ikintu ... icyo ... tu- ri tu- meze ba- ri abana ba- ri ba- zi ka- ubaha cyane , ||| therefore , the young ones were much younger than us . they were very obedient kids .
ba- n- fata nka tantine wabo . nk' umuntu mukuru u- ba- kura -iye , ||| they considered me as their aunt . they considered me as someone more mature than them .
tu- ka- ba- ha discipline [ tu- ka- ba- shira ku murongo ] kuko ariko mama ya- jya -aga a- tu- bwira . ||| we used to discipline them because that is what mum used to tell us .
ikindi n- vuga cy' icyenzi n- vuga , ni uko mama ya- ri ya- ra- tu- bujije ku- tuka -an . abana bacu tu- ba- haga ubura -ir -e , ||| another thing i can say , our mother had forbidden us to fight . we used to teach them good manners ; we would tell them that none of them should abuse the other .

"@ nti- mu- za- ongera -e , nti- n- za- umva -e umwana u- tuka undi . @" ||| therefore , she would warn them never do it again , she told them she did not want to ever hear them abusing each other .
ku buryo n' abo abana tu- vukana -aga , ariwo muco tu- ba- toza -aga . ||| and that is the discipline we taught to our young sisters .
nta muntu u- shobora -aga ku- tuka -an . ba- ra- kubagana -aga nk' abandi bana , tu- ka- ba- hana . ||| of course they were naughty just like other children are and we would punish them .
ariko ikintu cyo ku- tuka -an nti- ba- ki- gira -aga . kuko tu- ri tu- ra- ki- ba- bujije . ||| but they would never abuse each other because we told them not to .
ikintu na ... ikindi n- ku- ibuka -ir ku bavandimwe banjye , ni uko umwana witwa angelique , ya- ri umwana u- bona a- ta- sanzwe , ||| another thing i recall about my relatives , angelique was an extraordinary child .

a- ri umwana , icyo n- ra- bi- ibuka ko yi- gaga mu wa kabiri ya- ri mu mashuri a- banza , ||| i remember she was in primary two .
ya- kina -aga n' abantu benshi a- ka- ba- tsinda . ||| she won over many people .

ya- ka- umva iyi a- ka- vuga ngo ni funk , u- ka- umva ngo ni rock , a- ka- ba a- zi ngo ni zouk a- ki- ri muto , ||| i mean types of music ; she could listen to music and tell which one is funky , which is rock and which is zouk .
a- ka- bi- kunda a- ka- kunda ku- byina cyane . abantu benshi ba- ka- mu- kunda , ||| she also enjoyed dancing a lot and most people liked her .
a- ka- iga muri maternelle [ ibinyoni ] ha- ri abantu ba- igisha -aga a- honga -ho ba- jya ba- mu- jyana kuri lac , ba- ka- mu- jyana i gisenyi , ba- ka- mu- jyana ku kibuye ya- ri umwana u- shima -ish -ije cyane . ||| while she was still in nursery school , her teachers used to take her to the lake in gisenyi or in kibuye .
ku buryo abantu bose ba- mu- kunda -aga cyane , ||| she was such an interesting child that almost everybody liked her .
a- ka- menya ku- ririmba a- ka- menya ku- kunda abantu a- ri mutoya ni ... tu- umva ko tu- mu- fite ikintu cyo kumwibuka cyane . ||| she knew how to sing and how to make friends as young as she was . she left us special memories , we shall always remember her .
u- rebye abandi ba- ri ba- fite caractere i- sa nk' i- cecetse , ||| the other children had a more quiet spirit .
ariko we ya- ri eveillee [ a- fungutse mu mu- ta -w -e ] ... cyane ya- ri umuntu u- zi ... u- bona ko u- ta- mu- fata nk' umwana , ||| however , she was different , she was more noisy . it was easy to forget she was just a child looking at her ability to reason like an adult .
n' ibitekerezo bye u- ka- umva ko u- ta- mu- fata nk' umwana . ||| no one considered her to be young .
kandi ya- pfuye a- fite imyaka mike , ya- pfuye a- fite imyaka icumi ku- sa . ||| but , she died so young ; she was only ten years old .
uwakubaza nk' ikintu kimwe wibukiraho mama wawe , u- vuga i- ki- ha -e ? ||| if you were going to remember only one thing about your mother , what would it be ?
ikintu n- ku- ibuka -ir -ho maman cyane ... cyane ni ... ni u- ku- jya inama . n- vuga ngo @: ||| what i remember about my mother ... is the advice she used to give all types of people .

[ after habyarimana 's plane crashed ] it began at night .
tu- tangira ka- umva ba- vuga ba- ri mu cyumba ababyeyi bacu . ba- ra- byuka ba- ra- vuga bati : "@ ni- mu- byuka -e ibintu nti- bi- meze neza , ||| we heard them talking in the bedroom [ our parents ] they woke us up and said , "@ wake @-@ up , things are not good . @"

abenshi ba- shyinguye gisozi , ||| most of them were exhumed and reburied at gisozi .
abandi ... mbese u- rebye mu by' ukuri umuryango u- ra- shize . ||| others ... almost the whole family was decimated .
ubwo rero uko tu- banye ... uko ababyeyi bacu ba- banye , nibyo u- rebye bi- tumye tu- ba -ho mu minsi ba- ta- ri ba- ri -ho . ||| the way we used to live with other people ... how our parents behaved around others is what helped us to live in their absence .
kuko umuntu wese u- tu- bona -aga ya- ra- vuga -aga ati @: "@ dore abana bo kwa kanaka , ba- shoboye ku- rokoka . @" ||| everybody who would see us , would say , "@ these are the children of so and so , they survived . @"
abantu ba- tu- bana -iye neza ba- ka- tu- fasha mu ku- iga , ba- ka- tu- fasha ... kuko nti- tu- ri tu- fite aho tu- ba , ||| and people were good to us , they helped us in completing our school education .
tu- igeze ku- gira ikibazo kinini cyane cyo ku- gira aho tu- ba . ||| we did n't have anywhere to live , it once happened that we did not have where to live .
ariko tu- baye -ho bi- ta- ri byiza ariko tu- ra- gerageza , ||| we led a horrible life but we tried our best .
kubera ko ababyeyi bacu ba- shoboye kuba -an tu- bana nabo . ||| our parents lived well with others , we also had to do so .
ha- ri umuryango u- ri u- ra- sigaye i bu- ru- n- ri ba- ra- je tu- ra- bana . ||| there is a certain family , that had remained in burundi ; when they came we lived with them .

mu ... mubo tu- vukana , tu- vukana -aga tu- ri batandatu , ha- rokotse babiri . ni njyewe na mu- saza wanjye mukuru . ||| in my immediate family , we were six and only two survived ; my older brother and i.
u- tekereza ku- ta -e ejo ha- za- za ? u- bona ejo ha- za- za ha- za- ba ha- meze ku- ta -e ? ||| what do you think about the future ... what kind of future do you see ?
njyewe uko n- bona igihe ki- za- za , n- tekereza ko a- ri kiza . ubundi kuri n- jya -e n- bona ko a- ri kiza , ||| the way i think about the future ... i think it will be good .
n- bona ki- ruta icyashize . ni u- ku- vuga ngo nyuma ya jenoside . ||| in my opinion , the future is promising ; the future will be better than the past [ i mean after the genocide ] .
kuko mbere ya jenoside ho bi- ri ibindi . tu- bona -aga a- ri amata n' ubuki . ||| because before the genocide things were the other way round ; everything in life was like milk and honey .
ariko ubu nyuma ya jenoside ku- gera ubu , n- bona ko umuntu a- shobora ku- gira ikintu cyo ku- izera , cyane cyane burya ubuzima bw' abaturage budepa ... bu- shinga -iye kuri leta . ||| but after the genocide until today , one can believe ... in most cases , the citizens still depend on the government .
kuko n- bona uko ubuyobozi bw' ubu bu- meze , bu- shaka kura -ir bu- ta- vangura , bu- shaka ku- huza abantu , ||| when i consider today 's leadership , i can say that their aim is to bring people together and stop divisions . they want to unite people .
n- bona mu by' ukuri igihe ki- ri i- n- bera -e ki- shobora ku- za- ba kiza ku bantu benshi . ||| therefore , the future will be good to many people .
ariko nti- n- n- irengagiza -e ko ha- ri n' abantu ki- za- bera kibi ... bibi cyane kuko ha- ri a- ba- sigara -an -ye indwara . ha- ri abana ba- ta- shoboye ku- jya ku ishuri yenda ba- ri ku- za- bi- shobora . ||| but i would n't want to ignore that some people will still find the future so disappointing ... because they were left with diseases , there are some children who never went to school yet they were able to study .
igihe ki- za- za kuri jya -e n- tekereza ko ki- za- ba kiza ku- rusha i- ki- shize ni u- ku- vuga ngo nyuma ya jenoside kubera ko akenshi , ||| but to me , the future will be better than the past [ i mean straight after the genocide ] .
umuntu ya- ri a- ta- ra- bona umurongo a- genda -ir -mo . ||| because one had not yet defined the right path to go through .
n- ka- n- jya -e kuri n- jya -e n- gize amahirwe n- ra- iga , ||| personally i was lucky .
n- ra- rangiza amashuri yisumbuye , n- rangije na universite [ kaminuza ] . ||| i am educated ; i completed my secondary school and i have now completed university .
ku buryo n- bona ko ... yego ubuzima nti- bu- shinga -ir ku mashuri ku- sa , ariko n- tekereza ko yenda ibyinshi ... ibyo n- tekereza -aga ibyo n- tekereza -aga ko n- ta- za- gera -ho , n- shoboye ku- gera -ho n- umva ko bi- ba aribyo . ||| and now i see that ... well , of course life is not totally based on education but i guess there is much i thought i would never be able to achieve that i have achieved , which i am glad i did .
ibindi bi- sigaye n- umva ko bi- ba a- ri gahunda y' ima -an , ariko n- n- jya -e ku bwanjye n- umva ko n- za- bi- i- twara -mo neza . ariko n- ka- vuga nti @: ||| i guess the rest will go according to god 's plan and personally .
n' ubuzima bw' abaturage bu- shinga -ir cyane cyane ku miyoborere y' abantu . ||| i will emphasize on the fact that in many ways , people 's lives are dependent on the leadership .
kuko abantu ba- pfuye ba- zize leta . ||| people died due to a bad government .
iyo leta i- bi- i- twara -mo neza , abantu nti- ba- ba ba- ra- pfuye . ||| if the government had done the right thing , people would n't have died .
n- bona gahunda leta i- fite ubungubu , i- ha i- ka- izera -e abantu benshi cyo kuba -ho . ku buryo n- umva ko igihe ki- za- za mu by' ukuri ki- za- ba kiza . ||| thanks to the plan that today 's government 's has , many people have the hope of living and this reassures me that the future will be good .
ariko nti- irengagije ko ha- ri n' abandi bantu ba- n- ri ba- za- gira ubuzima bubi , nti- n- vuga ngo ibintu byose n' amata n' ubuki ku bantu bose . ||| i am not forgetting that some people will have a bad life in the future . i am not saying that things will be like milk and honey [ a good life ] for all people .
n- i- baza nk' abantu ba- siga -iye -w sida na jenoside ba- aka ... abana ba- ri ba- ki- ri bato , ba- fite imyaka itatu ... ibiri ba- ta- igeze ba- bona urukundo rw' ababyeyi , ||| i always think about people who were infected with hiv @/@ aids during the genocide ... very young kids who were two or three years old then who never experienced parental care .
ba- ka- rera -w nabi mu nzu z' imfubyi . ba- ka- ba munsi y' imihanda , ba- ka- rera -w n' umuhisi n' umugenzi , ba- ka- va mu rugo ba- jya mu rundi , ||| today they are not well cattered for in orphanages . others live on the streets , they are cattered for by passers @-@ by . they move from house to house .
n- i- baza ko nabyo bi- za- gira ikintu cy' ingaruka itoroshye ku buzima bwabo bw' i- n- y- uma . ||| i think that may have some negative impact on their future lives .
yenda n- jya -e n- gize amahirwe yo ku- bona ababyeyi ba- ra- n- tegura , ||| i guess i was lucky because i got a chance of having parents and they prepared me .
ku buryo wenda n- umva ko ba- sa -e [ urufatiro ] n- yi- fite . mbese n- umva ko ibyo aribyo byose nta kibazo n- za- gira cyane . mu by' ukuri . ||| and now i guess i have a foundation . i tend to think that i will never have to face plenty of problems [ as i did in the past ] to be sincere .
rosette , wowe u- bona bi- shoboka ku- babarira abantu ba- koze buriya bwicanyi ? ||| rosette , is it possible to forgive the people who committed these crimes ?
nti- bi- shoboka ko umuntu ya- ku- ibagirwa abe . ||| it is not possible for one to forget his or her people .
ibyo byo ni ibidashoboka . ||| that 's impossible .
ngirango n' abahanga ba- vuga ko ku- ibagirwa a- ri indwara . ||| even wise men say that forgetting is a form of sickness .
noneho ku- ibagirwa rero ibyakubayeho ... nk' ubu nti- n- ku- ibagirwa ko nta babyeyi n- fite . ||| forgetting what happened in one 's life ... for example there is no way i can forget that i had no parents .
nti- n- vuga ngo n- vutse ku giti mu by' ukuri . ||| sincerely i can not believe that i was born from a tree !
nti- n- ku- ibagirwa ko n- ri n- fite abavandimwe , ||| i can never forget that i once had sisters just because i do n't see them anymore !
kuko simbabona . kenshi n- jya n- bona nk' abo ba- ngana -aga , n- ka- bona ba- rangije secondaire , bi- gana -aga mu mashuri amwe , ||| i often see children of their age who used to go to school with them and who are now finishing secondary school .
ni byinshi bi- ku- ibutsa . ||| there 's a lot that reminds me of them !
ariko ku- ibagirwa byo nti- bi- shoboka . nti- bi- shoboka . ||| it is simply impossible to forget .
ntabwo tu- shobora ku- ibagirwa . ||| we can never forget !
ese ku bwawe u- tekereza ko habayeho ubutabera ku babyeyi n' abavandimwe bawe ? ||| do you think that you have had justice for your parents and your sisters ?
ku bwawe u- bona ubutabera bu- ra- koze akazi kabwo ku buryo bu- kwiriye ? ||| has justice been done to your parents ?
n- vuga ngo ubutabera ... ubutabera bwo ni n- gomba -w . ||| i would say that justice ... justice is needed .
ariko ku bantu ba- pfuye ba- zize jenoside , ba- zize a- ka- renga -an -e . ||| the victims of the genocide were innocent .
nk' ababyeyi banjye ; inshuti ; abavandimwe . n- umva koko ubutabera bu- kwiriye kuba -ho . ||| my parents , my friends and relatives ... i really believe that justice needs to take action .

n- fite i- ka- izera -e ko jenoside i- ta- za- ongera kuba -ho mu rwanda . ||| i hope genocide will never happen again in rwanda .

n- ta -w -e n- umva ko tu- bi- baye -mo , tu- gize ibyago byo ku- biba -mo , ||| i believe we experienced it , we unfortunately experienced it .
n- i- baza ko tu- fite inshingano zi- komeye zo ku- igisha abantu ka- ubaha abandi . ||| i think we have a task of teaching people how to respect each other .
uburenganzira bw' abandi . ni u- ku- vuga ngo uburenganzira bwa bu- ri muntu wese nibushobora ku- ba- ha- iriza -w , nta jenoside i- za- ongera kuba -ho mu by' ukuri . ||| i mean , if everyone respects human rights , then there would be no genocide again .
kandi n' ubu n- izeye ko i- ta- za- subira . ||| and even now i believe there will be no genocide again .
reka noneho n- ku- baze akabazo gato ka- n- y- uma na nyuma , ||| i said that was my last question but i have one more question .
nyuma y' ibyo byose u- ri umuntu ki ? ||| what kind of person are you after this ?
ese u- ri umuntu wizera ejo ha- za- za heza ; u- hora se u- nezerewe ... rosette ni inde ? ||| are you hopeful , are you optimistic ... are you sad and unhapppy ? who is rosette ?

n- umva ko nta kibazo mu by' ukuri muri n- jya -e , n- umva ko nisanzuye [ je suis libre ] ndi umuntu u- ri libre . ||| i am free ; i am a very free person .
n- umva ko n- ta- teye ikibazo muri societe . n- umva n- ta- ka- gombye kuba ... n- umva n- ta- ri ikibazo cya societe y' u rwanda [ umuyango nyarwanda ] mu by' ukuri cyangwa se abo tu- bana . ||| i do not constitute a burden to the rwandan society or to the people around me . i strongly believe that i will live long .
n- umva n- fite i- ka- izera -e cyo kuba -ho , n- umva n- shaka kuza ... n- umva n- shaka ku- za- ba -ho ku- rusha ukunguku . ||| i wish i ... i wish i would live a better life than this .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo n- bi- vuze kare ko n- shaka kuba mu mwanya w' ababyeyi , inshuti , abavandimwe bose n- umva ba- zize jenoside . ||| i guess i mentionned it earlier that i would like to stand in the position of my parents , my friends and my sisters ; all those who died in the genocide .
n- umva n- shaka ku- ba- hagararira . kubahagarira rero bi- saba kuba u- ri undi muntu wu- n- ri . u- gera kubyo n- ifuza , ||| i wish i would represent them .
n- ra- umva nti- n- zi uko n- bi- vuga [ a- ra- mwenyura ] . ||| to represent them requires to be a different person , that 's my goal ... how can i say this ... [ she smiles ]

ubwo ngubwo n- gerageje ku- shakisha tubura amakuru ye nyuma tuza ka- umva ko ibintu yose bi- ri aho ngaho ya- bi- gurishije a- ka- hita ajyenda a- ka- hita y- urira indegeakagenda , ||| we reported him and they sent him a letter asking him to come at the station . the madam asked me to not go back home , i stayed there the way i came . i came with nothing except the clothes i was wearing . when he came at the police station , he was directly sent to prison .

aha tu- ri ni ku kacyiru tu- ri kumwe na padiri muzungu bernardin aho tu- giye ku- ganira nawe ku mateka . ||| we are at kacyiru together with father muzungu bernardini where we are going to have a conversation on history .
padiri bernardin muzungu mwaba mu- gira ngo mu- tangira mu- tu- ibwira . ||| father bernardini muzungu can you start by introducing yourself .
nk' uko u- maze ku- bi- vuga n- itwa bernardini muzungu n- ka- ba ndi umu padiri w' umudominikani n- ba hano ku kacyiru . ||| like you already said , i am called bernardin muzungu and i am a dominican father i live here in kacyiru .
aho n- vuka iwacu ni ku musozi wa buhoro muri nyaruguru , n- vutse muri mirongo itatu na kabiri . ||| i was born back home on a hill called buhoro in nyaruguru , i was born in 1932 .
ubwo rero n- rinze n- gera hano mu ba padiri b' abadominikani n- ciye mu n- zira ndende y' amashuli ku- hera i ki- ba -e -ho , mu mashuli a- banza i kabgayi , mu badominikani bi- tumye n- jya mu bihugu byo hanze , ubufaransa , ubusuwisi , ubwongereza , canada . ||| i got here amongst the dominican fathers through the lengthy journey of schooling starting from kibeho , in the elementary school in kabgayi , being part of the dominicans made me go to countries abroad , france , sweden , england , canada .
eh u- tangiye neza icyo n' ikibazo cy' ingenzi ki- ri -mo igisubizo cy' ibanze mubyo n- za ku- vuga byose , amateka y' isi n' amateka y' u rwanda nk' uko n- za ku- bi- vuga ahangaha n- ra- bi- kura mu bintu n- somye ariko mu magambo makeya kuko kenshi na kenshi iyo ba- tu- bajije u- sanga umuntu a- pfa ku- vuga ku- sa . ||| you have begun well , that is a very important question having the first point to what i am going to say , the history of the world and that of rwanda like i will talk about here , is got from things i read but in brief because often when we are asked you find someone just merely speak
n- ragira ngo n- bwira -e a- ba- shobora ku- za- n- y- umva ko ibyo n- vuga bi- va mu bigega bitatu mu mateka y' u rwanda . ||| i want to tell those who will be able to hear me that what i am talking about comes from three chapters of the history of rwanda .
ikigega cya mbere a- ri nacyo n- za ku- hera -ho , ||| i will start from the first chapter , and what happened before that .
n' ibyabaye mbere yayo mateka y' u rwanda tu- zi , mu gifaransa ni mate ni archeologie n' ibisigarataka abahanga ba- sanze kw' isi ba- ka- menya amateka n' i- n- bera -e y' igihe cy' uko abantu ba- ri ba- zi ku- andika n- gira ngo mu- esa -e mwarabyumvise . ||| the history of rwanda we know , in french it is math , archaeology and fossils that scholars found on earth that told them the history before man could write , i think that you all heard about it .
umuntu wa mbere u- vutse kw' isi bibiriya imwita adamu ndetse na eva , ba- vuga ko ba- ri muri afrika ndetse afrika ya hafi ahangaha iwacu , aho n- ra- za ku- ha- hera . ||| the first human on earth in the bible is called adam and also eva , they say that they were in africa , which is very close to here , our home , i will start from here .
ibyo rero ni n' ibintu tu- sanga muri ibyo bisa bisigarataka . ||| these therefore are the things we find in those fossils .
ikindi kigega tu- sanga -mo amateka cyane twebwe abanyarwanda n' ayo abakurambere ba- tu- bwiye , tu- esa -e ngirango tu- ra- bi- zi tu- sanga imigani n' ibindi byinshi , n' amazina y' imisozi ariko cyane amasoko tu- sanga -mo iyo migani cyangwa se inzira tu- kura -mo ibyo bitekerezo by' abanyarwanda n' amateka y' abanyarwanda by' ihame kandi byanditswe bi- fashe bi- ri ubutatu . ||| and the other chapter in which we find history especially us rwandans is the one which our forefathers told us , i think we all know that we find stories and many other things , names of hills but usually the source of these stories or way through which we get these ideas of rwandans and their true history which is with evidence are three
i- cya mbere n' ibisigo n- gira ngo mu- esa -e mwumvise ibisigo uko bi- ri -ho bi- baye -ho bi- tangira -an -ye n' umwamikazi nyirarumaga mu kinyejana cya 16 . ||| the first are poems , i think you have all heard that poems exist and that they existed starting with queen nyirarumaga in the 16th century .
ha- ka- ba -ho i- cya kabiri ubwiru , ubwiru nabyo n' ibintu bi- tangiye kera bi- tangiye ndetse na na ki- hanga . ||| then there is the second one , royal secrets , royal secrets also are things which started long ago with gihanga .
n' umwiru w' abasinga ba kera witwaga ru- bunga a- ka- ba nyina umwiru w' abasinga a- ka- ba a- riwe u- zanye ubwiru mu banyiginya a- ka- wu- bwira ki- hanga , ndetse bi- ka- mu- va -ir -mo ku- gira uwo muhango wo kuzagumya ku- bi- igisha abiru bo ku n- goma y' abanyiginya . ||| the royal secret keeper of the ancient basinga clan who was called rubunga who was the one who brought royal secrets to the banyiginya clan and told them to gihanga , which resulted in that ritual of continuing to teach the royal secret keepers during the reign of the banyiginya clan .
uti mbere y' abami muri icyi gihugu ahangaha haba -aga iki ? ||| what existed before kingdoms in this country ?
n- subiye muri abo bantu babanyabwenge ba- bi- kesha ku- reba ibyasigaye mu bu- taka , iki gihugu cyacu , aka ka- rera -e kacu n' iyi afrika yacu kubera ko a- ri -ho abo bose ba- hamya nta ku- shidikanya k' umuntu wa mbere a- ri -ho ya- bonetse . ||| coming back to the scholars who base their research on fossil findings say our country , our region and africa is where they all claim without doubt that the first human being was discovered here .
bi- tumye ba- ha- shakisha kubera ibisigazwa bi- garagaza abantu ba mbere uko ba- ri ba- meze . ||| this made them explore this place because of the fossils which revealed how the first human beings were .
bi- je ku- gera igihe ndetse haza n' abanyabwenge baza no mu rwanda no mu bu- ru- n- ri . ||| there reached a time when explorers came to rwanda and burundi .
kandi mu- ra- bi- umva kenshi aba kera ndetse n' umwami ha- ri ikintu cyo ku- higa . ha- ka- ba rero nyine u- rebye ndetse aho ishyamba regabanukiye ha- je inka , ||| and you often hear that ancient human beings including the king used to hunt . there was also if you analyse the period when the forest reduced is when cattle came , like they say , when cattle graze .
niko ba- vuga inka zi- ka- risha ishyamba ri- ka- ri- vunja ri- za maze kuhatazura . ||| the thick forest is destroyed and then demolished .
rero isuka i- ra- ku- ri- kira , iyo u- bi- genzuye rero n- ra- za ka- ongera n- bi- vuga -e eh ni -ho ba- hereye ba- bona ba- himba ama amazina tu- menyereye ubungubu ngo y' abahutu n' abatutsi n' a- ba- ta -w u- ka- bona ko ba- ise a- ba- ta -w n' abari ba- fite umwuga wo ku- higa . ||| then the hoe followed , if you observe , i will come back to it , is when they begun to come up with names we are used to now like hutu , tutsi and twa you see that those they called the twa were hunters .
abari ba- fite umwuga wo ku korora no ku- ragira inka baki ba- ba- ise abatutsi , ||| those who bred and herded cattle were called the tutsi , those who were cultivators were called the hutu but you realize they were one people .
abari ba- fite umwuga wo ku- hinga ba- ba- iga ba- ba- ita abahutu ariko u- ra- umva ba- ri abaturage bamwe ba- tandukanya -ije -w n' imyuga tu- ra- za ku- reba ukuntu ikosa ri- je kuza nyuma byo ku- bi- ita ngo ni amoko . ||| we shall later come to see how the error of calling it tribes came to be .
ehh ngabo abantu tu- zi n' ibyari bi- ha- ri mbere y' iki ki- ha -e tu- vuga cy' abami , mu magambo make ni nk' ibyo umuntu ya- vuga kandi n- gira ngo biba bi- hagije ku- gira ngo tu- komeza -e urugendo rw' ibibazo wenda mu- za ku- n- baza . ||| those are the people we know of and what existed before the time of kings , in brief that is what one can say and i think that is enough so that we continue our journey of the questions you are going to ask me
n- hita n- baza ikibazo , mu- ra- tu- bwiye muti a- ba- higa -aga ba- ba- ise a- ba- ta -w abandi ba- ba- ita abahutu abandi ba- ba- ita abatutsi . ||| let me quickly ask a question , you have told us that those who were hunters were called the batwa while others were called the hutu and others were called the tutsi .
ese n' iki ki- tumye nk' urugero n- vuga nk' abantu ba ba ba- ri ba- oroye babi ba- ta- ita -aga abatutsi ha- ri ikintu cyagenderewe kugirango ubwoko bwororaga bu- itwa -e abatutsi . ||| what made them for example the people who bred became called the tutsi , what was considered so as to call the tribe that bred cattle the tutsi ?
ibyo bi- hita bi- na- jyana no kuba uwahigaga nawe ya- ba u- mu- ta -w ? ||| as well as one who hunted to be a twa ?
ese ko ha- ri ibintu tu- zi ba- na- vuga bati nabyo bi- shobora kuba wenda bitazwi neza cyangwa bi- ra- turutse ku mateka abantu ba- ta- zi neza ba- vuga ngo ayo abo bantu u- tu- bwiye batatu ngo ntibagereye mu rwanda rimwe ha- ri a- ba- vuga ngo abatutsi baje nyuma ha- ri a- ba- vuga ngo abahutu ba- geze -mo mbere . ||| there are things we know of which are also spoken of which may not be well known or came from the history which people do n't know well and say that those three groups of people you have told us about did not reach rwanda at the same time there are those who say that the tutsi came last and others who say that the hutu reached first .
ibyo nabyo mwaza ku- gira ikintu mu- bi- tu- bwira -ho ariko mu- hereye kw' icyo kintu cyo ku- ita amazina , bi- gira -ir -w bitewe n' iyihe mpamvu ? ||| is that right ? can you tell us something about that but starting with the question of naming , what was the reason behind it ?
ehh ii n- ra- za ku- bi- gera -ho tu- ra- za ku- bi- vuga ha- ri umuntu witwa speek niwe u- zanye iyo theorie y' amoko niwihangana rero tu- ra- za ku- bi- gera -ho mu kanya ki- kora wenda ikibazo n' uko ara abahinzi ar' aborozi a- ri n' abahigi u- ka- ba ubungubu ba- ba- ita ngo n' amoko uu wihanganye rero n- ra- za ku- bi- ka- umva -ish . ||| i will come to that , we shall talk about it . there is a man called speak who brought that theory of tribes , if you are patient we shall get to it in a little while , but rather the question is how the cultivators or the breeders or the hunters came to be called tribes , if you can be patient , i will explain it to you .
ubundi n- vuze y' uko ku- sa a- ri abaturage bo ni archeologie ntawababonye . ||| i said that they were just natives , and it is archaeology because no one saw them .
ni archeologie tu- vuga -e nk' urugero icyatumye ba- bi- vuga mbese ibyo ba- vuga -aga nk' ibi tu reba hano niba mu- gira ha- ri tu- vuga -e nk' aba abo ba- cukura ba- sanze ha- ri abacuzi . ||| it is archaeology giving an example as to why they say what they say like what we see here if we can maybe say like archaeologists who found blacksmiths .
hano muri iki gitabo ha- ri -mo ibintu by' amafoto y' inyundo n' ubutare n' iki n' amabuye , ngirango niba bi- boneka -aga umuntu ya- bona ha- ri inzitso hano n' utubindi . ||| here in this book , there are photos of hummers and small rocks , i think if it were visible one could see that there are small ropes here and pots .

tu- vuga -e nku abami ba- ri ba- fite , abami ba- ri ba- fite ukuntu bakuramwa mu mazina no mushyingano . ||| let us talk about kings , kings had a way in which their names reflected their responsibilities .
ha- ri abami babiri uwitwaga kigeli n' uwitwaga mibambwe akazi kabo cyane cyane ka- ri ako kwa ku- gura u rwanda . ||| there were two kings , one was called kigeli and the other mibambwe , there duty mainly was to conquer for rwanda .
kigeli niko kazi ke iyo y- ima -aga ingoma ya- gomba -aga ku- gura u rwanda n' umuhungu we mibambwe a- ka- za- ku- ri- kira -w n' uwitwa yuhi , yuhi a- ka- ba u- zana amahoro n' umutekano a- ka- ba ndetse u- za mu bintu by' imihango n' ibindi byose bi- tuma nko ku- ruhuka n' ibiki byose . ||| that was kigeli 's duty , whenever he was on the throne , he had to conquer for rwanda and his son too who was succeeded by the one called yuhi , yuhi was one who brought peace and security and he was also involved in thing to do with activities and all others which involved resting and others .
ha- ka- ba -ho na n' abandi rero ba b' amata uwitwa ki- ra- ima n' uwitwa mutara ba- zana u- bu- rumbuka -e mu gihugu n' icyo ki- tuma nyine naho mutara nyine ni mutara h' inka ni -ho ririya zina ri- turutse n' iki . ||| there were others for milk , the ones called kirima and mutara brought plenty to the kingdom , that is why mutara is place of cows , that is where that name came from .
u- ra- umva rero bi bi bi- gana -ish -ije mu bintu bi- erekeye uko igihugu ki- gomba -aga ku- jya mbere . ||| that leads us to things concerning how the kingdom had to move forward .

uwa mbere ruganzu mpimba na ruganzu ndori . ||| first there were those called ruganzu , they were to be fighters of ruganzu , the first was ruganzu mpimba and ruganzu ndoli .
iryo zina baje kuri kura mu mateka kuko rya a- ba- ri- iswe bose ba ri- ba- teye ubuvukasi , ||| that name was removed from the history because those who were named after it ... it made them lose their lives .

u rwanda , anda mu kinya , anda n' u- ku- vuga n' u- ku- vuga isi i- tagira imipaka , aanda ii . ||| anda in kinyarwanda means a world without boundaries .
ehh kigali n' ikigali n' igihugu nyine kigali ki- tagira imipaka nyine , ni kigali kimwe rwose niko ba- ka- ise . ||| kigali means large , without boundaries , it is one kigali , that is what they name it .
umunye y' uko gapi capital ya mbere ya ya- ba ni kigali nyine rwoya i- shinze hariya mu mu bushorishori bwa kigali hariya hejuru mu bi- taka mu biti hejuru hariya . ||| you have known that the first capital here was kigali , rwoya which was found in at the ends of kigali above in the ground in the woods above there .

eh umuntu ya- hera ndetse ku ba- tu- raga -e b' u rwanda abakoroni ba- maze ku- ha- gera ba- ba- fashe ba- ta -e ? ||| let me start with the locals of rwanda , how were they colonized ?

ngo n' a- jya -e mu misa n' a- gira -e a- ta -e , ||| and go to church , he could not understand that because it was not his faith and indeed that religion of god had no fault and they removed it and up to now it makes no sense .

u- batizwa a- ka- iga iby' ikizungu undi ya- ri a- shaje wenda ba- sanga a- ta- za- ba- shoboka -ir . ||| that 's what i think , other things maight have been because they wanted one who was easy going , baptized and willing to learn the white man 's things but he was old and they found that they could not get along with him .
noneho iyo u- giye ku- itegereza muri afrika ntabwo u rwanda n' u bu- ru- n- ri aribyo byakoronijwe byonyine n' ibindi bihugu bi- giye bikoronizwa . ||| if you take a look at africa , rwanda and burundi were not the only countries that were colonised , other countries too were colonised .
noneho ariko mu rwanda n' i bu- ru- n- ri cyane cyane u- sanga a- ri -ho ha- giye haba ikibazo kuko nk' ubwo abazungu ba- ra- je ba- sanga aa nko mu rwanda tu- vuga -e abanyarwanda uko ba- ri babaye -ho ba- ri ba- fite uburyo ba- tegeka -an , ba- ri ba- fite ukuntu babaye -ho noneho n- ki- baza ikibazo . n' iki ki- tumye abazungu ba- shobora ku- basha ku- teranya cyangwa ku- himba amoko mu banyarwanda ku- gira ngo ba- bona -e ukuntu ba- ba- ca -mo i- bi- ca -e cyangwa bi- fasha -ish -e nk' uko u- bi- vuze abatutsi ku- gira ngo ba- ba- tegeka -ir -e . ||| but you find that it was especially rwanda and burundi that had problems because even though the white man came , rwandans had away of ruling eachother , they had away of life and i ask myself , what made it possible for the white man to divide or to come up with with tribes amongst rwandans so as to divide them into pieces or like you said use the tutsi to rule for them .
noneho n- ka- vuga nti kuki ba- hise -mo abatutsi kuko iyo u- giye ku- itegereza u- sanga ikibazo uyu munsi tu- fite ki- turuka muri kiriya ki- ha -e cy' ubukoroni kuko abazungu ba- fite ibintu ba- himba -ye ku- gira ngo bi- ba- fashe mu mugambi wabo ariko se kuki bi- baye -ho muri bino bihugu byacu . ||| so why did they choose thetutsi because yuo realise that the most of the problems we have today are from the colonial time because the white man made up somethings to help them with their plans but why did it happen in our countries ?
urugero n- tanga nk' u rwanda no mu bu- ru- n- ri ku- sa n' uko a- ra- itwa -e tu- ri tu- fite nk' imiyoborere myiza baje ba- ka- bona ba- ta- za- tu- injira -mo ku- sa nko mu bi- n- ri bihugu . ||| the example i can give on only rwanda and burundi is that we were the only ones who had good leadership and they saw that they could not just penetrate us like in other countries .
ehh ibyo n- ri ku- ki- ku- subiza mu kanya iiyu u- ba uretse kuko tu- ra- za ku- gera ku bintu byo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda . ||| i would have answered that later because we shall come to things of 1939 .
nyine icyo tu- pfuye na n' ibyo bi- je kuba -mo ariko icyo kibazo umuntu a- ra- za ku- ki- subiza mu kanya . ||| our misunderstandings are those things that came to be but i will come back to that problem in a while .
mu by' ukuri u- bi- genzuye wenda ngisubirize aho iby' amoko ba- bi- himba -ye nk' uko u- bi- vuze neza , mu by' ukuri n' ahandi ba- ra- bi- himba -ye ariko ikibazo ki- je gukara cyane cyane igihe cyo cyo ku- shaka ubwigenge . ||| honestly , if you take a close look at where they came up with tribes like you have said clearly , they came up with these tribes elsewhere but the problem became more complicated in the time they wanted independence .
n' icyo ki- tuma n- gira iyo umuntu a- ki- vuga mu kanya ni -ho bi- ri ku- kunda kuko kuko naho mu by' ukuri hano ba- himba -ye iby' amoko ariko ahandi ba- himba -ye ibindi . ||| that is why i was proposing to talk about it later because they came up with tribes here but they came up with other things elsewhere .
ese icyo kintu cyo ariko noneho nyuma u- reba u- ka- sanga hagati hariya ntabwo nti- n- zi niba n- vuga kiliziya ka- turika cyangwa niba n- vuga abapadiri nabo ntabwo bi- twaye neza kuko ba- garagaje guhengama mu buryo bu- garagara , iby' a- ri ku- igisha abantu ima -an bi- hinduka politique u- ka- sanga noneho ibintu ntabwo bi- genze neza . ||| if you look closely you realise that along the way the catholic church or should i say the priest did not behave propery because they evidently showed crookedness , what was meant to be teaching people the word of god became politics and things did not go well .
nti- n- zi ikintu mwatubwira a- honga -ho ku kintu ka- erekera -an -ye n' aba padiri na kiliziya . ||| i do not know what you can tell us in regards to the priest and church .
eh ku- gira ngo tubyoroshye reka ibyo byose tu- bi- ganira -e tu- vuga -e ibyo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda bira bi- rasa nk' aho bi- subira muri ibyo byose kuko n' ubundi turavangavanga u- sanga -e biza no kuruhanya eh ni -ho tuza ku ibyo by' abapadiri n' abakoroni icyo tu- pfa cy' ukuri kuko nibyo bya speek n' iki nk' ukuntu n- bi- vuze mbere ku bu- haka -e ariko icyo n' iki n' ikintu ba- ri ba- keneye ku- ki- koresha . ||| so as to simplify things , let us talk about it all , let 's talk about thing in 1959 because it is like talking about all these things because we shall mix things up and you will find that it is tiring . that is where we come to the priests and colonialists and ourmiunderstandings with them , it is speak 's ideologies and what i said before about befriending but that is something they needed to use .
ba- ri ba- zi ko ba- beshya ariko ba- ri ba- keneye ku- gira ngo mu by' ukuri ba- n- gaga ku- va hano , ba- n- gaga ku- tanga ubwigenge , ibyo n' ibintu bi- kaza -e bakajije cyane cyane ba- gira ngo ba- ima -an -e ubwigenge . ||| they knew that they were telling lies but they honestly did not want to leave this place , they did not want to grant us independance , those are the things that became difficult as they tried not to grant independence .
eh noneho ngirango uwavuga ikibazo ki- erekeye ni ha- ri byinshi bishamikiyemo . ehehehe ||| i think if one is to talk about that , there are many thinga that are part of it .

tu- ra- kubita ku mvururu zo muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda imyivumbagatanyo abantu benshi ubungubu ba- bi- ita kwishi @: ||| we shall talk about the riots of 1959 and the protests .
ha- ri a- ba- bi- ita imvururu , ha- ri a- ba- bi- ita revolution sociale , ha- ri n' a- ba- bi- ita ukundi . ||| there are those who call it riots , others call it a social revolution while others call it something else .

muri afrika rero amateka mu- ra- ya- zi n' abantu benshi ba- ra- ya- soma ubungubu n' ibintu byoroshye ku ku- vuga -w . ||| many people now know the history of africa and even read about it , that is an easy thing to talk about today .

ibihugu bya mbere n- gira ngo n- i- za ghana nizo za- ba- n- je ku- gira independance . ||| in the period around 1960 , i think the first country to gain its independence was ghana .

uruhare rwa kiliziya gatorika muri ibyo bintu byose by' i- bi- ku- bara bi- baye cyane cyane by' amacakubiri , by' inzangano za- baye mu banyarwanda ba- ise amoko , ||| the role of the catholic church in all these things especially to with divisionism that happened amongst the rwandans which they called tribes .
n- gira ngo nibyo byiza kuko ku- vuga si pelode wenyine ni ku- ba a- ri ku- kabya u- ka- vuga ngo ni pelode wenyine . ||| i think that is better because it would be an exageration if i only spoke of pelodi because he was not the only one involved .
n- gira ngo n- vuze mu kanya ukuntu igitekerezo cy' uko ha- ri amoko atatu a- tandukanye cyane byanditswe mu bitabo byanditswe n' abapadiri ba mbere . ||| i told you a little while ago that the idea of there being three different tribes was written in books by the first priests .

ndetse niwe u- tumye a- mu- ta niwe u- mu- tandukanya -ije na n' umwamikazi ka- n- ka- zi . ||| he is the one who caused the king to leave queen kankazi .

musenyeri classe rero ba- ka- vuga kera ba- vuga -aga ndetse ko a- ri inshuti y' abatutsi . bi- ka- sa nkaho a- ri nkaho ehh aho bi- hindukiye rero abenshi ba- ka- vuga ngo pelode ya- baye umwami ya- baye mbese musenyeri w' abahutu niko ba- vuga cyane cyane . ||| they used to say that father classe was a friend of the tutsi while it seemed like peraudin was a father to the hutu
ba- ka- hera cyane cyane kw' ibaruwa yi- geze ku- andika yo ku y' igisibo ya- vuga -aga ngo ................... ngo ibiganiro byose , urukundo ehh ba- ka- vuga n' ibindi byinshi ariko noneho iyo umuntu a- jya ku- vuga uruhare rw' umuntu a- gomba ku- vuga ibintu bi- umvikana kandi by' ukuri iii ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| they based this in the letter he wrote during the fast saying that ... , love and many other things but when one is talking about the role of someone , he must speak things which are clear and honest .
n- jya -e icyo n- vuga muby' ukuri pelode ehh ba- mu- shyize muri urwo ruhande y' uko ya- giye mugipa asa nkaho mbese ya- giye mu gipande kidahuje n' i- cya musenyeri classe . ||| what i can honestly say is that pelodi was considered to be on that side because he opposed father classe .
habayeho musenyeri w' abatutsi haba -ho musenyeri w' abahutu niko ba- vuga ariko ba- koze uko ba- bi- umva -aga niko n- vuga na bu- ri ki- ha -e . ||| they say that there was a priest for the tutsi and a priest for the hutu but they did what they felt like , that is what i always say .
n- gira ngo igihe cya musenyeri pelode niko n- umvise ba- vuga ngo ba- ra- mu- bwiye abakoroni bati wowe wa mugabo we dore ha- giye kuba ubwigenge kandi abatutsi tu- ba- ciye , u- ra- bi- bona bi- rangiye hita -mo u- fashe abatutsi nako u- fashe abahutu kandi u u u- fashe hasi abatutsi , ||| i heard them say that in the time of father peraudin , he was told by the colonialists that the rwandans were going to gain independence and the tutsi had been removed , like you see it 's over so chose to help tutsis , rather help the hutu and leave out the tutsi .
fasha hasi abatutsi u- fashe abahutu wime ingoma ya gihutu u- tegeka -e u rwanda bi- kunda -e bi bi- ku- tungana -ir -e . ||| he was told to help the hutu and not to give the leadersip of rwanda to the tutsi so as to make it suitable for you .
bamwe bakavu ngo ya ya- hise -mo i- bi- geza -w -e -ho wa mu- ka- ni w' ikinyarwanda ki- teye , icy' ingoma y- ima -an . ubwo rero hagati y' uko ya- bi- emeye n' ibyo ya- koze n' ibyo ya- koze ku- mu- cira urubanza s' indi ima -an . ||| some say that he chose what was on mode like the rwandans say ... that is what he did , i can not judge him because i 'm not god .
ki- kora icyo n- bona cy' ukuri rero n- vuga n- ta- vuga -iye pelode wenyine , n' uko bi- baye koko ha- ri abapadiri benshi ba- koze ba- fatanya -ije n' abakoroni bi- bwira bati nidutanga ubwi n- i- haba -ho ubwigenge ba- za- irukana abakoroni ndetse ba- za- irukana n' abapadiri ba missionnaire , u- rebye icyo gitekerezo ba- ra- ki- gize bu- retse ko n' icyo ki- ha -e ba- ra- na- bi- vuze na henshi bi- ra- anditse . ||| however what i see that is true without deffending only peraudin , it 's the fact that it happened when they are many priests who were working together with colonialists thinking that if they grant them independence they will expel the colonialists as well as the missionaries , you see that had that ideology in that it was even said at that time and it is written .
ka- y- ibanda uretse no kuba umukristu ya- ri n' umufratiri ye , ya- giye yi ya- ragiye no ku ya- geze hafi yo kuba padiri . ||| kayibanda , besides being a christian , he was a brother , he was close to being a priest .
ubwo rero nabo u- ba- shyira mu mu bantu bana ba kiliziya bakosheje . kayi , ||| so you can also include him amongst those members who wronged the church .
habyarimana nawe ya- baye umuseminari ndetse ya- ri a- fite na a- fite bashiki be ba babenebikira , ||| habyarimana was also a seminerian and he also had sisters who were nuns .
ise , ise ya- ri a- ri umu catessiste ya- vuye , ya- vuye mu buganda i bufumbira a- zana n' abapadiri b' i rwaza baza no ku- shimira paroise ya rambura hanyuma a- za mw' iseminari . ||| his father was a catechist , he was from uganda in bufumbira and he come with priests from rwaza , they even came to inaugurate the diocese of rambura and then he joined the seminary .
rero tu- vuze u- shyize -mo kiliziya ko ye zu ya- gize ibintu bibi bi- ri nawe a- ri -mo kuri urwo ruhande . ||| so if we said that the church wronged , jesus would be inclusive .
n- ta- shaka ku- vuga y' uko ha- ri abana ba kiliziya rero babi koko ba- koze ibintu by' amacakubiri ndetse ba- geza no muri genocide ba- ra- bi- teguye . ||| i just wanted to say that some members of the church are bad , indeed they did some things that brought divisions and they even got to a point of planning the genocide .
eh u- ra- umva rero mu gipande cya cy' abaraique ba- ri -mo n' abapadiri rero ba- ri -mo . ||| so in the group of ... even priests are included .
tu- vuga -e n- ku- bwiye nk' urugero nkubu wenda ntanuwabitandukanya rwose n' ibi bya genocide ibi bi- ri bi- ra- tangiye genocide ya- ri ya- ra- tangiye . ||| let 's say if i give you an example maybe you can n't differentiate it from the genocide , this had started way before the genocide .
ubungubu mu- zi ko ha- ri -ho abapadiri nyine ba ba- ciriwe n' urubanza by' ukuri a- rusha mwarabumvise ba- hamye n' icyaha cy' uko ba- bi- gize . ||| you know that there are priests who were found guilty .

mwumvise ha- ri -ho a- ba- bi- kira ba- funga -iye mu bubirigi iii , ha- ri abandi ba- funzwe , ha- ri abapadiri ba- funzwe nti- n- mu- hamya ariko ha- ri abo n- zi n- n- jya -e ubwanjye ha- ri n- ba uwari u- giye kunyicasha , ku- n- y- icisha njyewe ubwanjye . ||| you see i did n't want to sound sure about peraudin , and i even know other priests , i know them myself but i 'm not in position to mention any before evidence is revealed like before arusha confirms that he destroyed his church when he was the priest in charge ... you heard of nuns who are jailed in belgium , there are priests who are in jail , i can n't accuse him but there those i know myself who even wanted to have me killed .
ariko nti- n- vuga ngo mu- vuga -e kuko ntawaciye urubanza mwavuga muti u- ra- beshya uhh . ||| but i can not mention him because he is not yet found guilty , you may say i 'm telling lies .
ku- vuga rero y' uko ikindi rero tu- vuga -e nko mu mu masengero mu kiliziya , uruhare rwa kiliziya n- ba- bwira ru ru- garagara ru ru ru- na- n- babaza n- jya n- bi- vuga rwose , ||| let 's say like in churches , the role of the catholic church i 'm telling you that is obvious and makes me sad and i even say it .

tu- vuga -e ibyabaye mu rwanda ahangaha tu- vuga -e nk' igihe amategeko ya parmehutu ya- vuga -aga kubyo ba- umvikana ko ya- ngana -ish abantu . ||| let 's talk about what happened in rwanda like during the time when the laws of parmehutu that talked about what agreed on .
tu- vuga -e nk' igihe radio ya- vuga -aga i- ka- hamya y' uko ha- ri umwanzi u- fite izina . tu- vuga -e nk' uko ha- ri umusenyeri faucasse , ||| let 's talk about the time the radio gave confirmation that there is an enemy with a name .
mwaramwumvise nikwigize ya- vuze ngo mutu umututsi ni ni mubi muri kamere kandi a- zi ko kamere ya- remye n' ima -an , a- ka- ba nta muntu wigeze a- mu- vuguruza muri abo basenyeri bose ngo a- gira -e ati wo tu- sangiye ima -an nti- tu- sangiye ijambo ati ibyo bi- ra- kabije . ||| let 's say like there is a bishop focas , you heard of him nikwize he said that a tutsi is naturally bad and he knows that character is created by god and no one disagreed amongst those bishops disagreed with him so that he says , one with whom we share god we do n't share a word , it 's exaggerating .
eh ka- umva ko ba- shyize -ho ha- ri -ho nk' a- banye ha- ri -ho nk' impunzi za- baye -ho imyaka n- n- jya -e n- baye -ho imya impunzi imyaka makumyabiri n' irindwi . ||| i was a refugee for 27 years , bishops used to write in books saying that there is no more room in rwanda , that those who left should look for room outside the country .
ba- ka- andika abasenyeri mu mategeko ba- aka ha- ri ibitabo ba- jya ba- andika ba- ka- vuga y' uko koko bemeza ko mu rwanda nta nta mwanya u- sigaye eh a- ba- giye ba- kwa -iye ku- ba- shakira imyanya hanze kandi u- ra- zi y' uko umuntu wese aba a- fite uburenganzira mu gihugu cye ahubwo iyo i gihugu ki- buze aho ki- tuza abantu ki- ba- shakira uko ki- bi- genza . ||| you know that every has has right in his or her country , in fact if the country has nowhere to settle its people , it looks for a solution .
nko ka- umva mbese nka radio rtlm ya- vuga -aga abantu ba- y- umva . ||| you would hear radio stations like rtlm saying such things like while people are listening .
nti- bi- igeze biba -ho . n- ka- n- jya -e rero n- ka- vuga nti icyo ni ni ni n' ikintu kibi cyane kandi ki- ra- ba- hama . bande ? abantu ba kiliziya , ||| these things did not happen , like me saying that it is a bad thing or the church .
abantu kiliziya , abantu ba kiliziya . ariko u- ra- umva ntabwo n- vuze ngo kiliziya gatorika ku- sa n- vuze abantu ba kiliziya n- vuga ; a- ba- yi- vuga -ir ba- ba ba- kwa -iye kuba ba- ra- geze igihe ba- vuga bati ibi sibyo . ||| but you see that i have not said the catholic church only , i 'm saying the church as a whole , those who speak for the church should have , at a certain point said no.
iyo u- bi- genzuye rero n' u- ku- andika udupapurooo tu- ta ariko nta kintu ki- umvikana ki- hamya ki- gira kiti twebwe aa kiliziya gatorika cyangwa se tu- vuga -e mbese n' abakirisitu ngo tu- vuga -e ngo ni missionni iyi n' iyi cyangwa se n' abapadiri ba- koze inama , cyangwa se n' abakristu ba- koze inama ba- geze uru uru mubya haru bwo ba- jya ba nka nka nka nk' ingendo zo kwamagana ikintu ngo wu- n- va -e ko abapadiri n' abakristu n' abantu ba- gize ba- n- ri ba- gize mani manifeste , ba- gize ikintu cyo ku- jya kwamagana a- ha- garagara ibintu ba- raye ba- umvise muri radio , nti- bi- igeze biba -ho . ||| when you take a close look , they were small writings but nothing solid reflecting that the catholic church or christians that a particular mission or that priests or christians had a meeting or a walk to show that priest , christians or other people manifested it , no one went and stood up against what they had previously heard on the radio .
ni bene nk' icyo kintu nicyo . naho ngana -ish rero y' uko kiliziya ka- turika wenda muri ru- sanga -e na no kubategetsi bayo . aho hantu ha- buze ikintu cy' ubutwari , cyo ku- erura . ||| what i am saying is that the catholic church and their leadership were not brave .
yezu ya ya ya ya- jya -aga yaya ya- sanga -aga ba- ba ba- n- tu- za hekaru a- ka- fata , a- ka- fata imigozi a- ka- kubita abantu ati insengero ry' ima -an ; ahubwo bi- ciye abantu mu masengero eh tu- ra- ceceka tu- ri- ruka ku- sa . uh tu- ri- ruka ku- sa . ||| jesus would whip those who made the house of god unholy , in fact they killed people from churches and we simply kept quiet and run away .
simvuga ngo nt' abantu ba kiliziya babaya abatagatifu , simvuga ngo nt' abantu ba kilizi ; mbese ba- ri -ho no mu basenyeri ba- ri -ho , ba- ri -ho ba- bi- zize no mu byo n- andika bi- ri -mo . ||| i am not saying that there are no people in the church that were holy , they are there including amongst the bishops , there are those who rejected it and it 's there in what i write .
ha- ri a- ba- vuze neza nka musenyeri bigirumwami tu- ra- mu- zi n' abandi benshi ariko muri ru- sanga -e nicyo n- gaya ; ||| there are those who clearly said it like bishop bigirumwami and many others but in general that is what i despise .
tu- vuga -e nko muri kiliziya ka- turika ikindi na ha- ri abakosheje by' ukuri ariko bo n' abantu , n' abantu . aho rero ha- ri ikintu nyine u- rebye tu- ba tu- rebye mpora n- bi- vuga tu- naniwe . twebwe n- ri- shyira -mo kuko n- n- jya -e ndi umuntu wa ka- turika kandi ndi umusaseridoti . ||| there are others in the catholic church who did wrong things but they are human beings , this is where i always say we failed including myself because i am a catholic and a bishop .
uh tu- naniwe ; tu- ba tu- ra- gize nka petero mutagatifi tuti tu- ka- rira tuti tu- naniwe umwanya wacu uh . ||| we failed , we could have been like saint peter and cried that we have failed in our place .
n- igeze ku- vuga muri radio hamba -ir -e ba- tu- baza , n- ra- vuga nti umva rero umuntu a- ku- shinze ubushyo n- ra- vuga kiliziya ka- turika , ||| i once spoke on the radio when we were being asked , i said that if someone ... meaning the catholic church ... they killed people while we were watching and what did we do ?
wishi a- ku- shinze ubushyo i- ki- rura ki- kaza ki- ka- bu- rya , i- ki- rura ni ni n' iki ki- baye nyine . abo bose ba- ishe abantu tu- reba tu- gira tu- ta -e . iyo u- naniwe ku- ki- rwanya wenda ngo ki- na- ku- ica -e wa wu- n- ri u- ku- size inka iyo u- ki- bonye u- ki- ru- kira nta nta zi- n- ri y- ongera ku- ku- shinga . ||| if you fail to fight it until maybe it even kills you , the one who left you with his cow , whenever he sees you and you run away , will never leave with others again .
n- i- bura a- vuga ko u- ri ikigwari twekuvuga ko , ||| at least he says you are useless , let 's not say anything more .
twekuvuga ibindi bi- kabije . aho ni -ho n- vuga ko yenda uruhare rwa kiliziya ru- baye kandi ha- ri ikintu cyagayitse mu by' ukuri bi- ra- garagara . nti- n- zi niba ha- ri iki si n- ta- keka ko nta kintu n- ka- ongera ki- renze ibyo . ||| this is where i can say the role of the catholic church was and it was something which was openly rebuked .
bi- genda -aga bi- ca abantu hirya no hino bi- ha- urira -an n' ukuntu n- ra- za ku- bi- vuga no mu kanya nyine ; iby' inyenzi zi- ra- je n' iki . ||| they used to go killing people here and there and there is a way they referred to them , i will talk about it in a few minutes , what did they mean by the cockroaches are coming ?
ba- tangira ku- ica abantu hirya no hino u- bona ko ha- ri -mo kwimenyereza ku- gira ngo ba- reba -e niba ba bi- kunda niba ha- ri uwabitinyuka , niba ntacyo bi- twara , ||| they started killing people here and there and you could see that they are training to see it if can be possible , if there is someone who could do it without fear , if it would have no consequences or if it can actually happen .
niba bi- fata . uko n- vuga mu magambo make rero , repubulika za mbere zombi zakurikije gahunda y' abakoroni ziranazuzuza zi- genda za- igana -ish muri genocide . ||| how i can say in few words then , at first both republicans followed the plan of colonialists and fulfilled it and went on towards genocide .
bi- vuga ku- vangura k' umunya , umututsi a- ta- ri umunyarwanda kandi ko a- kwa -iye ku- pfa . ||| it means to separate rwandans , a tutsi is not rwandan and that he has to die .
kandi rero ba- bi- shyira -ho rero uburyo ba- mu- vuga uko a- meze , ko a- ri mubi , ku buryo bwose ba- mu- shyira -ho ukuntu a- ri umuntu mubi cyane ba- ra- bi- igisha bi- jya mu nyigisho zose tu- zi ariko zi- kaza zi- kaza zi- kaza zi- kaza za- umva -ish ko a- ta- kwa -iye kuba -ho . ||| and then they came up with a way of talking about him , the way he is , that he is bad , in all the ways they painted him to be a bad person and they taught it to others and it went into all kind of teachings that we know but they come to make it understandable that he does n't deserve to live .
mbese n- vuga ko a- ri aho bi- geze mu magambo n- vuze mu magambo make cyane . ||| basically i can say that that 's where it reached in few words .
eh aho kuri za repubulika mpafite ikibazo . iyo u- rebye repubulika ya mbere n' iya ka- y- ibanda . ||| i have a question on the republics , when you look at the first republic and the one of kayibanda .
ka- yi- bana ya- hawe ubutegetsi u- rebye n' ababirigi b' abakoroni . ka- y- ibanda ntabwo ya- maze -ho igihe habyarimana a- ra- mu- hirika . ||| kayibanda was given power by the belgian colonialists . kyibanda was there for some time then habyarimana toppled him .
noneho n- jya -e ikintu ahangaha n- shaka ku- sa nk' umuntu u- hoze ariko n- rebye n' ibi n' ubuzima muri genocide icyenda na kane , ha- ri ukuntu ka- y- ibanda ya- hawe ubutegetsi n' ababirigi a- ka- yobora -an n' ababirigi ariko habyarimana a- je a- geze ku butegetsi , ||| then the only thing i want here as someone who was there but when i look at this and the life in the genocide of 1994 , there is a way kayibanda was given the power but he would rule with them but when habyarimana come to power , when he toppled it .
aho a- bu- hirika -iye we u- baye -ho umuntu u- banye n' abafaransa . ||| he had lived with french people .
n' ibintu bibiri ; ababirigi nibo ba- sa n' abantu ba cree ikintu cyo cy' urwangano mu banyarwanda haza -mo amacacubiri abantu ba- tangira ku- ryana . ||| there are two things ; belgians look like the people who created that thing of hatred among rwandese , conflicts started and people started fighting each other .
noneho nyuma ya repubulika ya ka- y- ibanda ha- ri ukuntu bi- na- cecetse u- bona ko rwose ububiligi bu- sa nkaho nta kintu bu- koze mu rwanda ahubwo noneho habyarimana a- zana ubutegetsi nabwo bu- ri -mo ibintu by' amayobera n' ubugome bwinshi ariko a- banye n' abafaransa a- ri nabo baje ku- gira uruhare mu mu myiteguro ya genocide muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 94 ) . ||| then after the republic of kayibanda there is a way it went quiet and you could see that the belgians had done nothing as if they had completely done nothing in rwanda and then habyarimana brought some leadership which was strange with a lot of cruelty but in good terms with the french who are the ones who in the end played a role in the preparation of genocide of 1994 .
kuburyo n' uyu munsi u- bona ikintu cy' ubufaransa aricyo ki- hawe ubugome bwabo cyangwa se no ku- fatanya n' abantu ku- tegura genocide nibyo bi- hawe intebe cyane ku- rusha ababiligi kandi aribo ba- zanye ikintu n- vuga ko aribo ba- zanye biriya bintu . ||| in a way , up to today you see how the french were malicious or being part of the people who were planning the genocide is what is seen more than the belgians yet they are the ones who brought it all .
ibyo nta kintu u- bi- tu- bwira -ho . ||| is there anything you can say about that ?
eh icyo n' iki n' ikibazo cyiza rwose kuko n- jya -aga n- bi- tekereza cyane . ||| that 's really a good question because i used to think about it a lot .
koko ababiligi ba- maze ku- tsindwa kubu ku bukoroni nyine babwambuwe , abazungu ba- giye b' abategetsi . ||| it 's true after the belgians were defeated during colonialism ; it was taken away from them , the white leaders left .
abafaransa barabi ba- shaka kubiganzura . mbese ba- shaka ku ku- ta- bu- tanga bwose . ||| the french wanted to take over . basically they did n't want to give it all up .
naho abafaransa ba- fite amayeri y' uko na ibihugu byose ba- giye ba bakoroniza , ba- yi- tanga ba- ta- yi- tanze . ba- ra- yi- tanga ariko rero ba- shyira -ho ikintu ki- sa nk' ikityo cyabo , ||| even if the french have many tricks , all the countries they colonised they gave them up without truly giving them up .
ki- sa nk' ikiganza cyabo ba- ta- jya ki- hora ; ||| they put something which seemed like their hand that was always there .
ba- ka- sanga nyine akomo . ||| they looked for something the belgians seemed to have failed at , that is how i view it .
u- ra- bona ibihugu byose byakoronijwe n' abafaransa , ||| but the french people worked together with habyarimana and even others .
ba- ra- yi- tanga kandi ba- ka- yi- tanga ba- ta- yi- tanze . ba- ka- shaka ikintu ababiligi ba- ri bashushe nkaho batsinzwe niko n- bi- umva . ariko abafaransa ba- fatanya na habyarimana ndetse n' abandi mu by' ukuri abafaransa uko bi- meze n' abanyabwenge ba- tanga , ||| truly french people , the way it is , are wise who are generous .
ababiligi ba- tanze independence ba- sa nkaho ba- yi- tanze bi- rangiye baragendakizatuma ba- hora ba- ha- ri , ba- za- yi- koresha abategetsi b' abirabura cyangwa se bo muri asia kuko naho ha- ri abategetsi ariko ba- ha- ri . ||| when belgians granted independence it looked like they have given it out and nothing behind it but there would be something that would keep them around , they used the black leaders or the ones from asia because there are leaders but they were still there too .
hano rero mu rwanda no mu bu- ru- n- ri no muri congo ndetse . ||| here and in burundi and in congo as well .
ababiligi kuko a- ri agahugu ka- toye ba- yi- tanze ba- yi- tanze ariko abafaransa bati a non non hoya ntabwo u- shobora ku ku- gira ngo ba- genda -e bi- rangira -e kandi congo i- ri -mo ibi i- ri -mo amafunguro . ||| because belgium is a small country when they granted it they meant it but the french were thought that you can n't just let them go just like that yet congo has riches .
ba- ra- za ba- ra- ba- simbura rero , abafaransa rero ba- shaka ukuntu ba- simbura ababiligi ahari ururimi rw' igifaransa ku- gira ngo ba- ba- omeka -e ku bi- n- ri bihugu by' abafaransa nyine . ||| they came and replaced them , the french wanted a way of replacing belgians because of the french language so as to add them on other french countries .
noneho rero noneho tu- subira -e nyine mu tu- sa -e nk' aho tu- sanze n' abakoroni na n' ibihugu byo bya koronijwe n' abafaransa bya kera . ||| so let 's go back to colonialism and the countries that were colonized by french long ago .
u- ra- umva nu ni nk' akantu kuko ba- simbuye ababiligi ariko ku- gira ngo bekutureka ngo tugende . ||| it 's like they replaced belgians so that they do n't just let us go .
ni nk' aho mbese ba- simbuye kandi nti- ba- bi- umvikanye -ho uuhh pardon !! nti- ba- bi- umvikanye -ho n' ubungubu ndetse baracyahigitse . ||| it 's as if they replaced them yet they had n't agreed on it . they did n't agree on that and even up to now they still argue on that .
iteka n' iyo tu- ta- umvikana n' abafaransa burya ababiligi nti- ba- bi- anze cyane , bi- tuma ba- garuka bati mwadutwaye imbehe . ||| actually whenever we disagree with the french , belgians do n't mind it , it makes them come back saying they got they took their place .
ngirango niko n- jya -e n- bi- umva nti- n- bi- tekereje cyane . ||| i guess that 's how i understand , it i did n't really think much about it .
ababiligi ba- ragiye ariko abafaransa ba- anga ku nk' uko ba- ta- igeze ba- gira iyo ba- jya rwose ariko ba- gira bati noneho ubwo ababiligi ba- giye reka na kariya kantu tu- ka- subiza -e mu mufuka wacu . ||| belgians left but the french refused since they did not go anywhere at all , instead they said this time since belgians are leaving . let 's put that little thing back in our pockets .
w' aba francophone mbese . ||| basically the francophone 's .
ba- bwira habyarimana bati uu i- cya mbere wowe u- ri umwana muto , n' igifaransa wa mugabo we . ||| they told habyarimana that first all you are still young , it 's french language now .
baramwiyegereza baramuryoshyaryoshya ba- ra- za ba- ra- mu- ha bati ngwino . ||| they got close to him and convienced himto come .
ikindi rero humura ni n' ubwenge bu- giye kuza rero ba- gira bati ikindi rero n' u- ku- rwanya abatutsi nibo ba- ri ku- anga ku- tanga independence nta ki- n- ri , bi- ri byoroshye . ||| they told him not to worry that they were bringing wisdom and they were going to fight against the tutsi , they are the ones who do n't want to grant independence and there is nothing else , it was easy .
habyarimana nawe ya ya ntacyo ya- ba- rwanya -aga -ho kuko ya- gira -aga ati muri abantu beza , tu- vuga igifaransa . ||| habyarimana as well had nothing against them because he used to say that you are nice people , we speak french .
ngirango n' uko abafaransa ba- simbuye ababiligi ku- gira kandi ba- ka- tu- twara muri abo ba francophone habyarimana a- ka- bi- i- shimira ba- ka- mu- ha amata n- gira ngo niko n- bi- umva . uhh ||| i think it 's because french people replaced belgians and made us francophones . habyarimana was pleased with them and they would give him all he needed , that 's how i understand it .
ha- ri ikindi kintu ba- kunda abantu ba- kunda ku- vuga kuri ka- y- ibanda cyane kuba ya- ra- fatanya -ije n' abazungu ko we a- ta- ri umunyarwanda a- ka- ba ku- ica aba abanyarwanda ntacyo bi- ri bi- mu- bwiye . ||| there is something else that people say so often about kayibanda . the fact that he worked together with white people , that he was not rwandese and killing rwandans meant nothing to him .
noneho yitwaza icyo kintu cyo ku- teranya abahutu n' abatutsi a- fatanya -ije n' abazungu . ||| then he used it to bring conflicts among the hutu and tutsi with the help of the white man .
ka- y- ibanda koko ntabwo ya- ri umunyarwanda ? ||| kayibanda was really not rwandan .
nti- ya- ri umututsi nti- ya- ri n' umuhutu kuko a- ta- ri umunyarwanda . ||| he was neither tutsi nor hutu because he was not rwandan .
ku- ba- teranya rero akabaryamishya a- fatanya -ije n' abazungu , we n- umva ntacyo bi- ba bi- mu- twaye . ||| to start conficts among themselves , with help of white people , i think it was fine with him .
ntacyo bi- ri bi- mu- twaye ariko u- ra- umva nti nti- ya- ri ku- vuga ko nti- bi- ri byoroshye ku- gira ngo a- vuga -e ngo nd' umunyamahanga n- je ku- teranya wenda we niwe u- ri- ku- gira ati nawe n- tu- ri umunyarwanda ibyo byo , ||| it was fine with him but , he was n't going to say it because it would not be easy to say he was a foreigner and he is bringing conflicts .
ya- gomba -aga ku- bi- hisha ngirango . ||| maybe he is the one who would be the one to say that you are not rwandan too however , he was supposed to hide that i think .
wenda nti nti- ya- ra- bi- anze nti yara ariko nti- n- zi niba kuba ya- ra- vuye i bukavu aribyo bi- ri bi- mu- himbaje . ||| maybe he did n't mind it but i do n't think the fact that he was from bukavu was enough for him .
eh si -ho n- vuga . ||| that 's what i 'm saying .
n- ra- vuga ko we y- umva -aga ko i- cya mbere nti- ya- ri umuhutu nti- ya- ri n' umututsi . ||| i am saying that he felt like first of all he was not hutu neither was he tutsi .
ku- teranya abanyarwanda a- fatanya -ije n' abazungu , kuri we y- umva -aga abanyarwanda ba- mara -an -ye ntacyo bi- mu- twaye . bi- ba ... ||| to create conflicts with the help of the white man , for him he felt that even if all rwandans killed , each other it would be ok with him .
oya si wewe u- shatse u- bi- vuga ariko ngirango sicyo cy' ingenzi muby' ukuri , sicyo cy' ingenzi , sicyo cy' ingenzi . ||| no , it 's not him . if you want you can say it but i think it 's not the important thing really , it 's not important .
ngirango abatutsi , hinga n- ku- bwira -e impamvu cyane cyane abatutsi icyo yabangiye . ||| i guess tutsi , let me tell you the good reason especially why he disliked the tutsi .
ise ya- ra- je a- ha- kwa kwa bi- rasa , wenda ba- mu- fashe nabi , bi- ra- shoboka ko a- fite ikintu cyo ku- vuga ko abatutsi ba- mu- suzuguye . vuga uwo mututsi wenda u- mu- twaye cyangwa se u- mu- hatse simbizi . ||| his dad came and served birasa , maybe he was mistreated , it 's possible that he has something against the tutsi who disrespected him , maybe the tutsi who his chief or his master , i do n't know .
ikindi rero ha- ri ikintu mu by' ukuri ka- y- ibanda ya- tumye y- anga abatutsi n' uko mu- ta- bi- zi ya- rwaye ikintu , n- ra- bi- zi ya- gize amateka mabi mw' ishuli ya- rwara -aga isundwe u- ra- umva . ka- yi- ba n- ra- bi- zi byo ka- y- ibanda ya- rwara -aga isundwe . ibyo ku- anga abatutsi byo bi- fite ikintu bi- turuka -ho . ||| another thing , there is something that made kayibanda hate the tutsi , only that you do n't know but he suffered from something , i know he had bad background in the school , he suffered from ............... , you can imagine ...... the hatred of tutsis had it 's origin .
ya- rwara -aga isundwe , hanyuma rero isundwe ku mw' ishuli ariko ibyo nti- n- zi si byo si nti- bi- ri bi- kwiriye ku- vuga -w ahangaha . ||| he was sick of ........ , then that sickness of ..... in school but that one i 'm not sure if it was supposed to be mentioned here .
ya- rwara -aga isundwe hanyuma ba- ba bityo ntabwo a- ri byiza cyane . ||| he used to fall sick of ..... but then really it 's not something good .
icyo n- zi n' uko mw' ishuli padiri , ba musenyeri pelode ndi padiri ii n- ra- mu- zi n- sa nkaho n- mu- tegetse n- n- jya -e kera . ||| what i know is that in school , the priest , the bishops , i am a priest so i know peraudin it 's like i was his boss some time back .
ikintu cyo ku- suzugura ya- racya- n- gaga rero . ||| he really did n't like being disrespected .
ku- vuga rero ng' abatutsi ba- ra- suzugura n' ikintu igihe cy' ubukoroni ki- ri ki- ra- kwa -iye , ba- ra- ki- kwa -ije ngo abatutsi barasuzura , icyo kintu ya- racya- n- gaga rero . ||| so to say that the tutsi used to be disrespectful is something that was common in the time of colonialism , they spread it all over that the tutsi were disrespectful , so he did n't like it .
ku- vuga rero ngo ya- ra- ba- teranya -ije ngo ni ni bene rubanda , ||| that 's why he created conflicts among them , saying he is not part of them and they are actually not even his brothers , so let them all die .
awa n' ubundi sibene mama ba- ra- ka- shira . erega nago na habyarimana u- bi- shatse u- bi- vuga ibyo kibazo ba- ra- ki- vuga . erega nawe n' umunyamahanga nimba u- ta- bi- zi , nawe n' umufumbira . ||| any way , if you want you can even say that with habyarimana , those issues are mentioned . he is also a foreigner if you do n't know , he is a mufumbira .
ese u- ri u- zi -ko a aba ijambo ubufumbira , a u- zi -ko abakozi bo mu gikoni b' abatetsi ba- ba- ita abafumbira . ||| did you know the meaning of the word mufumbira , do you know that the kitchen helpers who are cooks are called the bafumbira .
byatuuruutseee ( a- ra- seka ) kuri se wa habyarimana . ||| it started with his father , he came from the bufumbira land and came as a cook of the priests , it went on and that 's how they called them bafumbira .
ya- vuye i bufumbira a- za a- ri umukozi wo mu gikoni cy' abapadiri eh bi b' i- rambura ba ba- ba- ita abafumbira batyo ni ba bakozi ba- itwa abafuuumbiiira ( a- ra- seka ) bib' ufumbira . ||| they are helpers called bafumbiras from bufumbira .
wa u- shatse u- vuga nawe ngo ngo ya- teranya -ije abanyarwanda kuko a- ta- ri umunyarwanda ariko ibyo n' u- ku- kabya , n' u- ku- kabya . ||| if you want you can also say that brought conflicts among rwandans because he 's not rwandan but that would be exaggerating .
ya- ra- ba- teranya -ije mu by' ukuri kugirango a- bona -e ubutegetsi , nta ntawabivuga ngo ya- bi- gize kuko nti- i- anze ko abanyarwanda bi- cana . ||| he actually brought conflicts so he can have the power , no one can say that he did because he did n't go against the killings among rwandans .
n- jya -e nti- n- menya ko iyo a- ri -yo mpamvu y' ukuri . ||| i too can n't tell if that 's the true reason .
n- jya -e simbyemeza rwose . eh ||| i can n't confirm that .
ngirango mwakomeza mu- tu- bwira ku bitero by' impunzi a- ba- zize ku- itwa ibyitso byazo ese byo baje ku- genda bite ? ||| i think you can go on telling us about the attacks of the refugees . the ones who died because of being called their agents , how did it go ?
ngirango nabyo bi- ba bi- ri mubyukuri jenocide nyirizina ya mirongo icyenda na kane .... ||| i think even that would be part of it , truly , the genocide of 1994 itself ...

bagasinya badasinye u- sanga a- rusha mbese mubyukuri a- ri -yo yasukumye imbarutso ............ indege ya habyarimana ba- hanuye u- rebye rero simbizi u- rebye nti- n- zi uwayihanuye niba ya- garagara ariko nagirango aho ku- anga tu- vuze za mpunzi za- shatse ku- subira mugihugu bi- ka- nanira zi- ka- shyira -ho ingufu ba- ka- shaka ukuntu ingufu zi- ta- kora ba- ka- shyira -ho imishyikirano nayo bi- ka- gera igihe imishyikirano ba- y- anze ba- gira bati nti tu- sangira n' impunzi nti tu- sangira n' inkotanyi reka noneho tu- shaka -e ukuntu tu- zi- nesha .... n- ba- zi- fasha ibyitso byazo bi- ri ariko imbarutso yabyo rero nuku n- ba- zi- fasha ba- n- ri naya mashyaka . ||| they signed without signing ; basically you find that arusha is the one that pushed the trigger ..... so the plane of habyarimana which was blown up i really do n't know who did it wish he could be known but i wanted that instead of the refugees that wanted to go back in the country and it could n't happen and they applied force then they looked for a way force should not be used and they started peace talk which also reached a point and they rejected it saying that they can n't share with refugees , we can n't share with inkotanyi so let 's look for a way of defeating them .... with those who help them and their agents . but its starting point then is cause even the others who help them are these political parties .
tudahuje ...... ariko imbarutso yabyo ni ugutikuramo iturufu y' indege ya habyarimana uwayigize rero simuzi ariko uwo muntu a- gomba -e kuba a- riwe u- shaka -aga yuko ku- turitsa isasu rya mbere rya jenocide yeeeeeeeeeeee . ||| .... but the trigger of it all is the pretext of the plane of habyarimana , i do n't know who did it but whoever it is must have been the one who wanted to bust the first bullet of the genocide ...

bi- umvikana ko ibyo bisasu bi- ri bi- ishe bamwe muri bo ba- ri ba- ra- hungiye -mo . ba- tangiye ku- ta- tana ba- vuye -mo bamwe ba- ri hepfo abandi haruguru abandi bi- ruka bi- ra- umvikana ba- ri batewe . tu- ra- ha- geze abatapfuye tu- ka- bi- ca , ||| we found that some had already died because of the bombs .
abandi bagatemagurwa abandi ba- ka- kubita -w u- bu- ha- i- ri , ||| so we started killing others using machetes , clubs . honestly one has to say that .
mbese muri ru- sanga -e abanyarwanda ba- ri bi- hishe muri icyo ki- ha -e b' abatutsi ba- ra- ishwe ku buryo bu- garagara , ku buryo bi- ta- ri ibanga . n- n- jya -e rero nk' umunyarwanda u- ri u- ha- geze n- itaba -ir -iye ubwicanyi , nta ki- n- ri ki- ri ki- n- jyanye bi- umvikana -e . ||| that time the tutsis were killed very harshly and the truth must be said .
n' ubwo ha- ri -ho ubuyobozi bu- ri bu- n- jyanye , ariko bi- garagara ko n- geze -yo , ||| i was also there with the intension of killing and i should say that i also participated and i killed an old man using a club .
ndetse n- ka- gira uruhare ku- geza ubwo n- bi- funga -iye -w imyaka itandatu . n- funga -iye -w ko aho ngaho i nti- arama n- hishe umuntu w' umusaza mu- kubise u- bu- ha- i- ri muri icyo gitero n- giye -mo . ||| for that reason i was imprisoned for six years .
noneho bi- rangiye intambara i- baye nk' i- ha- gaze ho gatoya haba -ho i- hunga , ||| after all that , there was stability in the country once again so we had to flee and we went into exile .
tu- hungutse ubuyobozi tu- sanze mu gihugu bu- ra- n- funga , banyagiriza ko n- ri n- ragiye a- honga -ho i nti- arama . ||| when we returned the country i was imprisoned by the current government because i had participated in the massacre that took place in murambi .
n- bi- emera nk' umunyarwanda u- giye yo koko , n- garagaza ukuri kw' icyaha n- koze n- ta- ki- ciye ku ruhande , ndetse n- garagaza n' abo tu- ki- fatanya -ije . n- gamije kugirango ukuri ku- garagara -e , ||| later , i admitted and i said the truth on what i did in murambi and the people i was with .
kuko kuba abantu ba- ra- pfuye ba- ra- ishwe kandi ba- icwa n' abandi banyarwanda , bi- ri n- gomba -w rero ko n- garagaza uruhare rwanjye . nk' ubu rero n- icaye ahangaha nk' umuntu u- ciye i- n- bera -e y' ubutabera , ariko n- bu- ca i- n- bera -e n- i- rega n- emera icyaha cyanjye n- koze , ||| i had no objection to letting the truth out , because people died and they were killed by their fellow rwandans , so i felt that it was my responsibility to say the truth about it .
ndetse n- garagaza n' abo tu- ki- fatanya -ije . n- za ku- ca i- n- bera -e y' urukiko rumpa igahano cy' imyaka irindwi , ku- geza kuri iyi saha n- ra- ki- rangije ; n- funguwe na ririya tangazo rya perezida wa repubulika , ||| i was judged and sentenced to seven years imprisonment but i had already admitted and i had said the truth on what happened and the people i was with and i was released after that rule that was given by the president .
ariko n- fungurwa n' igihano n- ra- ki- rangije . ku- sa bi- ta- vuze y' uko n- ibagiwe icyaha n- koze cy' uko n- ba n- kubise impiri umusaza umwe mu gitondo n- ri n- ri -mo i nti- arama a- honga -ho . ||| but it does not mean that i have forgotten what i did .
nkamwica , n- ka- bi- funga -ir -w n- ka- bi- saba -ir imbabazi . n- ka- ba n- iteguye isaha n' isaha ku- garagaza ukuri kw' icyaha n- koze . kuko a- ha- n- i- ni nta ki- n- ri n- mara -ir ubutabera uretse kubwereka ukuri ku bi- baye nk' umunyarwanda u- ri u- ha- i- bereye . ||| i remember very well that i killed that old man on that morning when i was in ntarama and i am always ready to say the truth of what happened in ntarama .
uretse icyo gitero cy' i nti- arama nta bi- n- ri bitero u- ba u- ra- igeze witabira ? ||| besides the ntarama attacks , did you participate in any other attacks ?
uretse icyo gitero cy' i nti- arama ntabwo aricyo cyonyine ubwo ni bibiri , ha- ri ikindi gitero n- ba- n- je ku- vuga cy' i nyarunazi centre n- ba- n- je ku- vuga ki- guye -mo ba- ri bantu n- vuze i- n- bera -e , haruguru ; n' icyo gitero cy' i nti- arama ku kiliziya . ||| that centre , but i participated by giving them support like bringing back people who were trying to escape and others would kill them .
ubwo ni ibitero bibiri n- garagaye -mo . mu by' ukuri mu gitero cy' i nyarunazi nta ru- hara -e n- gize mu ku- ica umuntu , ariko n- gize uruhare mu bufatanyacyaha bwa sensibilisation , ||| but i believe that i would also have killed them myself if the people i sent them to had not killed them .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo ku- tera ingufu abandi . ni u- ku- vuga ngo niba umuntu a- ciye hariya n- ka- ba n- ra- mu- hize undi a- ka- mu- kubita u- bu- ha- i- ri , a- ha- n- i- ni ninjye u- ba waramwishe . ibyo rero ku- bi- i- rega ni byiza kuko wenda iyo n- ta- hagarara hariya , ||| i should admit i did terrible things by stopping these people maybe if i had not stopped them they would have escaped and be able to survive .
ya- ri ku- ha- mena -ir a- ka- hita a- ka- hunga . ariko kuba n- ri mpahagaze bi- garagara nk' umwicanyi . ku- sa uruhare rwanjye n- ru- gize i nti- arama kumugaragaro , ubwo n- ica -aga uwo muntu mu- kubise u- bu- ha- i- ri . ||| i still admit that i participated in the genocide in public and killed someone using a club .
bi- garagara y' uko ibyo a- ri byo byose ibitero bi- baye byinshi , ariko wemera ko ... ko witabiriye ibitero bibiri ku- sa , icy' i nti- arama ni icy' i nyarunazi kubera iki ibindi u- ta- bi- itaba -ir -aga ? ||| it 's proven that there were several areas , which were attacked . but you participated in only two ; that of ntarama and nyarunazi . why did n't you participate in several others ?
mu byukuri i nti- arama ... ntabwo n- menye uwo a- ri we . ||| sincerely speaking in ntarama ... i never knew who it was .
impamvu n- ta- menye uwo a- ri we , i nti- arama ha- hungiye abantu benshi cyane . ||| and the reason why i did know him , in ntarama several people gathered there ... to be sincere , they were very many and i guess while fleeing they never remembered to carry there identity cards for one to tell who was who .
kandi mu by' ukuri abantu ba- ri ba- ha- ri ntabwo n- bashije kuba wenda ... nti- n- zi ko ha- ri n' uwahunganaga indangamuntu kuburyo u- mu- kora mu mufuka wenda u- maze no kumwica . ||| well sometimes after killing someone , one would check in the dead body 's pocket expecting to get something but no one would check in pockets with an intetion of getting the id to know who was who or where he was coming from .
yenda u- shobora no ku- i- shakira udufaranga . u- shobora kumwica u- mara kumwica u- ka- ba u- kora mu mufuka ugirango u- reba -e i- ki- ku- tunga bi- ra- shoboka . ariko ibyo nti- bi- baye -ho wenda ngo mbe n- ra- menye ; ||| the main theem was killing .
ni naka w' i bu- n- aka haba -aga -ho ku- ica ku- sa . kubera ko intego ya- ri u- ku- mara -ho ntabwo .... ku- shaka ibyangombwa ntabwo bi- ri bi- fite agaciro , agaciro bi- ri u- ku- ica umuntu tu . ||| and our motto was to finish the ethenic of tutsi ... looking for ids by then , was nosense .
kubera ko u- ri wo mugambi . ||| point was in killing only because that was the deal .
nta mpamvu wu- n- va ya- ba ya- ra- baye mbere ya genocide , ukurikije y' uko ubutegetsi bu- ri bu- ri -ho bwashishikarizaga abantu ikintu cy' amacakubiri , ||| do n't you think that there was a reason before the genocide , considering the way leaders motivated people into segregations .
ku buryo nawe u- ba u- ri u- fite akantu gato k' urwango ku bwoko bw' abatutsi igihe ... ? ||| to the extend that , if one had a bias in the tutsi would ... ?
ubundi nkurikije iriya nti- ambara nk' umuntu wabikurikiye kandi narinshiye a- kenga -e n- ri mukuru . ||| if i consider that war ... as a person who followed up everything yet i was mature by then .
abantu tu- ri tu- turanye tu- bana -aga mu mahoro nta rwango n- ri mfitiye abatutsi , kuko tu- ri tu- mara -an -ye imyaka makumyabiri n' umwe y' amavuko , tu- ri tu- banye mu mahoro . ||| we live in peace with our neighbours . i did not have any hatred for tutsis because i had lived with them in peace for twenty @-@ one years .
ku- sa bi- jya ku- komera intandaro u- rebye yo kugirango abantu ba- pfa -e aha ahantu tu- tuye , igihe ha- vuga -w -aga ko habyarimana ya- ba ya- pfuye inzangano za- hereye kuri uwo munsi cyane cyane . ||| but the main cause for the killing of people who were living in that area was the death of habyarimana .
u- ka- sanga ba- ri udututsiko ubundi abandi mbese akoba ka- je mu ba- tu- raga -e . ||| we sensed segregation among people that particular day .
noneho kubera ko abanyarwanda benshi ba- umva -aga ko ba- kunze umubyeyi wabo , ndetse n' ubuyobozi bu- ka- bi- gira -mo uruhare ba- ka- umvikana -ish ngo perezida wanyu ya- pfuye kandi y- ishwe n' abatutsi ni u- ku- haguruka rero namwe mu- ka- mu- rengera . kubw' ibyo rero n- jya -e nta rwango n- ri mfitiye abatutsi , ku- sa intandaro ya- baye igihe gito cyane ki- jyanye n' iryo hanuka ry' indege ya habyarimana ba- vuga ko ya- pfuye . ||| people started joining different groups where they believed they belonged and started looking at tutsis as enemies because they had been told by their leaders that "@ their beloved father @" had been killed by the tutsis .
u- rebye ni -ho ku- pfa kwabo ku- gize ingufu , gusansibilizwa kwabo kugirango ba- icwa -e abayobozi ba- bi- gize -mo ingufu cyae cyane aho habyarimana a- pfa -ir -iye ||| and so you should stand up and defend him .
u- tu- bwiye ko ubu u- fite imyaka 31 bi- shaka ku- vuga yuko mu ki- ha -e cya genocide u- ri u- fite imyaka 21 kuko imyaka 10 i- ra- shize . ||| you have told us that you are thirty @-@ one years old . that means that you were about twenty @-@ one years old by then , because 10 years have passed .
ese mu ki- ha -e cya mbere ya genocide ha- igeze kuba -ho ibihe by' amashyaka ; ||| well before the genocide there used to be several political parties .
u- ba u- ri u- ri mu- ri- ha -e shyaka ? ||| can you tell us the one you belonged to ?
iby' amashyaka u- bi- umvise ku- ta -e nk' umuntu w' umusore u- ri u- ki- fite imbaraga wu- n- va -aga u- shobora ku- itaba -ir ibintu nk' ibyo bi- ri bi- fite imbaraga mu gihugu ? ||| how did you receive the idea of parties , you as a mature boy who was so strong to participate in such terrible ideas forwarded by the whole country ?
ubundi nk' umuntu w' umusore icyo ki- ha -e n- ri n- fite uburenganzira busesuye , ndetse n- ra- umva nta n' itegeko ri- n- buza -aga ku- jya mu ishyaka nk' umunyarwanda . ||| yes i was old enough to join any party i wanted to join and by then i was a member of mdr . i was there as any other rwandan , and because i was illiterate ; i could not get any good post .
u- ra- umva ? ku- sa haruguru n- ba- n- je ku- ku- bwira ko nta rwango n- ri mfitiye abatutsi , ariko cya ki- ha -e cy' amashyaka a- ri nayo ntandaro y' intambara , ||| but what i know is , that party disliked the tutsis so much . i had told you that i did not have any hatred for tutsis .
amashyaka amwe n' amwe ya- genda -aga y- igisha abayoboke bayo ko umwanzi a- ri umututsi aho a- va a- ka- gera . ||| but most of these parties always taught us that the only enemy we had was a tutsi .
nonese ku bw' umwihariko m.d.r ako kantu ka- ba ka- ra- saga n- ka- ku- tera ku mu- ta- ima wenda ko nubwo u- tanze umututsi ariko umututsi a- ta- ri mwiza , ||| though you did not have any hatred for the tutsis .
ha- ri ako ya- ba ya- ra- igeze ku ku- igisha mu buryo bu- zi- guye cyangwa bu- ta- zi- guye ? ||| when mdr was teaching you how tutsis were bad people although you never used to hate them , would they teach you directly or indirectly ?
ku- sa ntabwo m.d.r ntabwo n- igeze n- jya mu manama yayo menshi cyane . ||| i did not attend most of mdr meetings .
ku- sa n- ibuka ko uwari u- yi- hagarariye witwaga sebuningo oswald u- ri u- tuye hano muri uyu mu- renga -e wa kibungo , ||| but i remember some time when sebuningo oswald ; he was the representative of the party in kibungo sector .
yi- geze ku- koresha meeting hano kuri centre ya kibungo , a- tu- igisha amatwara y' ishyaka a- tu- bwira intego zaryo n' umugambi w' ishyaka n' iki byose . ariko bi- garagara yuko bi- anze bi- kunze ha- ri uruhande ribogamiyemo kuko ri- gusha -aga ku kintu ba- ita ngo hutu . iyo hutu iyo habayeho ku- vangura ubwoko ubu n' ubu , ||| he held a meeting at kibungo centre and told us how the party operated , its objectives and motto .
u- ra- umva ko ha- ri ubundi bu- ha- ejwe bu- ta- fite ijambo muri icyo ki- ha -e . ||| but one would clearly tell that there was a bias on one group of people . and the whole meeting was about the "@ hutu . @" therefore , there was a group of people that did not have total rights .
bi- garagara ko bi- anze bi- kunze amashyaka ya- ba ya- ra- gize uruhare mu ku- tegura iriya intambara , no mu ku- y- igisha mu ba- ri abayoboke bayo . ||| thus revealing how political parties and other leaders participated in the genocide .
mu ki- ha -e cya genocide se icyo kintu cy' amashyaka mwakibonaga mu- ta -e ? ||| during the genocide what was your altitude about those political parties ?
n- subiye haruguru gatoya kiriya gitero cy' i nti- arama cyo ku itariki 15/04/1994 ki- ri igitero ki- komeye kandi ki- ri igitero ki- guye -mo abanyarwanda ... abantu benshi cyane . abanyarwanda bose ba- ri ba- ri -mo bi- hishe muri icyo kiliziya n- ra- umva nta u- vuye -mo . ||| the troop that attacked ntarama was very big and so powerful and i should say many people died in that attack .
ahari n' u- vuye -mo ni ku bwa nyagasani nti- n- zi uburyo ya- ba ya- ra- rokotse -mo , ki- guye -mo abantu benshi cyane ka- itaba -ir -w n' abantu benshi . ||| i do n't even think that there was anyone who survived .
nk' aha n- tuye nk' umuntu u- ha- vuka -iye n- tawe n- yobewe izina , ||| in case there is one , it would have been through god 's mercy .
benshi mubo tu- giye tu- jyana n- genda n- garagaza nk' amazina yabo . abo n- ibuka nk' uwo n- shinja -e witwa sehene sylivestre tu- burana -iye rimwe mu idosiye n- fite n- burana -iye -ho , ubu nawe ya- ra- buranye ya- ra- kata -iye -w . ||| i remember some of the people who we were together when we were attacking ntarama .
n- ra- ibuka uwitwa sindikubwabo gilbert , uwo nawe tu- ri kumwe nawe y- i- emera -ir ibyaha bye ya- koreye aho ngaho . n- ra- ibuka uwitwa karanga -w charles uwo nawe tu- ri tu- ri kumwe n' abandi banyarwanda benshi ba- tuye hafi ahangaha ba- i- emera -ir icyaha , ||| i accused sehene siriveste , sindikubwabo gilbert , karangwa charles , they all admit that they killed .
uretse ko wenda ba- tabonye umwanya wo ku- gira icyo ba- vuga . ||| plus so many others who have not got an opportunity to say something .
ariko n- shinja -e benshi kandi noneho icyaha ba- ra- ki- emera kuko ba- geze aho ngaho ndetse ba- garagaza uruhare rwabo . ku bw' ibyo rero ntabwo icyaha nka kiriya n- ba n- ra- ki- koze njyenyine , ||| but i accused so many people and that shows that i was not alone .
kandi ni -yo n- ba n- ri- n- ri kumwe n' abandi si n- gomba -w kugirango n- ba- hisha -ir -e . ikigamijwe n' ukuri uwo ba- ishe nta wu- n- ri musanzu n- tanga uretse ku- garagaza ukuri k' ukuntu y- ishwe n' uko n- bi- genje . ||| and i realised that there was no use of hiding the truth because that is the only thing i can do to pay the fine of what i did .
kuko igihe cy' intambara nti- n- higa -w -aga n- ri n- fite uburenganzira bwose nk' umunyarwanda w' icyo ki- ha -e . ||| during the war i was not being hunted . so , i was free as a rwandan .
ku- vuga ukuri rero ku bi- baye ni n- gomba -w , ||| therefore , i witnessed whatever happened and i feel that i should say the truth about what happened .
dore ko abanyarwanda ba- ri muri iki gihugu abenshi ni abari ba ... a- ba- rokotse nabo nta kuri ku- hagije ba- fite kuko icyo ki- ha -e ba- ra- higa -w -aga . ||| because the majority of rwandans who are in this country at present are survivors . and survivors do not know everything because they were hunted .
abandi n' abanyarwanda a- giye ba- turuka hanze y' igihugu . nabo ba- keneye amakuru kandi nta ha- n- ri ba- ya- kura uretse ku- ya- bwira -w n- ta -w -e abanyarwanda tu- ri mu gihugu icyo ki- ha -e . ||| others are rwandans who came from exile .
ndetse amahirwe a- ka- boneka mu ki- ha -e ha- ri uwiyemereye icyaha n- ka- n- jya -e u- zi ukuri koko ku bi- baye . ||| they were not here during the genocide , they are just told stories . the only alternative is us who were free by then .
n- ka- ba- bwira ukuri ku byo n- koze , ku byo n- emera , ku bo tu- fatanije ndetse no ku- bi- n- ri byose bi- jyanye n' itsembabwoko ri- baye kuri uyu mu- renga -e . ||| and fortunately some of us are ready to say the truth about what we did , about who participated , what was done and what took place during the genocide in this sector .
ha- ri -ho ikintu cyo ku- saba imbabazi no ku- emera icyaha nyine . ||| there is some thing we call ; "@ asking for forgiveness @" and what we call "@ admitting what you did . @"
none nagirango n- ku- baze , kuko ha- ri abantu bi- ca -iye -w abantu ariko ba- ta- zi a- ba- ba- ishe . icyo kintu mwaba mu- tekereza ku- ta -e uko ki- korwa mu buryo bwo ku- saba imbabazi nk' abantu ba- rokotse mu mwanya .... kuko nabo ba- ra- hemuka -iye -w muri icyo kintu ; ||| therefore , i would like to ask you about the survivor ; there are some survivors who do not know those who killed their relatives , and though they survived , they are always hurt about what happened to their people .
wowe ha- ri icyo u- ba u- ra- gerageje ku- kora wenda ku- saba imiryango y' a- ba- rokotse ba- ba ba- ri muri aka ka- ca -e imbabazi . ||| i would like to know if you ever tried , let 's say to apologise to the families of those who survived living in this area ? have you ever asked them to forgive you ?
abantu ba- rokotse ba- huye na ririya tsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba ba- ka- ri- rokoka ba- huye n' ibibazo bi- komeye cyane . ba- ra- ha- i- za -w -e bi- komeye cyane , ndetse bi- cirwa ababo , ku buryo bi- teye agahinda . ||| it is true that those people faced horrible things and they lost their people , which is very sad .
nk' umunyarwanda rero u- gize uruhare mu itsembabwoko ; umuntu n- ishe mubyukuri simuzi n' umuryango we sinywuzi . ariko ya- ri umunyarwanda , kandi umunyarwanda wese a- hagararira -w na leta . ||| personally i do not know the family of the person i killed , but since the government has the right to forgive us on behalf of those families i decided to apologise to the government and all the nationals in general .
bi- baye n- gomba -w ko n- saba imbabazi n- ri- rega n- saba imbabazi ubutabera , n' abanyarwanda bose muri ru- sanga -e . ariko by' umwihariko n- genda -aga mpura n' abanyarwanda bamwe n' abamwe aho n- ri n- funga -iye baza -aga ku- tu- sura mu magereza . ba- ri -mo uwitwa rwililiza innocent n- ra- umva ahari mu mu- zi . ||| but we always tried to apologise to different people who came to visit us in the prison like rwiheza innocent .
gutyo a- ka- garagara nk' u- hagarariye a- ba- citse ku icumu ku mu- renga -e , ||| he was like an ambassador of the survivors who live in our sector .
n- ta -w -e tu- ka- mu- bwira ibitekerezo byacu ko tu- tu- fite umugambi wo ku- saba imbabazi abo tu- hemuka -iye , tu- funzwe tu- emera icyaha , tu- saba n' imbabazi . ||| we would tell him our thoughts that we are admitting what we did and that we are ready to apologise .
ariko noneho gahunda ya leta i- ri -ho kuri ubungubu n' ubwo n- ta- shoboye ku- bona umuryango w' uwo muntu n- ba n- ra- ishe ha- ri icyo ba- ita gacaca . gacaca rero tu- teganya yuko mu ki- ha -e ki- ri i- n- bera -e gitoya aho leta izapangira gahunda y' uko i- giye ku- tangira , ||| but the government has set up a new system of judging called "@ gacaca level . @"
ko tu- za- icara , tu- ka- fata imiryango y' ingo zahigwagwa ituye ku mu- renga -e , ||| in gacaca we believe that people will come together in their home villages and make a list of families that were living there before the genocide , [ i am sure we know family per family ] .
nta na umwe tu- ta- zi urugo ku rundi . ||| then we will count .
tu- vuga ngo abantu ba- ri muri uru rugo ba- giye hehe ? tu- ka- kora ikintu ki- meze nk' ibarura nta rugo ru- sigaye . ||| it would be more or less like a census .
a- ba- bashije ku- boneka muri bo tu- ka- genda tu- ba- bwira uko tu- giye tu- ba- korera ibyaha . uko abana babo ba- giye ba- pfa ; ||| then in case we find some of the people who survived still living in those homes , we would tell them how we killed their families , their children and loved ones , and where we dumped their people 's bodies .
abo tu- giye tu- ba ... n- vuga ko a- ri nko ku- ba- jugunya kuko nta u- hambwa -aga icyo ki- ha -e . ||| well i can say it was "@ dumping @" because by then no one would be buried .
tu- ha- garagaza ba- ka- shobora ku- shyingura -w mu cyubahiro , ||| hence they exhume and rebury them officially .
bityo bi- ka- tuma n- i- bura nubwo umuntu we ya- pfuye , ariko a- ka- umva yuko koko u- fite ubushake bwo ku- mu- bwira uko ibintu bi- genze u- ta- mu- kinze . ||| in that way , though survivors lost their people , they would be able to tell that we wish to say the truth without hiding anything .
a- gira agahinda ko kuba ya- ra- pfushije umuntu , noneho ya- gira agahinda ko kuba ya- ra- buze irengero rye a- ka- rusha -ho ku- gira agahinda . ||| on behalf of the servivors , it is agony to loss their beloved ones .
tu- iteguye tu- ta- shidikanya ko muri gacaca ejo bu- n- ri , ||| and when they add on not knowing where those people died , it hurts a lot .
tu- za- icara nk' abanyarwanda a- ha- n- i- ni tu- buranye n' ubwo tu- shyize ukuri a- ha- garagara . ||| in the gacaca corts that are going to take place in the next few months , we planned to come together as rwandans and say the whole truth about what happened .
tu- za- garagaza ukuri ku bi- baye , tu- ka- bi- bwira abantu ba- rokotse tu- ka- ba- saba imbabazi zi- ba -ho zose , ||| we will tell the truth to the survivors and we will pread for forgiveness as much as we can .
ko icyaha ki- baye tu- ta- shobora ka- ongera ku- ki- kora no ku- ki- tekereza . ||| the crime we committed we will never do it or think about it again .
tubagaragariza ukuri ku bantu babo ukuntu ba- ishwe , ||| we will tell them the truth about all the people we killed and how they were killed .
a- ba- shoboye kumenyekana aho bashyizwe tu- ka ha- ba- ereka . ||| those whom we still remember where they were dumped , we will show them to those who survived . and those that we do n't remember ; because they are some who died from here and there . but we shall use "@ saying the truth @" as our weapon to calm them .
abo tu- ta- zi ubu nyine ... wenda ha- ri benshi ba- giye bagwa hirya no hino , ariko bi- i- bura tu- ka- ba- humuriza tu- ifasha -ish -ije ukuri . ||| saying the truth is nothing much rather than showing people what we did and put everything in open .

ba- hakana ibyaha cyangwa se ba- sa n' abanakina no ku mu- byimba ku bantu ba ... ba- rokotse genocide ? ||| people who deny that what happened here was n't genocide or who try to be sarcastic to the survivors of genocide ?

n- jya -e rero nk' umunyarwanda u- ri mu gihugu itsembabwoko n- ri- emera nk' iryabayeho . ||| i as a rwandan who was in the country during the genocide , i admit that there was genocide in rwanda .
ntabwo n- ri- subiza i- n- y- uma . ||| i do n't deny it .
ba- ri -ho rero ubwira uti @: ' nyamuneka dore abantu ba- ra- pfuye , ' ba- ka- ba ba- vuga ngo ni u- ku- subira -an -mo . ||| yes there are some people you tell that ; "@ people died ! @" and they deny saying that " it was just a small conflict . @"
abanyarwanda ba- ra- ha- i- za -w -e , noneho bi- ongeye ha- higa -w ubwoko bumwe ba- ra- icwa bu- ra- toteza -w . ||| one group of rwandans was hunted , tortured , and killed .

tubifitiye inyandiko mvugo tu- koze zi- garagaza ko itsembabwoko ri- baye . ||| we have written and verbal evidence , which testify that there was genocide .
abantu bapfobya rero itsembabwoko n' u- ku- subiza igihugu i- n- y- uma , ||| those who criticise the genocide hinder the development of the country .
nta wu- n- ri musanzu ba- mara -ir igihugu , uretse ku- ki- subiza i- n- y- uma . ||| there is nothing special they help the country rather than bringing backwardness to her .
twe tu- emera ko itsembabwoko ri- baye , ndetse bamwe tu- ri- gira -mo uruhare ku mugaragaro . ||| we admit there was genocide , and some of us participated in it in broad day light .
n- ka- ba n- umva ku bwanjye abo bantu ba- kina a- ba- citse ku icumu ku mu- byimba ba- vuga ko ibyabaye ntacyo bi- maze , abo ngabo rwose ni abashinyaguzi . nibasigeho kuko ibyabaye bi- teye agahinda . ||| as a suggestion , those who are trying to be sarcastic to the survivors saying that , what happened here is not a big issue , they should stop it because what happened here is soul @-@ ful .
ahubwo ba- fata -e ingamba , ba- reba -e ukuntu ba- ku- egera abandi banyarwanda ba- vuga ukuri , ||| instead they should unit together with the rwandans who are ready to say the truth .
ba- genda -e ba- ba- cengeza -e -mo ukuri kw' ibyabaye n' ukuntu bi- giye bi- genda . ||| and together tell people what happened and how it happened .
ba- umva -e ko umuntu a- ta- i- beshyera niba u- ri- reze wireze ibyo u- koze ntabwo ... nta munyarwanda u- fite umugambi wo ku- i- beshyera ngo bi- gira -e icyo bi- mu- geza -ho . ||| they should understand that when one admits what he did , it is not a mare lie , it is true we did those crimes because one does n't gain anything from lying that he comitted a crime .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo rero itsembabwoko ri- ra- baye . ||| this means that , there was genocide .
a- ha- sigaye tu- shyira -e ukuri a- ha- garagara , kandi tu- bwira -e n' abo bose ba- vuga ko ri- tabaye -ho ko ri- baye . ||| then let 's say the truth and convice all those who deny that it was n't there .
tu- ba- igisha -e uko ri- genze , tu- bi- subira -e -mo twe ku- bi- ceceka , tu- bi- vuga -e hose , bu- ri wese y- umva -e ko itsembabwoko a- ri ribi , ||| preach them how it took place repeatedly . but not keeping quiet about it .
ko icyo cyaha ki- ta- kwa -iye ku- za- ongera kuba -ho mu gihugu cyacu . ||| until when everyone will learn that genocide is very bad and should never happen again in our country .
u- ra- koze ha- ri ikindi kintu n- umva n- shaka ku- ku- baza , ||| thanks a lot .
ku bantu ba- shobora kuba ba- ra- koze itsembabwoko kandi ba- ka- ba ba- ki- ri hanze . ||| i would like to ask you about those who participated in the genocide yet they are not imprisoned .
wenda u- shobora we ku giti cyawe kuba ntabo u- zi , ariko ntabo u- ba u- zi wenda ba- shinjwa ubungubu ba- ka- ba bakidegembya ndetse hano hanze muri iki gihugu ? ||| you may not be knowing some of them but do n't you know those who were already convicted but still out there , infact here in the coutry ?
eeh nk' ubungubu mpagaze ahangaha , nko ku idosiye yanjye n- fata -e urugero ha- ri abanyarwanda benshi .... abantu benshi tu- giye tu- fatanya , ba- ta- igeze ba- gera muri gereza ngo ba- funga -ir -w -e icyaha ba- koze . ||| yes there are there . up to this moment in my document i mentioned so many rwandans whom we were together during the genocide , yet they have never been arrested for the crime they committed .
ba- ri hanze koko bamwe na bamwe , n- ra- umva n- ba- ibuka . ||| some of them are out there and i remember them .
iyo a- n- bonye koko u- bona a- gize akantu kuko a- ra- ibuka . ||| when they see me , they change because they remember ... and one can tell easily .
a- ka- vuga ati @: « uriya muntu nubwo a- genda bwose tu- koranye icyaha kandi we ya- ra- ki- funga -iye -w , ||| "@ though that man is walking freely , he was once imprisoned for what we did .
ya- gize n' amahirwe yenda a- ra- fungurwa . » ||| he is lucky he was released . @"
u- ka- bona ko a- fite akantu ko ku- tinya yuko bi- anze bi- kunze igihe ki- za- gera , igihe cye nawe ki- ka- gera a- ka- vuga a- ka- shyira -w a- ha- garagara ; ||| that is what they say . one can easily notice their nervousness , they believe time will come . and it is true their time will come and they will be put in open .
kuko nti- n- za- mu- hisha -ir ni -yo ya- ba a- ri papa nta mugambi n- fite wo ku- hisha -ir itsembabwoko . ku bw' ibyo rero abo bantu ba- ki- ri hanze bidegembya , ||| because i will never keep a secret for them even though it was my father . i do n't intend to hide the genocide .
urukiko gacaca ru- giye -ho mu gihugu cyose , kandi ru- tanga uburenganzira bw' uko uwaba wiyiziho icyaha nk' icyo ya- gombye ku- ki- garagaza ha- ki- ri kare . ||| therefore , those who are still out there , i would like to remind them that gacaca courts were set for the whole country and the court gives a change to those who committed that crime .
kugirango urukiko nirutangira ru- za- mu- gira -ir -e imbabazi rukurikije ko ya- bi- vuze mbere , nabo ba- gombye ku- gira ikintu k' ishyaka , ||| those who report what they did earlier , will be forgiven as soon as the courts begin . but they should also have the courage to say the truth .
ba- ka- umva ko ku- vuga ukuri bi- ta- vuga ngo n' u- ku- ica umuntu . ||| saying the truth does n't mean you are going to be killed .
i- ya- ba aribyo iyi leta y' ubumwe i- ri -ho ya- ri ku- fata uwishe nawe a- ka- icwa , ||| if it was like so , this government of unity and reconciliation would have got all those who killed and kill them , but that is not true .
ariko si -ko bi- genze ahubwo bi- baye n- gomba -w ko u- zi ikintu a- ki- vuga a- ka- ki- tanga -ho n' ubuhamya . ||| instead the government asks those who have information about what happened to give it out and witness what they did .
ku- vuga rero genocide ntabwo a- ri u- ku- vuga ngo umuntu ya- ra- ishe ku- sa , ||| therefore , talking about the genocide does n't mean talking about killing people only .
tu- keneye byinshi , tu- keneye ubuhamya , tu- keneye ukuri . ||| there is much needed ; we need testimonies and the truth .
kuba rero u- ra- ishe umuntu u- gomba ku- bi- garagaza , ||| so , you killed some one you better say it .
ariko no kuba waramwishe u- ka- ba ukidegembya mu gihugu kandi u- bi- zi neza ko ha- ri abo mwakoranye icyaha , nabyo bi- garagaza ko u- ki- shyigikiye itsembabwoko . ||| because if you killed some one and you are still out in the country , yet you know there are those you were together who know you , it implies that you still support the genocide .
ubu a- ra- funze ? ||| was he arrested ?
oya n- tawe u- zi iyo ya- hungiye . ||| no , nobody knows where he fled .
uwo n- ri- n- zi wu- n- ri ... abandi ba- giye ba- pfa , ||| the other people that i knew died .
undi u- ri -ho ukidegembya tu- sangiye n' idosiye , n- vuga ko a- ri nk' umuyobozi w' akagari muri iki ki- ha -e we a- ri hanze . ||| but there is also another one who is out there yet he was also a local leader in this area .
uwo tu- ra- hura tu- ka- ganira ariko iwe ya- ra- ha- hunze n- ta- haba aho a- mara -iye ku- fungurwa . ||| we normally meet and chat but he ran away from his home after he was released .
a- funguwe ya- hise a- genda ? ||| after being released he disappeared ?
yego , ya- hise ajyenda . ||| yes , he disappeared .
ubu ya- hungiye he ? ||| where did he flee ?
aba hakurya ahantu ... a- ha- hoze muri commune kanombe . ||| he lives up there ... in the former kanombe commune .
ariko ubu i- n- bona n- ku- bona -e ku buryo isaha n- mu- shakira n- mu- bona , kuko niba ubuyobozi bu- mu- keneye n- genda n- ka- mu- zana , n- ka- ba namwerekana adresse ze n- ra- zi- zi . ||| in case he is needed by the authorities i can get him face to face . i know his adresses .
ni u- ku- vuga ko witeguye kuba wa ... ku- za- tanga ubuhamya , ku bantu bose ba- shobora kuba ... kuko jyewe impamvu n- ku- bajije abantu b' abayobozi ndetse n- ku- baza -mo n' abantu bize , n' abantu u- ba u- vuga uti ba- gira -aga n' uruhare mu ku- kangura -ir abantu genocide , ||| does it mean you are ready to ... to testify about all those who ... that is the reason why i asked you about the leaders and educated people plus those , one can say that played a certain role in genocide .
abo bantu u- shobora kuba u- ba- bona nabo ba- ba- tera -aga inkunga kandi ba- ri hanze ahangaha bakidegembya . ||| can you get those people ? because they also helped you and now they are out there happy .
a- ba- shobora ku- boneka nk' ubu leta i- fite umugambi wo ku- shakisha abo bose ba- koze itsembabwoko ba- ki- ri hanze y' igihugu . ||| it would be possible to find them , since the government is putting in a lot of efort in getting those people who participated in the genocide hidding out of the country .
nk' ubu n- umvise ngo ya- fashwa -e yenda ngo yajyanywe a- rusha , ||| for example if i had that some one is arrested , even if he is taken to arusha it is better .
naho n- jya -yo kuko ukuri kwanjye ntabwo ku- garuka -iye ahangaha . ||| if it means to go and witness in arusha i can go because my witness does n't have boarders , it can g beyond rwanda .
abandi bo ba- ri hafi yanjye , nk' uwo muyobozi bizimungu isaac a- ri i ri- ra- ima ni u- ku- vuga ngo a- ramutse a- shatse ku- hakana , ||| lucky enough some of them are living nearby , like that man called issac . he lives in ririma .
ubutabera bu- ka- n- kenera naho n- ku- ihuta -ir ku- jya -yo . mweraka iki ? mu- bwira nti ibuka wa munsi cya ki- ha -e tu- ri aha n' aha u- fite imbunda u- tu- bwira ngo tu- jya -e i- n- bera -e tu- tsemba -e umututsi nta ki- n- ri a- maze n' ukumwica . ibyo bikamwumvisha y' uko , ||| if he tries to deny and it appears that the chieves of justice needs my help , i can hurry to go there and convict him .
nubwo akwepakwepa ariko ha- ri abo ba- fatanya -ije icyaha . ubu rero n- ri- teguye , ||| i would remind him whatever he did while i was with him ; then he would realise that there is no need of hiding the truth because the people he was with are admitting and saying every thing that took place during that period .
ahubwo ku bwanjye n- umva ahubwo leta iri ku- n- tinda -ir . bi- baye n- gomba -w ni isaha ku isaha ubuhamya bwanjye bu- gera no kuri abo ngabo nyine n- ramutse n- ba- bonye n- ka- ba- umva -ish . wenda ahari nabo ba- hindukira nabo ba- ka- vuga ukuri . ||| i feel that even the government is delaying me because i am very ready to say the truth on what happened and i feel that i should talk to these people so that they change and say the truth too .
mu ku- anzura nagirango u- gira -e icyo ubwira abanyarwanda , cyangwa undi muntu wese u- tekereza u- shobora ku- za- reba ubu bu- hamya ndetse ha- ri -mo n' abongabo ba- koze genocide , ndetse u- na- bi- shobora u- ka- gira icyo ubwira a- ba- citse ku icumu . ||| in conclusion , is there a messege you can forward to rwandans in general or any other people who may have access to this testimony of which it may be those who participated in the genocide , and if possible to the genocide survivors .
icyo n- bwira abanyarwanda muri ru- sanga -e n' uko koko itsembabwoko n' itsembatsemba ri- baye muri iki gihugu cyacu . ||| what i can tell rwandans in general , is that "@ it is true there was genocide in our country . @"
ri- hita -an -ye abanyarwanda benshi , ba- saga miliyoni ( 1000000 ) nk' uko imibare i- bi- garagaza haruguru . ||| and so many people died ; more than one million people died as it is shown in the statistics .
kandi ibyo byose bi- kozwe n' abandi banyarwanda , ||| and all those people were killed by their fellow rwandans .
bi- korwa ku manywa y' ihangu , ||| which was done in broad daylight .
n- ra- umva abanyamahanga ba- bi- gize -mo uruhare wenda a- ri bakeya , ariko ku bwanjye mpamya abanyarwanda aribo ba- hemuka -iye abandi banyarwanda . ||| i believe that , foreigners who participated in it were few conpaired to the rwandans .
n- ka- ba n- ba- saba -aga rero abanyarwanda , cyane cyane abagitsimbaraye ku mu- ta- ima wo ku- ta- garagaza ukuri , ||| therefore i believe that rwandans were tormented by their brothers and sisters [ rwandans ] .
ko ba- gombye ku- vuga -ish ukuri ku bi- baye , kuko nta yi- n- ri n- ka- unga tu- keneye ku munyarwanda u- ri muri iki gihugu , uretse ku- garagaza ukuri ku bi- baye . abanyarwanda ba- ra- ishwe izuba ri- va , ||| so , i am advising those who try to hide the truth to stop it .
ni n- gomba -w ko tu- ka- garagaza na none izuba ri- va uko bi- giye bi- genda . abantu bagitsimbaraye rero nibave ku i- zima , ||| because the only contribution we can give to the government is by saying the truth . people were killed openly so the truth should be put in the open .
ba- umva -e yuko ukuri gukenewe , kandi ko bi- anze bi- kunze umusanzu we a- ri u- ku- garagaza ukuri . ||| therefore , those who are still hiding the truth should give up and realise that the only contribution they can give is to say the truth .
a- ba- citse ku icumu nabo , nagirango mbe n- ba- bwira yuko tu- ba- sabye imbabazi tu- i- vuye ku mu- ta- ima . ||| to the genocide survivors i would like to apologise to you from the bottom of my heart because what we did to you was something very terrible .
kuko icyaha tu- koze n' icyaha ki- ta- sanzwe niko n- bi- ita mu mateka y' isi , ||| which has appeared to be strange in the world 's history .
ariko abanyarwanda kera ba- jya -aga ba- gira umutima w' impuhwe , ||| in the past , rwandans used to be kind .
ko ba- gomba ku- ihangana ba- ka- komera ba- ka- gira umutima wa kigabo , inkunga tubemereye nta yi- n- ri nti- tu- bona ukuntu tu- zura umuntu wabo tu- ishe ariko n' ukuri tubagaragariza . ||| therefore , i am kindly asking rwandans to be strong and forgive us .
tubemereye inkunga y' ukuri igihe cyose tu- za- ba tu- ki- humeka tu- za- garagaza ukuri , ||| and what we promise to reveal the truth , because that is the only thing we can offer . that is our only contribution ; "@ showing the truth . @"
ku buryo bi- shobora ku- za- andika -w mu mateka y' isi ko ukuri gukenewe tubagaragariza uko abantu babo ba- giye ba- icwa bityo tu- ka- ba- saba imbabazi tu- i- vuye i- n- y- uma . ||| so that , the truth is written in the world 's history . we will tell them how their people were killed , and then ask for forgiveness from the bottom of our hearts .

impamvu ya- tumye n- bi- ca icyo ki- ha -e . impamvu ya- tumye n- bi- ca icyo ki- ha -e , ni uko icyo ki- ha -e ba- vuga -aga bati @: "@ nimu ... ha- ri -ho ubwicanyi , ba- vuga ngo @: umwanzi n' umwe . @" kandi tubitewe n' abategetsi , bati @: " utamwica , u- ta- ica abatutsi . ati @: nawe turamwica . @" ||| the reason i killed them is because the authorities ordered us to . they said , "@ there is only one enemy and you must kill him or her , and if you do n't , you yourself shall be killed . @"

abo bantu iyo ntabi ... abo bantu ... ni -yo mpamvu n- n- jya -e n- umvise ibyo bintu a- ri bibi n- ka- bi- i- rega , ||| that is why i realized that what i did was very bad and reported myself .
abo bantu n- ba- ishe nta kintu na kimwe bankoshereje , nta na kimwe , ku buryo n- n- jya -e bi- n- teye agahinda yuko n- ishe bagenzi banjye , n- ba- hoye ubusa . ||| i killed innocent people who had n't done any thing wrong to me . that is why whenever i think about it , i become very miserable because i killed my fellow people yet they had n't done anything to me .
ni u- ku- vuga yuko iyo abo bantu baza kuza , n- tu- ba- tura -e impiri yawe , u- ka- yi- reka aho u- yi- fite ba- ka- tambuka , ba- ri kuba -ho . ||| so if you had let them pass and you had not hacked them they might have been alive up to now ?

ibyo bintu nta muntu u- bi- n- tegetse , ni ubushake bwanjye , ni -yo mpamvu n- bi- saba -ir imbabazi . ||| no one forced me , it was out of my own will and that is why i apologize for what i did .

mbere ya jenoside , abategetsi babishishikarizaga cyane , ngo @: umwanzi ngo @: ||| before the genocide , the bad leadership of that time influenced us . they used to convince us that our only enemy was the tutsi .

habyarimana a- ki- mara ku- pfa , ha- ri ahantu n- ra- raga izamu ry' umugabo n- ra- ri- raga , noneho n- za- kuza ... n- za- ku- bona ahantu ba- ri ku- twika amazu , ||| after habyarimana 's death , i was at a place where i was working as a watchman .
n- vuye mu mu- ta- soma -w ku- gura ibirayi . n- ra- za nyura ku mu- gora -e w' umututsi , a- ra- n- bwira ati @: "@ ese gaspard , ||| as i was coming from mudasomwa to buy irish potatoes , i met a tutsi woman who asked me , "@ gaspard , how come those houses across are burning ?
ati @: ko n- ruzi hariya ba- twitse amazu , ati @: bi- meze bite ... kandi u- ka- ba wi- ruka ? ||| what is happening and why are you running ? @"
n- ra- mu- bwira nti @: n- vuye ku- gura ibirayi ku ka- ha -ir , ||| then i told her i was from buying irish potatoes from gasharu .
n- size amazu a- ri gushya hariya haruguru , nti @: ||| but i told her that i had left houses being burnt up there .
mpuye n' abagabo bi- koreye inyama z' inka , nti @: hariya mu mushishito . ||| i told her how i met some men taking cow 's there in mushishito .
nti @: ariko bitewe yuko n- ku- zi u- ri umuturanyi wanjye , nti @: ||| then i told her , "@ since you are my neighbour i will tell you what is going on .
n- giye ku- bi- ku- bwira ariko uyu munsi nti- n- ongera ku- rara izamu . ||| from now on , i will never work as a watchman anymore .
nti n- bonye a- ri abatutsi ba- ri -mo bi- ca ! yee nti @: ni abatutsi ba- ri -mo bi- ca . ati @: ||| they are killing the tutsi ! @"
"@ u- ra- koze . @" nti @: nibo ... nti nibo ba- ri -mo bi- ca . ubwo ya- hise afumyamo nti- i- ongeye ku- rara a- honga -ho . ||| then she thanked me and immediately left ; she never slept there in her home .
ubwo n- n- jya -e , n- hise n- taha n- jya i- mu- ha -ir n- va ku zamu , n- jya i- mu- ha -ir . ||| i also went home and stopped moving around . i stayed at home .
none u- ki- mara ku- bi- menya se nta gitekerezo ... ko wu- n- va -ish -e ko abatutsi ba- icwa , nta gitekerezo u- ba u- ra- gize , cyo ku- rwana kubo mwari mu- turanye ? ko u- na- vuze ko ha- ri abo mwari mwarashyingiranywe ? ||| after realizing what was about to take place , did n't you at least think of what you should do to help your neighbours since you had even intermarried ?
igitekerezo cyabo tu- ri tu- turanye , ba- maze ka- umva ibyo ngibyo , ba- hita ba- hunga . bamwe ba- hungira hano ... ba- hungiye hano i murambi . ||| my neighbours ... when they heard about it , they all fled . some came here to murambi .
u- tu- bwiye ko hano i murambi ha- baye ubwicanyi bu- ha- ambaye . nyuma yuko ubwo bwicanyi bu- ba ha- ri ibindi bintu u- zi byakurikiyeho ? mu ki- tu- raga -e iwanyu ... ||| you told us that here in murambi was a horrible massacre . after the killings do you know of something else that followed in your home village ?
nyuma y' intambara y' i murambi , nta bu- n- ri bwicanyi bu- baye -ho , ||| after the murambi battle , no more killings took place .
ha- hise haza abafaransa , ba- hita ba- bu- hosha . ||| the french troops intervened and stopped it .
abafaransa ba- sanze ha- ri abatutsi ba- ki- ri -ho ? ||| did the french find any tutsi around ?
abafaransa ba- sanze abatutsi ba- ra- pfuye . ||| they found all the tutsi already dead .
ni u- ku- vuga ko abo bafaransa icyo ba- koze a- ri ukugirango ... ba- kinga -iye i- ki- ba- ba abantu ba- hunze ? ||| it sounds like the french came to cover up the deeds of those who went to exile ?
yee , ba- kinga -iye i- ki- ba- ba abantu ba- hunze , ariko abatutsi ba- ra- pfuye . ||| yes they just wanted to cover up on what those people had done but the tutsi had already died .
hagati abatutsi ... bambe abafaransa wibuka igihe bagereye ino ? ||| do you remember when the french reached here ?
ntabwo n- ka- ibuka , nti- n- ka- ibuka . ||| i do n't remember ...
ariko ha- ri igihe ki- hise mo i murambi ha- maze kubera ishyano ? ||| maybe it was within a short time after the catastrophe that happened in murambi ...
ba- sanze abatutsi b' i murambi ba- ra- pfuye . ||| they found when all tutsi from murambi had already died .
u- gereranya -ije ni nk' igihe ki- ngana iki ? ||| when you estimate , what time do you think it was ?
n- gereranya -ije ... n- gereranije abatutsi ba- ra- pfuye ... abafaransa n- umva -ish -e ngo bi- geze ku kibuye , n- giye ka- umva n- umva ngo na hano ku gikongoro ba- ha- je , ||| if i estimate ... the tutsi died ... i heard that the french had reached kibuye and within a short time i heard that they had reached gikongoro .
ariko nta ki- ha -e cy' ukwezi ki- shize , abatutsi ba- maze ku- pfa . ||| but that was less than a month time after the tutsi had been murdered .
oya , nti- n- ku- baza ko u- baye umuntu mwiza ibyo n- ra- bi- emera . ||| that is not what i was asking . i know you 've changed and you are a good person .
n- ta- ku- baza u- ra- ibuka ibyo u- koze ... ikintu ki- ku- babaza ... ||| but i was asking whether you remember what you did ... what 's the most painful souvenir ... ?
ikintu kibi ki- n- babaje cyane , n- ibuka abantu ba- pfuye ba- zize a- ka- renga -an -e , ba- zize ubusa . ||| what i remember that always hurts me are the innocent people who were killed .
bose ba- zize a- ka- renga -an -e ba- zize a- ka- renga -an -e . ||| well , those who died were all innocent .
ariko tu- ra- ibuka hano nk' umuntu u- ri u- ri i murambi . ikintu u- ta- za- ibagirwa , ||| but as a person who was in murambi , what would be the souvenir that you will never forget ?
wenda se n' amaraso ya- ku- guye -ho ... ||| something you ever think about , maybe blood that dropped on you ...
ikintu n- ta- za- ibagirwa , ni abantu ba- guye hano , ba- ishwe n' abantu b' a- ba- ki- zi ba nabi . ||| what i can never forget are the people who died here , killed by wrong doers .
kuri wowe reka tu- ku- ha -e urugero . ||| i mean you personally . let me give you an example .
u- shobora kuba u- bana n' umugore wawe , mu- ka- jya mu- tongana , rimwe , kabiri , ||| let 's say you have a wife and you quarrel frequently ; you quarrel once , twice , three times and finally you fight .
gatatu . mu- ka- za- rwana , ariko noneho rmwe u- ka- zibuka ya- ku- teye i- ki- shira -ir cyangwa wowe u- ki- mu- teye . a- ka- ba a- ri cyo ki- ku- babaza . ||| and maybe she hits you with a burning charcoal or you hit her toot . that can stick in your mind maybe because it is what hurts you the most in the whole fight . now , comparing that example to this situation .
na hano i murambi u- ra- ha- geze . ||| you came to murambi , is n't it ?
sibyo ? n- bwira mu bi- korwa bibi byose u- koze , cyangwa n' abandi n' icyo u- bonye . icyo u- jya wu- n- va ki- ku- sigara mu mu- ta -w -e u- jya u- bona . ||| so tell me among all the horrible things you did or saw , what do you remember ... something that stuck in your head ?
wenda se ni umuntu u- temye , ni uwo u- gize ni uwo se u- bonye ashibukanwa na gerenade ... nicyo tu- shaka ku- menye . ||| maybe a memory about hacking somebody or somebody you saw being crushed by a grenade . that is all we need to know .
icyo u- ta- za- ibagirwa wowe ... ||| an incident that you will never forget .
ikintu n- ta- za- ibagirwa , ni abantu n- bonye ba- tera grenade ba- ka- bi- ca . ||| the thing i will never forget is seeing people being crushed by grenades .
ikintu n- ta- za- ibagirwa ... ||| i will never forget that .
bi- genze ku- ta -e iyo grenade ? ||| what happened ?
ba- ra- yi- ba- teye ba- ra- pfa . ||| a grenade was thrown to them and they died .
ba- yi- funguye ku- ta -e ... u- bonye imipfire yabo ba- pfuye ku- ta -e ... ||| how did they open the grenade ... ? how did you see them dying ?
imipfire yabo n- bonye bi- kubita hasi , ba- zana urufuro . ||| what i saw about their death , they fell down and died slobbering .
nicyo n- bonye . ||| that is all i saw .
ikintu nicyo wu- n- va ... nicyo wu- n- va u- bonye kibi ... kibi ... nko mu mu- n- ota umwe ... ? ||| is that all you saw ? i mean the worst thing you saw ... it might be an event that took place in the twinkling of an eye ?
ikintu n- bonye kibi ... kibi cyane ku mu- n- ota umwe . ni abo bagabo babiri n- i- iciye . ||| the two men i killed myself is the worst thing i saw happening in the twinkling of an eye .
nti- za- ibagirwa ku isi , ||| i will never forget that , in my whole lifetime .
kandi mbajijije ubusa . ||| yet they were innocent .
icyo u- bi- ibuka -ho ni iki ki- hora ki- garuka ... ||| what do you remember about that event , which always comes back to your mind ?
icyo n- bi- ibuka -ho ni uko n- ba- ishe , ||| what i recall ... is the fact that i killed them .
n- ba- icishije u- bu- ha- i- ri , ba- ka- hita ba- pfa . ||| i killed them with clubs and they died right away .
n- ra- bi- ibuka n- ka- gira agahinda kanini cyane , n- bi- ca n- ba- renganya -ije a- ri bagenzi banjye . ||| whenever i recall it , i feel so sad .
n- ta- ba- hishe n- ka- bi- ca , ||| they were my people but i killed them . instead of hiding them i killed them .
n- jya n- bi- ibuka n- ka- gira agahinda kanini , yuko n- ba- ishe , n- ka- ba n- bi- saba -ir ima -an imbabazi . ||| whenever i think about it i feel so sad . whenever i remember that i killed them ... that is why i ask god to forgive me . i always ask for forgiveness because i killed my comrades yet they were innocent .
yuko bagenzi banjye n- ba- ishe nta kintu n- ba- ziza , mbajijije ibitekerezo bibi bi- ri -ho bu- ri ki- ha -e ... icyogihe . ||| i killed them because of the wrong mentality we were fed then .
u- jya u- bi- tekereza -ho bu- ri munsi ... ? ||| do you think about it often ?
n- ra- bi- tekereza bu- ri munsi cyane , n- ka- gira agahinda cyane , kubw' abo bagabo n- ishe mbajijije ubusa . ||| yes i often think about it and it fills me with misery . because of those two men i killed yet they were innocent .
ku bwawe u- tu- bwiye ko wishe , ||| you personally told us that you killed .
ha- ri n' ibyo wibuka neza . u- zi ko wemeye icyaha nk' ubu ibyo ba- ku- rega ... icyo cyaha wu- n- va ... u- bi- fata u- ta -e , iyo ba- ku- bwiye ko u- koze jenoside ? ||| there are some events that you still remember clearly and you admitted what you were accused of . how do you look at that crime especially when people accuse you to have participated in the genocide ?
ibyo bi- ha , ni jyewe u- bi- i- reze bitewe n' umutima wanjye yuko n- koze ibintu bibi . nta muntu wabimpase ni jyewe u- bi- i- reze . ||| no one forced me to pleade guilty . i reported myself as my conscience did n't leave at peace because i knew what i did was very wrong . no one forced me i did it willingly .
n- za ku- bi- i- rega ibyo muri selire , n- za no ku- vuga ibya hano i murambi , ||| i reported myself in my home area and talked about what i did in murambi .
bitewe n' uko n- ha- bonye abantu ba- pfuye ba- zize a- ka- renga -an -e . ||| i saw so many innocent people dying in murambi .
ba- ishwe n' a- ba- ki- zi ba nabi , ba- ba- hoye ubusa ba- ha- hungiye . ||| wrong doers killed them although they had not done anything wrong . those people had fled to murambi .
n- za ku- ha- i- rega nta muntu u- ha- n- reze ni jyewe u- ha- i- reze . ||| i reported myself about it before anybody reported me .
ku giti cyawe se , kuba u- ra- koze jenoside , cyangwa ba- ku- ita ko u- koze jenoside , wu- n- va ko ipfunwe bi- ku- teye ? ||| having participated in the genocide or being called a genocidaire , does it make you feel embarrassed ?
kuba n- ra- koze jenoside , n- umva ku giti cyanjye , n- ra- koze nabi , ||| having participated in the genocide ... personally i feel that , i did wrong .
bitewe n' umutima mubi n- ri n- fite . nyuma leta , i- za ku- vuga iti @: ||| and , it was due to the bad heart i had .
"@ mwarishe , ni mu- vuga -e ukuntu mwishe , tu- babarira -e . @" ||| later the government said , "@ you killed , tell us how you killed then we shall forgive you . @"
n- za ku- i- baza n- ra- vuga nti @: n- giye ku- vuga ukuntu n- ishe , n- za- babarirwa -e ... ... ba- n- babarira -e n' ima -an i- n- babarira -e . ||| then i thought about it and decided was going to say how i killed and then be pardoned by the government and by god . @"
ku bwawe se , ubu u- zi ko ha- ri -ho ikintu ki- itwa ubutabera . cyane n' imanza nyinshi zi- ba mu rwanda ni i- zi- jyanye n' ibya jenoside u- bona ubutabera bwo mu rwanda , ||| you know there is something called ‘ justice ’ that is being practiced in rwanda , concerning the genocide that happened .
bu- gombye ku- kora iki ? ||| so how do you think justice should be done ?
kuri iki ... , ku bwawe . wu- n- va bu- gombye ku- kora ku- ta -e ? ||| how should they go about it ?
ubutabera bwo mu rwanda kuri njyewe , bitewe ko n- vuga -ish ukuri , n- ka- shinja abantu ba- ta- emera ibyabaye hano . ||| on my behalf , justice in rwanda ... i suggest that the government forgives me because i always try to simplify its work by confessing and convicting those who do n't admit their participation in murambi killings .
n- ka- bi- vuga -ish -mo ukuri , n- ka- fasha leta nti- n- yi- rushye n- ka- vuga ibyabaye , ||| i say everything truthfully and i help the government by telling what happened here and what i personally got involved into .
n' ibyo n- koze @: n- ra- umva , ya- n- babarira . ||| therefore the government should forgive me .
yuko n- vuga -ish ukuri ibyabaye , n- ta- yi- ruhije . ||| because i say the truth about what happened without giving them a hard time .
u- sibye ku- vuga ngo @: u- za- babarirwa ku giti cyawe . ariko se , ubutabera wifuza nyuma y' ibyabaye mu rwanda , wu- n- va bu- ba a- ri ubuhe ? ||| besides being forgiven , personally after all that happened in rwanda , what kind of justice should be done ?
ni ubutabera bwunga abanyarwanda , ||| it is ‘ justice ’ that unites all rwandans .
tu- ka- ubaka igihugu cyacu , ibyabaye nibyongere kuba . ||| so that we can build our nation and stop what happened from happening again .
tu- ka- ki- ubaka ki- ka- mera nk' uko ki- ri ki- meze , na mbere abantu ba- ta- ra- pfa . ||| we should build our nation and make it look like it was before people died .
kuri wowe ... u- vuze ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . ||| you have just talked about unity and reconciliation .
ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ubu- umva u- ta -e ? ||| what do you think about unity and reconciliation ?
wu- n- va bu- kora ku- ta -e ? ||| how do you expect it to work ?
ubumwe n' ubwiyunge nuko bwa ka- unga abanyarwanda , bu- ka- ba- subiza ... bu- ka- ba- subiza ... bu ... ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ni uko bu- ka- unga abanyarwanda , ba- ka- subira ba- ka- bana nk' uko bi- ri mbere , ||| i think unity and reconciliation should unite the rwandans so that they live in harmony the way they lived before .
ba- ka- bana n' abo ba- hemuka -iye , ba- ka- ba- saba imbabazi . ||| people should live with those they betrayed and ask for forgiveness .
wu- n- va se nyuma y' ibyabaye byoroshye ku- gira ngo ubumwe n' ubwiyunge bu- za- gera -w -e -ho ? ||| do you think that unity and reconciliation are possible after all that happened in rwanda ?
ibyabaye , ntabwo bi- ri byoroshye , ||| i know it 's hard to unite and reconcile after what happened in rwanda .
ariko leta y' u rwanda nti- shaka ku- kora nk' ibyabaye , i- ra- shaka ka- unga aba ... ka- unga a- ba- bi- koze , ngo ba- garagaza -e ibyabaye ... ukuri . ||| but again , the government is working hard so that people may say the truth about what happened in order to reconcile .
ese ku bwawe ko wireze u- ka- emera icyaha ... u- tu- bwiye ko ha- ri bamwe u- koreye icyaha , bamwe ba- ba ba- ra- rokotse u- zi . u- ra- ba- egereye ? ||| you have told us that you confessed ; now we want to ask you whether you asked for forgiveness to the people you hurt . did you go to them , especially the survivors ?
yee , ha- ri umugore n- egereye mu- bwira ukuri , mu- bwira nabo n- iciye , a- ra- vuga ngo @: ||| yes , there is a woman to whom i asked for forgiveness ; she was happy and she thanked me for having told her about the people i killed , she said she did n't know them .
nti- ya- ri a- ba- zi , kuba ... mugaragariza imiryango ye ya- pfuye ati @: " rwose ati @: nta kibazo . @" ||| and then she said there was no problem with her ... i told her about who killed her family members and she said she did not know them .
ku- vuga ngo ntakibazo , bi- sobanuye iki ? ||| what does it mean when one says there is no problem ?
ati @: "@ nti- n- ri n- zi abanyiciye , ||| she said to me , "@ i did n't know those who killed my relatives .
nune u- ra- ba- garagaza tu- ra- turanye , ati @: ||| now you have told them to me and in fact we are neighbours . @"
ubwo ngubwo ... ati @: kandi ba- bi- hakana u- ka- ba u- garagaza a- ba- ba- ishe , ati @: ||| she told me that they always deny that they did n't kill them .
n- ra- umva u- vuga -ish ukuri . ati @: u- za- komeza -e u- vuga -e nk' uko u- vuga , iyo miryango yanjye ya- pfuye . @" ||| she appreciated me and said , "@ you say the truth , keep it up and do n't change . @" she told me to keep saying the truth like i had said about her family .
ariko n- ta- ku- baza u- ra- bona byoroshye ? ||| but i am asking you if you think it is easy ?
ka- oroha kugirango abantu ba- tanga -e imbabazi z' abantu ba- bi- ciye , kuko a- ri benshi ba- za- itanga , ||| being easy ... people should forgive those who did wrong to them since the majority is ready to forgive .
a- ba- anga ku- emera ibyaha by' ibyo ba- koze kandi bi- ba- hama ba- ka- ba- hana , kuko ba- ba ba- anga ku- garagaza ukuri . ||| maybe those who do n't accept their roles in the genocide yet there are evidences should be punished because they do n't want to expose the truth .
kuri wowe u- maze ku- vuga ibyabaye u- na- gize mo uruhare . u- ri -mo u- vuga ko ubungubu bi- ku- koma ku mu- ta- ima ukabyicuza , ||| you have admitted the crimes you committed and always regret what you did .
ubundi u rwanda u- ru- bona u- ta -e , mu ki- ha -e ki- za- za ? ||| now according to you , how do you find the future of rwanda ?
u rwanda n- tu- bona ko rwa ... ru- ta- ri nka mbere , abana b' u rwanda ba- shaka kurwubaka , ||| rwanda is no more like the former rwanda . children of rwanda today think about building their nation .
ba- ta- shaka ku- kora nk' ibyabaye . ||| they do n't think about doing things like what happened in the past .
mu ki- ha -e ki- za- za abana ba- ri -mo ba- vuka ba- ri -mo ba- ba- igisha kuba -an n' abandi , ba- ka- ba- igisha ku- kora , n- ra- bona nta tsembatsemba ri- za- garuka . ||| the government is teaching the children how to live in peace with one another , how to work ... i do n't see genocide happening again .
nk' ubu ubwawe u- zi u rwanda ru- ta- ka- je abantu , ru- ta- kaza n' ibintu . ||| you know very well that rwanda lost so many things and very many people .
nk' ubu u- ramutse u- funguwe , uruhare rwawe u- tanga , haba mu bumwe n' ubwiyunge , haba mu bi- korwa by' amajyambere ni uruhe ? ||| so in case you were released , what would be your contribution as far as unity and reconciliation or development in rwanda is concerned ?
uruhare n- tanga ni uko n- ku- egera abo n- hemuka -iye , kuko ndi umuhinzi yenda tukaguzanya ; tu- ka- sangira nk' uko tu- sangira -aga ; n- ka- ba- saba imbabazi ; tugahingirana ; tu- ka- tu- ererana nk' uko bi- ri bi- sanzwe . ||| i think i would go and try to live in peace with the people i tormented and since i 'm a farmer , i would try to work with them as we try to help one another .
ukurikije se ibyabaye , u- jya wiyumva ko u- ri umunyarwanda ? ... n- ta- ku- baza . u- jya wiyumva ko u- ri umunyarwanda . ||| when you consider what happened , do you feel like you are a rwandan ?
n- ra- bi- umva . ||| yes , i feel i 'm a rwandan .
u- ra- koze . ha- rya u- shobora ka- ongera ku- tu- ibutsa amazina yawe . ||| thank you , would you please remind us your name ?
n- itwa ayirwanda gaspard . ||| my name is ayirwanda gaspard .
ubundi u- maze igihe ki- ngana iki .... ||| how long have you been in prison ?
n- fite imyaka itanu n' amezi umunani . ||| i have been in prison for five years and eight months
u- ra- koze ||| thank you .

umva n- ku- bwira -e . tu- esa -e tu- rize tu- giye tu- igisha ubumwe n' ubwiyunge , ||| listen , we all learnt ... all of us were taught about unity and reconciliation .
tu- ra- na- bi- umva tu- na- bi- shyira mu bi- korwa , ||| we understood and even practiced it .
ni nacyo tu- ri -mo ku- kora . ||| in fact this is what we are doing right now .
ariko tu- gira umutima n' ubwenge . ||| but as human beings we have hearts and brains .
nti- n- ku- baza ibyo ba- ku- igishije , ||| therefore , i am not asking you about what you were taught .
n- ta- ku- baza amarangamutima yawe . n- ta- ku- baza uko u- bi- umva . wowe ubwawe , ||| i am asking you according to your conscience and beliefs .
umuntu a- ku- iciye umwana , ba- mu- bwiye bati tuga ... tu- ka- rura -e uriya muntu u- ku- iciye umwana , ||| on your behalf , if one said that they are going to bring someone who killed your child , would you be that kind to him ?
wu- n- va u- shobora ku- mu- gira -ir izo n- ba- ba- zi ? cyangwa u- vuga uti @: "@ uyu muntu n- jya -e ukwe simushaka @"@ . ||| or would you say that you do n't even want to see him ?
uwo muntu abenshi bamwe ba- ra- zi- tanga , abandi ba- ka- zimana . ||| such a person ... the majority forgives and others do n't .
wowe ubwawe , n- ku- bajije wowe ubwawe , simvuga abandi . wowe ubwawe a- ri ibyakubayeho , ||| i 'm asking you personally , i 'm not asking you about others .
u- taha u- ka- sanga umwana wawe bamwishe . uwamwishe u- mu- babarira ? ||| if it was a true story that happened to you , let us say one time you went home and found your child 's body lying there dead . can you forgive that person who may have killed your child ?
njyewe ubwanjye , n- igeze nokuzitanga ha- ri umuntu u- n- yi- ciye umugore , n- ra- mu- babarira ubu a- ri hanze . ||| personally there is a time i forgave someone who killed my wife . now he has been released .
ariko si muri jenoside , ni uburozi ya- mu- haye , a- ra- pfa . ||| but it was n't during genocide , that person used poison and she died .
ariko ubu tu- ra- sangira -aga tuka -an ... tu- ka- sangira tu- ka- tumira -an . ||| but later we reconciled and started sharing everything ; we would invite each other for events .
n- n- jya -e n- zi- mu- ha . ||| therefore i would forgive him .
bitewe n' umutima wanjye u- ba u- garutse , n- zi- mu- ha . ||| my heart would be at ease to forgive him .
yee , ni icyo nagirango u- n- bwira -e . ||| well that is all i wanted you to tell me .
hanyuma , mu magambo make n- ragira ngo u- n- bwira -e imibereho yawe ... u- tu- bwiye ko ha- shize imyaka itanu n' amezi umunani u- funze , ni u- ku- vuga ko u- funzwe nko muri mirongo cyenda n' icyenda [ 1999 ] . ||| now would you tell us in brief , your life experience ; you told us that you have been in prison for 5 years and 8 month , which means you were arrested in 1999 .
n- funzwe icyenda n' umunani [ 1998 ] , itariki 26 z' u- kwa karindwi . ||| i was arrested on the 26th july 1998 .

muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] intambara i- maze kuba abatutsi ba- ra- pfuye , abantu tu- ri tu- fite umutima nk' uw' bisimba . ||| in 1994 after the war when all tutsi had died , people were wild .
tu- ri tu- fite umutima ... kuko abantu ba- ri muri gikongoro u- sibye njyewe , ntabwo ba- ri ba- meze neza . ||| everyone in gikongoro was bad except me .

u- komeje kuba -ho ubuzima bu- sanzwe bw' umuturage wo mu ki- tu- raga -e ? ||| did you continue to live your life in the village like any other villager ?
yee . n- komeje kuba -ho ariko umutima wanjye ... n- ka- umva umutima u- ra- rya , n- n- jya -e umutima wanjye nti- u- ri u- meze neza , bitewe n' abantu ba- pfuye tu- ri tu- turanye . ||| yes i lived a normal life but i was n't happy at all because of the innocent people who had died .

hagati aho u- tu- bwiye ko u- sa nk' uwafunzwe bi- tinze . ||| meanwhile , according to what you have said , it seems like it took long before you were arrested . but you are not telling us your life during all that period .

ukuntu bi- geze -ho ... ukuntu bi- geze -ho , uwo n- iciye umwana ya- ri umuhutukazi u- ri u- shatse ku mututsi a- za ku- n- rega . ||| what happened is that , the lady whose child i killed was a hutu but she had married a tutsi . so she reported me to the authorities and then i ran away from my home .
noneho n- anga ... n- ta- hunga n- ka- za- jya n- rara mu bihuru ndaraguza . nta urugo rwanjye . ||| i let my home and i would sleep in bushes .

hafi y' i ... n- jya -aga za rukondo , n- ka- tembera nkapagasa , n- za n- kaza ninjoro a- ta- reba . ||| near my ... i would go to a place called rukondo and then i would come back at night while no one was seeing .

nti- ba- fashe ba- ri hanze . ||| they were not arrested .

uko n- fashwa -e , n- ri n- ri -mo mpinga i- mu- ha -ir , ||| how the arrested me ... they got me from home where i was digging .

mpageze mpita n- emera ko n- ishe . ||| and when i reached there , i immediately i admitted that i committed the genocide .
ni nde u- ku- fashe ? ||| who arrested you ?
n- fashwa -e na konseye uwo nguwo , u- tu- zanye hano i murambi , ||| the counselor arrested me ; the one who brought us here in murambi .

u- tu- bwiye ngo @: konseye uwo nguwo ni umukonseye wigeze ku- ba- zana mu ki- ha -e cy' ubwicanyi ? ||| you have told us that you were arrested by the counselor , is it the one who brought you during the time of killing ?
yee , niwe u- n- fashe . ||| yes he is the one .
wigeze mu bu- hamya bwawe ... ||| did you talk about it in the testimony you gave ?
mu bu- hamya bwanjye no kuri dossier yanjye hose a- ri -ho . no mu ki- anika n- ra- bu- vuze ku kibuga . ||| in my testimonies and in my documents he is there . even in the testimony i testified in cyanika i mentioned him .
kuri dossier yanjye , abo bose ba- ri -ho . ||| that was in kibuye . in my document all of them are mentioned .
nonese nk' mpamvu u- bona bo ba- ta- fata -w , u- na- tu- bwiye ko ha- ri -mo umuyobozi ni iyihe ? ||| what could be the reason why they are not arrested and you have told us that some are leaders ?
n- ra- bi- vuze igihe kinini , ba- ra- vuga ngo @: ba- za- ba- fata -ir ... ba- za- ba- fata muri gacaca niko n- umva ba- vuga . n- ra- bi- vuze ba- anga ku- ba- fata simbizi . ||| i said it for a long time and they said that they will arrest them in gacaca but i do n't know why they do n't arrest them .
hanyuma se nkawe , nk' umuntu u- ri muri gereza , iyo wu- n- va ha- ri ... umuyobozi u- yoboye umurenge w' iwawe , ubwo ni u- ku- vuga ko a- riwe u- tanga amabwiriza niwe u- gombye kugaragariza ibibi . ||| you as a person who s in jail , when you hear about such ... a leader in your sector ... it means that he is the one who gives orders yet he is supposed to be the one revealing the wrong things .
u- zi neza ko mwakoranye ikibi . ||| you are very sure that you all participated in the genocide .
ubwo ni iki u- ba u- tekereza kuri uwo mu- renga -e wawe ? ||| what do you thing about your sector ?
n- tekereza kuri uwo mu- renga -e wanjye , ni uko n- za- ha- gera n- ka- hagarara mu ru- hama -e rw' abantu , njyenda mpagurutsa umuntu tu- giye tu- ica ... tu- fatanya -ije ubwicanyi . n' iyo na konseye ya- ba a- yoboye iyo nama , nawe namu ... n- mu- vuga ... n- mu- vuga -ho . ||| if i were given the opportunity to go back to my area , i would go pointing out the people we were with and even though that leader is among , i would name him too .
nyine n- shatse ku- ku- baza ubu , ku miyoborere y' umurenge wawe , ubungubu u- ta- ha- ri . ||| i just wanted to know how you feel about the leadership in your sector in this time of your absence .
nk' umurenge wanjye u- yobora -w n' umuntu u- ba ya- ra- ishe , n- bi- bona -mo yuko uwo muntu ba- mu- fata . ||| well , a place like my home sector , which is lead by a genocidaire , i suggest that person should be arrested .
ndi ku- ku- baza uko u- bi- tekereza ? ||| i am just asking you what you think about it .
icyo n- tekereza nk' umuntu u- yobora ya- ra- ishe . a- ka- yobora , ku bwanjye n- umva nta kintu a- ri ku- kora . ||| what i think about someone who is leading my home sector yet he killed , i guess he is doing nothing .
keretse uwamucisha mu ngando , a- ki- kura -mo ibibi ya- koze . kuko ya- koze byinshi . ||| i think he should first go to solidarity camps and try to forget what he did because he did many things .
kuri wowe u- ra- umva a- giye mu ngando u- ri ka- umva a- giye mu ngando ha- ri icyo ya- hindura ? cyangwa ya- na- giye -mo ntabwo u- bi- zi . ||| so you think if he went to solidarity camps he may change ? or maybe he went there but you are not informed ?
nta ngando a- ra- jya -mo kuko ... ya- jya mu ngando se a- ta -e , ||| he has not yet gone there .
kandi a- ta- funze , a- ri hanze ? ||| how can he go there yet he was not arrested ?
ha- ri ingando zi- jya zi- ba -ho z' abayobozi . ||| but there are camps purposely for leaders .
ibyo ya- koze a- ra- bi- irengagiza nti- ya- bi- emera , keretse ukuri ku- giye a- ha- garagara ibyaha bi- ka- mu- fata . ||| he ignored and never admitted what he did , unless the truth is revealed and then his crimes will get him to jail .
kubyo u- maze ku- vuga se ubungubu ni i- ki- ha -e cyifuzo cyawe u- tanga ? ||| of all what you have just said what would you suggest ?
kubyo maze ku- vuga , ikifuzo n- tanga ; ni uko ibyo n- koze bi- ri bibi muri leta ya mbere . ||| based on all i have said , my wish is to let people know that all the bad deeds i did were of the past government .
none kuri leta y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge i- ka- ba ... na ... n- shaka ku- garagaza ukuri kw' ibyabaye . ||| and , now in this government of unity and reconciliation , i would like to testify what happened .
n- ka- ba ukuri n- garagaza ni uko n- ka- rura umutima ... umutima wanjye u- baye muzima , ku buryo n- bana n' abantu . ||| and the truth i would like to show is how my heart was renewed and now i am human and i can live with other people .
tu- ka- bana tu- ka- ubaka u rwanda ru- tu- byaye , ||| together we can build our motherland rwanda .
tu- ka- garagaza ukuri ku bi- baye tu- ka- bana n' abo tu- iciye . ||| we should reveal the truth about what happened and live with those whose beloved ones we killed .

ariko baje ku- reba amagufwa , n' ibiki byose ... ariko umutima wanjye u- n- komanga , nti n- n- jya -e n- ra- ha- je . ||| they had come to see the remains of people and several other things . but my heart was haunting me . deep down in my heart something was telling me , "@ you too came to attack here ! @"
nti ba- n- fata n- zi- rega , ||| and i knew that once they get me i would say the truth .
n- hise n- bi- i- rega n- tawe u- bi- n- bwiye . ||| and indeed i admitted everything willingly .
iyo n- ta- bi- vuga nta u- ri ku- bi- menya , ||| of course if i had denied no one would have known what happened .
ni n- jya -e u- bi- i- vuga -iye ku giti cyanjye , ku- gira ngo na bariya bantu twa ... ||| therefore , i admitted everything personally so that even those people whom we ...
baza ku- ku- fata se u- ri u- ra- bi- vuze ? ||| had you ever confessed before they came to arrest you ?
baza ku- n- fata n- geze kuri komini mpita n- bi- vuga . ||| no i had n't , but i confessed immediately after i had reached the commune .
ariko iyo ba- ta- ku- fata ntabwo u- ri ku- za- bi- vuga ? ||| but if you had not been arrested , would you have confessed ?

iyo a- ta- za ku- bi- menya se ? ||| what if she had n't known ?
u- ri u- fite umutima wo ku- zi- rega wowe ubwawe ? ||| did you want to report yourself ?
iyo a- ta- za ku- bi- menya , kubera ko n- ri n- zi ha- ri ahantu n- ri n- giye kwa responsable , kwa konseye hariya ... mwene wacu hariya kuko n- vuka -iye hano ku gikongoro . ||| if she did n't know , there is a place i went to ... at the local leader 's ... there at the counselor 's place . he was my relative because i was born there in gikongoro .
a- ra- n- bwira ati @: "@ u- za- jya -e ku- i- rega bazakugabanyiriza . ati @: "@ u- za- vuga -e ibyo u- koze byose , ||| therefore , he advised me to go and report myself that they would reduce my punishment in case i did so . he told me that i should say all the roles i played in the genocide and stop living in the bushes .
ati @: u- va -e mu gihuru dore u- maze ku- zana amaga nk' ayo igikeri ati @: ||| i had started developing scale like those of a frog .

n- ri n- fite imigambi yo ku- i- rega , kuko n- ri maze ku- bona merewe nabi . ||| so in my plans i knew i would report myself because i had noticed that things had become worse in my life .

ya- ri myinshi cyane , n- ra- yi- bonye . ||| i saw them ; they were very many .

igihe ba perezida baza ahangaha nti- ba- tumye abaturage ba- jya yo . ||| when the presidents came , no citizen was allowed to go there .

ntabwo se wu- n- va ubwiyunge bwo ko bukenewe ? ||| so do n't you think reconciliation is required ?

yiiiii , u- bona -aga yi- fite ? ba- bona u- ri umuhinzi u- kora ba- bona u- ri umuhinzi u- kora ? bati uriya n' umututsi , ||| yeah , he would be wealthy .
a- tunze inka , bati nimumwice , tumwibe , tu- gira -e tu- ta -e tu- jya -e mu bye ||| when they could see you as a cultivator doing that kind of work ... then that one is a tutsi with cows , kill him and we still his belongings , then take over his .
mbese ubundi u- ra- umva ko ibintu by' amoko bi- giye bi- jya -ho bikurikije nu nuko umuntu ya- ri a- kize ? ||| so you can tell that this thing of racisms went according to how rich one was ?

bi- tuma noneho u- shaka ku- tu- bwira uko cyane abantu ba- genda -aga ba- pfa ibintu ? ||| then that can make you tell us how people killed each other because of property .
ba- pfa -aga ibintu , uuu ba- pfa -aga ibintu , ||| according to the property ... how they were ... you would set your eyes on your brother .
umuntu nkuwo mwana muri kumwe ba- bona uko asa , ba- byara undi mwana ba ba- ta- sa , bati uriya ba- mu- byara -an -ye n' umututsi kandi ise wabo a- ri umwe , ||| when he become bigger than you and he worked for a someone that rewarded him with a cow , you say the tutsi has been rewarded . kill him . no other alternative

inkiko gacaca aho umunyarwanda wese a- saba -w ku- vuga -ish ukuri ||| in gacaca courts each and every rwandan is required to tell the truth
kuri genocide ya- baye kubyo ya- bonye , uruhare rwe ibyo y- umvise ||| about the genocide , what he saw , his own contribution and what he has heard of it

ariko specifical tu- n- ongera -e ku- ibuka ibyabaye mu mu- renga -e wa ru- genga -e ||| especially in rugenge sector .
aho abanyarwanda ba- jya -aga ba- sanga ima -an ni -ho ba- giye ba- hungira mu biha -e bya genocide . ||| during the genocide , rwandans often went to hide in places where they used to go to pray god
ba- zi -ko ba- sanga -yo ya mana ya- jya -aga i- ba- fasha si -ko bi- baye ahenshi bi- ca -iye -w -mo ||| thinking they would find the very god who used to help them . however it was not the case ; most of time they were killed there .
muri izo nsengero mu za kiriziya n' ahandi ||| those places are catholic churches and others .

n' urubanza kukourimo ku- n- baza ngo u- giye ku- bwira abantu ngo banza -e ba- n- shinja -e kandi ejobundi nibo ba- n- shimira -aga ||| it is one because you are telling the population to come and accuse me . the very people who were praising me just some days ago !
n- ya- ka- ubaha -w ntabwo n- vuze ko ba- ku- shinja ||| i did not mean to accuse you , sir !
ejobundi nibwo ba- n- shima -iye kumugaragaro ba- na- n- tuma -ho ngo ba- ra- n- shimira . ||| they have just thanked me and sent a message to me saying they thanked me .
ibyo ngibyo ni byiza ni n- gomba -w , ||| that is a good thing . any who has done something good should be actually thanked for it .
k' umuntu u- koze neza ba- ra- mu- shimira ibyo rwose ntago n- vuze ngo abantu ba- ku- shinja -e n' u- ku- vuga ngo tu- gomba ku- tanga ijambo kumpande zose n- giye ku- banza mu n- ta -e -ko kugirango tu- umva -e nabo icyo ba- vuga . ||| i have not said that people must accuse you . we only have to let the two sides speak . we go to the court panel first and listen to their views .

nubwo iyo compagne territoriale ya- ri iyobowe n' undi arko mwari mu- fite ubushobozi bu- komeye aho rero ntago u- vuga ngo tu- sobanukiwe . ||| you should have known what your colleagues were doing . tough the territory company was commanded by someone else , you had enough power yourself . you can see that we did not get the point well .
ngirango yagirango a- ku- fata -e mu mugongo akwreke ko nta gahunda tu- shyize -ho yo ku- ku- shinja . ||| i think that his intention was to support you and show you that we are not meant to accuse you .

icyo kibazo ki- kura -e -ho byose na confusion zose iyo camionnet y' umutu ba- bonye ntabwo yi- geze i- genda -w -mo na lieutenant colonel munyakazi , ||| that question must remove all confusions . the red pickup people saw never carried lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi .
ikindi cya kabiri n- ta- ku- bwiye ba n- ya- ka- ubaha -w mu- gize urukiko gacaca n- ri -mo ku- bona ba- himba ibintu ngo ba- bi- n- gereka -e -ho kandi n- ra- koze uko n- shoboye ngo n- ba- tabara -e . ||| the second thing i did n't mention , i guess , ladies and gentlemen of gacaca court panel , is that i see people trying to bring fake accusations against me whereas i did my best to protect them .
ikindi igihe bombe za- gwa -aga kuri eglise st famille n- ra- je ubwanjye n- jya muri eglise st famille n- jya ku- humuriza abaturage n- giye -yo tu- fata abarwayi croix rouge ya- tegeka -w -aga na ka- yi- ranga ba- jya ku- ba- vuza muri croix rouge , ||| once saint @-@ famille church was being fired at . i myself went to sainte @-@ famille church to console the population . we took sick people and they went to be treated in red cross infirmary . red cross was chaired by kayiranga in the time .
iyo modoka y' umutuku rwose ba- ba- bwiye ubwo icyo kirego mu- ki- n- vana -e -ho ki- va -e -ho nti- n- igeze n- yi- genda -mo . ||| i never travelled in the red car . remove that accusation completely .
n- ya- ka- ubaha -w icyo n' ikirego u- za- burana niba ki- na- ha- ri , ||| that is an accusation you will deal with during the trial , sir ! of course if it is one .
ariko wu- n- va -e ko n- ta- ku- burana n' ukugirango tu- menye ku- sa tu- sobanukirwa -e ntagobwo tu- je tuje ku- ca urubanza tu- je ku- kira ubuhamya bwawe nkuko wabwisabiye . ||| we have not come for trial . you should understand us ; we just want to listen to and understand your testimony as you asked it yourself .
ariko mu- ri -mo ku- n- baza ibyo ba- bwiye ||| you are asking me what you 've been told though .
yeah , ba- ra- ku- baza bagirango ba- sobanukirwa -e ku- sa ariko si u- ku- burana , ||| of course they are asking you because they want to understand but it is not a trial .
reka mpe undi mugenzi wanjye a- ku- baze . ||| i go over to my colleague so that he may ask you as well .
na ru- ta- bana u- ri ushinzwe ku- tanga ibiryo mu nkambi y' impunzi gira icyo u- tu- bwira ||| court panel according to rutabana you were both in charge of distributing food in displaced people 's camp
ntabwo ki- ri ikirego yagirango a- menye , ||| it was not an accusation . he just wanted to know .
u- ra- umva ibiryo byo atri ikirego kuko n- tawe u- ta- rya . ||| food can not be an accusation because everyone eats .
a- ra- vuga ko n- koranye ni -yo nterahamwe ku- tanga ibiryo kandi lietenant colonel u- ri mu nti- ambara ntabwo ya- bona igihe cyo ku- jya ku- tanga ibiryo mu mpunzi . ||| he is saying i and the interahamwe distributed food but a lieutenant @-@ colonel who is in war can not have time to distribute food to displaced people .
nagirango mabze ikibazo ki- ka- ubaha -w colonel munyakazi ya- tanze ingero muri mille collines , muri st famille , no muri st paul , ahantu hose ya- giye a- gerageza ku- gira -ir neza abanyarwanda , ||| court panel i want to ask a question . mister colonel munyakazi has just examples such as mille collines , sainte @-@ famille , and saint @-@ paul and he tried to help rwandans everywhere .
ya- bi- kora -aga ku manywaibyo aribyo byose nagirango mu- baze niba ha- ri abantu babanyamakuru ba- ba ba- ra- bonye icyo ki- korwa cyiza ya- koze . ||| probably he was doing that during the day . i would like to ask him there might be some journalists who saw that humanitarian action .
murakoze ||| thank you !
eeh , ||| right !
abanyamakuru bo mu rwanda cg bo mu mahanga kuri icyo kibazo , ||| about that question ... do you mean rwandan journalists or foreign ones ?
kuri icyo kibazo , ku- va muri 1992 , ||| about that question ... about that question ... from 1992 ... from 1994 ... if you might have read ; all books written confirmed that gendarmes contributed in saving people .
ku- va muri 1994 niba mwarabonye ibitabo bi- andika -w -aga byose abantu ba- kunda -aga ku- vuga -w -mo abajandarume ba- gize uruhare mu- ku- tabara abantu tu- itwa -aga nabo bose bangag ku- bi- vuga kubera ibihe tu- ri tu- ri -mo , ||| all of them refused to mention that because the situation we were living .
ariko iyo u- somye igitabo cya auteur le drpoit survivre cyanditswe na hibert cyo ki- erekana yuko kuri hotel mille colline ha- ri- n- za -w -e n' abajandarume muri za enquete ba- koze a- ka- ba a- ri -yo mpamvu ha- ta- pfuye abantu niko icyo gitabo ki- bi- anditse muri za enquete zabo . ||| however if you read the book le droit de vivre by hibert , you can see that book shows well that hotel de mille collines was protected by gendarmes according to the investigations . that is why people did not die there . that is what the book says
kuri cathedrale st michel ha- ri umunyamerika u- ri hamwe na ziriya mpunzi zo kwa gisimba nawe tu- mu- vanye inyamirambo tu- mu- zana muri cathedrale st michel , ||| there was an american who was with gisimba 's displaced people in saint @-@ michel cathedral . we had taken him from nyamirambo and brought him to the cathedral .
no kwa gisimba na gisimba uriya a- zi -ko abajandarume major karanga -w a- riwe ziriya mpfubyi zose u- zi- gejeje muri position zanjye , ||| even gisimba knows that all the orphans arrived in my area thanks to the gendarme called major karangwa
ariko ibyo ntabwo ba- bi- vuga , ||| unfortunately this is not evoked .
ariko ubu n- i- bura abantu ba- menye ko icyo ki- korwa ki- baye -ho noneho rero ba- geze hariya bamwe ba- ra- na- ba- bwira -aga ngo nti- ba- za- vuga -e yuko ba- kijijwe na lieutenant colonel munyakazi ngo kuko ba- za- mu- shinja ubwicanyi , ||| for the time being , however , people should know the action took place . when people arrived there , some were even told not to say they had been saved by lieutenant @-@ colonel munyakazi because he would be charged of killings later . fortunately there are gacaca courts ; you have given me the opportunity to tell you that i had given orders to the gendarmes of hotel de mille coliines .
ariko inkiko gacaca zi- ra- ha- ri mu mpaye uburyo bwo ku- ba- bwira yuko abo bajandarume ba- ri ba- ri kuri hotel mille collines n- ri n- ba- haye a- n- bwiriza mpa amabwiriza abantu bo kuri cathedrale st michel mpa amabwiriza abajandarume yo ku- voma amazi no ku- zana ibiryoniba nibyo mu- ra- bi- menye ubwo mu- ra- bona yuko nta mugambi wo ku- gambana -ir abatutsi n- ri n- fite . ||| i had given orders to people at saint @-@ michel cathedral . i also gave orders to gendarmes to go and fetch water and bring food . you have known that too . you can see that i did not intend to plot against tutsis
n- ya- ka- ubaha -w ibyo nibyiza ibyo u- koze kuri mille collines ni byiza u- ra- bi- shimwa , n' ibintu u- koze nabyo u- ra- bi- shimwa , ||| yes sir , that was perfect . what you did at mille collines was perfect ! what you did is also recognized .
ku- sa ha- ri impungenge tu- ba tu- fite ku kintu kuko tu- umva ko u- ri u- fite ubushobozi bwo ku- ki- menya tu- ka ki- ku- baza , ||| just because of the power you had in the time , we get curious and worried and we are obliged to ask you questions in order to know .
tu- ra- ku- saba ko kubera igitinyiro cyawe u- ra- vuga abantu ba- ka- gira ubwoba ba- ka- tinya no ku- ku- baza wifate neza i- n- bera -e y' urukiko , ||| we would also like to ask you to stand appropriately in front of the court panel . this is because people fear even to ask due to your dignity .
ku- ifata neza ntabwo a- ri ibyo byo ku- gira gutyo u- vuga -e u- tuje , ||| no , by standing appropriately i do not mean standing that way .
abantu ba- ta- ikanga ba- ta- fite ubwoba cyane ko ba- vuze ko u- ri umuntu u- komeye n' icyubahiro cyawe . , ||| ; try to speak calmly so that people might not get intimidated by your dignity . they have said you are an important person so they have much respect for you .
n' igitinyiro u- fite niba u- na- rushye u- shobora kuba wicaye gatoya ba- ka- ku- baza ||| if you feel tired you may even sit down so that they may ask you .
n- ya- ka- ubaha -w muri uyu mujyi wa kigali nuko wenda mutanyemereye urukiko rutanyemereye ariko wenda murza kumpa uruhushya n- za -e ku- bi- ba- bwira kuko nabyo n- ri n- bi- teguye , ||| you know sir ... may the court panel has not allowed me to tell you about the then structure of the army in kigali . however , i had prepared it . i hope you will allow me that .
iyo u- rebye uko unity za- ri zi- meze hano mumujyi wa kigali u- ka- reba ukuntu n- koze ukuntu n- shoboye ngo n- shobora -e ku- tabara bariya bantu ba- ri ba- ri muri kariya ka- ca -e ||| when you check well that structure and see how i did all my best to protect the people who lived in that area .....
kuko si u- ku- burana kandi uriya we yabitiranyije ku- sa tu- ku- bwira -aga ngo u- jya -e u- tu- mara impungenge kuko ha- ri ibyo tu- ta- zi cyane cyane ko u- ri umuntu u- genda ahantu hose u- zi ibintu byinshi bi- giye biba ||| this is not a trial . the other one confused you ; we only wanted you to spare our worries because there are things we do not know and that you might be aware of since you could go anywhere hence you have much information about what happened .
noneho u- bi- tu- sobanura -ir -e ntago a- ri u- ku- burana nta nubwo a- ri inzira tu- shatse kugirango u- burana -e twebwe urukiko rw' umurenge nta nubushobozi tu- fite bwo ku- ku- burana -ish ntabwo tu- fite ubushobozi bwo ku- ku- burana -ish na butoya kubera icyubahiro cyawe ntabwo twebwe tu- fite ubwo bushobozi reka tu- tanga -e ijambo kumuntu umwe mu- ba- gize inteko hanyuma tu- jya -e ku ba- n- ri . ||| so , we want you to provide us with explanations . this is not a trial . it is neither a way we have wanted you to precede your trial . we are not even entitled with the ability to do so at all as the sector tribunal considering your personality . we give the floor to someone else
murakoze kumpa ijambo nagirango nkwibarize utubazo duatatu tw' amatsiko cyane cyane tu- umvise utsindagira ishyaka mrnd u- shobora ku- tu- bwira ishyaka u- ri u- ri -mo ? ||| court panel thank you . just out of curiosity tell me about three questions @: you have been evoking mrnd a bit a lot ; would you please let us know which political party you belonged to ?
i- cya kabiri u- tu- ibwira -iye ko u- tanze rapport zihinyuza ibyo ba- beshyera -aga abtutsi reak nkwibarize nk' umuntu u- ri u- fite ubushobozi u- jya -aga no hanze u- ganira -aga n' abantu u- tu- ha nk' abatutsi nkabangahe u- ba u- ra- buriye ? ||| second @: you told us that you drew reports denying the accusations brought against tutsis . so i want to ask you ; as a high @-@ ranked personality of then who could go abroad at times , how many tutsis have you warned ?
i- cya gatatu nagirango nkwibarize u- tu- bwiye umugabo witwa nti- ru- ki- ri- bamba -e ese tu- mu- kura he ? ||| third @: you told us about a man called ntirugiribambe . where can we find him ?
ese ya- ri ashinzwe iki ? ||| what was his responsibility ?
murakoze ||| thank you .
munyakazi i- cya mbere u- n- bajije ngo ishyaka n- ri n- ri -mo , ||| the first question concerns the political party i belonged to .
ku- gera ku itariki ya cumi . 06.1991 ha- ri ha- ri -ho iegeko n- shinga abanyarwanda bose nawe u- ri muri mrnd nawe niko bi- ri bi- meze abantu bose ba- ri ba- ri muri mrnd , ||| according to the rwandan constitution in force till june 10th 1991 , all rwandans including you adhered to mrnd . surely it was the same for you .
nawe u- ri u- ri -mo kuko umunyarwanda wese ya- ri muri mrnd , ||| all people adhered to mrnd . even you because any rwandan did .
nyuma yo ku itariki ya 10.06.1991 ha- giye -ho itegeko ri- shyira -ho amashyaka menshi , abasirikare nta shyaka ba- jya -aga -mo , ||| after june 10th , the constitution accepted many political parties . soldiers did not adhere to any political party .
i- cya kabiri u- n- bwiye ngo u- ri u- n- bajije uti izo rapports u- koze ngo n- vuga abatutsi n- buriye . ||| the second question you asked is about reports i drew and how many tutsis i might have warned .
izo rapport yuko ba- ri -mo ku- ba- himba -ir n- zi- koze ku- turuka ku itariki ya mbere igihe ba- tangira -aga ku- fata ibyitso ba- n- bwiye ngo n- kora -e verification , ||| i drew the reports from the 1st after the presumed accomplices started being arrested . i was told to verify .
kandi n- ra- emeye n' umutima wanjye n- vuga -ish ukuri n- kora uko n- shoboye kugirango ba extremiste ba- ta- jya ku- koresha izindi rangamuntu mu- zi- n- ri imprimerie ngo ba- zitira -ir -e sisi evariste ||| i committed myself with my entire mind and told the truth . i did my best to prevent extremists from going printing other identity cards somewhere else and say later that they had been printed at sisi evariste 's .
kandi izo rapport n- koze nubwo tu- bi- vugana -aga n' abakozi bo muri embassade baza -aga ku- tu- baza uko situation i- meze ni -yo ya- tumye ba- shyira -ho pression president habyarimana kugirango uriya mugambi wo ku- rimbura abatutsi u- ta- korwa , ||| i also used to talk to embassy agents who came to ask us about the situation . that is why they started putting pressure on habyarimana in order to give up the plan of exterminating tutsis and start releasing people .
ba- tangira -e ba- fungura -e n' abantu , ||| people were released .
n' abantu ba- tangiye ku- fungurwa n' a- ba- funguwe ba- ra- ha- ri president habyarimana yaravuganga ngo ni- mu- ongera -e ku- fungura mu- jya -e mu- reba a- ba- funguwe ||| there are even people who were released . habyarimana used to say @: "@ do not release people anymore you should check those who are being released @"@ .
mukwezi kwa kane . 1991 ariko iyo tu- ta- kora izo rapport tu- ka- jya muri uwo mugambi wo ku- funga abatutsi tu- ba- himba -ir tu- ri kuba tu- koze nabi , ||| in april 1991 ... it would have been bad of us if we had drawn those reports and get involved in jailing tutsis for fake accusations .
jya -e n- ku- bwiye ko iyo rapport ya- gize akamaro kuko n- bwiye abanyamahanga nti n- ta -w -e tu- koze verification tu- sanze ba- ra- beshyera abatutsi . ||| i am telling you ; the report served a lot because i told foreigners that we had verified and found out that tutsis were innocent .
i- cya gatatu n' i- ki- ha -e ? ||| what was the third question again ?
uwo ntrugiribambe ya- ri commanda wa territoriale ya n- ya- ru- genga -e ya- ra- hunze ya- giye muri za- ira -e ntabwo aho a- ri mpazi . ||| ntirugiribambe was the territory company commander of nyarugenge . he exiled to zaire . i do not know where he might be right now .

eeh nagirango n- ba- bwira -e yuko iriya minota mwatanze kugirango umuntu a- ba- bwira -e ibyabereye kuris t famille na st paul a- ri mikeya ||| i would like first to remind you that the time given for testimony is not enough to talk about what happened at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
kandi itsindo ry' ikibazo a- ri -ho ri- ri , ||| whereas it is the center of the problem .
abantu n- ra- umva ba- ba ba- fite imformations zi- ba zi- tandukanye kuko uko ibintu bi- ri bi- meze ntago abantu ba- bi- bona -aga kimwe . ||| people have different information because they did not see what happened in the same way
twebwe rero nk' abapadiri ba- ri bashinzwe ku- reba abantu ba- ri ba- hungiye kuri st famille no kuris t paul ariko tutiyibagije ko ha- ri abandi bantu ba- ri hanze ||| we , as priests who were in charge of looking after displaced people at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul bearing in mind there were other people outside though @:
ku kibuga cy' amashuri ya st famille abo ngabo ba- ri ku kibuga cya st famille n' abantu ba- ri ba- ra- hunze imirwano ba- ta- fite ikibazo cy' interahamwe ||| on sainte @-@ famille primary school playground , on sainte @-@ famille church yard , and other people who were displaced by fighting but were not hunted by interahamwe
abari st paul no muri st famille ndetse no mu ntangiro muri cela n' abantu ba- hunga -aga ahubwo interahamwe . ||| those who were at sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul even at cela during the first days as well as people who were escaping from interahamwe
eeeh twebwe rero , ||| right !
kubera ko abntu baza -aga ba- tu- hungira -ho ntabwo tu- ri tu- zi abo bantu abo aribo ngo tu- vuga -e ngo wowe u- ra- hunga interamwe eeh wowe nta nterahamwe u- hunga ||| we did not distinguish people ; we did not for example consider whether one was escaping from interahamwe
ariko ibyo ngibyo tu- bi- korera -aga kubera umutekano wa bose nukuvuga rero yuko ubwacu nk' abapadiri mu ibanga tu- kora -aga inama nimugoroba ||| we did all that for the sake of everybody 's security . that means that as priests , we held secret meetings in evenings
kugirango tu- ku- sa -an -ye ibyo tu- giye tu- bwira -w hirya no hino kigirango tu- menye uko tu- shobora tu- komeza ku- menya ku- fasha abantu ba- ri ba- ra- ha- hungiye ||| in order to share the information we might have collected from different people all along the day and be able to handle all these people who were displaced up there
uwaduhaga information ntabwo tu- vuga -aga ngo umuntu ya- tu- haye information twagirango tu- ba- bwira -e ko informations tu- bona -aga z' ibitero bi- gomba -aga kuza muri st paul no muri st famille . ||| we did not say neither this one informed us , that we wanted to inform them about a possible attack against sainte @-@ famille
ha- ri -mo n' abantu ba- korana -aga inama nabo , ||| there were even people who held meetings among them .
haba -aga ha- ri -mo abasaveri , ba- kaza ba- ka- tu- bwira abti mu- itonda -e ejo cg ejobundi ba- ri -mo ku- tegura igitero . ||| there were xaverians who could come and tell us warn us about a possible attack .
ubwo tu- ka- bi- menya ||| the information could be got that way
hanyuma rero kubera ko nkuwo munsi u- ta- baga u- zi i- zi- ri ku- korana n' interahamwe ntawari ku- bi- menya ni -yo mpamvu tu- irinda -aga ku- gira ibintu tu- sohora bimenyekana . ||| since we could not know those who were connected to interahamwe , we did not reveal anything .
kuko u- shobora -aga ku- bi- sohora ugasnag nibo ba- giye ku- tu- tanga , nuko nguko rero muri ru- sanga -e tu- kora -aga . ||| one could reveal that information and the very informed people would go to complot . that is the way it worked
na munyeshyaka ba- tinya -aga ku- vuga nti- n- zi impamvu ba- tinya ku- mu- vuga ntabwo ya- koze , nta na rimwe yi- geze a- shaka no ku- icisha abo bantu ba- vuga . ||| i do not even know why people have not evoked munyeshyaka . munyeshyaka did nothing wrong . he never intended to betray people .
ubuhamya bwo , nibyo n- ba- bwira -aga ngo abantu tu- fite ukuntu tu- bi- umva kuburyo bu- tandukanye twebwe rero nk' abapadiri , a- ri muri st paul a- ri muri st famille ||| that is why i was telling you people understand things in differently . we , as priests either in sainte @-@ famille or
muri st paul ha- ri hashinzwe padiri celestin a- riwe u- ri uhinzwe izo mpunzi nti- n- zi impamvu ba- ta- igeze ba- vuga yuko n' interahamwe naho za- ha- geze za- twaye abantu nabo ba- pfuye ||| saint @-@ paul ... we had appointed father celestin to take care of those displaced people at saint @-@ paul . i do n't know why people did not mention that interahamwe arrived there to remove bodies
nkuko muri st famille abntu baje ba- ka- ba- twara ba- ka- bi- ca icyo kugirango nagirango n- vuga -e ku- bi- erekeye na munyakazi ||| as they came to sainte @-@ famille to take and kill people . this leads me to talking about munyakazi now
ibyo ngibyo rero n- giye ku- ba- bwira n- ra- ba- bwira n ukuri n' ubuhamya ariko na none ikindi nagirango n- ba- bwira -e nuko ha- ri abasirikare baje ku- rinda kuris t famille no kuri st paul ||| what i am telling you is a true testimony . i would also like to let you know that there are soldiers who had come to guard sainte @-@ famille and saint @-@ paul
abasirikare tu- ri twitabaje ministiri aloys padiri munyeshyaka a- ka- mu- bwira yuko ibitero bi- ri bi- raye bi- ha- je , akmubwira yuko interamwe irmo kuza ku- ica abantu . ||| we had resorted to minister aloys . munyeshyaka had told him that there had been attacks in the night and interahamwe were coming to kill people
niwe u- vuze ati tu- giye ku- reba ukuntu tu- fasha ubwo nyuma yaho jya -e n- koranye na munyeshyaka tu- giye ku- bona tu- bona abajandarume ba- ra- je . ||| he said he was going to handle the situation . i worked with munyeshyaka . then after , we saw gendarmes coming the following day .
ha- ri abajandarume ba- ri ku muryango winjiraga kuri procule kubera yuko abantu ba- ri ba- ra- hungiye kuri st famille ba- ri mu kiriziya inzugi zo z' i- n- y- uma za- ri zi- funze . ||| gendarmes settled at procure main entrance because displaced people were in the church and the hind doors were closed .
ka- ereka nyine ubwo ha- igeze kuza igitero ki- komeye noneho rero tu- saba kubera yuko interahamwe kubera ko za- injira -aga uko zi- bonye zije ku- twara abntu muri st famille ||| once a very strong attack came to take people from sainte @-@ famille and because interahamwe entered in disorder ,
tu- geze naho tu- saba tuti abajandarume ba- ha- ri ngo nizizajya ziza imbunda ba- jya -e ba- zi- bambura ba- zi- siga -e ku muryango aho ba- injira -ir -aga , ||| we asked the gendarmes to take guns from them at the entrance .
ba- giye ba- bi- kora . ||| they did it .
ariko rero iyo haza -aga igitero ki- komeye nkuko n- igeze ku- bi- vuga igitero ki- komeye cy' interahamwe nta ki- ha -e abo bajandarume bi- geze ba- bi- hagarika . ||| however as i said it earlier the gendarmes were never been able to stop very strong attacks
bi- ba- rusha -aga ingufu pe ndetse wenda na munyakazi yaza ku- gera aho a- vuga ko nawe ha- ri ibyo a- ta- shoboye . ||| they were stronger than them till munyakazi himself some were stronger than him
mu- reka -e tu- umvikana -e ||| please , listen !
n- racya- komeza kuko niba tu- shaka ku- vuga -ish ukuri tu- jya -e tu- vuga ukuntu ibintu bi- genze ||| i still have the floor . if we really want the truth we should be saying the reality of things
reka tuze ku- mu- baza , ||| we shall ask him questions .
a- ra- tu- sobanura -ir mu- reka -e tu- umvikana -e , a- ra- vuga wenda ibyo a- zi n' undi a- ra- vuga ibyo a- zi , ||| he will explain . listen ; let him say what he knows , another person will say his .
mu- ceceka -e tu- umvikana -e . ||| please , stop shouting
eeh ikindi rero na none n- ba- bwira , mu bajandarume ba- ri ba- ra- tu- haye kugirango ba- rinda -e abantu ha- ri -mo bamwe b' umutima mubi ba- shaka -aga koko ko abo bantu ba- bi- ca . ||| what i can add is that among the gendarmes we had been given , there were bad @-@ hearted ones who wanted the people to be killed .
ndetse ha- ri -mo bamwe bi- sabye ko ba- ba- hindura kubera yuko baza -aga ba- ka- vuga bati tu- ra- irirwa tu- rinze inyenzi abasirikare bacu ba- ri -mo ku- pfa -ir ku ru- gamba ba- icwa nazo ? ||| it became even necessary to transfer some because they said they were protecting inyenzi while their army was being killed by some of them at the battlefield
muri abo ngabo ha- ri -mo abo tu- sabye ba- ra- ba- tu- hindura -ir ubundi mu ntangiriro ba- ba- n- ri ba- baga ba- ri ku kibuga ngirango mu- ra- bi- zi ba- jya -aga ku- voma ubundi ba- kaza ku- gurisha n' abantu ba- ri mu kiriziya ba- ta- shobora -aga ku- sohoka ||| we asked that some might be transferred . you can remember those who were on the yard , during the first days , could go to fetch water and sell some articles to people who could not go out .
bi- geze aho ahubwo za nterahamwe ba- vuga -aga za- ri zi- ri aho ngaho hafi kuri st famille za- je ku- shyira -ho bariyeri kuko ba- vuga -aga ngo ba- ra- zanira amazi inyenzi ||| after that , the interahamwe talked about who were at sainte @-@ famille set a barrier saying inyenzi were being given water .
izo bariyeri rero zi- maze ku- jya -ho tu- i- ambaje abajandarume ngo ba- jya -e ba- tu- fasha no ku- jya ba- jya ku- tu- zanira amazi ba- ra- bi- koze . ||| after the barriers were set , we resorted to the gendarmes so that they might go and fetch water for us . they did it .
muri paroisse n- baga -mo y- itwa yuhi n- jyanye numu na major nsanzimfura jean batiste n- maze ku- mu- taba za ko a- ba- bi- kira ba- giye a- ba- bi- kira ba basomption ba- giye ku- bi- cira aho ba- ri ba- ba- size n- ra- mu- bwira nti iruka -e iwanyu ba- ha- kora -e genocide ||| in the parish yuhi where i lived , i went with major nsanzimfura jean baptiste after having called him for help that that the assumption sisters risked to be killed where they had been left . i told him to rush because a genocide was reaching his place
a- ra- n- bwira ati reka tujyende tu- jya -e ku- ba- zana n- banza no ku- gira ubwoba nti jya -e nti- n- renga hariya hepfo a- ra- n- bwira ati ngwino tugende niba u- ri buze ku- pfa tu- ra- pfa -an . ||| he told me to go and take them . i first feared to go far and he ensured me that if i was to die we would both die .

ku- bi- erekeye igitero cyo muri sela ba- vuze -ko ki- baye ku itariki ya karindwi ha- ri icyatanzwe ku itariki ya karindwi . ||| as far as the attack at cela is concerned , i think it took place on 7th as it has been said ... or ?

ku kibazo abantu bose ba- ibanze -ho kiriya modoka y' umutuku . ||| what do i think about the red car all people have been insisting on ?
ngirango nicyo n- na- tangira -iye -mo n- bwira a- ba- gize urukiko ko iyo modoka n- ta- yi- genze -mo . ||| i think i even started with it , saying that i never travelled in that car !

............ ha- ri imodoka y' umutuku u- genda -aga -mo n- ra- yi- hakana iyo modoka koko y' umutuku ntago n- igeze n- yi- koresha . ||| i absolutely reject that i travelled in that red car . never !
ka- ereka niba ha- ri umuntu u- genda -aga a- vuga ko y- itwa koroneli munyakazi a- ri muri iyo modoka . ||| maybe there was someone who travelled in it saying his name was colonel munyakazi !
mu- ki- ha -e cya jenocide ya- twara -aga abantu itwawe n' abandi ariko nawe indi . ||| during genocide it was used by others but

ntabwo iyo modoka yi- geze i- jya muri ..... ntabwo iyo modoka n- igeze n- genda iruhande rwayo . ||| the car never got to ... i never travelled near it .
ntago n- igeze n- genda muri iyo modoka ku- bi- erekeye ikibazo ki- za groupe za- ica -aga abantu muri kigali . ||| never ! concerning the groups that killed people in kigali ;
izo groupe za- ri nyinshi ha- ri interahamwe nkuko tu- kunze ku- bi- vuga uwanyuma a- ra- vuze ngo ha- ri abajepe baza -aga . ||| they were many . there were interahamwe as we 've been saying . the last one has just evoked republican guards who used to come where he was .

ntabwo rero ibyo ngibyo ba- bi- shyira k' umutwe wa munyakzi . ||| so munyakazi should not be responsible for all those crimes !
mwazabibaza iyo mitwe yi- ca -aga abantu ariko ntabwo mwabigereka k' umutwe wa liyetona koroneli munyakazi . ||| you should ask those groups of killers but not bring all those accusations against the lieutenant @-@ colonel !

tu- kijije abantu benshi i- ki- bi- tera ubungubu nuwo n- twaye mu modoka a- shobora ku- gera hano a- ka- bi- hakana . ||| we actually saved many people . the only problem is that even someone i carried in my car denies it when he arrives here !
ariko nge abo bapadiri n- vuga bose ba- ri muri za corelasiyo ...... ku- rasa kuri arishoveki . ||| however , all those priests were closely connected to ... as far as shooting at archbishop 's palace is concerned .

ni ibihe bintu bi- komeye wibuka bi- baye muri jenoside ? ni iki ki- ku- goye cyane ? ||| during the genocide , what is the memory , which is the strongest , the most difficult for you to recall ?
ikintu muri ... n- vuga nko muri jenoside ki- n- babaje cyane ku babyeyi banjye , n- vuga nk' ukuntu ba- pfuye . mbere y' uko ba- pfa uko ba- bi- n- bwiye n' uko baje ku- ba- fata aho ba- ri ba- ri , icyambabaje cyane ni uko mama ya- ri a- rwaye . ||| the thing that hurts the most as far as my parents are concerned is the way they died .
ya- ri a- rwaye malaliya , ngo ya- ri yi- riwe ... ya- ri ya- raye a- meze nabi a- hinda umushyitsi ; a- ruka ... kubera malaliya , nta n' imiti ya- bonye , ||| i was told that when they came to get them , my mother had been sick with malaria , she did n't have medication and she had been shivering and throwing up the whole night and they came that morning .
icyo gitondo nicyo baje ku- mu- byutsa -mo . ba- ra- mu- fata kuko ngo ya- ri a- meze nabi . ngo ya- ri a- rwaye , a- fite imbeho a- ta- i- tira . ||| my big brother was moping the floor and listening to the radio even though they were hiding .
mukuru wanjye we ngo ya- ri a- ri -mo a- kora isuku aho ba- ri bi- hishe , ha- ri mu gitondo ba- ri -mo bakoropa ... a- ri -mo akoropa nawe , y- umva radio a- ta- zi ibyo aribyo , u- ra- umva ya- ri umuntu w' umwana . ||| what hurts the most about my father is that they shot him five bullets and he was there agonizing for two days with no medication .
wenda n- vuga ko we , icyambabaje cyane kuri we , ni ukuntu ... ni iminsi ya- maze a- ta- ra- pfa . ba- ra- mu- rashe amasasu a- gera kuri atanu , ||| he was just there and there was no enough medication .
a- ki- ryamye nta miti a- fite yo ku- mu- vura , a- ri aho ku- sa nta muti . n' imiti ba- bonye i- ka- ba i- ta- hagije . icyo ki- ha -e ki- maze ku- shira a- tangiye ku- kira ba- ra- ongera ba- ra- garuka . ||| two days later when he started to feel better , they came back and finished him .
n- i- baza ko icyo ki- ha -e ya- maze ... n- jya n- vuga nti @: "@ i- ya- ba ya- ra- hise a- pfa . @" kubera ko igihe ya- maze a- ta- ra- pfa , nicyo n- bona ki- mu- babaje cyane kuko ya- ki- maze nta kintu ... a- babaye . ||| it hurts me and i always feel like it would have been better if he had died right away without going through so much pain .
ibyo bintu bu- ri ki- ha -e iyo n- bi- tekereje bi- ra- n- babaza cyane . ||| those are the two most painful things .
icyo ki- ha -e wowe u- ri u- ri he ? ||| where were you at that time ?
njyewe bi- jya kuba tu- ri tu- giye kwa nyogokuru , ||| we had gone to my grandmother 's place before it started .
tu- genda ba- vuga bati @: "@ ino ahangaha ha- ri umutekano mukeya , ||| they said that here in kigali there was no security and the best thing to do was to split into two and maybe some of us would survive .
reka i- bi- i- za tu- tandukana -e , kuko ba- shobora ... twebwe tu- shobora ku- sigara . @" noneho tu- jya -yo , n- ri ndi i ki- ta- arama kwa nyogokuru wanjye aho ba- ita i taba . ||| i was in gitarama at my grandmother 's place ; it is called igitwe .
u- menye u- ta -e uburyo umuryango wawe wishwe ? ||| how did you find out about the way in which your family was killed ?
uko n- bi- umva , uko n- bi- bona ba- ishwe ... ba- ishwe nabi . ||| they killed them very badly .
kubera ko mbere yuko ba- pfa , ba- ba- n- je ku- jya ba- ba- jyana hirya no hino , ba- ka- ba- shorera ba- ka- ba- jyana nk' ibirometero nka bitanu a- ri nk' abantu ba- gera ku ijana ... abantu babavugiriza induru ba- ba- kubita ... ba- ba- kubita amahiri ... ubwo buryo ba- pfuye -mo nibwo ... nabyo bi- ra- n- babaza . muri ubwo buryo , ||| before then , they 'd make them walk around for maybe five kilometres , they were about a hundred people and they were shouting at them and beating them up .
mbere y' uko ba- na- pfa , n- umva n- jya -e ba- ra- ishwe nabi cyane . ||| the way they died is also something that hurts me a lot .
kugirango ... ba- geze n' umunsi wo ku- pfa mbere y' aho ba- ba- n- je ku- jya ba- irukanka , ba- ka- ba- vumbura mu bihuru aho ba- ri ba- ri . ba- ka- ba- kubita , ba- ka- ba- tuka , ||| even the day they killed them , they still run after them , beat them up and insulted them .
ba- ka- ba- saba -ir imbabazi , nabo ubwabo bagatakamba ba- aka ... ba- ka- inginga ... n- bona ko icyo ki- ha -e cyose , ||| they pleaded with them to let them live but they refused .
bi- ruta -w n' uko ba- ri ku- pfa ku munsi wa mbere . ||| i think it would have been better for them to die straight away , on the first day .
papa wawe n' abasirikare ba- ri ba- banye ku- ta -e ? ||| what was the relationship between your dad and that soldier ?
ese ba- ri inshuti ... ? ||| were they good friends ?
icyo n- vuga ni uko papa nta ba- n- zi n- zi ya- ri a- fite . ||| all i can say is that my dad did not have any enemies .
ba- ba abasirikare , nta kibazo ya- gira -an -aga nabo . ||| he did not have any problems even with the soldiers .
ku buryo n' abantu bo muri kano ka- ca -e ba- ra- mu- kunda -aga . kuko ba- mu- kundira -aga ko ibibazo ba- mu- bwira -aga yarabibakemuriraga , ya- ba a- ba- sanze ku muhanda a- fite i modoka a- ka- ba- twara , nta modoka a- fite ba- ka- zamuka -an n' amaguru ba- ganira ku- gera kuri taxi . ||| people in this area liked him because he used to help them out with the problems they 'd submit to him , he used to give them a ride the days he 'd have a car and they days he did not have one they would walk up to the taxi together .
ya- ba a- fite amafaranga ba- ka- mu- saba bati @: "@ tu- sengera -ir -e a- ka- ba- sengera -ir . @" ||| he used to buy them a drink when he 'd have money .
n' abasirikare nabo nta kibazo ya- ri afitanye nabo . ahubwo ya- ri a- fite n' abasirikare bamwe na bamwe b' inshuti ze . ku buryo n- umva nta kibazo yarafitanye n' abasirikare , uretse n' abasirikare nta n' undi ba- ri bafitanye ikibazo . ||| even soldiers did not have any problems with him ; in fact some of them were his friends . he was in good terms with not just the soldiers but with everyone else .
iyo u- bona -an -aga papa wawe n' uwo mugabo w' umwicanyi u- bona -aga ba- meze ba- ta -e ? ||| if you saw your dad with that particular man , what would their relationship have been ?
ese u- bona -aga a- ri inshuti nziza ... ese ba- baga ba- ganira neza ... ? u- bona -aga ba- sabanye ku- ta -e n' iyo nshuti ye , ||| friendly ? would they drink beer together ? would they work together ? would they sit and talk ?

abo mu ka- ba- ri nabo ba- ra- hura -aga basengeranira . a- ka- ba- setsa ibiganiro bi- meze neza , ||| his friends in bars were people they used to buy each other a drink and he used to make jokes together .
ndetse n' uwo mugabo wu- n- ri u- mu- gambana -iye nawe ya- ri umuntu w' inshuti ye cyane . ||| even the man who betrayed him was his very good friend .

ndetse n' abantu bo mu muryango wacu baza -aga mu rugo , baza ku- mu- sura , a- baza ku- mu- saba amafaranga , a- baza ku- mu- saba conseille [ bamugisha inama ] , ||| our family members used to always come home to visit him or ask him for money or to simply seek advice from him .
abo bose baza -aga hano bu- ri ki- ha -e , ha- hora -aga abantu baza -aga bu- ri ki- ha -e . ||| there were always people here in our house .
u- ba u- zi uko mama wawe y- ishwe ? ||| do you know how your mother died precisely ? did somebody tell you ?
wowe ubwawe u- ba u- ra- bonye aho bi- ca abantu ? tu- vuga -e nk' aho u- ri u- ri i ki- ta- arama , wigeze u- bona ahantu ha- korerwa ubwicanyi ? n- bwira ibyo u- bonye muri icyo ki- ha -e . ||| from where you were in gitarama , did you see the killings taking place , not of your family but ... ? if so , what did you see ? how did the killers go about doing their work ?
uburyo n- bonye bi- ca abantu , n- bonye abantu benshi . ||| i saw many people being killed .
ariko nk' ibyo n- ibuka ha- ri umugabo rwose n- bonye interahamwe zi- ra- mu- vumbuye ahantu ya- ri yi- hishe ba- ri ba- fite u- bu- ha- i- ri , ||| i remember in particular this man who was found by the interahamwes from his hiding place .
ba- ri ba- fite imihoro , baramwirukankana . n- ra- mu- bonye y- irukanse a- gerageza ku- ba- siga ariko bamwirukankanye nk' iminota igera kuri itanu ba- ta- ra- mu- fata . ||| some had clubs , others machetes , they run after him for about five minutes before they caught him .

umugabo nta n' ikindi kintu ya- koze , ya- hise yi- kubita hasi a- ra- pfa . ||| he did not do anything ; he just fell down and died right away .
ibindi n- bonye ha- ri umukobwa n- bonye ba- ishe , uwo mu- kobwa bamwishe nabi . ||| the other thing i saw is this girl who was also killed very badly .
nawe ba- ba- n- je ku- mu- vumbura baramwirukankana , ||| they found the place where she was hiding also and run after her .
ku- jya kumwica ya- ba- n- je ku- taka ya- maze nk' iminota nka mrongo itatu [ 30 ] a- ta- ra- pfa , ||| she was left there agonizing for about thirty minutes and i was hearing everything .
a- ki- boroga n- ra- bi- umva -aga . ariko n- bonye a- pfa ariko nti- n- igeze n- gira ingufu zo kumwegera ngo n- reba -e aho ya- ri a- ri . kuko ha- ri ha- ki- ri abantu ba- seka bi- shimye ba- vuga bati @: "@ tu- vumbuye umuntu . @" ||| i saw her dying but i did not have the strength to approach her , as they were still standing next to her , laughing , happy to have found a prey .
wowe muri wowe i- n- bera -e mu mu- ta- ima wawe wu- n- va -aga u- meze u- ta -e ? ||| how did you feel ? what was your predominant emotion at that time ? what was your main feeling at that time yves ? how were you feeling inside ?
mu mu- ta- ima wanjye n- umva -aga ... n- ri n- ki- ri umwana ariko muri n- jya -e n- umva -aga ... n- baga n- babaye cyane . ||| i was still a child but inside of me i was very sad .
uretse no kuba n- ri n- fite ubwoba , ubwoba bwo bu- geze aho bu- ra- shira . ||| i was also scared but it reached a point where all the fear went .
ariko noneho n- gera aho bi- ra- n- yobera . n- ka- umva nti- n- zi ibyo n- ri -mo , nk' umva nti- n- zi n' aho ndi . ||| i reached a point where i felt like i did not know what was going on , or where i was .
ku- bona umuntu yi- ca undi , ku- bona umuntu y- irukanka -an undi , ||| seeing a human being killing another one or running after him or her .
ni -yo wenda a- ta- baga ya- pfuye u- ka- bona a- ri -mo ku- samba cyangwa u- ka- bona ba- mu- temye a- fite ibikomere umubiri wose , n' ibintu nti- umva -aga n- ta- na- basha -aga no ku- sobanukirwa . ||| seeing them agonizing or having wounds all over their bodies because they cut them down is something i was not capable of grasping or fully understanding .
n- baga n- fite agahinda kenshi cyane . ||| i was so miserable ! there 's a day i kept feeling very sad without really knowing why .
ndetse ha- ri n' igihe n- je no ku- menya ... mbere y' uko ... ariko nti- n- ri ndi mu rugo , ariko ha- ri iminsi yi- geze ku- gera n- umva n- tekereje mu rugo cyane . n- ka- umva n- ra- babaye , n- ka- umva n- ta- hangayitse . ||| i felt very uncomfortable , very confused despite the fact that it had been a good day as no one was chasing after me .
icyo ki- ha -e n- fashe agapapuro n- andika itariki . iyo tariki n- je ku- sanga a- ri nayo ya- huye muri iyo minsi mu rugo ba- pfuye -mo . ||| i wrote down the date and i later on found out that it was around that time that my family was murdered .
kuko icyo ki- ha -e n- iriwe ndira , ||| i had spent the whole day crying without really knowing why .
umunsi wose bi- ra- n- yobera . kandi icyo ki- ha -e niwo munsi tu- ri tu- bonye a- ka- ha- enga -e kuko nta bantu ba- baga ba- ha- ri baje ku- tu- vumbura . ||| it was quite a peaceful day as no one had come where we were hiding on that day .
noneho uwo munsi bi- ra- n- yobera n- ka- umva nta mahoro n- fite n- irirwa ndira n- ka- tekereza mu rugo cyane n- tekereza mukuru wanjye ; ||| but on that day i was not at peace at all , i kept thinking about home , about my brother .
icyo n- fashe agapapuro n- ra- bi- andika . agapapuro n- ta- ka- bika itariki n- yi- fata mu mu- ta -w -e . ||| i wrote down the date and kept the peace of paper and memorized the date .
icyo ki- ha -e ni -ho n- je no ku- baza neza n- sanga ibyongibyo ni -ho bi- bereye . ||| later on i found out that it was the time it happened .
ni ryari u- menye ko ababyeyi bawe ba- ishwe ? ||| when did you find out about your parents and brother ?
u- menye ryari ibyabaye ? ||| when did you find out what had happened ?
n- je ku- bi- menya nyuma ya jenoside . ||| i was told about it after the genocide .
kuko n- jya -e n- umva -aga ba- ta- pfuye . n- ri n- i- shyize -mo yuko wenda ba- shobora kuba ba- ki- ha- ri . ||| i was so convinced they were still alive ; i had convinced myself that they were not dead .
nyuma n- bi- menye nko mu ... n- ba- bi- menye banza -e ku- bi- tu- bwira kuko ba- umva -aga nibabitubwira se tu- ra- bi- genza tu- ta -e ? n- je ku- bi- menya nko mu kwa munani , ||| i learnt about it later on in august . the people who knew what had happened did not know how to tell us , as they did not know how we were going to handle it .
jenoside ya- ra- rangiye nibwo n- je ku- bi- menya ... mushiki wanjye nibwo tu- ganiriye neza , a- bi- n- bwira neza a- n- bwira uko bi- genze ... ha- ri mu kwa munani jenoside ya- ra- rangiye . ||| one day my sister and i had a long conversation and she told me what had happened . it was in august , when the genocide was over .
kuko ntabwo n- ri n- zi aho ba- ri , kuko n- maze amezi angahe tu- ba twenyine , nta muntu wo muri famille [ mu muryango ] tu- bana ni -ho n- bi- menye . ||| i did not know where they were and we spent some months living on our own without any family members .
u- shobora ku- gerageza ku- n- bwira ikintu u- bonye muri jenoside ki- ta- jya ki- ku- va -mo ? ikintu u- hora wibuka . ||| could you describe for me something that you saw during the genocide that really stays in your mind that you can not get out of your mind ?
ikintu cyo muri jenoside ki- ta- shobora ka- umva -mo , ikintu ki- n- bera -e n- ibuka ni n- goma -w u- gomba ku- menya ko ababyeyi bawe ba- pfuye . icyo kintu nti- ki- shobora ka- umva -mo . ||| the thing about the genocide that i can never forget is first of all the fact that my parents were killed .
ku- ibuka ukuntu abantu ba- ishwe , ukuntu ba- icwa -aga nabi kandi ba- ri abana beza , a- ri abakobwa beza cyangwa ababyeyi beza . ||| the ways in which people were killed , and yet they were innocent children , innocent women , innocent parents , is also something i can never forget .
ibyo bintu byo muri jenoside , ku- bona imirambo cyangwa ku- genda u- simbuka imirambo . kuba u- shaka ku- ryama ntu- ryama -e ahubwo u- shaka nk' ikoti u- ka- ri- ambura umuntu u- pfuye wowe u- ka- ri- fata , n' ibintu bi- ta- shobora ka- umva -mo . ||| jumping over dead bodies , not being able to sleep , having to steal a jacket from the dead all these are things i can never forget .
nti- n- shobora ku- jya ku- ryama n- ta- tekereje ukuntu mu rugo ba- pfuye , ||| i can never forget .
cyangwa se n- ta- tekereje ukuntu abana ba- pfuye . cyangwa se abantu ba- pfuye n- ba n- ri n- zi n' ukuntu ba- pfuye n' ibintu bi- ta- shobora ka- umva -mo na rimwe . ||| i can not go to bed without thinking about them and remembering how they were killed , or without thinking about other children who died or other people i knew . it is not something that i can ever forget .
kuri wowe kuba umuntu u- citse ku icumu wu- n- va bi- vuze iki ? ||| what does it mean to be a survivor ?
ni izihe n- garuka zo ku- rokoka jenoside ? ||| what is the consequence for you as a person ?
jyewe ku- rokoka , iyo umuntu a- rokotse nibwo u- menya ... nibwo n- je ku- sanga agaciro k' ubuzima . ||| surviving taught me the value of life .
kuko ku- rokoka n' ikintu ba- ita ... iyo umuntu a- giye ku- pfa a- ka- rokoka . niba u- ri u- giye ku- tema -w u- ka- gira ima -an u- ka- bona ako kanya n- tu- tema -w -e u- ka- bona u- fite umunsi w' ejo . ni -ho koko u- hita u- bona ko ubuzima bw' umuntu a- ri ikintu ki- henze ; ni -ho koko u- hita u- menya ko ubuzima bw' umuntu a- ta- ri ikintu cyo ku- kinisha . ||| when you escape death , when maybe someone was about to cut you down and does not do it and you 're still alive the next day , that is when you appreciate life .
ubuzima bw' undi cyangwa se ubwawe . ||| you then realize that your life or other people 's lives are of great value .
kuko nawe ikiba ki- ku- baye -ho ni nako ki- ba ki- baye ... ninako ki- na- ba no ku wu- n- ri muntu iyo u- giye ku- mu- korera ibintu nk' ibyo ngibyo u- giye ku- korerwa . ni nayo mpamvu iyo n- giye ku- kora ikintu n- banza ku- tekereza jyewe uyu muntu a- ki- n- koreye bi- genda bite . ||| you understand that everyone gets affected by things just like you do .
iyo n- giye ku- korera umuntu ikintu n- ri- baza nti ese a- ri njyewe a- ki- koreye n- bi- fata n- ta -e ? ||| i now think twice before i do something bad to others because i know it hurts others as much as it could hurt me .
kuko iyo umuntu a- citse ku icumu ni -ho hantu wu- n- va ko ubuzima a- ri bwiza , kandi ubuzima a- ri ikintu umuntu a- gomba ka- ubaha , bu- ba ubwawe cyangwa bu- ba ubw' abandi ||| it taught me respect for both my life and for other people 's lives .
u- tu- bwira uburyo ababyeyi bawe bashyinguwe ? ||| how were your parents buried yves ?
n- vuga ko uburyo ba- hambwe -mo ntabwo bu- n- shima -ish -ije . ||| i would say that they way they buried them did not please me .
kuko nko mu muco wa kinyarwanda iyo umuntu a- pfuye , haba ha- ri abantu . ||| in the rwandan culture , when someone dies , people come and mourn with you .
abantu ba- ra- za ba- ka- gira i- ki- ri -yo ... ariko bo ba- ra- ishwe ba- ra- ba- fata ba- ba- jugunya ahantu mu myanda ... ha- ta- meze neza , bon ... kuri n- jya -e n- umva ba- ta- ra- hambwe . ||| they killed them and threw them into some garbage , so to me they were not buried .
ni nacyo kintu nabyo mu bi- n- babaza bya jenoside icyo kintu nacyo ki- ra- n- babaza cyane . kuko n- babaza -w n' uko n- ta- bashije kuba bi- i- buze mu rugo , ||| that is actually one of the things that really hurt about the genocide .
ku- bona umurambo wabo cyangwa kuba n- ta- ra- bi- hamba -iye cyangwa kuba tu- ta- ra- ba- hambye nk' umuryango , ||| i wish we had at least buried them as a family .
ibyo bintu bi- ra- n- babaza cyane . n- vuga ko ba- ta- hambwe kuko iyo u- fashe umuntu u- ka- mu- jugunya , u- ka- mu- jugunya aho u- bonye , kandi ya- ri umuntu wiyubashye , ||| i would n't say that they were buried because getting somebody 's body and throwing it anywhere and yet they were some respectable and innocent person is not a burial .
u- kunda -aga abantu nta kintu kibi ya- koze , n- i- baza ko a- ri ibintu ... si u- ku- hamba ni ibintu bibi . ||| it is so wrong !
ibyo u- bi- menye u- ta -e ? wabimenyeye he ? ese u- biba -w -iye -w ni iki ? ||| can you tell me where you found them and when you found them and how you found them ?
ku ba- ba- bonye ubundi ba- ri ba- ri kubaturanyi , ||| people had seen them as they were at the neighbours .
ha- ri ha- ri na mushiki wanjye nawe u- ri kumwe nabo , u- na- ba- bonye ba- bi- ca . ya- ra- ha- tu- eretse ati @: "@ ni ahangaha ba- ba- hambye . @" ||| even my sister who was with them saw the way they killed them .

none se yves u- tekereza ko u- shobora ku- babarira abantu ba- ku- iciye ababyeyi ? u- bona bi- shoboka ? ||| yves , do you think you can forgive the people who killed your parents and your brother ?
kuri n- jya -e bi- ra- komeye cyane . ||| it is very hard .
ku- babarira ntabwo a- ri ibintu byoroshye . ntabwo n- vuga ngo @: mpite n- bi- vuga aka kanya ngo @: ||| forgiveness is not easy .
n- vuga -e ngo n- babarira umuntu u- n- gize gutya , u- tumye n- tagira ababyeyi , nta mera nk' abandi bana . n- tagira affection [ urukundo ] y' ababyeyi , ||| i can not just say that i can forgive the person who took my parents away , the person who made me the way i am , who made me to be different from other children , without the affection and the presence of my parents .
n- ta- basha kuba -an nabo . ntabwo a- ri ibintu byoroshye . ntabwo a- ri ibintu nakwishoboza ngo n- vuga -e ngo n- babarira umuntu u- n- yi- ciye . ||| forgiveness is not easy and it is not something i could do on my own .
n' u- ta- ra- n- yi- ciye ya- ri- ciye abandi , n- ba n- umva nawe n- ta- pfa ku- mu- babarira . noneho rero nk' uwanyiciye n- ba n- umva a- ta- ri ibintu byoroshye . yewe n' uwishe n' umuntu n- ta- zi , ||| it is already hard enough to forgive the person who killed other people apart from my parents .
ariko a- ri umuntu ntabwo byoroshye ku- mu- babarira . n- n- jya -e uwanyiciye , uwanyiciye nk' ababyeyi aho ho bi- ra- komeye ntabwo a- ri ibintu byoroshye . ni ibintu bi- saba nk' igihe kirekire cyane . ||| forgiving my parents ' murderer is a lot more difficult ; it is something that would require that i think about it for a long time .
u- bona ha- ri icyo ubutabera bu- korwa cyangwa bu- koze mu ku- ku- rengera cyangwa ku- rengera umuryango wawe ? ||| do you feel that justice has been done for you and your family ?
n- vuga ko ubutabera , ||| justice ?
ku- va uwanyiciye n- ta- zi naho a- ri . wenda a- shobora kuba a- ri muri prison ahantu . ubutabera n- umva kuri n- jya -e , n- umva nta ki- ra- korwa kuri n- jya -e . ||| since i do not even know where the person who killed my family is ; maybe he is somewhere in jail ... to me , it is like nothing has been done as far as justice is concerned .
kuko iyo u- bonye umuntu wenda u- ku- iciye a- kata -ir -w imyaka itanu , ||| when you see someone who killed your family members being condemned for something like five years , you know that , sooner or later , the five years will be over and then he will be released .
ubwo ni u- ku- vuga ngo n- i- mara ku- shira a- za- fungurwa .. ku- fungwa ku- sa n' igihano ariko n- bona jya -e ubwo bu- tabera bu- ta- ranga -ir -ho kuko n- ta- ra- bu- bona , ||| being imprisoned is a punishment yes , but personally justice has not yet come my way because i have never seen it .
nta ru- banza ba- ra- cira umuntu u- n- yi- ciye ngo n- vuga -e ngo wenda ba- mu- kata -iye urupfu cyangwa se ku- fungwa burundu . ibyo nabyo n- umva a- ta- ri igihano , ||| they have never judged the people who killed my family , so that i maybe say that they were condemned to death or to life imprisonment .
n- umva ubwo bu- tabera n- ta- zi ubwo a- ri bwo , ||| therefore , i do n't consider that as a punishment , actually i wonder which type of justice that is .
nti- n- ta- tekereza ubwo a- ri bwo ngo n- umva -e ndenganuwe . ||| neither have i ever analysed it to see if it [ justice ] has been done to me .
yee , ha- ri umuntu umwe n- igeze ku- bona , nubwo a- ta- ishe ariko nawe ya- ri a- ri mu bantu ba- ri ba- ri aho ngaho ba- bi- ishima -iye . n- ra- mu- bonye . ||| i once saw one of the people who were present and who were happy about it even though he is not the one who killed them .
u- mu- bonye se u- vuze iki ... u- koze iki ... u- bi- i- twaye -mo u- ta -e ? ||| what did you say ? what did you do ? how did you react ?
ntabwo n- igeze n- gira imbaraga zo ka- ongera ku- mu- vuga -ish , ||| i did not have the strength to talk to him .

kuko ya- ri a- n- zi n- n- jya -e n- ri mu- zi , ku- mu- vuga -ish n- umva -aga n- tabona icyo mu- vuga -ish , ||| there was nothing to talk about , he knew who i was and i also knew him .
nti- n- mu- suhuza , sina ... bi- ra- n- yobeye n- ra- mu- reka . ||| should i have greeted him ? i did not know what to do so i left it there .
u- bona ha- ri isomo tu- kura muri jenoside ? ||| do you think we learn anything from the genocide ? is the genocide useful in any way ?
jenoside n- jya -e n- bona ha- ri icyo ya- tu- igishije . ku giti cyanjye jenocide ya- n- y- igishije ku- menya agaciro k' ubuzima . jenoside ya- n- y- igishije ku- menya ko burya iyo umuntu a- fite ababyeyi a- ri ikintu ki- komeye . kuba u- ta- ba- fite nibyo bi- ku- ha ku- menya ... ku- menya koko ko ababyeyi b' umuntu a- ri ingirakamaro . ||| personally the genocide taught me the value of life , it taught me to appreciate having parents .
jenoside ya- n- y- igishije byinshi . ||| loosing them is what makes you realize the importance of having them .
ya- n- y- igishije ka- ubaha ubuzima bw' abandi . jenoside n- vuga ko ya- tumye menya nk' uko n- bi- vuze ka- ubaha ubuzima bw' abandi , ituma menya y' uko ubuzima bwanjye n- gomba ku- bu- fata neza nkabwubaha , ||| the genocide taught me respect for other people 's lives as well as respect for my own life .
kandi n' ubwabandi ... n- ra- umva a- ri ibyo . ||| that 's it !
yves u- tekereza yuko jenoside i- shobora ka- ongera kuba mu rwanda ? ||| yves do you think the genocide is possible again here ?
n- ra- umva ... n- jya -e n- umva bi- ta- shoboka . ||| i think it is impossible .
n- jya -e n- umva n- ta- bi- izeye nkurikije ibyo n- bona n- bona n- ta- bi- izeye . kubera ko n- umva jenoside i- ta- ka- ongera kuba -ho , n- bona i- ta- za- n- ongera . ||| from what i see i believe it can never happen again .
kubera ko iyo n- bona nk' urubyiruko tungana ingufu ba- shyira -mo ba- rwanya ibyo bintu byose tugarageza no ka- ongera ku- bi- ibuka , kandi bi- tu- babaje , kandi tu- bona ingaruka bi- tu- gize -ho , ||| when i look at the way today 's youth really fights against it all and the way they really want to fight it and remember it no matter how hard it is , and when we look at the consequences it had on us , i do n't think it is possible !
n- bona bi- ta- shoboka . ||| i think it is impossible !
kandi n- bona nk' uko tu- jya tu- bi- ganira tu- kora n' i- bi- shoboka byose kugirango wenda nti- i- ongera -e . ||| and as we were saying , we need to do all we can for it not to happen again .
u- ra- umva u- fite ibyiringiro ? ||| are you just being hopeful , or do you believe it ?
n- umva ubuzima bw' ejo ha- za- za bwanjye n- umva bu- za- ba bwiza . kandi n- umva n- ifuza kuba umuntu u- shobora ku- gira icyo yi- mara -ir , n- n- jya -e n- ka- gira umwuga nk' abandi , nk' uko tu- ri tu- meze mbere . ||| i believe my future will be good ; my desire is to be responsible for my life and to be able to help others the way we used to be before .
ibyo ku- iga byo ni n- gomba -w kugirango u- gira -e ubuzima bwiza . kandi n- umva ndi umuntu u- ba -ho n- fasha abandi ba- fite ubuzima bubi , ||| it will take a good education , which is a must for one to be able to have a good life and to be able to help out others .
bagenzi banjye wenda tungana n- ta- n- shobora kuba n- fite icyo n- rusha , ||| others who are poor and whose lives are worse than mine .
n- umva mu minsi i- rimba -ir -e n- za- gerageza ku- gira icyo n- n- jya -e n- ba- fasha , muri bike n- ba n- fite n- umva n- gerageza ku- gira icyo n- ba- fasha . ||| i believe i will soon be able to help them out with the little i will be having .
n- umva ubuzima bw' ejo ha- za- za bu- za- ba bwiza . kurenza ubwashize uko bu- ri bu- meze mu myaka cumi i- shize . ||| i believe the future will be better than the last ten years have been .
u- bona u rwanda nk' igihugu ru- kwa -iye ku- kura somo ki ku bi- baye ? ||| what do you think rwanda has to learn as a country ? and how is the best way to do it ?
jya -e n- bona isomo u rwanda ru- vana -mo ... ... n- bona bi- baye mu rwanda kuko u rwanda n' igihugu gitoya kandi cyiza , n- bona abanyarwanda ri- ba isomo y' uko ba- gomba ku- kundana , gufashanya nicyo kintu ki- tuma u rwanda ... kandi no ku- ta- ibagirwa ... ku- ta- ibagirwa ibyahise . ||| rwanda is a small , beautiful country and i believe all rwandans should learn to love each other and to help each other out .
ku- hora ba- ibuka kandi ba- ka- tekereza gufashanya . ||| they also need to always remember what happened and to try and love each other and to help each other out .
kuko ibingibi byose kugirango biba -e n' uko abantu ba- ta- kundana -aga . ||| because for all this to happen , people did not love or respect each other .
kandi abantu ba- ta ... ba- suzugura -an -ye nta muntu wu- basha -ye ubuzima bw' undi . kandi ku- bi- kora nabyo kugirango ba- bi- gera -e -ho bi- ra- komeye . ||| nobody respected other people 's loves .
kuko bu- ri muntu wese aba a- fite ibibazo bye , aba a- fite i- bi- mu- hangayika -ish -ije . i- ya- ba abantu ba- shobora -aga ku- menya ko ibibazo by' undi u- gomba ku- bi- umva , nawe u- ka- mu- bwira ibyawe ni -ho abantu bafashanya . ||| it will take a lot to make it happen as each rwandan has his or her own problems ; if people were understanding what challenges we go through individually , we would be able to help each other more effectively .
ni izihe n- gora -an -e zi- komeye u- bona zi- komoka ku kuba umuntu u- citse ku icumu ? ||| what 's the most difficult aspect of being a survivor ?
ikintu n- bona ki- komeye nk' umuntu u- citse ku icumu ... ki- gora cy' umuntu u- citse ku icumu n' u- ku- ibuka ibyakubayeho . ||| the thing that constitutes a challenge in being a survivor is remembering what happened to you .
kuko iyo wibutse ibyakubayeho ha- ri igihe bi- shobora ku- tuma ubuzima bwawe bu- pfa . iyo u- citse ku icumu ha- ri ibintu u- ba u- fite wibuka bibi bi- shobora kuba bi- ku- buza ku- gira ikindi kintu u- kora . bi- shobora no kuba bi- ku- hindura mu mu- ta- ima wawe , ||| sometimes as a survivor you can remember so many bad things that it destroys your life , it stops you from doing anything .
u- ka- ba u- hinduka umugome , kubera ibyo u- huye nabyo , cyangwa ibyo u- bonye . ||| you can change to become a very wicked person because of the things you saw or the things you went through .
ku- cika ku icumu ikintu ... ingaruka ... n- vuga nk' ingaruka mbi y' ikintu ki- tuma ubuzima bu- komera nk' uko n- bi- vuze nk' ibyo u- bonye , ||| being a survivor can make life very hard as i said because of what you saw .
ibyo u- huye nabyo bi- shobora kuba bi- ku- hindura , uko u- reba abantu bi- ka- ba bi- tuma nta muntu u- kunda . kubera ko u- huye n' ubuzima bubi . ||| what you saw might change the way you look at people and it can even stop you from loving anyone .
bi- ka- ba bi- tuma rwa rukundo u- ri u- fite ru- shobora no guhungabana ku bantu . ||| your love for people can be completely destroyed . you get to see so much evil that you do not fear anything anymore .
kuko u- tinyuka ibintu byinshi . u- bona ibintu byinshi bibi . nyuma yaho rero ubuzima bu- ka- ku- komera -ir bu- ka- tuma nta kintu u- gera -ho . ||| even afterwards , life becomes so challenging that you can not achieve anything in life .
u- ryama ugashiguka , kubera ya mihoro u- bonye abantu ba- ku- ri hejuru ... ku- bona uko umwana y- icwa . ||| you sleep and you 're woken up by nightmares of people with machetes who want to kill . or you remember the child you saw being killed .
icyo n' icyo kintu n- bona ki- komera -ir abantu ba- citse ku icumu . ||| that 's the thing that i think can be such a challenge for the survivors .
ni ibyababayeho kandi bi- ki- ba- gira -ho ingaruka , mu buzima bwabo . ||| it affects them for the rest of their lives .
u- vuze ko mama wawe ya- jya -aga a- ku- gira inama y' uko u- gomba ku- i- twara . none se ubu a- ta- ki- ri -ho u- gerageje u- ta -e ku- bi- shyira mu bi- korwa ? ||| you said that your mother gave you advice on how to behave when she is no longer here . how have you done that ? what 's the advice that she gave you and how have you done that ?
n- vuga nk' ibyo ya- n- bwiye by' ukuntu n- gomba ku- i- twara igihe a- ta- za- ba ahari , ||| maybe i can talk about how she told me how i should behave in her absence .
ya- ra- vuga -aga ati @: "@ u- jya -e u- kunda abantu , kandi u- jya -e u- tekereza kuba -an n' abantu neza . @" ||| she told me , "@ you should love people and always think of living with people peacefully . @"
ibyo ya- ra- bi- n- bwiye kandi a- ki- bi- n- bwira n- i- bajije impamvu a- bi- n- bwiye . ariko nyuma n- je ku- bi- tekereza -ho n- i- baza ... a- ta- ki- ha- ri n- bona koko ko ibyo bintu n- gomba kubikurikiza . ||| then i wondered why she told me that but later on ; when she was no longer there , i thought about it again and i realized how important it is .
nyuma yaho ubungubu ibyo bintu n- ba- igendera -ho , ni ibintu mpora n- ibuka cyane . n- gerageza kuba -an na bu- ri muntu wese neza . ||| i always think about it and try my best to live in good terms with everybody .
n' iyo umuntu ya- ba a- ku- gira -iye nabi u- gerageza ku- bi- irengagiza . kuko burya nta muntu u- tagira nabi nawe bi- shobora ku- kuba -ho . ||| even when somebody hurts me , i try not to focus on that , as it is something that has to be there .
n- gerageza ku- kunda abantu ... ka- umva ikibazo cya mugenzi wanjye . ibyo nibyo n- genda -ir -ho kubera ko ya- bi- n- bwiye . kandi n- ka- gerageza ku- vuga nti @: ya- bi- n- bwiye a- zi impamvu kandi ya- bi- n- bwiye a- riwe muntu u- n- kunda -aga bwa mbere . ||| i try to love people and to understand people and what kind of challenges they face in life .
ni ibintu mpora n- gerageza ku- kora . ||| it is something i try my best to be able to put into practice .
ha- shize iminsi u- kora ku mu- shinga wo ka- ubaka urwibutso rwa gisozi . ||| you 've been working on the project in gisozi .
u- tu- bwira impamvu ? ||| why ... ?
kuku ... n- umva biriya bintu byo ku gisozi , n- bona a- ri ibintu bi- tu- reba kandi tu- gomba ku- kora . ||| because the gisozi project is ours and we need to be the ones to do it .
kuko n- bona umuntu a- ta- bi- koze n- bona nta wu- n- ri muntu u- bi- kora . ||| if i do not do it , who else will do it ?
kuko n- ba- bi- shobora ni bake . ||| not everyone is capable of doing it .
ku- hora bu- ri ki- ha -e wu- n- va ubuzima bw' abantu ba- pfuye , ku- hora bu- ri ki- ha -e u- reba amafoto y' abantu ba- pfuye , ni ibintu bi- teye agahinda cyane . ||| spending all your time looking into the lives of people who died and looking at their pictures is very sad .
ariko impamvu njyewe n- bi- kora -mo n- ka- bi- shyira -mo ingufu ni uko jyewe n- bona a- ri ibintu bi- gomba kuba -ho . ||| but i do so and i do it with all my strength because it needs to be done .
kugirango n' a- ba- shaka ko byibagirana ba- bi- bura -e . ||| so that even the people who want them to be forgotten will have failed .
n- bona ko umunsi biriya bintu byo ku gisozi umunsi bi- rangiye , n- bona a- ri ibintu bi- za- ba bi- fite ingufu cyane . kuko bi- za- fasha abantu benshi cyane . ||| i think the day the project is completed it will have a lot of impact .
n- ta -w -e ubwacu bi- ra- tu- fasha . ||| it is very helpful even to us .
igihe u- za- jya u- shaka ku- ibuka -ir ababyeyi bawe , cyangwa n' inshuti zawe , cyangwa n' umuryango wawe . ||| the day you will want to remember your friends or your family , you will be able to go there .
n- bona a- ri ahantu tu- za- jya , tu- ka- jya tu- ha- jya ha- ka- tu- fasha . ni -yo mpamvu ku giti cyanjye n- bona a- ri ibintu n- gomba ku- shyira -mo ingufu zi- shoboka . ||| that 's why i give myself fully to that project because it will be of great help .
kandi n- bona a- ri ibintu by' ingirakamaro bi- za- ereka n' amahanga ko koko jenoside ya- baye . ||| it will even show the international community that the genocide actually happened .
u- ra- koze . ||| thank you !
ariko haba ha- ri ikindi kintu u- shaka -aga ku- vuga u- ta- vuze u- ki- vuga . ||| is there anything that you feel you should say that i have n't asked ?
ntacyo narenzaho , ku- sa icyo n- vuga ni uko ubuzima bwanjye nyuma y' imyaka icumi ni ubuzima bu- komeye kandi butoroshye . ||| i do not have much to add but the only thing i can say is that life after ten years is a very difficult life .
abantu ba- zi ko jenoside ya- rangiye ibintu byose bi- rangiye nta kibazo . ||| some people think that the genocide is over and there 's absolutely no problem .
ariko ahubwo nyuma y' imyaka icumi nibwo abantu benshi ba- tangiye ku- bona ingaruka za jenoside . ||| in fact it is now after ten years that some people are starting to realise the consequences of the genocide .
ni nabwo ba- tangiye ku- menya jenoside icyo a- ri cyo kuko ha- ri abantu ba- ki- babaye . ||| some people are getting to understand what genocide is . people are still hurting .
kuko iyo wu- n- va umuntu a- ku- bwira ati @: "@ maze imyaka icumi nti- shima , " n- taba a- ku- beshya . kuko burya aba a- maze imyaka icumi a- ta- ishima . ||| when someone tells you that they have been unhappy for ten years , they mean it .
ubuzima bwa nyuma y' imyaka icumi ni ubuzima butoroshye . kandi n' ubungubu bu- ki- komeye kuko ha- racya- ri kare . n- bona inzira ndende i- ki- ha- ri , kandi tu- za- gerageza kuyi ... tu- ka- gerageza ku ... ku- jya mbere , ||| life ten years later is a tough one and this is still too soon , we still have a long way to go and despite the fact that those who did it do not want us to progress , we will try and move forward .
kuko a- ba- bi- koze ba- shaka ko tu- ba -ho nabi . ni -yo mpamvu tu- gomba ku- gerageza nti- tu- ba -e -ho nabi . kandi n- zi -ko ima -an i- za- tu- fasha tu- ka- ba -ho neza . ||| and i believe god will help us to do so and to be able to help one another .
kandi tukanafashanya kuko a- ba- citse ku icumu bose ntabwo ariko ba- meze neza , imfubyi zi- ha- ri ntabwo a- ri ko zi- meze neza . zi- keneye a- ba- citse ku icumu bagenzi bazo kugirango ba- ba- humuriza -e . ba- ba- bwira -e nabo uko ba- bi- genza kugirango ubwo buzima bubi ba- bu- renga -e . ||| the survivors do not live in good conditions , the orphans have a difficult life and they need other survivors to be able to share the challenges they go through and also the victories , the way out .
n- bona ko a- ba- citse ku icumu tu- ra- kenera -an -ye , kandi tu- gomba gufashanya . ||| i think us survivors need each other .
kuko imfubyi ntabwo zi- shobora , ||| very few people who are not survivors can actually be able to help out a survivor .
nta muntu ... ni abantu bake ba- shobora ... ya- humuriza undi u- citse ku icumu we a- ta- ra- citse ku icumu . ||| whereas a survivor can encourage another one better , as he or she is the one who can relate to what they are going through and who can show them that is it actually possible to overcome .
kuko niwe u- zi ubuzima ya- huye nabwo , kuko niwe u- zi ko ubwo buzima ya- bu- renga kuko burya iyo umuntu a- ku- bwiye ibibazo bye nibwo wu- n- va ko ibyawe nta kibazo wowe u- fite , ||| sometimes hearing about the challenges other people go through makes you feel like yours are less important .
ahubwo u- ka- umva u- gize imbaraga kuko ha- ri undi muntu u- meze nkawe . ||| it instils some strength in you ! that 's my opinion !
izina ryanjye ni murengezi wilbeforce , ||| my name is murengezi wilberforce .
n- ka- ba n- fite imyaka mirogo itanu n' umunani . ||| i am 58 years old .
wilbeforce , umuryango wawe u- ri u- ki- za -w -e n' abantu bangahe , mbere ya jenoside ? ||| wilberforce perhaps you could just tell me , how many people were in your family before the genocide ?
n- ri n- fite ... jyewe n' umugore wanjye n' abana batanu . ||| there was my wife and i and our five children .
none se ha- sigaye bangahe ba- ki- ri -ho nyuma ya jenoside ? ||| and how many of your family are left after the genocide ?
eh , umugore wanjye tu- menya -an -ye kera , tu- ri abanyeshuri muri ecole secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] . ||| i met my wife a long time ago when we were still in secondary school ; we went to the same school .

hanyuma muri 1971 tu- ra- rongora -an . ||| then in 1971 , we got married .
ntabwo rero ya- ri umukobwa tu- pfuye ku- hora ku- sa , ariko n' umuntu tu- banye igihe kirekire tu- ta- ra- rongora -an , ||| therefore , she was not a girl i just met and married but we were together for a long time before marriage .
kandi n' ababyeyi bacu ba- ri ba- ra- zira -an -ye , kuko bose ba- ri abapasitori muri eglise episcopale mu rwanda . ||| even our parents knew each other because they were both pastors in the episcopal church in rwanda .
tu- banye ... u- ra- umva tu- mara -an -ye imyaka mirongo itatu n' itatu ... eh ... ha- ri ibyo n- beshye gatoya kuko tu- mara -an -ye imyaka ... ku- geza muri 1994 , ||| so we spent thirty @-@ three years together .
ubwo tu- ri tu- mara -an -ye imyaka makumyabiri n' itatu tu- rongora -an -ye . ||| sorry that was n't true ; by 1994 , we had been married for twenty @-@ three years .
muri iyo myaka makumyabiri n' itatu , ni -yo tu- byaye -mo abahungu babiri n' abakobwa batatu . ||| we had two sons and three daughters together in those twenty @-@ three years .
n- bwira noneho ku mwana wawe wa kabiri [ cyangwa ku bu- heta bwawe ] . ||| tell me about your second child .
eh , umwana wanjye wa kabiri y- itwa -aga jean claude . ||| my second born was called jean @-@ claude .
ya- ri umuhungu muremure cyane , ||| he was a very tall guy .
u- ri u- geze muri 6 eme secondaire [ muwa gatandatu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] , ||| he was in his 6th year of secondary school , almost finishing high school .

francine se we ibye bi- genze bite ? ||| what happened to francine ?

kuko na murumuna we ntacyo a- vuga . ya- bonye byinshi ariko a- vuga bike cyane . ||| her younger sister does not say anything about her although she saw many things happen .
ariko mu magambo a- vuga ya- n- bwiye , ya- n- bwiye ko ba- mu- temye n' umupanga . ||| but she just told me that they hacked her with a machete .
ntabwo n- kunda ku- mu- baza byinshi kuko iyo n- tangiye kumuganiriza n- bona ko nawe nta kunda ku- bi- vuga cyane . ||| i do n't like to ask her too many questions , because i know she does not like to talk about it .

kuko u- ka- umva ko a- ri ibintu bi- baye , kuko u- ta- ba- bona . kandi rimwe na rimwe [ nti- n- zi niba n' abandi bi- jya bi- ba- ba -ho ] ariko jya -e rimwe na rimwe ha- ri -ho igihe n- ganira n' umwe muri bo . nijoro , ||| sometimes i talk to them at night as if they were still around !
u- ka- umva mu- ra- ganiriye , ariko biba ikibazo kuko nti- bi- ku- shira -mo . ||| it is a big problem because it can never disappear completely .

mu- ka- mara imyaka makumyabiri n' itanu , noneho n- vuye ku mu- gora -e wanjye we kuko tu- menya -an -ye kera tu- ki- ri abana . u- ra- umva ni souvenir zo mu bwana zi- ra- kura , zi- ra- kura ku- geza igihe mu- baye ... mwubatse urugo mu- ka- bana neza , ||| after living the family you lived with for twenty @-@ five years , i have told you that i met my wife in my childhood and we grew up together , we got married and we got kids and suddenly it was all gone .
mu- ka- byara abana , hanyuma bi- ka- shira . wu- n- va u- sa n' aho u- sigaye ... u- ta- ri ... u- ki- baza ndetse rimwe na rimwe impamvu u- sigaye . ||| sometimes you wonder why you survived !
ni ... ni ikibazo ki- komeye . ||| it is a very tough question .
kuko ku- babarira umuntu , u- ba -w mbere na mbere u- gomba ku- banza u- ka- menya uwo a- ri we . kuko nti- u- babarira umuntu u- ta- ku- sabye imbabazi . cyangwa se u- ta- menye uwo a- ri we ngo u- mu- reba -e uti @: ||| because , for one to be able to forgive , you first of all need to know whom you 're forgiving , you can not forgive if no one asks you to forgive him or her or when you do n't know who it is you 're forgiving .
uriya ya- ri ya- baye umusazi reka mu- ihorera -e . ||| or maybe when nobody has come to ask for forgiveness so that you can at least acknowledge that they were going through some sort of madness .
bi- ra- komeye rero ku- vuga ijambo ryo ku- babarira . ||| the word "@ forgiveness @" is a tough one .
ariko mpamya ko umuntu a- je a- ka- n- bwira ati @: " n- ra- ku- hemuka -iye n- ku- iciye umugore , n- ku- iciye abana , " n- mu- ba- rira . ||| but i believe if someone would come to me and say , "@ i betrayed you , i murdered your wife , i murdered your kids @"@ , i would forgive them .
kuko mwishe n- n- jya -e n- ba n- baye umwicanyi . ||| i 'd also become a murderer if i killed them .
n- mu- babarira rwose . ariko ikibazo ki- ha- ri ni u- ku- menya ahubwo uwo u- babarira uwo a- ri we , ||| i would truly forgive them but the question is who to forgive .
ni inde ? ||| who is it ?
kuko abahutu bose ntabwo ba- ishe , ||| not all hutus killed .
ntabwo rero u- vuga ngo u- ra- babarira abahutu . ||| therefore you can not say that you 're forgiving the hutus .
u- gomba ku- menya umuntu ku izina rye uti kanaka ya- n- koreye ibi ariko n- ra- mu- babariye . ||| you need to know who did it and then be able to say that , so and so did this to me but i forgive him or her .
kandi nk' umukristo n- n- jya -e n- zi ko ba- vuga ngo mu- jya -e mu- babarira abantu ibyaha ba- ba- korera kuko n- n- jya -e ubyo mu- n- korera n- ra- bi- babarira . ||| as a christian i know it is written , "@ forgive others as i forgive you . @"
nk' umukristo rero n- emera ko umuntu a- shobora ku- babarira umuntu , ariko cyane cyane a- gomba ku- menya uwo a- babarira uwo a- ri we . ||| therefore , as a believer i truly believe it is possible to forgive but you ought to know whom you are forgiving .
a- je i- n- bera -e yanjye rero a- ka- n- saba imbabazi , n- mu- babarira . ||| so if they came before me and asked me to forgive them , i could do it .
n- jya -e n- umva a- ri uko n- bi- vuga ariko ya- bi- vuze . ||| that 's the way i can put it . but the condition is that they would say it .
kuko ntabwo u- tanga imbabazi ngo u- vuga -e ngo n- ra- babariye bande se ? ||| you can not forgive in general . who is it you 're forgiving ?
mpanya ndetse ko aricyo kintu tubura muri iki gihugu cyacu cyo mu rwanda . ni uko umuntu a- shobora ku- vuga ati @: " jyewe n- ra- ku- hemuka -iye . ||| i think that is what we lack here in rwanda , that someone would come and acknowledge that they betrayed you , that they killed your people .
n- gize gutya , n- ishe abantu bawe , none n- babarira . @" icyo ki- ha -e umuntu ya- babarira , ||| if it were the case , people would forgive .
ariko igihe abantu bose ... benshi ba- bi- hakana ko ntabyo ba- koze , u- ki- baza niba abo bantu ba- ra- i- ishe , ba- ra- pfuye ku- sa . ||| very few people acknowledge what they did and you wonder if these people killed themselves , if they just happened to die .
kuko abantu ba- bi- emera nibake cyane ; u- gereranya -ije n' umubare w' abantu ba- pfuye . ||| it is so obvious when you compare the number of the victims to the number of those who acknowledge being the perpetrators of the genocide .
abo tu- turanye ... tu- ri tu- turanye , ||| the same people who were our neighbours .
n- ku- bwira urugero rumwe rw' umugabo tu- ri tu- turanye witwa simbizi . hagati ye n' iwanjye ha- ri ha- ciye -mo inzu imwe . ||| i 'll give you the example of one of my neighbours called simbizi , there was one house between his and mine .
tu- ri tu- zira -an -ye ku- va kera . ||| we had known each other for a long time .
kandi ba- mu- fashe baje ku- n- baza kugirango n- reba -e niba mu- zi . ||| when they arrested him they asked me to come and identify him .
kandi mu- geze i- n- bera -e ba- ra- mu- bajije bati @: "@ uyu muntu u- ra- mu- zi ? @" ya- ra- vuze ati @: "@ oya ntabwo mu- zi . @" ||| when i got there they asked him if he knew me , he said no !
umh ! u- ra- umva icyo kintu ki- ra- komeye noneho kugirango umuntu a- vuga -e ngo n- ta- ku- zi , ||| you see how difficult it is !
umuntu tu- i- rara -an -w -aga , mwasangiraga , umwana we ya- jya -aga a- za iwanjye a- ka- sangira n' abanjye rwose . umh ! ||| someone we used to live with and spend a lot of time with , his child used to come home and share meals with mine and he said he does n't know me and yet we were neighbours !
ariko ya- ra- vuze ngo ntabwo a- n- zi , kandi tu- ri tu- turanye . ||| despite the fact that we were neighbours , he said he did n't know me .
ibyo rero bi- garagaza ko abanyarwanda igihe ba- ta- ra- vuga -ish ukuri , no ku- emera ikintu ba- koze , ku- tanga imbabazi bizaruhanya . ariko ubundi nibyo bi- ri byiza . ||| that shows how much forgiveness will be difficult as long as rwandans will not tell the truth about what they did . otherwise , forgiveness is for sure the ideal thing to do .
none se ubwo wu- n- va ubutabera bu- shoboka ? cyangwa u- sanga bu- ta- shoboka ? ||| so is justice possible or not ?
wowe wu- n- va ubutabera bu- ra- koze ku bi- ha bi- korewe abana bawe ? ||| do you feel justice has been done for your children ?
ku- geza ubu ntabwo i- ra- korwa . ku- geza ubu nta justice [ ubutabera ] i- ra- korwa , eeh ... n- vuga kuri jya -e n- ta -yo i- ra- korwa , ||| so far , no ! no justice has been done so far !
kandi mpamya ko no ku- ba- n- ri a- ri uko . ||| in my opinion , not yet and i believe even others feel the same way .
kuko justice y' umuntu u- ku- maze umuryango , u- ku- maze -ho abana , ni iyihe ? ||| because what justice can be done to somebody who wiped out your children , all your family ?
ku- fungwa imyaka itanu , cyangwa itandatu , cyangwa icumi ba- ka- mu- fungura u- ba u- bonye iki ? ||| what do you gain when they are imprisoned for five , or six or ten years ?
aba a- hana -w -e iki ? ||| what punishment is that ?
justice ... ubutabera bu- za- korwa abantu ba- za- kira -w imanza bakurikije amategeko uko a- vuga -w , ariko abenshi ntibazamenyekana . abenshi ntabwo bazamenyekana . ni -ho ikibazo gikomereye . ||| justice will be done according to the laws of the country , but many will never be known and that is a very big issue because many have fled from where their former residence .
kuko abenshi ba- hunze n' aho bi- ciye , ba- ka- jya ku- tura ahandi ba- ta- ba- zi . ||| they now live in places where they are not known .
ahandi ndetse n- ba- gira abo ba- menya ba- ka- tinya ku- ba- vuga , kuko ba- ba- gira -ir nabi hanyuma . ||| or maybe they are known but nobody has the courage to report them for fear that they might take revenge afterwards .
ni ... mu rwanda n' ikibazo ki- komeye cyane kugirango ha- tabaye ku- saba imbabazi , no ku- i- rega kw' abantu , no ku- emera icyaha ba- koze , bizaruhanya cyane . ||| it is a very big issue in rwanda . it will be very difficult unless they ask for forgiveness and confess their sin and acknowledge them .
wiyumvise ku- ta -e , igihe u- ri u- giye hanyuma u- ka- umva ko umuryango wawe bawishe ? wumvise umerewe u- ta -e ... ? ||| how does it make you feel personally that you were n't there when your family died ?
eeh , n- ra- rwaye . eeh ... , n- rwaye indwara n- ta- zi , ||| i got sick , with a weird sickness i had never heard of before .
bu- ri bwo bwa mbere i- n- gera -ho , ariko n- rwaye ku- ishima [ a- hita yi- shima mu mu- ta -w -e no ku maboko ] , umubiri wose . ||| my whole body was itching and i was scratching myself all over .

ha- ri databukwe na mabukwe , bose ba- ri ba- maze ku- pfa . ||| my father @-@ in @-@ law and my mother @-@ in @-@ law also died .
u- ra- umva rero wu- n- va -aga ko uruhande rwawe rwose nta ki- sigaye . ||| it felt like you were left completely on your own .
na john ... john niwe n- ri n- zi ko a- ri -ho kuko ya- ri- gaga , ya- ri- gaga mu mahanga hanze , we n- ri n- zi ko a- ri -ho we tu- ra- vugana -aga . ||| john is the only one i knew who was still alive because he was studying abroad and we used to talk on phone .
ariko na celine nti- n- menye ko ya- ri -ho nawe n- ri n- zi ko ya- pfuye . ||| at that time i did n't know that celine survived , i thought she also died .
ubwo rero n- umva ko umuryango wose @: a- ri umuryango w' umugore wanjye ; a- ri umuryango wanjye ; nta ki- sigaye . ||| so i felt like there was no one left , either on my side , or on my wife 's side .
ariko by' amahirwe tu- je ku- gira amahirwe ku- bona abandi bavandimwe babiri ba- sigaye , ba- tagize icyo ba- ba ba- shoboye ku- jya muri mille collines [ hoteli yi- hishe -mo abantu ] . ||| we were lucky to later on find out that two of our relatives survived as they took refuge at mille collines hotel .
hanyuma ha- ri na murumuna ... na barumuna b' umugore wanjye babiri . ||| also two of my wife 's sisters survived .
ubwo u- ra- umva rero nyuma wongeye ku- bona ko ha- ri abandi bantu ba- ki- ri -ho , bi- ka- ku- humuriza . bi- ka- ku- tera ka- ongera ku- shaka kuba -ho , ||| so after the war , being able to find out that some people were still alive was very encouraging and motivated us to want to continue to live and give your best .
kandi cyane cyane no ku- reba abo bana u- sigara -an -ye , u- ka- umva ko u- gomba kuba -ho no kugirango ba- ba -e -ho nk' uko ima -an ya- ba- ku- haye kandi ba- sigaye . u- sanga rero a- ri n- gomba -w ku- kora icyo u- shoboye cyose kugirango n' abo ba- sigaye ba- za- shobora -e kuba -ho no ku- iga no ku- gira icyo ba- gera -ho . ||| especially because somebody needed to look after the children who survived so that they could study and live a good life and achieve something .
wu- n- va wifuza ko ba- ku- ibuka -w ku- ta -e ? ||| how would you like them to be remembered ?
eeh , cyane cyane nk' iyi minsi ba- shyira -ho yo ku- ibuka , itariki ya karindwi ni umunsi umuntu y- ongera a- ka- ba- ibuka cyane . n' ubwo n' ubundi umuntu a- ba- ibuka , ||| especially on the days that were made for remembrance , on the 7th , the day of commemoration is a day one gets to remember them a lot .
ariko u- ba umunsi u- sangira -ho n' abandi banyarwanda ku- ibuka abanyu . ||| even though we remember them anyway , that day is a day you share with other rwandans in doing so and it helps us to think together and look for a way for this never to happen again in rwanda .
bi- ka- tuma mu- tekereza ikintu ki- korwa kugirango ibi bintu bi- baye -ho ... iri tsebwabwoko ri- baye -ho , ri- ta- za- ongera kuba -ho . yewe ri- ta- za- gira n' undi ri- ba -ho mu isi . kuko ni ikintu ki- teye ubwoba . ||| and that it should not happen to anybody else worldwide because it is terrible !
kandi cyane cyane n- kunda ku- reba amafoto yabo , ||| i also enjoy looking at their photos .
kuko n- ri n- fite mushiki wanjye u- baga i kinshasa . ha- ri amafoto menshi ya- ri a- fite n' amwe n- ba- eretse niwe wayampaye , ||| my sister who was living in kinshasa , congo drc had many of their photos .
kuko inzu ba- ra- yi- twitse yose n' ibyarimo byose ntacyo tu- bonye . ariko ya- shoboye ku- tu- ha amafoto amwe , ||| she is the one who gave me even the photos i showed you since the house and everything in it was burnt up .
n- kunda rero ku- icara rimwe na rimwe n- ka- ya- reba , kandi bi- tuma n- ibuka ... n- ba- ibuka . mbese n' ubu n- ki- baza nti @: ||| so i sometimes sit down and look at them and i remember !
"@ ubu ba- ba ba- meze ba- ta -e ? aba bana ba- ba ba- meze ba- ta -e ? nyina wabo aba a- meze a- ta -e ? @" ni ibintu rero n- ibuka cyane . ||| i think about them and wonder how the children would be today , how their mother would be ... it is something i remember very much .
kandi nta muntu u- shobora ku- ku- kura -mo ku- ibuka abantu bawe , ba- gize ubuzima bwawe . ||| nobody can stop you from remembering your people who were so much part of your life .
n' ubwo ha- ri -ho abantu ba- ba ba- ta- shaka ko mu- bi- ibuka , mu- bi- vuga , ariko twebwe nti- tu- shobora ku- ta- bi- ibuka . ||| even though some people do not want us to remember or to talk about it , we can not forget them .
tu- za- hora tu- bi- ibuka kandi n' abana bacu ba- bi- menye , kugirango nabo ba- za- na- bi- irinda -e . ||| we will always remember and even our children need to be told about it .
kuko ahari akenshi twa ... tu- zize ku- ibwira ko bi- ta- shoboka . ||| perhaps our biggest mistake was that we never believed it could actually happen .
ariko ubu tu- zi neza ko abantu ba- shobora ku- gambirira ku- kora ... ku- mara -ho abantu . igikuru cya mbere n' u- ku- menya ko mu- gomba ku- anga icyo kintu . ||| but now we know it is possible , we are aware that people can betray others and wipe up entire families .
mu bitekerezo mu- bi- igisha abandi , kandi bi- ba n- gomba -w ku- bi- rwanya n' imbaraga ... n' ingufu mu- ka- bi- rwanya . ||| it is something we need to fight against in our thinking and this can be done through teaching and also in fighting against it with all our strength .
ariko mpamya ko mu bana , mu rubyiruko ba- genda ba- igisha , ba- igisha inyigisho ni -yo ya mbere nkuru . ||| but i believe that the younger generation and the youth , if they keep on teaching .... educational method is the primary idea .
inyigisho ni -yo ya- bi- teye , ||| after all , it was through education that everything came up .
inyigisho ni -yo i- za- bi- rangiza . ||| therefore , education is what will take it away .
nta ki- n- ri ki- bi- rangiza . ||| nothing else can !

u- shobora ku- n- bwira ingorane zi- komeye u- huye nazo , cyangwa ikintu u- bona cyagukomereye ku- ruta ibindi muri jenoside ? ||| can you describe to me what was perharps ... the most difficult experience of being on your own during the genocide trying to survive ?
n- vuga ngo bose ntabwo ba- ri babi , ariko abenshi ba- ri babi . ||| i would n't say that everybody was evil but the majority of the people were . if only few were wicked , it would not have reached such an extent .
kuko iba a- ri bake ba- ri babi ntabwo bi- ri ku- gera kuri uriya mwanya .... kuri kiriya kigero . iba ... n- vuga ngo 5 % ba- ri beza . abandi 5 % ntabwo ba- ri ba- fite icyo ba- ri ... ba- ri hagati bi- fashe . hanyuma 90 % ya- ri i- sigaye bose ba- ri babi . ||| i would say that 5 % were good , the other 5 % was neutral and the 90 % remaining was evil .
nk' umuntu a- ku- bajije ibyabaye muri iki gihugu ngo u- bi- mu- bwira -e mu magambo make u- bi- sobanura u- ta -e ? ||| how would you describe the ... if you had one sentence to say what happened in this country , how would you describe it ?
nko mu ki- ha -e wendaga ku- rokoka u- bi- umva -aga u- ta -e ? ||| was it evil and hatred ? was it madness ? what happened ? as you were trying to survive , what was going on in your mind about what was happening in this country ?
nti- n- bi- tekereje mu nti- ambara , ariko ubu nibwo n- bi- tekereje . ||| i did not think about it then but when i reflect on it today .
kuko iyo n- gerageje ku- ibuka ibyabaye muri 1994 , igice n- bi- shyira -mo n- vuga nk' aho u rwanda ru- ri rwimutse ru- giye mu kuzimu . cyangwa ru- giye mu yi- n- ri planet [ u- mu- bumba -e ] n- ta- zi . ||| i would describe what happened in 1994 as though rwanda had gone down to hell or moved to a different planet .
ahantu ru- ri ru- cecetse nta muntu wa ... mbega nti- n- zi ukuntu n- bi- ku- ereka . ||| rwanda was silent . i do n't know how to describe it .
reba ku- sa abantu a- ba- icwa umunsi n' ijoro . umunota ku wu- n- ri . ||| imagine people being killed day and night , minute after minute .
hanyuma nta muntu u- vuga , nta muntu u- gira iki ... mbega igihugu ki- ri ki- cecetse ki- ri -mo ki- kora amabi , ||| no one intervened or did anything ! the whole country was silent and was busy doing something so wrong !
wu- n- va -aga ko tu- imutse tu- giye ahandi hantu kuko n' isi nti- ya- ri i- tu- zi . ||| it was as though we had moved to a different planet . even the entire world was silent as though nobody knew us .
n' isi ya- baye nk' aho ntabwo i- tu- zi . bi- ri bi ... wagirango u rwanda ru- ra- imutse , ru- jya ahandi hantu aho n- ta- wu- n- ri muntu u- ri uruzi . ||| it was as if rwanda had been erased from the earth .
kuko ibintu bi- baye bi- renze u- ku- emera ... nti- n- zi niba n- vuga ngo bi- renze u- ku- emera . ||| the things that happened are difficult to believe if i can say , they go beyond what we can humanly comprehend .
bi- renze icyo umuntu ya- tekereza . ||| it goes beyond what one can imagine .
n- bwira kuri yahaya . ||| tell me about yahaya .
yahaya ni ... n- vuga ko a- ri umuntu mwiza kuko ibyo ya- koze ntabwo a- ri abantu benshi ba- bi- koze . ||| yahaya is ... i would say that he is a good person because few people did what he did .
ya- hishe abantu ba- gera kuri mirongo itatu [ 30 ] ba- renze . ||| he hid over 30 people .
kandi ikindi n- n- jya -e ya- ra- n- kijije umunsi wo n- ri n- giye ku- pfa ... kuko uriya munsi wo n- ra- wu- zi n- ri n- zi ko ba- giye ku- n- yi- ca . ||| he saved me ; i am sure that interahamwe was going to kill me .
kuko uriya mugabo ya- ragiye kunyi ... iriya nterahamwe ya- ri i- giye ku- n- yi- ca . ariko yahaya n- irukanse mpungiye iwe , ||| when i run to yahaya 's house while fleeing , he welcomed me into his house and stand by my side .
ntabwo ya- n- y- irukanye ahubwo ya- ra- n- retse ... ya- n- rekeye iwe , a- hagarara ku ruhande rwanjye . ntabwo a- ri benshi ba- ha- gaze ku ruhande rwanjye rero . ||| and i did n't have many people sided with me then .
ni -yo mpamvu n- bona ko a- ri umuga ... a- ri umuntu mwiza . kandi a- ri ni umukiranutsi kuko ijambo ya- n- ki- rishije ntabwo a- ri ijambo ryo ka- umva ko ya- ri umuhutu , ||| that 's why i think he was a good man , a righteous man . he did it not even so much because he is a hutu .
ahubwo ya- vuze ati ... ya- n- bwiye iriya nterahamwe ngo @: "@ amaraso u- mena , wameneye hano ejo , n' ayo u- shaka ku- mena uyu munsi ima -an i- za- ya- ku- baze , ||| he told that interahamwe that he will answer to god the blood he had shed there the previous day and mine as well .
ariko ntabwo wi- ca uyu mu- kobwa . @" bi- vuga ngo ntabwo yitwaje ubuhutu , ahubwo yitwaje ko ibyo ya- kora -aga ya- korera -aga ima -an . n- umva rero a- ri umukiranutsi . ||| so he did n't even do it in the name of being a hutu but he did it for god . i think he was a righteous man .
n- bwira noneho ku- bi- jyanye no ku- rokoka jenoside [ ku- cika ku icumu ] , ka- umva u- rokotse u- bi- akiriye u- ta -e ? ||| tell me about surviving ; what was it like to get through the genocide and find that you 've finally survived ?
nyuma ya jenoside , bi- saga nk' aho nanone u- sigaye mu muriro . ||| after the genocide , it still felt like hell .
kuko ibintu byose bi- ri hirya ya- ri imirambo , ya- ri intumbi nta muntu muzima u- ri u- sigara -an -ye . u- ca -aga iruhande rwawe u- ka- bona umuntu ... aho ya- guye , ||| there were dead bodies all over the place , everywhere you passed , you 'd see corpses .
u- ka- bona undi ya- ri amagufa ... n- ra- ibuka njyewe n- genda n- bona umwana y- onka ... y- onka nyina ya- ra- pfuye . ariko n- mu- rebye nti- n- igeze n- gira ikintu n- kora , kuko n- umva -aga n- n- jya -e ubwanjye ntakaye . nti- n- igeze n- fata uwo mwana ngo mwigizeyo , ||| i remember seeing a baby that was breastfeeding on its mother 's dead body and i did nothing to stop the child , as i myself felt so confused .
ahubwo n- ra- mu- rebye ku- sa n- ra- igendera . mu mu- ta -w -e n- umva -aga ndi ... n- umva -aga nta kintu ki- ri -mo . no mu bu- enga -e n- umva -aga nta kintu ki- ri -mo , ntago n- koze ibintu by' a- ba- zima . ||| i did n't know what was going on .
ku- sigara rero nyuma y' icyo ki- ha -e wu- n- va -aga a- ri nk' uko umuntu ya- twika ishyamba ryoseee ... hanyuma a- ka- ku- reka u- ka- genda mu bu- shya -e . ||| surviving that time felt like walking through some bush after it has been burnt .
kuko bi- ri nko ku- genda u- ri igicucu , cyangwa u- ri nk' ikintu ki- ta- zi n' ikintu na kimwe . ||| i felt stupid , as though i did n't know anything .
rangiza interuro ya- n- y- uma kubyo u- tu- bwira -aga . ||| would you finish the last sentence ?
nyuma ya jenoside n- giye ... tu- baye icyumweru muri ste andre [ ishuri ryisumbuye ri- ri i nyamirambo ] , ||| we lived in saint @-@ andre [ secondary school in nyamirambo , kigali ] for about one week .
ariko ku itariki esheshatu ... cyangwa eshanu ... oya esheshatu . nibwo n- giye ku- reba mama wanjye . ||| i went to see my mother on the 5th no on the 6th .
n- geze -yo n- sanga ibintu byose ... ngirango ikintu ki- fite ubuzima cyose nta ki- ri ki- ha- ri . ||| when i got there was n't a single living .
n' inyoni za- ri zi- cecetse , ||| even the birds were silent .
n' imbeba nta zi- ki- ba -ho , ||| there were no mice around .
mbega wu- n- va -aga ibintu byose bi- cecetse . ahubwo icyo u- bona -aga n' u- ku- bona ubusimba bu- va mu rutoki bwirukanka ... bi- ri bi- renze . ||| in a word everything was silent and you could only see insects flying over the corpses .
ikindi ni uko n- hise mpura n' umudamu tu- ri tu- turanye , ya- ri y- ambaye ijipo ya mama wanjye , n' ishati ya mama wanjye . ||| the other thing i recall is meeting a lady who used to be our neighbour ; she was wearing my mother 's clothes .
hanyuma n- ra- garuka i- na- ha , n- geze i- na- ha nibwo n- giye kuba -an na famille [ umuryango ] imwe y' abantu ba- ri ba- vuye hanze muri iyo minsi . ||| i came back here to kigali and when i got here i stayed with a certain family that had just come back from exile .
abantu n- ta- ri n- zi , kuba mu bantu u- ta- ri u- menyereye , ururimi u- ta- zi , rimwe na rimwe ba- ganira ururimi ba- kura -an -ye , ||| staying with people i did n't know , who were even sometimes speaking a foreign language , was also very hard .
bi- ri bi- n- goye cyane kugirango n- bana -e nabo . kandi ikindi nanone kuba -an nabo , ba- baga ba- ta- ku- izeye bi- hagije . ||| the other thing that was so difficult is that they did n't totally trust me .
ba- vuga -aga ko uwapfuye a- riwe ... umututsi ni uwapfuye . ||| as a survivor i could have been with the interahamwe because to them all the tutsis had died .
uwasigaye ubwo ya- ri kumwe n' interahamwe . ibyo nabyo bi- baye -ho nk' ibintu bi- babaza cyane ku- rusha noneho no ka- umva ko u- sigaye . kuko abo u- sigara -an -ye nabo ntabwo ba- umva -aga ko u- sigaye . ||| that was also very hard ; it was even harder than being a survivor because those you stayed with did not believe that you were a survivor .
muri wowe i- n- bera -e wiyumvaga u- ta -e ? ||| what was the feeling inside ?
n- vuga ngo ... uko n- i- umva -aga mo i- n- bera -e ntabwo ... ntabwo bi- ri ... n- ra- umva n- ta- ku- ha ikigeraranyo cy' uko n- umva -aga . ||| i do n't know what i can compare it to . i can not really express how i felt . there 's nothing i can compare it to .
ahubwo u- gera -ho ku- sa u- ka- umva u- baye ... nta kintu u- ri cyo . u- gera -ho u- ka- ba -ho gutyo uko u- baye -ho ku- sa . ||| you reach a point where you feel like you 're nothing , you 're just there and days pass but you 're indifferent to everything .
u- ka- bona umunsi urira , u- ka- bona undi u- ra- je , u- ka- ba -ho mu buzima bura -ho u- ta- menyereye ... ikindi wu- n- va ko ntacyo u- bwiye undi , ||| you 're living a life you 're not used to .
nta kintu u- maze muri make . ||| in short you feel so useless .
kuko n- ra- ibuka ko umunsi umwe n- igeze ku- vuga ngo @: iyo n- ba n- ra- pfuye kuko a- ba- pfuye ubungubu ba- ra- cecetse . ba- meze neza . ||| i remember one day even saying that i should have died , as the dead at least were silent , they were fine .
n- umva -aga ko ha- pfuye abantu benshi ! n- ka- umva ... n- ka- vuga rero kuba -ho mu buzima bu- ta- fite ikintu bu- ta- fite igisobanuro , bi- ruta -w n' uko n- ba n- ra- pfuye . ||| my thinking was that living a non @-@ sense life was worse than being dead .
n- jya -e rero ntabwo n- igeze ... n- gira ibindi byiyumviro . ||| my perspective of life was different .
n- ri n- fite ibyiyumviro byo ka- umva ko kuba -ho bi- ruta -w no ku- pfa . ||| my opinion then was that living was worse than dying .
wu- n- va u- shobora ku- babarira abantu ba- koze biriya bintu ? ||| can you forgive people who carried this out ?
umh ! ||| umh !
[ a- ra- seka ] icyo ni ikibazo ki- komeye kuko ... ntabwo ... ku- babarira ni iby' ima -an ku- sa . ntabwo njyewe n- babarira nk' umuntu . ||| [ she smiles ] that 's a tough question . i can not forgive . forgiveness is from god .
ndi umuntu ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ndi ... ntabwo ndi umwuka . ||| i am only human ; i am not some sort of air .
ububabare bwose n- shobora ku- hura nabwo mu buzima bwanjye , ntabwo bumpa umwanya wo ku- babarira . ||| all the pain i encounter in life does not leave room for forgiveness .
ubuzima umuntu a- ba -mo muri iyi minsi u- bona i- bi- i- za bi- ka- ku- ibutsa ibyabaye , ||| the life we live in today ... you see the good and that reminds you of what happened .
u- bona ibibi bi- ka- ku- ibutsa ibyabaye , mbega n' iyo u- bonye inzu nini cyangwa u- bonye amafaranga menshi , wu- n- va n- tawe uribuyahe . wu- n- va n- tawe u- ri bu- sangira -e nawe , ||| you see the bad and it also reminds you of what happened . even when you get a big house or a lot of money , you have no one to give it to or to share it with .
u- bona inzu nini u- ka- bona i- baye ... nta kintu ki- ri -mo kuko nta muryango u- ri buze ku- ku- sura -mo ... u- sanga rero no ku- vuga ngo @: ||| you get a big house but it is empty because no family will come and visit you .
‘ ku- babarira ... ’ wenda u- babarira kuko nta ki- n- ri u- kora . ||| so when you think of forgiveness ... maybe you can forgive because there 's nothing else you can do .
kandi u- ta- babariye se ? kuko abantu ba- ishe mu nti- ambara ni 90 % . ubwo rero u- pfa . u- rinda wicwa n' umutima ... u- rwara umutima . ||| and if you do not forgive ... the killers were about 90 % ... it would kill you . you would get a heart attack and die .
u- gerageza kurenzaho ku- sa . ||| you just look at it and leave it .
u- ba u- zi abantu ba- ishe umuryango wawe ? cyangwa se n- i- bura u- jya u- hura n' abantu ba- gize uruhare mu ku- ica umuryango wawe ? ||| have you ever met any of the perpetrators who you recognised and know ... or having met anybody who was directly involved in killing members of your family ? if you have n't how would you handle it if it happened ?
a- ba- ishe umuryango wanjye bo kubera n- ta- ri mpari ntabwo n- ba- zi . ||| i do not know the people who killed my family because i was not there .
bi- vuga ko mpura nabo n- ta- na- ba- zi . ||| i probably meet them without knowing they are the ones .
ariko umugabo wishe ... mu bantu ba- ishe mama wanjye , ba- ri aho ku- sa bose . iyo u- ba- ciye -mo nta ki- n- ri ... u- ba- gura -ir inzoga , cyangwa u- ka- ba- shakira ikindi kintu . ||| but the man who was in the group pf the people who killed my mother is there . when you meet them you just buy them a drink or something .
hanyuma umuntu n- huye nawe wishe abantu n- huye nawe kuri gare hano hirya mu mugi . aho kugirango a- gira -e ikibazo , n- i- jya -e u- hise n- gira ikibazo . ||| there was a time i met a killer at the taxi park in town and instead of him being the one to have a problem , it is me who had one .
umutima u- ra- n- simbutse n- hise n- gira ubwoba ku- sa ... n- icara hasi kuko n- ri n- tangiye ka- umva isereri . ||| i felt so shocked , my heart stopped beating . i sat down , as i felt dizzy .
ntabwo rero ... u- hura ... ubwo rero ntabwo n- ku- bwira ngo n- giye ku- tekereza ku- babarira , cyangwa ubugome , ||| i can not tell you that i thought of forgiving them or even of taking revenge .
ahubwo n- gize ubwoba . ||| i was terrified .
n- umvise umubiri u- zanye ubushayi nta ki- n- ri . ntabwo n- ku- bwira ngo n- umvise n- babariye cyangwa ... kuko iyo u- huye nabo u- ta ubwenge . nta ki- n- ri u- tekereza . ||| i had goose pimples . i can not tell you that i forgave them or anything else , when you meet them you almost loose your mind , you can not think straight !
u- bona ubutabera bu- kora akazi kabwo neza ? cyangwa u- bona ha- ri -ho ku- renganura -w nabwo ? ||| has justice been done ?
icyo kibazo ki- ra- goye kuko ... n- umva ... aho kugirango bi- itwa -e ubutabera , bi- ta- ri ubutabera , ni byiza ko ba- ba- reka noneho ba- ki- gira hanze ku- sa . ||| it is tough question because i feel like instead of it being called justice when it is not justice anyway , it would be better that they just let them go free .
kuko nti- n- ku- ifuza ko ba- ba- roha mu ruzi nk' uko ba- roshye mama mu ruzi . ||| that 's all i can wish them . because i would not wish them to be thrown into the river the way they threw my mother into the river .
mama ba- mu- roshye mu ruzi , ba- roha data wacu , ba- roha sogokuru , ba- roha abantu benshi bo muri famille [ mu muryango ] yanjye . ||| my mother was drowned into the river together with my uncle , my grandfather and many other members of my family .
u- roshye umuntu umwe rero , ntacyo bi- maze . ||| therefore throwing just one person in there is useless .
kandi ikindi , leta i- ra- gaburira izi n- fungwa . i- ra- ita ku n- rwara zabo kandi ni benshi . ||| the other thing is that the government takes care of the prisoners ; it has to feed them and provide healthcare for them and they are many .
i- bi- i- za rero ni uko ba- ba- reka ba- kaza ba- ka- jya hanze , ku- sa ba- ka- jya ba- ba- ha inyigisho wenda mu kwezi , cyangwa mu mezi angahe ... zi- ba- ka- rura mu bumuntu kuko ibyo ba- koze nabo ba- ri batakaye . ||| it would therefore be better to let them free and maybe to sensitise them every month or so to help them become human again as they had probably lost their humanity .
kuko uuturanyi mwahanaga inka , mwasangira inzoga , ||| how can you kill the neighbour you used to exchange cows with and share a drink with ?
mwasangira iki ... nabyo si ubuzima . ||| it 's not normal .
ni ibintu wu- n- va ko nk' uko n- ku- bwiye u rwanda ru- ri rwatakaye . ru- ri rwatakaye ahantu , kuko nta n' undi muntu warwumvaga . ||| it shows that rwanda was lost as i was telling you , because no one heard its voice then .
ru- ri ru- ri ahantu nta n' undi muntu ya- reba -aga . ||| we were somewhere where no one could see us .
n- ra- umva rero ikintu n- vuga ubucamanza , ubutabera ka- ereka ... nabyo ntibyampaza ku- bona wishe uwo muntu . nta n' icyo bi- mara -ir . ariko nanone nabyo nti- bi- n- shima -ish , ||| what i can say about justice ... unless .... even that would not be enough , even if they killed them ... but it does not sound fair to me when it is called justice .
ka- umva bi- iswe ubutabera , a- ta- ri ubutabera . ka- umva ko umuntu y- ishe ejo bu- n- ri ya- koze iki ngo a- ra- kuze . mbega nti- i- ishe a- ba- kuze nkawe ? ||| knowing that somebody killed other people the other day and they say he 's an adult !
ko se bo bi- ca -aga a- ba- kuze ? ||| were the people they killed not adults ?
ka- umva ngo umuntu ya- ri umwana . ||| or saying that they were children !
mbega umwana a- ri- ca ? umwana nti- i- ica . ||| do children kill ? they do not !
kuki ba- tabaye abana mbere y' uko bi- ca ? ||| why were they not children while killing ?
aho rero bi- vuga ngo ... ba- ba- vana -e -mo ahubwo bi- gira -e inzira . baze tu- turana -e . ||| let them free them , which is what will make more sense to me . let them come and live with us .
u- bona jenoside i- shobora ka- ongera kuba mu rwanda ? ||| can genocide happen in rwanda again ?
ntabwo n- bi- emera ... ntabwo i- za- ba -ho . kuko n- ka- n- jya -e nta mu- ta- ima wo ku- ica n- fite . niba abo bantu ba- za- za ba- funguwe ba- ka- igishwa , ha- ka- ba -ho ku- ibuka ibyabaye , ||| i do n't think so , it can not happen again .
ha- ka- ba -ho aho abantu ba- za- jya ba- jya ba- ka- vuga bati @: "@ ibi bintu bi- ra- baye . @" n' umwana a- ka- jya -yo a- ka- vuga ati @: ||| because personally i do n't have a desire to kill in my heart .
"@ ibi bintu bi- ra- baye . bi- baye ni bibi . @" ntabwo n- umva ko jenoside i- za- ba -ho . ntabwo i- za- ongera kuba -ho . ||| if the people who are being released today are going to be sensitised and if remembering what happened will be part of our lives , if there will always be a place where anyone even children themselves can go and acknowledge that it actually happened , and that it was wrong then i do n't believe the genocide will happen again !
u- gerageza ku- n- bwira ingaruka u- bona zo ku- rokoka jenoside ? ||| what do you think about the future ? ... can you describe for me about the consequences of being a survivor ?
ingaruka zo ... zo ku- rokoka ni nyinshi cyane . ||| the consequences of being a survivor are very many .
kuko iyo n- rebye nk' a- ba- rokotse ... n- kata -w -e tu- rokotse intambara ... jenoside ha- ri a- ba- rokotse ba- ta- rokotse . ||| when i look at us the survivor of the genocide , some of us survived without really surviving .
ha- ri a- ba- rokotse ba- fite sida , abagore ba- fashwa -e ku ngufu ; ha- ri a- ba- rokotse ku- rokoka u- ta- ki- gira umuntu mu- vugana ; narwo n' urundi rupfu . ||| some women who were raped are living with hiv @/@ aids , some survived but they have no one to talk to , that is another type of death , those are some of the genocide consequences .
izo ni ingaruka . ikindi ntabwo u- ba -ho mu buzima bwuzuye . u- ba mu buzima bw' igice . u- ba mu buzima bw' ibitangaza ; ||| the other thing is that you can never live a full life again , you live half of a life , and you live a life full of questions , of uncertainties , of maybes .
u- ba mu buzima bu- tekereza ‘ surprise ’ [ ikintu ki- tungura -an -ye ] ... bu- tekereza ko ... wenda ... wenda ... cyangwa se ... u- hora muri wenda ... se ... u- hora wu- n- va wenda ... bi- shobora u- ka- ongera -ho , u- hora wu- n- va u- ta- fite umutima u- ri hamwe . ||| maybe it is going to happen again , you 're never at peace within your heart .
ku- rokoka rero niko ... ibyo nibyo ba- ita ihahamuka ahubwo . ||| that 's what they call trauma .
u- hora wu- n- va u- hahamutse bu- ri ki- ha -e , ||| you constantly are traumatized .
ntabwo u- gira ubuzima bwuzuye . ||| your life is incomplete .
u- ra- genda ... ... nk' urugero njyewe , ha- ri igihe ... iyo n- reba abantu benshi ... iyo ndi nko mu mugi , n- ka- reba abantu ikivunge cy' abantu . ha- ri igihe n- ba- bona ba- ryamye a- ri intumbi . ||| for example sometimes i can be walking in town and i look at crowds of people and i see their bodies lying down , as though they were dead .
n- ka- shaka ku- reba umuntu , n- ka- shaka ku- mu- reba a- pfuye ; ||| i look at somebody and i imagine him or her dead .
n- n- jya -e ubwanjye ha- ri igihe n- jya n- i- tekereza mfuye . ||| even me myself i sometimes imagine myself dead .
ibyo ntabwo a- ri u- ku- bera ko n- tekereza urupfu , n- racya- ri mutoya . ahubwo ni u- ku- bera intumbi n- bonye , n' abantu n- bonye ba- icwa . ||| not so much because i think of death , i am still young , but because of the many people i saw being killed .
ibyo rero nizo n- garuka zo ku- rokoka . ||| those are the consequences of surviving .
ntabwo u- reba umuntu ngo u- mu- bona -e -mo ubuzima , u- reba umuntu u- ka- mu- bona -mo a- pfuye . ||| you do not look at people and see life in them , you see them dead instead .
u- bona jenoside ya- ri i- kwa -iye ku- ibuka -w ita -e ? ||| how do you want genocide to be remembered ? what is the right way to remember genocide ?
ukuntu ba- ri ba- kwa -iye ku- ibuka jenoside , ||| the way genocide should remember ?
ba- ri ba- kwa -iye ku- ibuka jenoside bu- ri mwaka . ariko na none tu- ri tu- kwa -iye ku- ibuka tu- fasha a- ba- citse ku icumu . ||| i think we should not only remember the genocide every year but also in helping out the survivors .
tu- ri tu- kwa -iye ku- ibuka ... kuko ku- jya ku- ibuka ibyabaye ku ba- citse ku icumu , nta nicyo bi- ba- mara -iye tu- ri tu- kwa -iye ku- ibuka jenoside bu- ri mwaka , ||| because remembering what happened only once year does n't really benefit the survivors much .
bu- ri munsi , kuko a- ba- citse ku icumu bo ba- y- ibuka bu- ri munsi ntabwo iba -ho bu- ri mwaka kuri bo . ||| we should remember it every year , everyday because they do remember it every day , not just once a year .
ariko mu rwego rw' isi yose tu- ri tu- kwa -iye ku- ibuka jenoside tu- fasha a- babaye muri iyo jenoside a- ba- citse ku icumu . tu- ba- ibuka , tu- igisha abana batoya , n- ruzi ko twebwe tu- ra- angiritse , ||| on an international scale , we should remember the genocide in helping out those who lived through the genocide , the survivors .

ahubwo twagirango tu- ba -e tu- ku- ica u- ka- va mu nzu twebwe tu- ka- genda ukwacu . ||| i was suggesting we kill you and then we proceed our journey without you . @"
n- ra- vuga nti uyunguyu a- ra- n- zi nanone ntakintu ndi bu- subiza -e -ho ntaki , ||| i knew there was nothing to lie about because it was true , he knew me .
n- ri- ceceka -ir ndamwihorera . ||| therefore , i simply kept quiet .

n- ra- mu- bwira nti n- sekuye ibigoli n- rangije rero n- ragira haza -mo ibavu ri- ra- turika none ubu nti- n- zi . ||| i told him that i was grinding maize grains and then developed corns in my hands , which turned to be boils and later on the boils busted .
ubwo a- rangije ampereza abagabo ngo ba- genda -e ba- jya -e ku- n- yi- ca . ||| then he told some men to take me and kill me .
abagabo bansiganira ku- n- yi- ca mbese hariya i rusatira , ||| but there was a dispute among those men because they could n't decide who would kill me .
ba- rangije ba- ra- vuga ngo uno mwana ntabwo tumwica mbese n' u- za- ba -ho . ||| that was in rusatira .
ubwo umwe a- ra- vuga ngo sha ngo ngaho igendera -e . ||| one of them told me to go after that .
n- ongera n- i- subira -ir i- n- y- uma n- ra- igendera , ||| i left them and went back .
sice mu muhanda njyewe n- ka- za- jya genda n- ki- cira mu bihuru n- ka- igendera , ||| i would avoid using the main road and would go through the bushes instead .
nyuma rero nti- n- zi ukuntu n- huye n' abantu ba- vuga ngo mbese ni inkotanyi ba- genda ba- toragura utwana nk' uko nguko n- n- jya -e ba- n- toragura -mo , ||| as i was walking i met some people whom were said to be the inkotanyi . they were collecting children and that is how they got me too .

reka njyewe n- va -e -mo nijyewe mukuru genda -e n- ba- sanga -e . ubwo n- rangije mu by' ukuri ubuzima bu- ra- tu- gora , ||| i was the oldest , life became very hard on us .

n- tawe u- za- za ngo a- tu- bwira -e ngo mwaramutse , cyangwa se tu- ka- bura nk' uko tu- jya ku ishuri . nkubu njyewe n- ba n- ra- rangije . ariko bi- gera a- honga -ho n- ka- bi- va -mo , ||| life where no one comes to say hi , sometimes we do not go to school . at my age i would have finished high school if it were n't for such problems .
n- ka- bi- reka n- ka- bura uko jya ku ishuri , ||| sometimes i stop because i have no means to go to school .

mbese n- ka- bona ubuzima bu- ra- goye , ||| it 's difficult to get a job . nobody can employ me yet .
n- ka- vuga se ubu n- za- kora iki ? ntanuwo n- saba n' akazi ngo akampe , ||| of course i can never work as a housemaid because i can not stand that job .
n- ka- bona nanone ntawampa akazi . kandi nanone n- jya -e n- tawe uzampa akazi ko kuba mu rugo njyewe nti- n- shobora kuba umuboyi cyangwa ngo umuntu a- n- tuka -e cyangwa ngo a- gira -e ku- ta -e . ||| i can not work as a housemaid where every one insults you or people do to you anything they wish .

kakampa amafaranga n' ubwo ya- ba 3000 cyangwa se 5000 ka- koze isuku , ||| be it 3000 rfw or 5000 rfw in case he repaired it .
n- ra- umva bi- angirira mbese akamaro . ||| he said that it would be of use to him .
tu- ra- genda noneho n- ra- vuga noneho n- jya ku mu- saza kabisa w' umuhutu witwa muhamudu nti mu- za -e n- zi uko u- ri inshuti ya papa , ||| i went to see another old man who was a hutu and told him ; "@ mzee [ old man ] , you used to be a friend to my dad .

a- rangije umusaza akazu arakampaye k' icyumba na salon ka- baga -mo abakozi be , ||| fortunately the old man gave the house to me . it had a single bedroom with a small living room . it was his servants ' house .
a- rangije noneho igihe kiza ku- gera ati @: "@ noneho , mu- jya -e mu- n- shakira n' igihumbi . @" ||| after some time , the old man said that we should at least give him 1000 rfw .

a- ta- ri uko abantu ba- ta- ri -ho kandi ba- vuga ngo n' abagiraneza ba- ba -ho . ||| i stopped going to school because there were no people in this world to help others in need .
n- ra- icaye umwaka wose u- ra- shira . ejobundi nabwo n- bonye ko rwose n- icaye bi- rangiye , igihembwe ki- ra- shira . ||| i dropped out of school for a whole year until a few days ago when i realised that i am risking stopping my studies , and then went back at school when the term was coming to its end .
ki- maze ku- shira , n' ubungubu no ku- jya ku- iga n- giye -yo nyuma . ||| i went to school very late .
kuko niga -aga hariya i kanombe . n- ra- reba kuza ku- iga hano ikigali , nta tick , ||| i used to study in kanombe .

ubwo n- rangije n- ra- genda n- saba ishuri , bararimpaye , ba- maze kurimpa ariko n- gira ikibazo cyo ku- jya ku ishuri , ||| i asked for admission in the school and i was accepted .

noneho n- i- baza ubuzima bwanjye , n- i- baza kuza ku- irirwa n- icaye ngo n- ra- iga , nti- n- za- na- kora nti- n- za- na- gira ku- ta -e ? ||| i imagined spending days in class yet i were n't going to sit for exams .

ngo oya . nti njyewe reka n- taha -e niko njyewe n- mu- bwiye , ||| i again asked him to let me go back home , once again he said no !
directeur a- rangije a- bona n- ra- rakaye , ||| i got annoyed and he realised that i was .
bu- ra- cya n- subira -yo , bu- ra- ongera bu- ra- cya n- subira -yo . n- ra- mu- bwira nti rero , ||| the following day i went to him again he refused .
ubundi directeur ntabwo aba a- zi ibibazo by' umuntu . nti mpa uruhushya n- taha -e jya -e ku- bi- bwira mu rugo , uko ibintu bi- meze , ampaye uruhushya . ||| the next day i told him that i needed permission to go and tell people at home about the situation . headmasters never know student 's details he thus gave me the permission .
n- rangije noneho n- ra- vuga @: mu by' ukuri n- ta -ho n- taha jya , ||| i said to myself , i have no home to go to .
ntaki , ahubwo reka n- gira -e ku- ta -e ? jyende jya -e muri conseil jya -e kwibariza . noneho reka jyewe jya -e , ||| i better go to the examination council and ask if i can not sit for exams . that is the decision i myself made .
reka jyewe jyende muri conseil jya -e kwibariza . u- ra- umva , reka jyewe jya -e muri conseil jya -e kwibariza , nibarize impamvu njyewe alisa n- ta- gomba ku- kora , ||| i decided to go to the examination council and ask why alice in particular would not sit for exams .
n- i- baza ukuntu jyewe n- za- iga umwaka wose , u- ra- umva , ||| the thought of repeating the whole year ... can you imagine ?
n- ka- ongera ubutaha n- ka- za- garuka . n- ki- baza n' ubuzima bwanjye n- ka- bona ibyo bintu n- ta- za- bi- shobora . ||| at the same time i would think about my life and finally i decided it impossible .
kandi no kuza ku- iga bi- n- goye . ||| at first going to school was very hard for me .
n- ra- genda n- guza umwana n- ra- mu- bwira nti rero n- babarira njyewe u- n- ku- rize amafaranga . ||| i borrowed 1500 rfw from a fellow student .

ubwo n- ra- za jya hariya kuri conseil ejo n- ra- genda n- ba- bwira mbese ikibazo cyanjye ko a- ri cyo kibazo n- fite , ba- emera ku- vuga ngo ba- za- gira . ||| then i went to the examination council yesterday and explained to them my problem .
ba- telefona directeur , ba- ra- mu- bwira ikibazo cya alisa , ||| at the council they easily understood my problem . they gave a call to my headmaster and reminded him about alice 's case .
noneho u- za- uzuza -e wowe u- za- uzuza -e fomurmulaire yiwe numara ku- y- uzuza u- gira -e ku- ta -e ? u- za- yi- zana -e . ||| they asked him to fill the form on my behalf and take it to the council for me .
ubwo rero n- rangije , ||| then i left that place .
n- ra- genda n- ra- vuga nimugoroba nti reka rero noneho jya -e ku- reba claire , n- ra- manuka mpita jya ku- reba claire mbese , ||| in the evening i decided to go and see claire as i had planned prior .

nti njyewe ubuzima bwo n- ra- bu- fite . ||| i know the experience of living alone .
nuko nyine nti n- ba n- ra- na- giye n' ejo n- ka- ongera n- ka- subira -yo ngo n- genda -e jya -e ku ishuri , ||| i would have left yesterday for school because the headmaster said that i should go back to school .
kuko directeur ya- ri a- vuze ngo mpite n- ongera n- garuka -e kuko ba- ri ba- maze ku mu- telefona . ||| that is what he said on phone .
nuko mbese u- rebye ubuzima bwanjye n' ubwongubwo n- ri -ho n- ta- ri -ho . ||| in a word that is how my life is , i am half alive , half dead .

u- ka- vuga tu- vuga -e n- ka- n- jya -e ndi umunyeshuri , nyuzwe y' uko ndi umunyeshuri , n- ka- nyura -w y' uko n- na- bu- raye . ||| for example @: i am a student , i have to be happy with being a student and be happy even though i had nothing to eat for dinner .

n- genda -e jya -e ku- iyandarika . u- ka- sanga a- ragiye a- ra- iyandaritse ntanyuzwe n' uko a- ri , a- kuyemo n' iki ? a- kuyemo na sida . ||| because they are not happy with what they have , they say ; "@ i am an orphan who has no one to listen to my problems @" so , they go to the streets and involve themselves in prostitution and end up getting infected with hiv @/@ aids which in now an epidemic .
kuri iki ki- ha -e noneho u- zi yuko nicyo cyorezo noneho ki- teye . ariko uyo unyuzwe u- ka- nyura n' ukuri u- ka- nyura -w n' ubuzima bwawe , kuko byose byose biza buhoro . ||| but if you are happy with the little you have and are content with who you are , the rest will come slowly .

ntabwo njyewe ... ntabwo n- i- shimira -aga kuba -an no mu rugo . ||| i did n't like living with my parents .
njyewe ubundi n- kunda -aga kuba -an na sogokuru . ||| i only wanted to live with my grandfather ; my grandfather was the person whose company i enjoyed the most .
kubera ko mu bantu bose n- umva -aga n- ishima -iye kuba -an nabo n- bana -aga ... n- umva -aga sogokuru a- riwe n- bana nawe cyane . ku buryo n' amashuri n- ri n- ranze ku- y- iga n- shaka ku- mu- sanga , ||| i reached an extent of refusing to go to school just because i wanted to stay with my grandpa .
n- ra- genda n- bana nawe . ||| i moved in with him and we lived together .
eh mu rugo ba- maze ku- bona yuko n- ta- ha- shaka ku- haba n- shaka ku- ibana -ir na sogokuru , ba- ra- n- reka n- bana nawe . ||| when my parents realized that i did n't want to live with them , they let me go to my grandpa 's .
kubera ko we ya- ra- fite inka , n- ka- jya n- i- rira -an -w nawe n- ragiye . ||| i was happy because he had cattle and i would spend the whole day with him grazing the cows .
nyuma a- ka- jya a- n- bwira amateka ya kera , akampa exemples [ ingero ] z' abantu tu- ri tu- turanye n' ubu bamwe ba- ra- ha- ri , umusaza umwe a- ra- ha- ri . ||| later , he started to narrate me stories of the past . sometimes he would give me examples of some of our neighbours who were still alive .
a- ka- jya a- tu- bwira ukuntu muri ... ku- hera muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , ukuntu baza -aga baza -aga ba- ka- ba- sahura , ba- ka- ba- twara -ir inka , ba- ka- bi- ca , ||| he told me how in 1959 they would come and loot their properties ; take their cows , kill them ... kill their cows , sometimes eat them or take the rest .
ba- ki- ca inka ba- ka- zi- rya izindi ba- ka- zi- twara , amazu ba- ka- ya- senya ariko ku- ica nk' umuntu ntabwo bi- baga -ho , nago ba- kunda -aga ku- bi- kora . ||| but during those days they did n't used to kill people , it was rare .
a- ka bi- n- bwira gutyo ampa urugero rw' umusaza umwe tu- ri tu- turanye witwa n- shaka . ||| he used to tell it to me live ... !
n' ubu a- ra- ha- ri ngirango n' intambara iba nyuma baje ku- mu- funga , ba- ra- ongera ba- ra- mu- fungura kubera ko a- shaje . ||| he also gave me another example of a man called nshaka who was our neighbour and i think he was arrested after the war and released because he was aged .
ubundi kwa ba sogokuru ha- ka- ba ha- ri abandi bana ba ... b' abuzukuru ba nyi ... ni mushiki wa sogokuru abuzukuru be . ||| there were other children at grandpa 's ; they were his sister 's grandchildren . therefore , they were his grandchildren too .

umwe niwe u- ki- ri -ho abandi bose ba- ra- pfuye . ||| only one of them survived , the rest died .
niwe tu- irirwa -an -aga ku muhanda tu- i- kina -ir , ||| we used to play together on the streets .
ibyo n- vuze ni ubuzima bwanjye bwa mbere y' intambara . ||| what i talked about is my life before the war .
ibyinshi nta nubwo n- ri n- bi- zi njyewe kuko ni ... n- umva -aga i- bi- n- shima -ish -ije a- ri u- ku- i- ragira -ir inka ku- sa , no ku- irirwa n- i- kina -ir ku muhanda . ||| i did n't know much , i was simply interested in grazing cows , eating and playing on the streets .
ikibazo nti- ki- umvikana . ||| q ...
yee , ||| yes .
ubwo ... n- ra- bi- ibuka n- ra- umva ha- ri mu ... muri mirongo cyenda na rimwe [ 1991 ] , hagati ya mirongo cyenda na rimwe [ 1991 ] na mirongo cyenda na kabiri [ 1992 ] . ||| i remember it was in 1991 ... between the year 1991 and 1992 .
ubwo n- ri n- vuye ku- ragira , ariko no muri icyo ki- ha -e n- ri n- rwanye n' abandi bashumba , n' abana be b' uwo mu- saza mbese witwa n- shaka . ||| i was coming from grazing the cattle , i remember i had fought with nshaka 's kids who were also looking after cows .
n- ra- za kubera ko n- gira -aga amahane a- n- bajije icyatumye n- rwana nabo , mu- bwira ko ba- kubise inka inkoni mu matwi . ||| when he asked me why i fought with them , i told him they had hit a cow with a stick in the ears .
ba- yi- babaje n- rwana nabo . ||| and when they hurt the cow , i had to fight them .
kuko ntabwo ... ntabwo tu- ra- ki- ri- za -aga ... ntabwo tu- kubita -aga inka , u- shaka u- zi- kora -aga -ho gutya uzikabukira kugirango zi- genda -e , ||| we never used to hit cows ; we would just caress them while saying soft words and the cow would go where you want it to go .
ku- zi- kubita ntabwo bi- baga ... ntabwo u- kunda -aga ku- zi- kubita , nta n' inka za- gira -aga amahane za- baga zi- ri -mo . ||| we never used to beat them because almost all cows were peaceful .
n- rwanye nabo rero , n- geze mu rugo n- bi- mu- bwiye , a- hita a- n- bwira noneho n' amateka ye , ||| so , when i faught and after telling grandpa all that , he decided to tell me all about his past .
ibyo ntabyo n- ri- n- zi icyo ki- ha -e . ||| i did n't know it then .
a- n- bwira amateka ye , ampa urugero rw' ukuntu noneho bi- geze kuza ku- ba- sahura , baje ku- ba- sahura mu nzu ba- anga ku- yi- va -mo , ||| he gave me another example of how one time they came to loot them and they refused to live the house .
uwo n- shaka a- ka- ba ya- ri a- fite igitero a- yoboye icyo ki- ha -e , ba- ha- geze [ ndi ka- umva ya- ra- bwiye ko muri cyo ki- ha -e ko ha- ri mirongo irindwi na gatatu ] . bi- geze mu rugo a- ba- bwira ko a- ta- ri bu- va -e mu nzu , ||| the same nshaka was leading thea group of attachers and when they reached our home ... i guess he told me that it was in the year 1973 ; they came to my grandpa 's house , grandpa told them that he was not going to leave the house .

noneho ba- rangije ba- twara inka n' imyaka ba- ra- yi- twara , kubera ko ya- ri y- anze ku- sohoka , ||| therefore , they took away cows and his harvest since he had refused to get out of the house .
ba- anga ku- mu- twika , inzu ba- yi- mu- siga -mo ba- ra- igendera , ariko ibintu ba- ra- bi- twara . ||| they did not burnt him , they just left him there in the house and took everything .

n- ka- umva n- ta- shaka ku ... no ku- ba- egera n- bona n' inka yabo n- ka- umva n- yi- kubita nkanayica . ||| i would n't want to come close to them and whenever i would see their cows , i would feel like hitting them to death .
icyo ki- ha -e ha- ri nka ryari ? ||| when was that ?
icyo n- bi- kora ha- ri muri [ 1992 ] . ||| it was around 1992 .
kuki u- kunda ku- bi- kora ? ||| why would you do that ?
njyewe ... ubundi njyewe n- kunda -aga sogokuru cyane , ||| i ... i loved my grandpa so much , i can not explain it .
nti- u- n- baza ngo ni iyihe mpamvu . impamvu nini i- garagara ni uko njyewe yampaga liberte . ||| maybe because he used to give me total freedom .
ha- ri ahantu ha- egereye noneho umuhanda wa kaburimbo , n- ka- kunda ku- i- gira ku muhanda . ||| there was a place that used to be close to the main road , i used to like sitting there at the road .
kandi akampa n' uburenganzira n- ka- jya k wiragirira , mu ki- ha -e mu rugo ho u- sanga -aga ba- shaka ko n- irirwa mu rugo n- icaye mu rugo . ||| and again he would let me graze the cattle while at home they would want me to just sitting there .
nta n' abandi bana ba- haba -aga muri ... tu- ri tu- turanye tu- umvikana -aga ngo n- jya -e ku- kina nabo . ||| yet there were no kids to play with .
u- ka- sanga mbese n- i- kundira kwa sogokuru kuko n- bana -aga a- ri -ho n- bona -aga ha- n- shima -ish -ije . ||| generally , i used to like my grandpa 's place . i was happy there .

sogokuru ? ya- ra- pfuye . ||| my grandfather died .
noneho wowe ku bwawe imibereho u- bona ya- ra- hindutse ryari , ||| from your point of view , when do you think change occurred in your life ?
u- bonye ibintu bi- hindutse ryari ? ||| when did you notice the changes ?
njyewe , ubundi na ... ni -yo n- bi- bona -aga gutyo ntabwo n- menya -aga ibyo aribyo , ||| i ... normally i did n't ... whenever i would see such things , i would never understand what it meant .
kuko n- n- jya -e n- ra- bi- i- shimira -aga , ||| because i used to enjoy it myself .
n- bona -aga interahamwe zije ... icyo ki- ha -e nta n' ubwo tu- za- ita -aga interahamwe . ||| whenever i would see the militias coming ... we never used to call them interahamwe .
kuko ya- ri amashyaka za m.d.r. icyo ki- ha -e ha- ri ha- ri -ho m.d.r. ariko njyewe i shyorongi [ commune ] icyo n- ri n- zi ni ... ya- ri m.r.n.d , [ ishyaka rya politike ] ni -yo n- bona -aga cyane kubera no ku- n- ima [ ku- shyushya u- ru- gamba ] ba- ka- ririmba cyane , mbese ni muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] n- tangiye ku- menya amashyaka icyo aricyo , impamvu a- ri -ho , ||| there were political parties such as m.d.r but at the time , in shyorongi commune , i only knew of m.r.n.d. because i would hear them animating , singing loudly ... it 's only in 1993 that i understood they were political parties and why they were created .
ariko n- ka- umva inkotanyi n- ka- umva ... n- n- jya -e n- ka- zi- fata uko ba- bi- vuga . ntabwo n- n- jya -e n- ri n- zi ikibazo cyabyo . uretse ko icyo ki- ha -e bi- tangira muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] , ||| when i would hear of inkotanyi , i thought of them in a negative way because i believed what was said about them .
ha- je -ho amashyaka , ||| i was not aware of what was coming next .
nibwo sogokuru y- ongeye ku- n- bwira yuko ba- shobora kuba ba- ongeye ya gahunda yabo , ba- ri ba- ri -mo muri za mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] , na mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] ; ||| in 1993 my grandfather told me they might have resumed their mission , the one they had in 1959 and 1973 . @"
noneho njyewe n- ka- umva ... nawe ya- ri a- zi -ko ko a- ri nta muntu u- shobora ku- ica undi . ||| i would think that ... he did n't think people would kill others .
a- ka- umva ko a- ri bya bi- n- ri byo kuza ba- ka- ba- twara -ir inka , ba- ka- ba- sahura ba- ka- ba- senya -ir amazu bi- ka- shira . ||| we thought it would be as usual ; taking cows , looting properties , demolishing houses and that would be all .
mbese n- n- jya -e ntabwo n- ri n- zi ko bino bintu bi- baye muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] bi- shobora kuba -ho . ||| i never thought that the things that took place here in 1994 would happen . i was really surprised .
ni ibintu n- n- jya -e bi- n- tunguye ntabwo n- bi- zi . ||| i did n't have a clue .
bi- hindutse bite ... bi- tangiye bite muri za mirongo cyenda na gatatu ... ||| how did it start ? how did it start in 1993 ... ?
muri mirongo cyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] i shyorongi , kuko a- ri -ho na ri- n- ri , tu- ri tu- tuye muri quartier [ mu ka- ca -e ] imwe , u- rebye ni nka partie [ igice ] imwe ya serile , ||| in 1993 in shyorongi , i was ... we were living in one part ... it was like one part of the cell .
uko imiryango yacu ifitanye amasano yose ya- ri ituye hamwe . ||| all our relatives were living in that area .
ariko ku muhanda ha- nyura -aga imodoka zi- vuye i gisenyi , mu ruhengeri , baje i- na- ha i kigali . ||| there was a road from gisenyi and ruhengeri going to kigali .
ba- fite amabendera , ba- genda hejuru y' amabisi ... muri quartier [ muri ako ka- ca -e ] nabwo ha- ri -mo abantu , abenshi ba- ri famille y' uwo mu- saza . ||| people would pass waving flags , seated on top of mini buses ... in our neighbourhood , there never used to be much people ... the only people that used to be there were that old man 's family .
kuko uwo mu- saza nawe ya- ri a- fite famille [ umuryango ] nini cyane , ||| that old man also had a very big family .
ku buryo nk' uwabasha ku- vuga ko serile ya- ri i- ki- za -w -e na famille y' abantu ... y' imiryango ibiri ntabwo ... ngirango nti- ya- ba yi- beshye . ||| if one said that there were only two families in that area , one would be almost true .
u- sanga -aga a- ri iyo famille [ uwo muryango ] abantu bose bafitanye isano n' uwo mu- saza witwaga n- shaka , abandi bafitanye isano na sogokuru , ||| almost everyone was related to that old man called nshaka and the rest were related to my grandfather .
u- ka- sanga a- ri ubwo ... ubwo bwoko bw' abantu ku- sa ba- ha- ri ... ||| that was the only type of people you would find there .
iyo serile ya- ri iyihe ? ||| which cell was that ?
ni nyarurama . ||| it was called nyarurama .
.... noneho nyuma , n- ka- jya n- bona abantu ba- jya muri stade y' i shyorongi ha- ri -mo stade y- itwa nyakabingo . ||| ... then later , i would see people going to shyorongi stadium , which was called nyakabingo .

ariko n- n- jya -e n- ra- genda -aga nyine n- n- jya -e n- ka- jya ku- i- byina -ir n- ka- genda ... n- n- jya -e n- umva -aga bi- n- shima -ish -ije . ||| me too , i would go there to dance because i used to like it .
ariko uretse yuko ... uko n- jya -aga -yo ba- ka- bona n- bi- ishima -iye n- bona -aga mu muryango n- ka- bona n' a- ba- bi- ishima -iye na bamwe , ||| although i would go to dance , i could see that some people in my family were not happy with it .
n- ka- bona ha- ri -mo akantu ariko njyewe simbyiteho , ||| i would sense something but it would be so unclear to me .
simenye ibyo aribyo . bi- geze muri ... n- ra- umva icyenda na gatatu [ 1993 ] aribwo amashyaka n- ya- menye neza . umwaka u- jya ku- rangira , kuko icyo ki- ha -e niga -aga mu wa gatatu primaire , ||| later in ... 1993 when i really knew what political parties were . the year was ending , i remember i was in primary three and that is when i quit school .
mpita n- reka ku- iga n- ra- i- icara -ir n- ra- i- icara -ir n- ra- bi- ihorera . ||| i just stopped studying .
icyo ki- ha -e ha- ri ha- ri -ho n' intambara , ariko ya- ri i- ta- ra- gera ino aha , ||| i remember there was a war but the war had n't reached our area .
tu- umva -aga ko i- bera mu ruhengeri n' i byumba ku- sa . ||| we used to hear that there is a war in ruhengeri and byumba .
kuki u- vuye mu ishuri ? ||| why did you stop studying ?
bon , jyewe aho niga -aga n' umwarimu u- tu- igisha -aga ya- ri mwene wacu . ||| well at school , even my teacher was my relative .

mpita n- vuga ko no ku- iga nta nakamaro bi- fite , ||| i did n't see any importance of studying .

nyuma banshubije mu ishuli ku- bera -ko ba- bona -aga nta bu- n- ri buzima . kandi nta n' ikindi kintu n- ri ku- kora , ||| they told me to go back to school because they realised that there was nothing else i could do with my life .

bon . intambara i- tangira , mbese njyewe ubundi n- kunda -aga abasirikare cyane . ||| well , when the war started ... personally i used to like soldiers very much .

ya- ri ya- ragiye mu nkotanyi . ||| he had joined the inkotanyi army .
noneho abantu benshi ba- ka- jya baza ba- vuga ngo , ngo @: "@ imiryango yacu ngo ha- ri -mo abantu ba- giye mu nkotanyi , ||| many people used to come saying , "@ in your family , some people joined the inkotanyi . @"
" ariko n- n- jya -e n- ka- umva inkotanyi n- ka- umva a- ri abantu babi , ||| even me , whenever i would hear of inkotanyi i would imagine that they were very bad people .
mbese n- n- jya -e inkotanyi n- ka- umva ndazanze neza . ||| generally , i would hate the inkotanyi so much .
kuko bitewe n' ukuntu ba- zi- vuga -aga n- umva -aga n- n- jya -e koko inkotanyi zi- shobora kuba a- ri mbi . ||| due to the way they would talk of inkotanyi , i also would believed that inkotanyi were very bad .

noneho ba- rangije ba- ra- ba- fata abasirikare bose ba- ri a- honga -ho ba- ba- jyana i jari . hano kuri ... kuri fm [ entenne ya radio ] . ||| later , all the soldiers who were there were taken to jari , where there is a radio antenna .

mpitamo ngewe ku- i- gira i- n- bera -e aho u- ru- gamba ru- bera -aga icyo ki- ha -e . ||| therefore , i decided to move forward , towards where the war was taking place .

noneho mpageze , icyo ha- ri abana benshi ba- giye ba- turuka mu miryango y' a- honga -ho hafi a- honga -ho ba- ka- cika -ir mu gisirikare , ||| when i got there there , i found so many kids who had come from their homes in the neighbourhood to join the army .
haza interahamwe zije ku- ba- reba . noneho zi- ka- genda zijonjoramo abana bose ba- ri -mo , n- n- jya -e ba- n- fata -mo . ba- n- fashe -mo , ||| then some interahamwe came to investigate on all the kids . they picked all the kids , me included .
wa musirikare kubera ko ya- ri ahari , ba- giye ku- tu- twara , ||| since the soldier [ who had taken me there ] was there , he talked on my behalf telling that i do n't come from that area when they were almost taking me .
a- vuga yuko njyewe n- ta- vuka a- honga -ho . ba- rangije ba- vuga ko njyewe mpavuka ko ba- n- zi . ||| then some people said that i was born there , that they even knew me .

noneho a- rangije a- ra- vuga ati @: « ba- n- kuye i byumba , inkotanyi zi- ra- ishe ababyeyi banjye , ko mbese natoraguwe n' impunzi . ||| he told them that they got me from byumba when the inkotanyi had killed all my parents , and that the refugees had taken me there .
ba- hita ba- n- kura -mo , abo bana bose ba- ra- ba- jyanye . ||| immediately they took me out and took the rest of the kids .

ubwo ni -ho ya- ri a- tuye nti- n- ri mu- zi , n- umva -aga ngo ni kwa konseye . ||| but i did n't know him ; i just used to hear that it was at the counselor 's .
ba- ra- ba- cukura -ir u- cukura umwobo u- mara ku- gera ku- shyika uko u- ngana u- ka- jya -mo bakarenzaho igitaka . u- ri muzima . ||| they made people dig holes ; once one would dig a pit of his or her height , he or she would enter into the hole and they would just put soil above when someone is still alive .
noneho bi- geze hagati kubera ko ha- ri -mo abana ba- turutse i byumba b' abahutu , ba- maze ku ... ba- ra- vuga ngo njyewe ntabwo ndi umuhutu ndi umututsi ba- ra- bi- n- shinja . ||| meanwhile , some hutu kids who had come from byumba accused me of being a tutsi .
ba- jya ku- zana interahamwe nijoro , kubera ko ba- giye ... ba- bi- vuze ba- ri mu madirishya ndi ku- bi- umva ko ba- giye ku- zi- zana . ||| i overheard them saying they were going to call the interahamwes to come and kill me . they went to call them [ the interahamwes ] at night .

n- injiye -mo n- sanze a- ri intumbi ku- sa zi- pakiye -mo mu buzu , abantu ba- giye bi- ca . ||| when i got inside , there were dead bodies all over the place , that 's where they were keeping them .

amasaha ane a- shize nibwo n- vuye -mo n- umvise ntamuntu u- ki- koma , n- va -mo n- ra- za . ||| then i decided to leave the house after realizing that it was calm .
noneho n- guma hafi y' aho ... aho abasirikari ba- rwana -ir -aga ni -ho n- hise n- guma , hafi ya terrain , ||| i stayed in the area where the soldiers were fighting . i would hide at the frontline .

ha- ka- ba ha- ri umukecuru u- ri u- ha- ri haruguru y' aho ba- ri ba- ranze ku- ica . n- mu- nyura -aga -ho , kuko ha- ri ahantu tu- soroma -aga amatunda , n' ibigori n' ibisheke , ||| there was an old woman they had refused to kill ; i used to see her whenever we would be going to harvest fruit , maize and sugarcane .
n- ka- mu- zanira nawe n- ka- ha- nyura n- ka- hita n- bi- manura n- ka- bi- jyana a- honga -ho ku ... aho ba- rwana -ir -aga . ||| i would always take some to her before i would take them to the soldiers .
uwo mu- saza nawe ... uwo mukecuru bamwishe ha- shize ... ha- sigaye iminsi ibiri ngo tu- ha- va -e . ||| they ended up killing her two days before we left the place .
nyuma a- honga -ho n- ra- za ba- fata ... kubera ko inkotanyi za- ri zi- ra- funze inzira i- zana ibiryo mu kigo ; ||| in that area the inkotanyi had blocked the roads used for taking food to the soldiers in the camp .
ibiryo bi- buze , amasasu a- buze , ba- fata decision yuko tu- ha- va . ||| when they realized they could no longer get any food or bullets delivery , they decided to leave .
mu gitondo tu- iriwe a- honga -ho nta muntu u- rasa , ni mu- goroba nijoro bi- gejeje nka saa mbiri , ba- ra- tu- bwira ngo tugende . tu- ra- manuka wa musirikare umwe u- ri warampfashe , ||| the following day , we spent the whole day without hearing any shooting until 8:00 p.m. when they told us to leave .
ya- ri a- fite igikapu ki- uzuye amafaranga . bya bikapu bya gisirikare a- vuga yuko ayo mafaranga , ||| as we were going the soldier who had taken me with him had a bag full of money .
a- ya- shyiriye francoise uwonguwo uwo mu- kobwa mbese u- baga i shyorongi . ||| he said he was taking it to francoise ; i mean the francoise who lived in shyorongi .
a- rangije tu- ra- manuka kubera ko a- riwe u- ri u- ri i- n- bera -e a- fite imbunda , ||| since he had a gun , he went in front of us then i followed him .
a- geze i- n- bera -e tu- gwa mu ki- ca -e cy' inkotanyi niwe za- ba- n- je ku- rasa a- ra- pfa . ||| we bumped into the inkotanyis and he was the first one to be shot dead and everyone else was killed .
bose ba- ra- pfa n- rebye i- n- y- uma n- bura umuntu n- rebye i- n- bera -e n- bura umuntu , ||| i looked around but i could n't see a single living person , they had all died .
nti- n- ri mpazi n- sigara njyenyine none n- i- icara -ir hasi , ku- gira n- banza -e n- tuze menye ahondi n' a- ha- ri -ho . ||| therefore i sat down to try and pull myself down as i did n't even know where i was .

ba- ambaza impamvu mpicaye kandi ba- n- tumye kare . ||| they saw me sitting there ; they asked me why i was sitting there yet they had sent me a while ago .
umusirikare a- va -mo a- ra- n- bwira ngo ninurire imodoka tujyane n- ba n- ba- citse gutyo . ||| then a certain soldier got out and told me to enter the car . that is how i escaped them .
noneho mu gitondo baza ku- ta ... ku- vuga yuko na ... ha- ri umu ... a- honga -ho n- ba ko umuryango u- jya -e wose u- pfuye , kandi ko ndi umututsi n- n- jya -e bi- baza impamvu n- ba mugisirikare . ||| then in the morning they came and said that my whole family had died and that i was a tutsi too ; they were wondering why i joined the army .
ba- maze ku- bi- menya mpita n- ba- hunga mpita n- jya mu mpunzi . ||| when they found out details about me , i escaped them and joined the refugees .

mpageze kubera ko za- tangiye ku- n- baza ukuntu ... ubundi aho n- turutse , n- ba- bwira ko n- turutse i byumba , a- ri -ho iwacu , kandi ko papa na mama a- ri inkotanyi za- ba- ishe zi- ba- kubise udufuni . ||| when they started asking me where i was coming from , i told them that i was coming from byumba and that the inkotanyis had killed both my parents using clubs .
icyo ki- ha -e ha- ri ha- ri -mo abagore ba- ra- n- kunda cyane , ba- n- fata neza , ||| some women liked me very much and treated me so well .
noneho n- genda mu mpunzi zi- genda i byumba . ||| then i joined the refugees who were heading to byumba .

ba- ra- n- fashe nk' umwana wabo . ||| they all believed it was true and they treated me as their child .
tu- ra- jyana tu- geze ku ... ndi ka- umva tu- ra- gera -an -ye ku mupaka , ni -ho n- tandukana -iye nabo , ||| we went on together ; i think we reached the boarder together .

kuko n- je ku- andika ibaruwa nyinyujije muri croix rouge , i- ra- za igera kuri mukuru wa mama y- igisha -aga hano ku mu- ha- ima . ||| i wrote a letter , which i sent through the red cross to my aunt who was a teacher here at muhima .

kuko narayitsinze n- jya muri leta n- jya ku- iga mu bi- ima -an [ ki- ta- arama ] . ||| i passed well primary and joined a government school "@ byimana @" in gitarama .

kuko n- basha -aga ku- andika ariko simbashe ku- vuga . icyo ki- ha -e n- maze amezi atandatu n- ta- vuga , n- andika ku- sa . ||| i spent six months without talking , i was used to communicate through writing .
nibwo n- je ku- jya hariya muri tromatisme [ ikigo ki- vura ihahamuka ] , ||| that is when i was taken to the trauma centre .
aba a- ri -ho n- korera nabo , n- ba- n- je no ku- korana n' umugore witwa esther umwe u- korera -aga muri avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba jenoside ] nyuma y' amezi atandatu nibwo n- ongeye ka- ongera ku- vuga . ||| i even started to work with esther who was with avega .
no ku- iga , a- honga -ho mpita mpava , ||| i was able to talk again six months later and i went back to school .
niga -ir kuri apace . yee . ku- geza ubungubu ni gutyo . bi- jya -aga bi- garuka ariko ubungubu , ||| but i shifted from byimana to apace .
kubera ko nyuma y' aho nibwo ... bi- ongeye ku- n- ba -ho nibwo muri traumatisme ba- n- bwiye bati @: "@ u- za- jya -e u- gerageza ku- ganira n' abantu , u- ba- bwira -e amateka yawe nabo ba- ku- bwira -e ayabo , bi- za- jya bi- genda bi- shira . @" ||| the situation continued like that up to when they [ trauma centre ] advised me to be in the habit of talking to my friends and telling them my story , vice @-@ versa .
ariko kubera nta muntu n' umwe wo muri famille , nta n' umwe n- igera -aga n- izera ku- ganira nawe , u- rebye muri famille [ umuryango ] yanjye yose nta muntu n- vuga ngo ya- baye mu nti- ambara . ||| i usually do n't talk , not even to the members of my family ; but this is because they have never seen a war . there is none i can say that he or she knows a war .
nta muntu n' umwe wigeze u- bona yi- ca undi , ||| none of them has ever seen a person being killed .
n' a- ba- bonye intumbi ni bakeya , ba- zi- bona -aga ku matereviziyo . ||| even the few who have seen dead bodies just saw them on tv .
u- ra- umva ko nta muntu n' umwe n- ba n- umva ko n- ganira nawe , ngo n- umva -e ha- ri ikintu a- zi , ||| that is the reason why i believe there is nobody i can talk to about such stories because i believe they do n't know a thing .
ni -yo mpamvu . ||| that is the only reason .
ha- ri aho u- tu- bwiye ko u- giye mu basirikare , icyo ki- ha -e winjiraga mu basirikare ho u- maze -mo igihe ki- ngana iki ? ||| there is apoint you mentioned that you joined the soldiers . how much time did you spend with them ?
icyo ki- ha -e n- maze -mo iminsi ibiri , ||| i stayed there for two days .
kuko jya -e n- umva -aga n- shaka ku- reba aho ba- ra- shisha imbunda nta ki- n- ri n- umva -aga ki- n- shima -ish -ije , ||| i just wanted to see the way they used a gun ; i enjoyed it .
ariko mpageze n- umva -ish -e yuko abantu ba- ri ku- ica abantu , ||| when i reached there , i found out that some people had been commanded to kill others .
kandi nti ... a- ri n' itegeko , n- ra- vuga nti u- bona no kwa sogokuru nabo ba- ri bu- bi- ca -e mpita n- ta- ha- garuka . ||| when i thought that they could even attack my grand father 's place , i immediately left .
kwa sogokuru nti- ba- ri ba- zi aho u- ri ? ||| at your grandfather , did they know where you were ?
nta kintu n- igeze n- ba- bwira ba- ra- n- shatse ba- rambura , kuko n- je bara ... ba- ra- umiwe ba- ambaza iyo n- ri ndi . n- ra- bi- ba- bwira ariko nta kintu bi- geze ba- n- twara . ||| i did not tell them anything , and when i came back they asked me where i had been , i told them but they did not say a thing .
ikibazo nti- ki- umvikana . ||| q ...
icyo gi ... mbese nahavu ... n- ha- vuye ndi ku- vuga nti @: buno iwacu ha- ri amahoro . kuko n- bona -aga yuko ubuzima tu- ri -mo , n- bona -aga bi- anze bi- kuze ko ba- gomba ku- tu- ica . ||| i left that place knowing there was peace at my place , i knew that one day they would kill us because of the way they were moving with their machetes , they all had new machetes .
kuko ukuntu baza -aga ba- meze byonyine n' imihoro , bose ba- baga ba- fite imihoro mishyashya . uwo mu- saza witwaga n- shaka niwe u- bika -aga iyo mihoro . ||| nshaka was the one to keep the machetes .
ba- jya -aga ku- yi- fata iwe . ||| so , they used to pick them up from his place .
ha- ri -mo abahungu be , ha- ri -mo n' abahungu ba mukuru ... ba murumuna we benshi cyane . mpita mpava rero , n- jya ... u- ri ka- umva ko aribwo ibyo bintu byose bi- je kuba , ||| his sons , his younger brother 's sons [ nephews ] and his older brother 's sons [ nephews ] were all killers .
nabwo n- geze -yo n- ka- bona naho nta ki- genda . icyo ki- ha -e nibwo n- menye ko ubwo hose ariko bi- meze . ||| that is when i realized that the situation was similar everywhere .
u- giye n' iki . u- teze imodoka ? ||| how did you go , in a car ?
oya n- giye n' amaguru , ||| no , i left by foot .
kuko n- ha- vuye mu gitondo kare mpagera saa kumi n' ebyiri ... saa moya . ||| i left early in the morning and reached there at around six or seven in the evening .
nti- u- ri u- fite ubwoba se bwo ku- genda , cyangwa ha- ri uko wihishe ? ||| were n't you afraid of walking or there was a way you would hide ?
icyo ki- ha -e mu muhanda ha- ri abantu benshi ba- vuza induru , abenshi ba- jya ku- higa abandi , ariko n- jya -e nta bwoba n- baga n- fite n- genda -aga -mo gutyo , nta muntu wigeze a- n- tangira mu n- zira , ahantu n- tinya -aga ku- nyura ni kuri bariyeri ku- sa . ||| at that time there were many people on the road screaming while hunting for people but i did n't fear anything at all because i could walk anyhow and no one stopped me , though i feared roadblocks .
ha- ri ryari ? ||| when was that ?
n- hora -aga n- tekereza ... kubera ko n- bana -aga ... mukuru wa mama tu- bana -aga ntabwo a- ri ... ntabwo a- ri uwo kwa sogokuru neza . mbese ba sogokuru ba- ri ba- va inda imwe . ||| i used to think about the way i was living , i was staying with my aunt [ my mother 's older sister ] , they were n't real sisters but their fathers were brothers .
a- fite abana babiri , undi aba hanze . ||| he had two children and one was abroad .
n- bona uburyo ba- iga -mo n' uburyo n- n- jya -e niga , n- ka- bona njyewe nta kintu ku- iga bi- mara -iye . ||| whenever i would compare the way they study and the way i study , i would find my studying useless .
kuko n- ra- za -aga n- gera mu rugo muri vacances [ ibiruhuko ] , n- ka- bona abana ... ... a- ra- je uko yi- shima -iye umwana we si -ko a- n- yi- shima -iye , ubundi ibyo ntakibazo . ||| i would go home for holidays and when the others would come , they would be received in such a warm way !
ariko nka tekereza ese njyewe n- shobora ku- i- shimira ... ku- shima -ish nde , ninde n- shobora ku- i- shimira n- ka- mu- bura mbese . u- ka- sanga mu mu- ta -w -e wanjye ibyo ... nicyo kintu ki- ri -mo , ka- umva ko nta kintu jyewe n- i- mara -iye . ||| it would leave me wondering whom i live to make happy and who could ever make me happy !
bi- n- zirika mu mu- ta -w -e kandi nta ... n' umuntu n- bona -aga n- ganira -aga nawe , mbese tu- vuga -aga ibintu bi- sanzwe by' ubuzima bw' a- honga -ho bw' ako kanya . nta yi- n- ri gahunda n- baga n- ri -mo n- bona ... ntabwo n- igeze n- bona umwanya wo ku- vugana n' umuntu n' umwe , ibintu bi- erekeye na jenoside . ||| there was none and this really troubled me a lot .
kuko n' aho muri traumatisme [ ikigo ki- ta ku- ba- hahamutse ] aho n- ri ndi , ntabwo n- igeze n- ba- bwira ibyinshi , ibyinshi n- giye n- bi- ba- bwira n- ba- beshya . nta muntu n- umva -aga n- shaka kubwiza ukuri . ||| because i had no one to talk to and whenever i talked to anyone it was just the usual things but i could n't talk about things related to genocide because of being traumatized and in case i talked it was only lies , i never felt like telling anyone the truth .
u- geze muri traumatisme [ ikigo ki- ta ku- ba- hahamutse ] ni -ho u- tangiye ku- vuga ? ||| did you start talking at the trauma center ?
yee , icyo ki- ha -e ... nibwo n- tangiye ku- vuga ariko ... icyo ki- ha -e n- koresheje bic [ ikaramu ] . noneho ibya bic , ba- n- bwira ngo tu- bi- va -e -ho , ||| i started talking from then , but at first i used to use a pen and later they told us to stop writing and they started persuading me to try and talk .
ba- aka ba- genda ba- n- y- umva -ish ukuntu n- gomba ku- vuga , bi- kaza gahoro , ubundi ba- ra- bwira bati u- jya -e u- kora sport , noneho sport n- yi- kora cyane . ||| at times they also would tell me to start doing sports .
noneho kino kibazo cy' umugongo nibwo ki- tangiye no kuza -ho , icyo ki- ha -e nta nubwo n- tekereza -aga ko a- ri n' iyo mpamvu wenda ba- ba ba- ra- n- kubise mu mugongo . mbese ... n- umva a- ri ibintu n- ta- kwa -iye ku- ba- bwira , n- ra- bi- ihorera n- anga ku- irirwa n- bi- ba- bwira byose . ||| i over practiced sports , which has caused me backaches , though i think it may be because of the beatings during the war .
ibyo ba- n- bajije a- ka- ba aribyo n- ba- subiza , ba- ambaza i- bi- erekeye n' intambara n- ka- ba- bwira -mo bike , ibindi n- kanga ku- bi- ba- bwira . ||| basically there are things i would n't feel like revealing and i could only answer what they asked , in case they would ask me about the war , i would briefly reply and keep the rest to myself .
u- tangiye ku- bi- vuga byose ryari ? ||| when did you start telling it all ?
n- tangiye uno mwaka ku- bi- vuga , kuko ibya mbere n- tangiye ku- bi- vuga ejo bu- n- ri . ||| it is this year that i started talking about it ; i recently said it for the first time .
n' ubungubu tu- vugana ha- ri -mo byinshi n- ba n- giye n- simbuka . ni byinshi nti- ibuka . kuko nko ku- bi- andika nabwo bi- ra- n- vunnye . ||| even right now as i am talking , there are some information that i skip , because there is much that i forgot .
ha- ri -mo ibyo n- anditse byoherejwe hariya i mudende [ universite adventiste ] . ||| even writing was n't easy ; there were some information i wrote and sent it to mudende [ adventist 's university ] .
n- ra- anditse umunsi wa mbere , n- anditse page ebyiri , n- vuga ngo ejo n- za- ongera n- andika -e , ||| the first day i wrote two pages , hoping to add on the following day .
n- giye kwa ndika noneho haza ibindi ... noneho nashobo ... n- bona chaine [ umurongo ] ku- zana imwe , kugirango bi- genda -e kuri chaine [ umurongo ] imwe n- bona nti- bi- shobotse . ||| when i sat the following day to continue , i had a lot to write but it was not flowing in order .
n- fata decision [ icyemezo ] yo ku- fata umunsi umwe wo ku- bi- andika . ||| therefore , i decided to leave everything and get a whole day to prepare it .
n- n- tu- kura umunsi woseee ... n- anditse , amapaji umunani , n- rekera aho ngaho . ||| that day i wrote eight pages .
kuri uwo munsi nibwo n- tangiye ku- gira ... ku- za- jya n- bi- vuga . ku- bi- andika ; nibwo n- tangiye kubyamndika . ariko impamvu ya- tumye n- bi- andika , ||| and from that day on , it is when i started talking about it ... writing about it .
ni u- ku- bera ubuzima bwanjye n- jya -e ... n- i- tekereje -ho . kubera ha- ri ... muri ‘ traumatisme ’ nibo ba- angiriye inama , ba- ra- bwira bati @: "@ u- za- jya -e u- gerageza ku- bi- i- vana -mo ; ||| and the reason as to why i was trying to do this is because at the trauma center they had advised that in order to overcome it i must try and talk it out or even cry .
ku- bi- i- vana -mo u- za- jya -e u- gerageza u- bi- ganira -e -ho n' undi muntu . kuko ba- n- bwira -aga ko n- shobora ... cyangwa n- ki- hangana n- ka- rira , ariko mu buzima bwanjye nti- n- jya ndira , ||| but in my whole life i have never cried .
ahubwo umwanya wo kura -ir , ||| instead of crying , i can n't talk .
ku- vuga bi- ra- nanira . kuko n' iyo tu- giye hariya nko ku gisozi , akenshi abandi mu ki- ha -e ba- ri kura -ir njyewe , akenshi ntabwo n- jya n- shobora ku- vuga . ||| whenever we go to gisozi , while others cry , i just can n't talk anymore .
ni -yo mpamvu iyo n- giye -yo n- reba umuntu tu- jyana , noneho tu- ka- jya tu- genda tu- vugana . kugirango bi- ta- za ku- n- cika , nkashiduka bi- naniye ku- vuga . ||| that is why whenever i go there ; i get someone i can keep talking to in order to avoid loosing my speech . but still i find myself quiet .
ubungubu nibwo n- tangiye ku ... ejo bu- n- ri nibwo n- tekereje , kubera ko n- bana na murumuna wa papa . ||| i live with my dad 's younger brother .
kubera ku- ta- umva uburemere bwa jenoside . niba a- ri ukutabwumva ... niba ha- ri ukundi kuntu a- bi- fata simbizi . nk' ubu mu ku- iga kwanjye niga ... niga n- bi- jyana gahoro . ||| recently i was asking myself if my uncle understands the seriousness of genocide ; i wonder if he does n't know the heaviness of genocide or if he has a different perception about the genocide ... i do n't know .
iyo nize cyane , ||| currently ... i do n't stress myself with studies .
nshiduka no ku- vuga bi- naniye . ||| because whenever i read a lot , i find myself in a position whereby i can n't talk .
noneho n- ka- jya n- bi- jyana gahoro , ||| afterwards when i come back home he shouts at me .
n- za a- ka- ba a- ra- n- tutse ngo nta kuntu ngo u- shobora ku- gira mirongo itanu [ 50 % ] ngo n- shaka mirongo irindwi [ 70 % ] ngo abe a- ri -yo n- gira . ||| saying that i should get 70 % not the 50 % i manage to score .
ku- gira ngo n- za- bi- mu- bwira -e nawe ntabwo ... n' ubungubu tu- bana ntabwo a- zi uko n- shobora kuba n- ra- rokotse . ||| i have never told him ... i guess he does n't know my past and how i survived .
n- ta- zi n' ukuntu bi- genze , no murugo ... niba ha- ri n' u- bi- mu- bwira a- mu- bwira igice kimwe , n- tawe u- bi- zi mbese . nawe ubwe a- genda gutya ntacyo a- zi . ||| by the way , if he knows my story , he knows just a little bit of it .
nibwo n- tangiye ka- umva yuko ku- tagira undi muntu n- bi- bwira , ko a- ri ubujiji bwanjye . ||| that is when i started realizing that keeping it silent is being stupid .
mpitamo ku- za- jya n- i- andika -ir , ||| therefore , i decided to start writing .
n- bona ha- ri umuntu wo ‘ traumatisme ’ n- ka- pfa ku- ganira nawe ho bikeya nawe . ||| and when i am able to get the counselors from the trauma centers , i tell them some things , which relieves me .
nk' ubungubu ha- ri ibintu u- simbutse ... ha- ri ibintu u- ta- igeze u- tu- bwira nk' ubungubu ? ||| even now there are some things you skipped ... is there some information that you did not tell us ?
yee , ||| yes , there are some things that i did n't tell you .
ha- ri -mo byinshi nta ... bikeya ... nk' ubungubu nti- n- igeze n- ba- bwira nk' ukuntu ... ha- ri -ho ubwo n- igeze ku- fata decision yo ku- iba imbunda , nyuma y' a- honga -ho igihe n- ri n- vuye i jari . n- ibye imbunda ba- ra- n- fata , ||| there was a time i stole a gun the time i left jari .
ba- ra- n- kubita , ||| they found me and i was beaten .
ariko n- ba- umva -ish yuko n- shaka -aga n- n- jya -e ku- yi- fata ngo n- umva -e ukuntu imbunda i- mera , ||| when they asked me , i told them that i just wanted to hear how a gun feels like .
ariko ntabwo a- ri -yo objectif [ intego ] njyewe n- umva -aga n- fite . ||| however that was n't my real intention ; i wanted to take it and use it to kill the old man nshaka . and i was ready to face any punishment .
kuko n- umva -aga n- fite objectif [ intego ] yo ku- yi- fata , n- mara n- ka- umva n- ka- hita n- jya ku- rasa uwo mu- saza witwaga n- shaka ku- sa , ba- shaka ba- ka- hita ba- n- koresha icyo ba- shaka . ariko icyo ki- ha -e nti- n- igeze n- bi- gera -ho . ||| but i was so unfortunate because i did n't succeed .
mbese u- rebye ... jenoside ni gutyo njyewe n- yi- ba- bwira nta ku- n- ri . ||| generally that is what i can tell you about the genocide .
kubera iki ? ||| why ?
impamvu , n- umva ko umugore a- shobora ku- za- n- ta -ish igihe ... ku- za- tuma n- gira ubuzima bubi . ||| i believe a woman might waste my time .
n- tekereza yuko n- ramutse n- gize amahirwe y' ubuzima bwiza , n- ka- bona umugore u- baye imfu ... u- ta- fite papa we na mama we , ||| she might make me unhappy .
bose ba- pfuye muri jenoside , a- riwe n- bana nawe . kuko iyo n- tekereje urugero @: ukuntu ngana , ||| however , i believe if i am lucky , i 'll come across one whose parents were killed in the genocide .
n- ka- tekereza abantu jenoside ya- baye -ho ba- ri -ho , igihe n- za- jya ku- shakira umugore n- ka- umva bose ba- za- ba ba- fite abagabo , n' abatazaba ba- ta- fite abagabo ba- za- ba a- ri bakuru cyane . ||| however , i think it will n't be possible because all those orphans of the genocide will be married before i will be in position to marry and those who may be still single will be too old for me .
n- ka- umva ko bi- za- n- saba ku- shaka umugore u- ta- zi na jenoside icyo aricyo . n- bana nawe n- bona nka papa we a- je ku- mu- sura , cyangwa mama we , cyangwa barumuna be , cyangwa ba- saza be . n- ka- umva nabyo ibyo bintu bi- za- n- ta -ish ... bi- za- mu- n- gabanya mu mu- ta -w -e , n- ka- umva yuko n- bi- reka . ariko na none , n- ka- umva yuko n- shaka umugore ku- gira n- za- bona -e umwana u- za- jya mu mwanya wanjye mbese . mu muryango iwacu nti- ha- gira -e umuntu ... ntiwibagirane , u- ka- za- jya u- hora wibuka yuko , nubwo jenoside ya- baye -ho uwo muryango w' i ... iyo jenoside ya- baye -ho uwo muryango u- ri u- yi- ri -mo . ni gutyo n- bi- tekereza . kuri avenir [ ejo ha- za- za ] wanjye . ||| i would n't want to marry someone who does n't know anything about the genocide . and when we will be living together and i see all his family members visiting us , it may confuse me . in the end i end up not thinking of getting married though at times i consider getting married so that i could have a child to replace those who died and to restore the memories of those we lost .
u- ra- shaka ku- za- kora iki ? ||| what would you like to do ?
ku bintu ku- kora , ubundi n- tekereza ko n- rangije ku- iga , n- shobora ku- za- shaka ibyo ku- ikorera . ||| i think after completing my studies , i 'll be self @-@ employed .
kuko ntabwo n- jya n- tekereza n' umunsi n' umwe ku- gira umuntu n- korera . n- tekereza ko n- ramutse n- bonye uburyo n- shobora ku- rangiza ku- iga , n- ka- gerageza gusha ... gucreya [ ku- i- himba -ir ] imishinga n- ki- korera ku giti cyanjye . ariko i- cya mbere n- tekereza ni by' ubuhinzi n' ubworozi n- ka- genda ku- bi- shyira mu matongo yo mu rugo . ||| i want to make a project and it will involve agriculture and cattle breeding , which will be based at my now deserted home .
noneho ubwo u- za- iga agricole [ ubuhinzi ] ? ||| that means that you want to study agriculture ?
oya , ku- iga agricole [ ubuhinzi ] byo ntabwo bi- shoboka . kuko nk' ubu niga comptabilite , ||| i can not study agriculture because i am studying accounts .
mbese mubyo niga ndi ka- umva ku- gira ngo n- za- jya -e ku- fata iyo faculte nabwo bitarii ... nibyo n- vuga -aga ko wenda faculte n- za- fata ni management . ||| i think i will do "@ management @" at the university .
ariko n' ubwo n- ta- ri ... a- ta- ri agricole [ ubuhinzi ] n- bonye moyen [ ubushobozi ] byose n- bi- kora n- izera ko bi- shoboka . kuko mu mu- ta -w -e wanjye n- umva ko ibyo byose bi- shoboka . ||| but if i get a chance to study agriculture , i will do both since i feel i have it on my heart .
nk' ubu wi- baza ko umuryango wawe cyangwa famille yawe mu ki- ha -e ki- za- za , u- bona jenoside i- za- ba a- ri iki ku muryango wawe ? ||| when you think about you future family , what do you think genocide will mean to them ?
noneho abacamanza ba- n- tegeka ku- jya ngo ku- reba i.p.j. , ngo mu- bwira -e a- n- korera -e dossier . ||| afterwards the judges told me to see the prosecutor and tell him to make me a file .
n- ragiye noneho a- rangije arabi ... kubera ko ibyinshi ba- ri ba- bi- anditse ba- ra- ongera ba- ra- andika a- rangije a- ra- n- bwira ngo a- za- ba- tuma -ho abandi ... abenshi ba- ri mu rugo ba- ta- funzwe . ||| when i reached there , i found that he had written most of the things , although he rewrote them again .
umwe ya- ri na responsable , ||| then he said that the court would call them , since most of them were not imprisoned .
ngirango n' ubu a- racya- ri responsable . maze ku- bi- vuga , a- rangije a- ra- n- bwira ngo n- za- garuka -e a- ri kuwa gatatu . ampa n' isaha a- ra- n- bwira ati @: ||| and one of them was a local leader who is not imprisoned up to now .
"@ saa tatu . @" n- ri n- fite igare rya sport , n- ri- za -ho n- ri- je -ho n- subiye yo manuka ba- n- tera amabuye . abantu ba- n- teye amabuye ntabwo n- ri n- ba- zi . ||| they told me to come back that wednesday at 9:00 a.m. i used a bicycle i had and while sloping down on my way back i was stoned by people i did n't know .
n- kata igare n- subira i- n- y- uma . n- subiye i- n- y- uma , n- rebye i- n- y- uma n- bona abantu ba- n- y- irukanse -ho . igare n- ra- ita hasi . ||| therefore , i decided to go back .
[ abo bantu nti- n- ba- menye ] . n- ra- itaye hasi n- irukanse , n- bona imodoka i- turutse i- n- y- uma , mpita n- ta- ha- gaga . ||| when i looked back , i saw a group of people running after me .
ya- ri ... ya- ri i toyota ya ba n- tuza ya ardi . irahagara abo bantu n- ra- ba- bwira , n- ba- bwira ukuntu abantu ba- ri banyi ... ba- giye ku- n- yi- cira hano mu n- zira . ba- rangije ba- ra- za ba- ra- n- fata ba- shyira -ir -mo iryo gare , ||| i went off the bicycle and started running , leaving it behind .
tu- ra- jyana , n' abantu ba- hita ba- subira i- n- y- uma ba- hita ba- bura ... tu- ra- ba- bura . ku- va uwo munsi ku- geza na n' ubu , i- bi- erekera -an -ye n' ayo madossiers simbizi . ||| luckily i saw a vehicle and stopped it .
nti- n- zi ahantu bi- za- na- garuka -ir n- ra- bi- ihoreye , ku buryo n' umwe muri ... muri bo u- ri u- ri -mo , [ muri ba- ba- n- ri ba- ri ba- n- yi- hakana -ye ko ba- ta- n- zi ] nawe ya- ra- funguwe ya- baye umwere mbese . ||| i told them my story and then we went back , picked my bicycle , but the people who were chasing me were nowhere to be seen .

ubwo iyo nshuro ya- ri iya kabiri . ||| that was my second time .

u- ba -w kabiri n- jya -yo , n- giye ku- reba irangamuntu , aribwo n- jya -aga -yo n- ka- sanga -yo urubanza . ||| the second time i had gone to look for an identity card and that is the time when i found a case .

uretse ko umuntu ya- ba a- tekereje nk' umwana a- ramutse a- vuze ngo @: ||| it would sound childish if someone said that the elders should be removed from the world .
"@ abantu bakuru ba- ba- kura -e -ho , ha- sigara -e -ho abana . ||| because if the old people were taken away , there would remain only children , which is not good .
nabyo nti- bi- shoboka . n- ra- umva ko kugirango avenir [ ejo ha- za- za ] y' abanyarwanda iba -e nzima , ni uko uubyiruko ru- ri ku- zamuka gutya , nirwo umuntu ya- hera -ho y- igisha . ||| for a better future of rwanda , they should educate the coming generation .
kuko nk' iyo umuntu y- iga aba ... iyo umwigisha u- ka- mu- ha exemples [ ingero ] nyinshi a- ra- umva . ||| because as they study and you give them a lot of examples , they understand better .
uretse ko , aba a- ri na ... a- ri nawe wa mbere u- ba uwa mbere ku- bi- ica , ||| however they can even be the first ones to disobey .
ariko iyo a- bi- umva -ish -ije a- ruta ba ba- n- ri ba- ri ha ... ba- ta- igeze ba- gera mu mashuri . ||| but when they have heard about it , they are far better than those who never went to school .
n- umva aribo bantu umuntu ya- ku- igisha . naho bino byo ku- genda ba- ba- igisha ku- babarira ku- sa , njyewe n- umva umuntu ya- ba- igisha imvo n' imvano yabyo , ||| i guess they are the ones who should be sensitized . instead of teaching people how to forgive only , they should teach them the origin of everything , and the cruelty of it all .
a- ka- ba- igisha ububi bwabyo , noneho umuntu wese a- ka- umva ko a- gomba ku- gira ishyaka , ryo ka- umva ko ibyo bintu byose bi- ta- gomba kuba -ho . ||| then everybody will feel concerned in stopping such acts from happing again .

kuko n- umva ko mu bintu byose bi- gomba ku- za- ba -ho , n- gomba kuba aribyo n- banza kumwigisha . ||| because i believe that if there is anything i have to do for them first , is to teach them about those things .
kandi n- ka- umva ko umwana wanjye n' iyo n- ba ndi umukire ku- ta -e , a- ta- rera -w n' umukozi . ||| i also believe that , even if i am very rich , a housemaid will n't be the one to take care of my children .
n- umva ko a- ri njyewe uzamwirerera na mama we . ||| i think their mother and i are the ones who need to raise them . in case their mother will be working , she shall quit her job and first raise up the children .
bi- ba n- gomba -w ni -yo mama we ya- ba a- fite akazi , ||| that is why i earlier told you that it would be difficult for me to marry due to my confusion .

umwana w' umuhererezi , ||| well , i was the last @-@ born . it is said that last @-@ born children always stress their parents ; they easily fall sick .
cyane cyane ba- jya ba- kunda ku- vuga ngo ni umwana u- rushya ; urwaragurika , kuko n- n- jya -e ngo nararwaraguritse , ||| i was told myself i used to be very sickly .
bi- ruka hose , banshakishiriza imiti . ||| people would run around looking for medicine .
ku- sa n- za- ka- umva -ko mama ya- pfuye n- ki- ri muto , ||| i also heard that my mum died when i was very young .
ya- pfuye n- ki- ri muto n- ta- ra- tangira n' umwaka wa mbere primaire . ||| i had not yet reached time to join primary school .
ariko papa we ya- ri a- ki- ri -ho ni nawe tu- hise tu- bana , ||| but by then , my dad was still alive . therefore , we lived with him .
a- ka- jya a- komeza ku- n- y- i- egereza ku ... , aho a- giye hose , aho a- kora hose ; aho a- genze hose , ||| he always used to draw me near him wherever he was and wherever he went .
tu- ka- ba tu- ri kumwe kuko n- ri- n- ri umwana , niwe u- ri u- sigaye a- ri nk' umubyeyi wanjye mukuru , u- gomba kunda -ir ; ku- n- tetesha . ||| sometimes he could even take me at his working place because i was too young to be left alone and also , he was the only parent that we had .
ubwo n- ta- kura nyine a- n- shakira ishuri nk' abandi bose n- ra- iga . ||| so he had to look after me , take good care of me and so on . when time came to go to school , he took me to school like other children .
intambara yo muri 1994 i- za kuba n- ta- ra- gera , n- ta- ra- jya muri secondaire ; n- ri n- ki- ri muri primaire , ||| then in 1994 the war started and by then i had n't joined secondary ; i was still in primary .
n- ra- ibuka ko n- ri maze ku- kora i- cya leta cy' umwaka wa gatandatu icyo ki- ha -e umwaka wa munani u- ri u- maze ku- va -ho . ||| i remember i had sat the national primary leaving examinations p.l.e. by then primary school would stop at the sixth level .
nibwo n- ri n- ki- ki- kora n- tegereje resultat [ ibisubizo ] , nibwo amahano rero yo muri mirongo 1994 ya- baye . ||| level 8 had been removed . therefore i was waiting for my results but unfortunately enough that is when the catastrophes of 1994 started .
ubwo nawe u- ra- bi- umva niko n- vuga ubuzima bwanjye bw' ubwana . ||| i guess you too can imagine how my childhood was .
uko wibuka hagati ya 1990 na 1994 , uko u- bi- bonye ni ryari u- tangiye ku- bona ko ha- ri ikibazo ? ||| when you try to remember between 1990 and 1994 , when did you realize that there was a problem ?
yes , u- ra- umva ubundi mu rwanda kera mbere y' intambara , haba ... , nkubu n- kata -w -e tu- i- gaga secondaire , ||| yes ... long ago in rwanda , that is before the war ... especially those of us who went to secondary school we used to study the history of rwanda .
cyane cyane burya umuntu wize ya- gize chance tu- na- byiga -aga tu- i- gaga amateka ... amateka y' igihugu cy' u rwanda ; ba- tu- bwira mbere y' umwaduko w' abazungu ; ba- ka- tu- bwira nyuma y' umwaduko w' abazungu , ndetse ba- tu- bwira ... ba- ka- tu- bwira no muri icyo ki- ha -e cya mbere y' intambara , ||| we were taught about life in rwanda before the coming of the whites , after the coming of the whites and life before the war meaning how rwandans leaved before the war .
uko tu- ri tu- baye -ho icyo ki- ha -e . aho ni -ho ba- vuga -aga ... icyo ki- ha -e abantu ba- ri ba- fite power ba- ri abahutu ; ubwoko bw' abahutu , ||| during that time , the hutu were on power .
mbere y' intambara ni nabo ba- ri ba- fite ubutegetsi , ||| even before the war , they were the ones in the leadership of the country .
u- ka- sanga ikintu bi- mira -ije i- n- bera -e ba- ka- erekana ububi bw' umututsi , mbese nizo nyigisho za- ri zi- geza -w -e -ho ba- banza -aga ba- ka- erekana uko umututsi ya- tegetse mu bwami . ||| their main goal was to teach how tutsis were bad . generally that was the main lesson . people were first shown how the tutsi used to lead during the monarchy .
ba- rangiza noneho ba- ka- jya ba- erekana mu mayeri uko ... ububi bw' umututsi . ||| then based on that , people were convinced on how bad the tutsi are .
ni muri urwo rwego n- ku- ha nk' urugero ukuntu ba- tangira -aga bati @: "@ tu- bara -e nk' abatutsi ba- ri mw' ishuli . @"@ ||| i could give you an example related to this @: they used to count the number of the tutsi in class , i would be asked to stand up in class .
ba- ka- ku- hagurutsa wenda u- ri nk' umwe cyangwa muri babili , ||| sometimes there was only one or two tutsis in class .
u- ka- umva isoni zi- ra- ku- ishe u- ka- tangira ku- i- baza byinshi . ||| i felt so ashamed and i 'd easily ask myself many questions .
ubwo n- ra- ibuka ko ... , jya -e papa ya- kora -aga ahantu ba- ita -aga i ri- ra- ima ... i ri- ra- ima kuri prison ya ri- ra- ima . ||| i remember my dad used to work in a place called ririma , he was working at the ririma prison .
ni -ho cyane cyane ninaho n- baye ubuzima bwanjye bwo mu bwana . ||| i lived in ririma when i was young .
noneho muri1990 , 1991 , 1992 , igihe ... igihe ba- vuga -aga ngo inkotanyi ngo za- teye , ||| then in 1990 , 1991 and 1992 a rumor spread that inkotanyi troops had invaded the country .
n- umva -aga amakuru y' iwacu za nyamata iyongiyo ba- ra- tangiye ku- twika amazu . ||| i heard that in our home village [ nyamata ] people 's houses were being burnt . the burning of houses used to be the first sign whenever there was a problem of tribes in this region . then the same acts started in ririma too .
ni -ho ba- tangira -iye , ||| normally in bugesera , it seemed as though people were bewitched .
ho iyo ikintu ki- koma -aga ka- erekera -an -ye n' ubwoko , ||| even when they heard that people were being killed ... i was lucky because i was living at the prison and the supervisors protected us . there were times when at the ririma prison everybody was scared that the inkotanyi troops were coming to take control of it .
ba- tangira -aga ku- twika amazu . ||| i remember that time we spent the night outside ; we could not sleep in our houses . then the local people started killing each other ; we could hear that hutu are killing tutsi .
n- ta -w -e , aho n- baga i ri- ra- ima bi- ri byara ... ubundi u bu- gesa -ir bwose wagirango bu- ri bwararozwe naho tu- umva ko abaturage ba- tuye .. , kuko n- jya -e n- baga kuri prison nizo mana zacu tu- ri- n- za -w -e n- ba surveillants , kuko ha- ri n' igihe prison y' i ri- ra- ima yi- geze ku- gira ubwoba i- vuga ngo inkotanyi ba- ra- za kubohoza kuri prison y' iririma . ||| i was so lucky to be protected , by then i was at the prison , and nothing bad happened to us .
icyo ki- ha -e tu- rara ... ntanubwo n- raye mu nzu icyo ki- ha -e twebwe tu- raye hanze ; ubwo nibwo wu- n- va -aga mu ka- ca -e k' abaturage bi- cana ngo abahutu ba- ri- ku- ica abatutsi . ni amahirwe n- gize ku- bona n- ri n- ri- za -w -e n- ri ndi ; n- ri ndi aho kuri prison ntacyo bi- bashije ku- tu- twara , ||| later things cooled down .
bi- geze igihe bi- ra- hosha . ni u- ku- vuga ngo nab' inyamata tuza ka- umva amakuru ko ba- hungiye kuri ... ku kiriziya , ||| we heard that nyamata people hid in the church .
uwo ba- bashije ku- ica baramwishe , ariko abandi ba- hungira ku kiliziya , ba- ra- ba- rinda , ||| however some were killed on their way to the church but those who managed to escape and reach the church were protected .
igihe kiza ku- gera ba- subira mu ngo zabo . ariko ba- ba- twikiye amazu , ||| after sometime they all went back to their homes , most of them found their houses burnt .
ba ... ndetse ha- ri -mo abo ba- ishe , a- ba- subiye mu ngo zabo bagafashanya ba- ka- ongera ba- ka- sakara utuzu tw' utugonyi twa kinyarwanda , ba- ka- ongera ba- ka- tura . ubwo ni uko bi- genda -aga . ||| some people had already been killed , those who went back home could help each other and construct huts [ rwandan traditional houses , made out of sticks and grass ] .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo bu- gesa -ir tu- hora -aga tu- iteguye muri make , tu- iteguye ko tu- gomba ku- higa -w , ||| generally in bugesera we were always ready ; we knew we were being hunted and that at any particular time , we would all be killed .
cyangwa ku- icwa isaha n' isaha . ni u- ku- vuga ngo nta bu- umvikana -e n- bona -aga hagati y' umututsi n' umuhutu ba- hora -aga ba- meze nk' ingwe , cyangwa i pusi n' imbeba niko n- bi- gereranya . ||| i had never seen hutu in good terms with tutsi . they were like leopards and ... or cats and rats all the time . that is how i could compare the two clans .
u- bi- bonye ryari ko a- ri ikibazo ? ||| when did you realize it was a big problem ?
ubundi ikibazo n' u- ku- hera muri 1990 , 1991 , ||| well , all problems began in 1990 , 1992 .
ariko aho n- tangiye ku- vuga nti @: ak' umututsi ka- ra- shobotse ni muri 1994 , ||| but it was in 1994 when i realized that any tutsi was in trouble . in 1994 the situation got worse .
ni -ho ibintu bi- ri bi- ra- komeye n- ra- ibuka ko papa ya- ri ya- ra- bonye pansion ( ikiruhuko cy' izabukuru ) kera , tu- sigaye tu- ba i nyamata noneho , aho ba- ita -aga secteur kayumba , icyo ki- ha -e niko ba- hita -aga secteur kayumba . ||| i remember my dad had retired several years before and we were living in nyamata , which used to be called kayumba sector .
ni -ho n- tangira -iye ku- bona ibintu bi- hindutse koko , ni -ho n- humutse kuko ubundi muri 1990 , ||| in nyamata i saw the real change that had occurred ; that is when i opened my eyes .
1992 ba- saga nk' aho ba- ri ba- ra- tu- humye amaso . ni u- ku- vuga ngo tu- ra- hunga -aga , tu- hungira kuri commune cyangwa kwa padiri ( ku kiliziya ) , ||| because from the year 1990 to 1992 , it seemed as though we were blind ; those days , we could flee and just go to the commune or to churches and the priests could protect us and then we could go back to our homes .
ba- ka- tu- rinda tu- ka- subira mu ngo zacu tu- ka- umva ko nta kibazo , ||| therefore , we never thought it was a big problem .
ba- ka- komeza baducengacenga gutyo . ariko aho tu- je ku- bonera ... aho n- je ku- bonera ko ukuri a- ri ukuri , ni icyo ki- ha -e ki- shyira 1994 , ||| but in 1994 , i finally accepted that the facts the way they were .
aho konseye ... konseye w' iwacu secteur kayumba , ya- koresheje inama ( ya- ri umututsi ) . ndetse ... noneho a- koresha inama a- ra- vuga ati @: "@ ngewe ba- sigaye bampisha mu manama ya leta , ||| that is when the councillor who was also a tutsi held a meeting and said , "@ i am no longer invited in meetings that are held on behalf of the government .
ati @: iyo ba- giye ku- korana inama za leta nti- n- ki- jya -yo , ||| therefore , i do n't attend government meeting .
ati ku- sa mu- itegura -e ko a- ka- giye ku- tu- ba -ho , ka- baye ! ati bi- bi- n- ri mwamenyereye ku- jya ku- hungira i nyamata , ati mu- irinda -e nti- ha- gira -e umuntu u- zi- gera a- jya ku- hungira i nyamata . ||| but be ready we are in danger ; stop that habit of fleeing towards the commune or to nyamata church .
ati ni -ho ibi bintu byose bi- giye ku- za- ba ( kuko we ya- ri umuyobozi ya- ra- bi- bona -aga , ||| this time the killings will start from those areas . all i can advise you , is to be ready and face what is going to happen here . @"
ya- ri umukonseye ) , i- bi- giye ku- za- ba byose bi- za- ba bi- turutse ha- ha- n- ri mwahungiraga kuri komine , mu ma kiliziya ni -ho bi- za- ba bi- turutse . ||| because he was a leader , he had spied and got that information .
nti- ha- gira -e umuntu u- za- ibeshya ngo a- jya -e ku- hungira i nyamata , ati @: "@ mu- zi- rwana -e -ho mu- pfa -e mwiruka ariko nti- mu- za- gira -e mu- ta -e ? ||| "@ all the plans for killing that are going to take place are made in the nyamata commune , in churches ; they all have the same plans @"@ , he added .
nti- mu- za- hungira -e i nyamata . @" ||| he warned us that no one should make a mistake of going to the former hiding places .
naho ngewe iyo nama ni -yo u- rebye n- humuka -iye -mo , kuko umuntu burya iyo umutegetsi ; iyo a- ku- bwiye ikintu burya aba a- ki- zi koko . aho ni -ho n- tangiye ka- umvira ubwenge , ||| i learned a lot in that meeting . normally when a leader says something of that sort , it means that he is sure of it .
n' ubwoba bu- tangira kuza , ||| then i grew up in my way of thinking and was so scared .
nti koko ka- shobotse . ||| that is when i really saw how much i was vulnerable .
aho ni muri 1994 mu ntangiriro ? ||| was that in the beginning of the year 1994 ?
mu ntangiriro ! mbese intangiroro za genocide z' itsembabwoko , muri uko kwa kane ; ||| in the beginning ... at the beginning of the genocide and the massacre , it was in april , the early days of the month .
mbese ku- ki- tangira . kuko n- ku- bwiye ... nti- angiriye ubundi amakuru y' i nyamata cyangwa aho muri secteur kayumba . ubundi secteur kayumba cyangwa u bu- gesa -ir , ||| i began with the information concerning kayumba sector or bugesera .
n- ibanze muri nyamata , n- ibanze muri ka- n- y- enze ya- ri nk' indiri ni nk' indiri y' abatutsi ha- ri ha- tuye abatutsi benshi cyane ; ni u- ku- vuga ngo icyakorwaga kibi muri gouvernement , ha- banza -aga u bu- gesa -ir . ||| i mean i am starting from what took place in nyamata , kanzeze because in those areas there were so many tutsi .
ba- ka- twikirwa , ba- ka- icwa , mbese ni -ho hamba -ir -e genocide ya- hita -aga i- banza gufrequa ... ku- gera . ||| whenever there could be any conflicts in the country , people in those areas could be in for it ; houses were burnt , blood was shed , in brief those were the target areas for genocidal acts .
uko bi- genze rero @: ni u- ku- vuga ngo ha- ba- n- je kuba icyo ba- ita i- higa -an , i- higa -an noneho bu- ka- cya , bu- cya u- ka- jya ku- bona u- ka- bona ku musozi ... ‘ ubundi kayumba nti- n- zi ukuntu n- jya n- ba- ha urugero , ||| so , what happened , first there was what one could call ‘ hunting ’ , the following day , one could see at the hill ... [ i have failed to get a better way of giving you examples ] normally there was a hill where we lived , that hill was called kayumba .
ha- ri umusozi umwe uwo musozi niwo n- ri n- tuye -ho witwaga kayumba ha- ka- ba n' indi misozi iyo misozi y- itwa za ... za murama , secteur murama secteur mwogo , secteur muyenzi . ||| then there were other hills called murama sector , mwogo sector and muyenzi sector , which sectors surrounded kayumba .
zi- kikije kayumba iyo kayumba rero ni -yo ya- ri- ri -mo abatutsi benshi , ku- rusha ayo amasecteur ya- n- ri yose . ||| and tutsis resided in kayumba more than in other sectors .
’ noneho bu- cya u- ka- jya ku- bona ba- ka- bona amazu a- tangiye ku- ku- ruma -an , ba- ki- baza , ||| then in the morning , one could see houses in flames and one would wonder .
abantu bakuru kuri twebwe ba- ka- jya bi- baza bati ka- shobotse , bati ba- tangiye ku- twika . ||| but the grown ups would vulnerably nod and say that there was no alternative , that we were going to be exterminated since they [ hutu ] had started with their habit of burning houses .
konseye a- ra- tu- rwanya cyane , a- ra- tu- bwira ati @: « nti- ha- gira -e u- za- hungira hehe .. ? i nyamata ; ||| the counsellor once again warned us from fleeing towards nyamata .
ahubwo mu- manuka -e mu- jya -e ku mipaka y' ayo masecteur . ||| instead , he advised us to go to the boarders of those sectors and our sector .
[ icyo ki- ha -e habyarimana ya- ri a- ta- ra- pfa ] mu- jya -e ku mipaka , ||| by then habyarimana had not yet died .
muboroke , mu- kinga -ir -e interahamwe ziza muri iyi secteur yacu . » ||| so , the counsellor advised us to go to the boarders between our sector and the neighboring sectors and prevent our sector from the interahamwe who were coming in .
kuko secteur ya- ri i- ri -mo abahutu ba- ri ba- ri -mo ha- ri ha- ri -mo nk n- kama -w -e ; tubiri .. tubiri .. , dutatu gutyo , utwo duhutu turitoratoranya tu- va -mo tu- jya muri ayo masecteur ya- n- ri ; ||| there used to be few hutu in our sector about two or three and they even left later on and joined other sectors .
noneho na ba batutsi ba- ri mu masecteur , baza muri secteur yacu kayumba , ||| then other tutsi who were in other sectors came to our sector kayumba .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo @: secteur kayumba iba nk' indiri y' abatutsi . bi- genda bite rero ? noneho , ||| therefore , kayumba sector became a sector of tutsi only .
ubwo tu- tangiye ku- rara amarondo , ||| what came next is that we started patrolling at night in our sector .
ha- ri ubwoko bw' iwacu [ aho muri iyo secteur kayumba ] bwitwaga a- ba- mera -e , n- n- jya -e ubu ndi u- mu- mera -e . ||| there was a clan in kayumba sector , which was known as abamere which i am a member of .
a- ba- mera -e ni abantu ba- baga ba- fite inka , mbese tu- ri tu- fite inka ; ahomuri bu- gesa -ir kayumba tu- baga tu- fite inka , kandi ba- zi ikintu ba- ita umuheto , ||| this is a clan that used to own many cattle in the whole of bugesera @-@ kayumba .
ku- rasa -an n' umuheto . noneho ni u- ku- vuga ngo iyo kayumba rero tu- ki- rinda tukazenguruka secteur yacu . ||| people in that clan used to be good at using bows and arrows . therefore , we could guard our sector by moving around in our sector .
tu- baga tu- tandukana -ije -w n' ibibaya , ||| at different boarder with other sectors , there was a swamp .
ayo masecteur a- tandukanya -ije -w n' ibibaya tu- ka- manuka n- ra- bi- ibuka n- n- jya -e n- ri ndi umwana n' ubwo n- ta- fata -aga umuhoro ba- ra- tu- bwira -aga ngo icyo umuntu a- fite abe aricyo a- manuka -an . ||| this swamp separated our sector from other sectors . i remember i was young but i could carry a machete . we were told that one should carry whatever weapon they could get .
n- ka- fata amabuye tu- ka- manuka , tu- ki- rinda , tu- ka- rara amarondo a- hanga -ho . ||| sometimes i could get stones and we could descend down the hill and patrol the whole night .
noneho , mbere habyarimana a- ta- ra- na- pfa ba- ka- jya baza ba- shaka ku- egera secteur yacu ngo baze ba- tu- higa -e tu- ka- ba- subiza -yo . uko bi- genze rero habyarimana a- gize atya , ||| that was before habyarimana 's death . the perpetrators would attack our home village but we would defeat them and send them back . and then habyarimana died .
ha- ri mu ijoro ryo ku ... ku .. mbese bu- cya a- ri kuya gatandatu , ku tariki ya gatandatu , ||| it was on the 6th at night .
nibwo ninjoro ... tu- ri tu- ri ... n- jya -e n- ri n- subiye mu rugo ni njoro , nko mu ma saa moya saa moya n' igice gutyo ; ||| that night i had gone back home at around half past seven in the evening .
kuko iyo u- ri iwacu mu mbuga y' iwacu u- ba u- reba kanombe amatara y' i kanombe , ||| someone standing in our home compound could see the airport 's security lights [ kanombe airport ] .
tu- ba tu- ya- reba atondetse umurongo kuriya . tu- giye ku- bona tu- ri ku- kama -ish , tu- bona ibintu by' ibiriro bi- ra- zamutse bi- huye hejuru bi- ra- ku- bi- tanye , ||| therefore , while we were milking cows , we saw sparks rising above the airport and suddenly joined up in the air and ignited .
bi- ra- atse . bi- manuka bi- aka ... ibishashi bi- gwa hasi ; ||| then , objects in flames started falling downwards , which from a distance looked like a polythene material falling on the ground .
a- ba- tu- kura -iye , n- ri n- fite mukuru wanjye kwa data wacu u- ri u- zi ubwenge ya- ri ya- rize , ati @: ‘ ibi bintu si amahoro ! ||| those who were grown up like my cousin who was quite intelligent and who had gone to school said , "@ this is not a sign of peace . @"
’ ni uko ya- tangiye ku- vuga , ati @: ||| everybody around said so .
‘ ibi bintu si amahoro . ’ tu- ra- ryama bukeye nibwo ba- tangaje rero ngo inkuru y' inshamugongo ; ngo prezida habyarimana ba- raye ba- rashe indege ye . ||| then we went to bed and in the morning , the news that president habyarimana 's aircraft had crashed and spread all over .
eh ! icyakozwe rero ni iki @: noneho bya bi- n- ri bi- hora -aga bi- gira ku- ta -e ? ||| eh ... what happened next ?
... bitumbatumba ba- bi- shyira ku mugaragaro . ||| all the evil plans that were in their hearts were put out in open .
nti- n- ku- bwira .. ba- tangira ku- jya baza ku- higa muri iyo secteur ; tu- ri- rinze tu- ka- manuka tu- ka- jya mu kibaya icyo kibaya cya karambi tu- ka- hura -ir -mo aho ; ||| i have no words to explain this ... they [ perpetrators ] started hunting people in our sector ; we had protected our sector . we could go to karambi swamp where we could meet the attackers .
nabo ba- ka- manuka ba- vuza amakondera aho ku murama ; ||| those attackers could come while producing musical sound by the use of some local musical instruments made out of horns called amakondera and get in murama .
‘ nti- n- zi niba ... ubyimagine u- bi- i- shyira -e mu mu- ta -w -e u- reba -e ukuntu nawe nk' imisozi iba i- maze hirya no hino . ’ ba- ka- manuka ba- fatanya -e urunana , ||| i wonder if you can imagine ... just put yourself in my shoe at that time and try to think about being attacked by people from all the neighbouring hills , all together for one hill .
ba- vuza amakondera ba- ambaye amakoma ; ||| playing those makondera and dressed in banana leaves .
nibwo ba- tangiye kuba interahamwe koko u- ka- bona ko a- ri ibisimba . ||| that is how they became interahamwe [ people united with a common purpose ] and surely , they looked wild .
noneho , ba- ka- manuka ba- genda ba- vuza amakondera , ba- vuza amafirimbi , ba- genda ba- terana inkunga ; ||| so , they came playing the makondera and whistles with so much courage .
ubwo n- ta -w -e tu- ha- gaze mu kibaya tukanatukana , tukanahamagarana , tuti @: « mu- tinyuka -e mu- za -e . » ||| we could just be standing in the swamp , cursing or calling one another saying , "@ try and come here . @"
ba- ra- manuka ... ba- ka- manuka ba- ka- ha- rara nko hakurya n- ta -w -e tu- hagarara hakuno ba- ka- tera amabuye , ||| they [ attackers ] came and stood on that hill at the other side and we were standing on our hill on this side .
ba- ka- tera amacumu , ba- ka- rasa imyambi , n- ta -w -e tu- ka- ba- oherereza . ubwo , ||| then they started stoning us , shooting arrows , and we also did the same in turn .
tu- ka- ba ... kuko u- ra- umva ba- ba baje a- ri nka bakeya twebwe tu- i- shyize hamwe tu- ka- manuka igihiriri ; ||| they used to come in a smaller number than ours , because for us the whole sector could gather yet for them , some would come while others would not .
ubwo tu- ka- fata amabuye , tu- esa -e tu- manuka -an -ye tu- ka- tera tu- ka- tera twavansa [ tubasatira ] tu- ka- ba- kubita ba- ka- subira -yo bi- ruka . ||| therefore , we could put together our stones and stone them at a go . slowly by slowly they were defeated and went back running .
ubwo umunsi wa mbere u- ba u- ra- shize . ||| a day would end like that .
umunsi wa kabiri ba- ra- ongera , ba- ra- manuka bukeye ba- vuza amakondera ; ||| the following day they came back . they came down the hill still playing the makondera .
noneho ha- ri ibintu ba- ri ba- zanye nti- n- zi ibyo a- ri byo by' ibiriro bi- aka , ||| this time they brought some things i could n't identify ; they were holding things burning with flames .
ba- tu- tera ubwoba , nka biriya biriro ba- ba ba- gira ku kibuga , ||| that was so scary .
iyo nk' ikipe itsinze u- ka- bona ikiriro ki- ra- atse . ba- kaza ba- bi- canye ba- ambaye amakoma ! noneho , n- n- jya -e n- ri ndi umwana u- kunda -aga ku- manuka mu bantu ba- jya -aga ku- tabara , ||| those flames looked like the torches that are always lighted when a team wins a match . the attacker were holding these flames while wearing banana leaves , i was a young boy who used to like joining others on the field .
n- ka- manuka -an amabuye , noneho tu- ka- hura -ir muri cya kibaya tu- ka- rasa -an , tu- ka- rasa -an , tu- ka- ba- kubita ba- ka- zamuka . ||| i would carry stones and we met them in the swamp and fought ; we shot each other until when they were forced to run back while no one had been killed in our group .
nta muntu u- pfuye n' umwe , ||| on the third day , that is when they realised that we were serious .
ku- sa a- ri u- ku- rasa -an imyambi tu- ka- cenga -an nabo ba- ka- tu- rasa tu- ka- cenga -an , ubwo ba- ka- zamutse . ||| therefore , they came down the hill like they used to and we too did the same as it had become the routine .
umunsi wa gatatu nibwo baje ku- bona ko tu- ri serieux koko ba- ra- manutse nk' uko bi- ri bi- sanzwe , ||| inside our hearts we were confident that we shall conquer them .
mbese n- ta -w -e tu- ra- manuka nk' uko bi- ri bi- sanzwe , tuti @: ‘ tu- za- ba- kubita aba . ’ kuko tu- ri twariyemeje ko tuti ntabwo ba- za- pfa ku- tu- ica urubozo ; ||| we had decided never to let interahamwe kill us cruelly . so they tricked us by coming down the usual way and very close .
ba- ra- manutse , ba- maze ku- manuka nibwo baratujijishije tu- ra- rasa -an nka ku- ku- n- ri , tu- giye ka- umva tu- umva ba- rashe pistolet . ||| then we started shooting arrows as we used to do and all of a sudden , we heard them shouting with guns .
ubwo n- ri- ruka n- ri- ruka ... n- ri- ruka pe ! ||| i ran and seriously ran .
n- sanga ... noneho n- renga , ha- ri ahantu ha- ri ibitare , sasa , ||| i ran beyond a place where there used to be rocks .
kuko conseiller wacu ya- ri ya- vuze , ati @: « abantu nibave mungo zabo , ||| the local counsellor had ordered people to remain in their homes . he had said , "@ nobody should leave their homes and people should stay together . @"
bi- runda -ir -e ahantu hamwe . » ba- ri bi- runda -iye ku gasozi , ako gasozi bi- taka -aga ka kayumba nyine , ahantu ha- ri n' ishyamba n' amabuye abantu bose a- ri -ho bi- runda -iye ; ||| therefore people gathered together on one hill , which was kayumba hill .
abagore , abana , mbese n' inka , a- ri ho tu- giye tu- shinga imizi abantu ba- jya mu ngo zabo ku- gira ku- ta -e ? ||| that place was bushy and stony and crowded with the people who had gathered there , children , women , and cattle ... generally that is the place where we had camped .
ku- teka -ir yo , ba- ka- gemura ... ba- ka- jya kura -ir ahantu tu- i- shyize hamwe . nibwo rero interahmwe za- je zi- rara muri abo bantu , ||| some people would go home and prepare food in secret and bring the food to people in the camp where we were .
za- ica abagore , za- ica abasaza , za- ica abana , a- honga -ho ni -ho ha- pfuye sasa umututsi , ||| later on , the interahamwe spread into the camp and killed so many people ; women were killed , old people , children ... tutsis died on that day .
ni naho , ni naho umugore wa data wacu ya- guye icyo ki- ha -e . ||| i remember that is the day when my uncle 's wife was killed .
aho ni -ho ha- guye sasa umuntu w' umututsi wo muri kayumba , ||| the majority of the tutsis from kayumba died from there .
bi- raye muri izo nzirakarengane ba- ra- bi- ca kweri . ||| the interahamwe poured in those innocent people and killed them so badly .
ariko jyewe n- ta- komeza , maze ku- komeza , n- gera i nyamata kuri centre , u- ra- umva ko consieller ya- ri ya- ra- tu- bujije ku- jya kuri centre y' i nyamata ko a- ri -ho bi- turuka , ||| i continued to nyamata centre but the counselor had warned us from going to nyamata centre because all the plans of violence were made from there .
ariko abantu ntabwo bi- geze ba- bi- umva . kuko manuka n- manuka -an -ye n' impunzi cyangwa abatutsi n' inka zabo ngo ba- giye kuri komine , ngo ba- giye kwa padiri . komine na kiliziya bi- ra- turanye by' i nyamata , ||| but most people never agreed with him , because on my way i was with tutsi refugees who were fleeing with their cows and belongings and when oasked , they could say that they were going to the commune or to the church [ nyamata church and commune are next to each other ] .
ngo ba- giye kuri komine ba- za- ba- rinda . ni u- ku- vuga ngo , ba- ri ba- buze uko ba- bi- gira nyine , nta ku- n- ri , ||| therefore , people would say that they were going there to seek for protection .
kuko ntabwo u- rwana n' imbunda ! ba- ri ba- zi ko kuri komine no kuri kiliziya koko a- ri ho ba- za- ba- rinda . ||| in people 's mind , the church and the commune were always secure .
ubwo jyewe , n- ra- manutse , ||| i also went down the hill .
ariko ku mu- ta- ima n- ra- vuga ngo jyewe simanukana n' aba bantu n' iki kivunge , nti reka ... n' iki gihiriri , nti reka n- ku- ereka -e , ||| deep in my heart i was saying i would n't go with all these people .
nti n- giye ku- kata muri centre n- ra- ni , mbese mu isoko n- ra- ni , isoko rya nyamata nibwo n- ciye mu mazu hagati , n- ra- genda n- ikubita mu nzu ha- ri inzu bacururizagamo ibigage , ||| therefore , i took a short cut through the center [ through the nyamata market ] . i passed between houses and entered a certain house where they used to sell local beer .
u- ra- bona mbese buriya buzu bwo mu mugi bwa kenyege . n- ki- kubita -mo , n- ta- kingura umuryango , n- kinguye umuryango n- sanga -mo abandi bantu , ||| that house looked like those houses in the city slams . i found people inside who were also hiding .
bahu ... ba- icaye -mo ... ba- hungiye mo , ba- ri ku- humeka -ir hejuru , ariko n- sanga ko a- ri abatutsi bene wacu . ubwo tu- ra- icara , ||| they were breathing deeply but when i realized that they were tutsi , i joined them and took a sit .
n- ra- ibuka ko n- bize icyuya ki- shobora ka- uzura nk' igikombe , ||| i remember that time almost half a liter of sweat came out [ of my body ] .
n- ryama hasi n- ra- banza ndacururuka ... , ||| i laid down and first took a rest .
ariko ubwo n- umva amasasu a- vuga ruguru iyo za kayumba . ||| but i could hear gun shots towards kayumba area .
maze gucururuka nibwo n- hagurutse , tu- sa n- ba- kingura idirishya gatoya tu- reba hanze aho rero ni -ho n- tangiye ku- bona amaraso y' umuntu , ||| later i woke up and we slightly opened the window and piped outside . that is the time i started seeing people 's blood .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo n- tangiye ku- bona bi- ca umuntu , ||| i saw people being hacked .
ba- ri ba- ba- ishe kera , ba- ba- ishe mbere ariko kuko jya -e n- iruka -aga ntabwo n- bi- ita -aga -ho , ||| well even before , people were killed but because i was running all the time , i never observed it clearly like then .
n- ri- ruka -aga nyine n- rengera ubuzima . ||| i would just run for my own life .
noneho ubwo tu- ra- runguruka n- bona umuntu ba- ri ku- icisha kupakupe [ coupe @-@ coupe ] a- honga -ho mu mugi wa nyamata ; ||| so , as we piped , we saw someone who was being killed with a machete . that was in nyamata town .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo a- ka- haguruka ya- haguruka ba- ka- mu- kubita kupakupe a- ki- ku- bu- ta hasi , ya- ka- ongera ku- haguruka ba- ka- mu- kubita kupakupe a- ka- ongera a- ki- kubita hasi , mpaka uwo muntu a- pfuye . ||| whenever he would try to stand up , he would be slashed then he would fall down again , he was slashed until he died .
ba- mu- kina -ir -ho ngo wa nyenzi we ngo u- jya -aga he , ||| they were playing on his mind asking him , "@ you cockroach where were you going ? @"
n- bi- umva ndi aho ngaho mu nzu . noneho ibyo bi- va -ho haza icyo ba- ita ku- kora , interahamwe zi- hita kuri utwo ducentres zi- vuga , ||| i was silently listening from that house .
ngo @: ||| later on , they started using the term "@ to work . @"
« tu- giye ku- kora , » ba- hera ku nzu ya mbere basaka kuri utwo ducentres twa nyamata , basaka , ||| the interahamwe could pass through the center saying , "@ we are going to work @" [ implying that they are going to kill ] . they started searching house by house in nyamata center .
basaka .. basaka ... , ba- twika , inzu y' umututsi cyangwa boutique y' umututsi , ya- ri iy' mututsi ba- ka- hita bayishumika ba- ka- yi- twika . ||| they searched all around and they burnt houses or shops that were owned by tutsis in that area .
noneho ba- hera kuri boutique ya mbere ba- twika , ba- twika ... ba- twika ; ||| shops were burnt , one after the other .
noneho jyewe ku mu- ta- ima ndavunga nti @: nti- n- shaka ko ba- n- sanga muri iyi nzu . baza ku- gera ku nzu y' umugabo witwaga ka- ha- ima , ||| i said to myself , "@ i do n't want to be found in this house . @" then in no time they had reached gahima 's house .
ya- ri umukuru wa pl , ya- ri president wa pl aho ngaho i bu- gesa -ir ; ||| [ gahima was the president of pl in bugesera ] .
ba- ra- yi- twika pe ! ya- ri inzu nziza cyane , barayishumika n- ra- yi- bona ukuntu i- hise i- ku- ruma -an nti koko . kuko ba- ba- n- je ku murongo umwee ... kuburyo baza kuza ku- tu- gera -ho . ||| his house was very beautiful but it was burnt to ash . it was ignited and i saw its flames . the interahamwe burnt house after house to the point where , in the end , they were going to reach us .
noneho , n- ra- vuga nti @: aho kugirango ba- n- sanga -e , ba- n- fata -e muzima nk' uku ba- n- yi- ca -e urupfu rubi ; ||| but i did n't want to wait to see the interahamwe getting me alive and see myself dying a painful death .
nti jyewe ba- za- n- yi- ca n- iruka . ||| i decide to die running .
nibwo n- fashe umwuko , ubundi ha- ri icyuko ... iyo nzu n- injiye -mo bayishigishiragamo ikigage . n- fata umwuko , ||| then i reached for a spatula [ made out of wood , about two meters long ] that was in that house , which they used for stirring while making the local beer .
icyuko kinini n- ki- shyira ku rutugu , maze ku- ki- shyira ku rutugu n- shaka ku- sohoka , n- shatse ku- sohoka abo bagenzi banjye ba- ra- vuga bati @: ||| i held the spatula across my shoulders and tried to get out . when the people who were in the house saw that i was going to get out , they stopped me .
"@ u- retse ba- ta- ku- icira hanze . @" ||| "@ why do n't you stay here , do you want to die from outside ? @" they asked me .
nti @: njyewe mu- n- babarira -e ntabwo n- za- pfa ndi munzu , ngo ba- n- twikira -e munzu , nti jyewe mu- n- babarira -e n- sohoka -e , ||| i excused myself and told them that i was not going to die inside a house , to be burnt in the house .
n- ra- ba- nanira ba- shaka ku- n- fata n- ra- ba- nanira n- kubita urugi n- ta- sohoka mpita n- subira , ||| then when i refused to stay , they tried to hold me [ to stop me from leaving ] and i hit the door open and i left .
n- subira i- n- y- uma y' amazu . noneho , ||| immediately i hid behind the houses .
wu- n- va -e iyo umuntu a- jya ku- pfa cyangwa iyo urupfu ru- bunza umuntu a- bura uko a- bi- genza , a- ka- jya mu bi- ta- shoboka kandi bi- gomba ku- shoboka . ||| but when someone is meant to die or if death is on the way , it is very hard to think straight .
ubwo jyewe n- ra- vuga nti reka n- n- jya -e n- sanga -e abandi kuri komine no ku kiliziya aho ba- giye . ||| while i was behind the house , i decided to join others at nyamata commune or church .
ubwo abandi ba- ri ba- maze ku- genda ta- ya- ri , impunzi za- shize i- n- y- uma nyine a- ri jyewe n- sigaye . ni u- ku- vuga ngo , ||| other refugees [ tutsi ] had already left ; it was only i left behind .
n- ra- retse ibintu bi- ra- banza bi- ra- hosha , noneho n- n- jya -e n- va muri iyo nzu , n' icyo cyuko n- ra- genda nyine nta ... , nta ku- tinya kugirango bagirengo ndi interahamwe . ||| i waited for the situation to calm down and then later i walked slowly with my spatula without fear in order to give people the impression that i am an nterahamwe .
n' icyuko meze nabi cyane nirakaje . ubwo n- ra- manuka i- n- y- uma y' amazu ... n- ra- manuka ntawunkomakoma ... n- ra- manuka n- gera ahantu ba- ita mu ... , muka ... , nani mu kajevuba , ||| i looked very serious and passed behind the houses . no one talked about me , i just walked firmly and reached a place called kajevuba formally , it was known as gatare .
cyane cyane ba- hita ku gatare noneho aho ku gatare iyo u- ha- ciye u- hita u- zamuka u- jya kuri , kuri komine ariko n- shaka ku- jya , kuri komine . n- zamutse n- giye ku- jya kuri komine mpita mpabona bariyeri , ||| through gatare one just ascends the hill and reaches the commune . i was trying to get to the commune . before i reached the commune , i saw a roadblock just ahead of me .
ba- maze ku- ha- shyira bariyeri , bariyeri y' umupolisi . ||| at the roadblock there was a policeman .
u- ra- bona abapolisi ba kera imbunda ba- gira -aga , ba- gira -aga z' ibibaho gutya ... , ariko icyo ki- ha -e uwo mupolisi ya- ri a- fite imbunda i- teye ubwoba ! ||| normally during the days before the war , policemen used to have wooden guns , but that policeman had a scary gun .
kubwanjye n- yi- shyira mu rwego rwa mitrayeze . noneho n- ri n- fite icyo cyuko mpita n- za ... nti n- ta- shaka ku- jya kuri komine , ariko n- bwira uwo mu polisi . ||| holding my huge spatula i told the policeman , "@ i want to go the commune @" [ i was desperate , i knew in all cases , i would die ] .
kuko n- ri n- vuze nti ni u- ku- pfa no ku- pfa nti uko n- vuga kose . ||| i did n't care about the way i was saying it .
noneho umupolisi a- ra- n- bwira ati @: u- ra- shaka ku- jya kuri komine ? ||| the policeman asked me , "@ you want to go the commune ?
ati bu- retse , ati @: ntabwo ba- ra- tangira ku- ica . ||| wait , killings at the commune have not yet started . @"
ubwo nibwo n- hise n- vuga nti @: ba- ra- pfuye bariya bantu ba- giye kuri komine ! nti reka n- reka -e ku- jya -yo , nti kuko maze ku- menya ibanga ry' igituma ba- giye -yo . ||| then i realised that people at the commune were going to die in the meantime .
nti butya bariya bantu ba- ra- za ku- bi- ca ? nibwo n- subiye i- n- y- uma ubwo a- ra- n- bujije . maze ku- subira i- n- y- uma ubwo n- ta- kata , ||| then i told the policeman , "@ okay , i will go back and wait . @" then i understood the logic behind sending people to the commune .
na none ni ha- ha- n- ri n- ra- vuga -aga nti ese n- ra- jya hehe ? ||| i went back but i was wondering were i would go .
n- shaka izindi n- zira kugirango nyura -e -mo n- subira -e kuri ya komine , n- jya -e kuri komine nyine . ||| so , i looked for another shortcut that would lead me to the commune .
nibwo n- tambitse nyura aho ba- ita aho mu kajevuba nyine ; n- ki- tera intambwe ebyiri , n- sanga aho interahamwe zi- ri ku- vumbura umukobwa u- ri wihishe muri toilette , zi- ri ku ... kumukinguza ngo n- kingura -e , ||| i crossed through that place called kajevuba and as i had made two steps , i found the interahamwe who were forcing a lady to open the door of the toilets in which she was hiding .
ubwo n- ri n- ki- fite cya cyuko cyanjye ; ngo kingura , ngo kingura tu- ku- ica -e wa .. ba- mu- tuka ngo wa mbwakazi we . ||| " open the door you bitch @"@ , the interahamwe were shouting at her .
umukobwa ati @: « mbwambabariye , » a- vuga -ir mo . ||| and she was pleading for forgiveness inside the toilet saying , "@ please forgive me . @"
ubwo n- n- jya -e , kuko n- bi- kubise -mo , nanirwa ubu- iruka nanirwa n' ubu- subira i- n- bera -e , ||| because i had already bumped into them , i could neither run back nor continue a head .
ariko umutima u- ra- n- bwira uti ihangana -e u- subira -e i- n- bera -e , ||| but my heart told me , " be strong and go ahead . @"
n- komeza -e , n- komeje n- ra- genda n- i- vanga nabo n' izo nterahamwe na cya cyuko cyanjye . ||| therefore , i went ahead and joined the interahamwe . i still had the spatula .
ubwo ni n- n- jya -e u- baye uwa mbere mu ku- kubita icyuko kuri urwo rugi kugirango ba- tamenya , n- ka- kubita icyuko kuri urwo rugi nti @: ||| in fact , i was the first person to bang my spatula on the toilet 's door so that they would n't know me .

ubwo tu- ri- shima , tu- tangira ku- vuga cyane , bi- bi- n- ri byo ka- ongorera biba bi- ra- shize . ||| we were so happy and we started talking loudly and we forgot about the tactic of whispering .

igituma , cyane cyane ni ibintu nka bitatu @: i- cya mbere , n- umva -aga kubwanjye , ||| there are about three reasons why i joined the army ; the first one was the bad impression i had of the hutu .
n- umva -aga remord n- fite y' umuhutu ku- n- za . n- ka- vuga kweri u- mu- nyaga -w w' umuhutu , n- ka- umva ko intambara i- ta- za- pfa i- rangiye , mu buzima bwanjye . ||| i felt like the war would never end .
ati ... ko a- gomba kuza a- ka n- yi- ca bi- anga bi- kunda , ariko noneho n- ra- vuga nti @: ' reka n- za -e n- ku- ereka -e . ||| therefore , i had to join the army and get trained and maybe own a gun so that in case i was attacked , i would be able to fight back and then go and save others who were still being killed .
reka n- za -e n- jya -e mu gisirikare , ||| i had left them behind .
ni -yo yaza a- sanga -e n- fite imyitozo ya gisirikare , cyangwa n- fite imbunda n- shobora ku- mu- rwanya . ’ ikindi cya kabili @: ||| secondly , i wished to be a hero .
n- umva -aga n- shaka ku- komeza , n- n- jya -e cyane cyane n- tabara -e ; n- tabara -e abari ku- komeza ku- pfa . kuko n- n- jya -e n- umva -aga n- ra- ba- size i- n- y- uma . ||| i wanted to save those who were still being killed , well i had left them behind but i wished to go back and save them .
i- cya gatatu @: ni ubwo buzima n- ri n- baye -ho , a- honga -ho mu buhungiro . n- ka- vuga ngo reka n- va -e muri ubu buzima n- jya -e mu gisirikare wenda ni -ho bi- za- mera -ir neza . ||| thirdly , i joined the army because the life i was leading in the refugee camp was horrible . therefore , i decided to join hoping to find a slightly better life .

ni u- ku- vuga ngo abanyarwanda tu- ramutse tu- baye abantu bakingutse , ba- ki- n- ku- kira -an -ye nikonavuga ; ba- shobora kubwizanya ukuri . u rwanda u- bona ru- jya ahantu heza . ||| if rwandans were open to one another , i mean they can be honest towards each other ; the future of rwanda would be good .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo mu rwanda rwacu ha- ri abantu b' inyangamugayo ariko ha- ri -mo n' abandi ba ruryi ba- ki- meze ... ba- ki- fite inda zi .. , zi- jya i- n- bera -e , ||| in my country rwanda there are honest people , however there are also others who are still greedy .
ba- shyize inda i- n- bera -e . rero u rwanda rwacu u- ru- rebye , u- ru- rebye i- n- bera -e gutya u- bona a- ri u rwanda ru- jya ahantu heza . ru- fite vision nziza . ||| if you critically observe rwanda , you will find that rwanda has a good vision .
ariko mu ki- ha -e ha- ta- je za kirobya nk' i- bi- aka -ir , ||| the only condition is that some of its people do not become selfish .
ngo abantu ba- shyira -e inda i- n- bera -e . kandi bi- genda bi- garagara , u- genda u- bi- bona ko ha- ri abantu ba- fite inyungu zabo . ||| it has been happening , people who put their personal interests forward .
ba- shyize inda i- n- bera -e . jya -e niko n- bi- bona . ||| sometimes i say they are selfish .
ikibazo nti- ki- umvikana ! ||| q ...
ubundi njyewe , kera mu gisirikare nibwo bi- geze ku- vuga , ngo @: « ariko u- je tu- ka- jya ku- ku- siba -ish iyi nkovu yawe ! » ||| sometime ago when i was still in the army , i was asked if i could accept to be taken abroad and get my scar removed but i refused .
ngo ba- n- jyana -e hanze ! n- ra- bi- anga , n- ra- bi- anga , nti @: ||| i told those people that my scar would stay as y souvenir of the genocide , because i personally do n't find it easy to forget the genocide .
' njyewe nimundekere inkovu , inkovu i- za- ba amateka . kuko jyewe ku bwanjye n- umva jenoside n- ta- shobora ku- y- ibagirwa , nti- biba -ho . ||| never .
n- n- jya -e ikintu n- shaka ku , ubundi n- shaka ku- kora , n- ta- shaka kuba inararibonye , mu mateka y' u rwanda . ||| i want to appear in the history of rwanda .
nti- n- za- ibagirwa -e i- bi- ambaye -ho , n- bi- bwira -e n' ubuvivi n' ubuvivure niko n- vuga , umuntu u- za- n- turuka -ho wese a- bi- menye , a- menye ko genocide a- ri mbi . ||| i will never forget what happened to me and i will tell it to my grandchildren and my great grand children . whoever will generate from my family will have to learn that genocide is very bad .
kandi n- jya -e ... ni u- ku- vuga ngo @: n- jya -e mpora nyamagana . ukuyamagana kwanjye n- garagaza ibibi bi- baye -mo ; ||| i will expose what was in it [ genocide ] .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo kuko jyewe bi- ambaye -ho n- bi- garagaza -e nk' uko n' ubu n- bi- ba- bwira -ir i- n- bera -e . ||| the way i am now giving you this testimony .
u- bona ibibazo bi- komoka kuri jenoside , bizaffecta abana bawe [ bi- za- gira ingaruka ku bana bawe ] n' ubuvivi bwawe ? ||| do you believe that consequences of the genocide will affect your offspring ?
yee ! biza affecta [ bi- za- gira ingaruak ] kuko ; nk' ubu jya -e n- baye responsable w' aba rescapes n- ka- iga aho ba- ita i shyogwe muri ki- ta- arama . ||| it will affect them because already now i became the person responsible for survivors by the time i was in a school in shyogwe in gitarama .
n- ka- gerageza ka- umva abana , abana ba- ka- jya ba- n- bwira ibibazo byabo , ||| i try to listen to the children and to understand their problems .
u- ka- sanga nk' umuntu u- turutse hanze , sibyo ? ntabyo ya- bonye n' amaso , ||| someone did not see what took place during the genocide , for example the people who came from the neighbouring countries and who did not see what happened besides hearing it from people .
ariko ku ... ku- bi- mu- bwira ku- sa , tu- vuga -e u- bi- mu- bwiye . u- ka- sanga ... cyangwa u- ka- umva a- ra- shaka kuza mu muryango aba rescapes . ||| well some of these people say that they want to join the survivors association .
ati @: « jyewe n- ta- shaka kuza mu muryango w' aba rescapes . » kuko a- zi ububabare bwabo . ndetse ha- ka- ba -ho n' igihe a- hahamuka . ||| some join and sometimes get traumatised after hearing people 's testimonies within the association .
urwo ni ... ni urugero rworoshye . noneho n- ka- n- jya -e rero u- byaye , ||| that is a simple example .
tu- vuga -e nimbyara umwana wanjye n- ka bi- mu- bwira , nkanamwereka ... nkanamwereka ingaruka mbi , ||| but i personally if i get my own children , i will tell my children the stories of genocide and show them the consequences of it .
nkamwereka exemple n' igikomere , cyangwa nani inkovu n- fite ya genocide yo muri 94 . ||| i will show them my scar of the 1994 genocide .
bi- za- ba a- ri ikibazo , ||| i know it will be hard .
umwana wanjye a- gomba ku- bi- bika mpaka ! ku- sa impungenge wenda n- fite , ni uko ha- ri -ho abantu ba- za- komeza kumanjirirwa nk' abo bahutu ; ba- za- komeza bamanjirirwe , ||| but my children will have to keep it at heart . but i am worried because there are some people , the hutu for example who will keep on harassing my kids .
tu- za- jya tu- bi- vuga bamanjirirwe , iyo ni -yo mpungenge n- fite nti est @-@ ca -e @-@ que ba- za- tinyuka ? ||| but i really wonder if they will one day feel free to live with us with no worries ?
ba- ongera -e ba- bana -e n- ta -w -e neza ba- umva -e bisanganywe ntibi ... n- ba n- umva bi- ta- shoboka nti- n- zi uko n- bi- vuga . ||| i find it impossible , i do n't know how i can put it .
noneho n- ra- umva u- shobora ku- tanga nka message [ ubutumwa ] , u- ha isi yose cyangwa n' abantu ba- shobora ka- umva ubu bu- hamya . ||| is there any particular message you would like to pass to the world at large especially to those who will came across this testimony .
amafaranga n- ta- ki- n- ri a- maze , niba u- kunda u rwanda , kandi wu- n- va u- vuga ngo @: ||| money has no value if you do n't use it appropriately .
ubwiyunge bw' abanyarwanda u- hora ubu- shyira i- n- bera -e , bi- erekana -e . fata ba bana ba- ri ku- gwa aho ngaho , ba- ri kubura amashuri u- ba- egereza -e u- ba- tunga -e mu rugo rwawe . ||| but sincerely if you are a nationalist and you really need reconciliation among rwandans then show that love , take in the orphans who are starving out there , who have no school , take them in and raise them in your home .
twe ku- shyira i- n- bera -e inda ku- sa zacu , ||| let 's not be selfish .
ahubwo tu- reba -e abanyarwanda muri ru- sanga -e . nidukundana nibwo igihugu cyacu ki- za- tera i- n- bera -e . kandi icyambere ni u- ku- kunda igihugu , aho ku- gira ngo tu- kunda -e ... buriya ha- ri umugabo n- jya n- emera perezida wacu wa repubulika , ||| rwandans in general , we should love one another that is how we will be able to develop our country .
ni umugabo . ni umugabo perezida , kuko we a- kunda igihugu n' abanyarwanda . ku- sa , ||| i like our president because he loves his country and the people in the country , which i find very wise .
ima -an i- za- mu- fashe a- korana -e n' abantu ba- kunda igihugu , ||| may god bless him . i wish he works together with people who love the country and the nation at large , and then our country will develop .
ba- kunda abanyarwanda . kugirango igihugu cyacu tu- ki- zamura -e . ||| to love the people who love their country and rwandans in order do develop it .
n- ra- umva a- ri aho ... a- ri -yo message [ ubutumwa ] n- tanga @: ‘ kuba umunyarwanda ya- kundana n' undi ; kandi a- ka- haranira i gihugu cye . ||| the message i can pass on to all rwandans is to love one another and strive for the improvement of our country .
’ niko n- vuga . ikindi n- ra- ongera n- bi- subira -e -mo @: ‘ umuntu wese wi- beshya gupfobya genocide ... ijambo genocide uwo ni ukumwamaganira kure . ||| the other thing is and i will not stop repeating it , anyone who denies the genocide should be opposed .
’ murakoze . ||| thank you .
ariko ubwo hagati aho , ubwo baza ku- ica murugo nyine , baje a- ri benshi a- ba- zanye intwaro , a- ba- fite impiri , ||| when they came home to kill , they were very many . some were armed ; others were carrying clubs and many other weapons .
a- ba- fite iki , ||| so they came home and found us there .
ni uko ba- tu- sanga nyine aho tu- ri tu- ri mu rugo kuko tu- ri abantu benshi cyane , ha- ri n' abari ba- bashije ku- hungira mu rugo abari hafi abari ba- tu- egereye , kuko ba- bona -aga ko nta ha- n- ri hantu ba- shobora kuba ba ... ba ... ba- ca cyangwa se bakwitabaza . ||| we were very many ; some neighbours had come to hide home because they had no other alternative ; they could n't go and hide anywhere else .
ba- hita -mo kuza mu rugo rero kugirango tu- i- fatanya -e , ubwo niba a- ri u- ku- rokoka tu- rokoka -e cyangwa se niba a- ri igihe cyo ku- pfa nyine ubwo tu- pfa -e . ||| therefore , they decided to join us at home saying that , if it meant to die , we would die together . or if it meant to survive , we would also survive together .
nibwo rero nyine bi- je kuba , ok n- basha ku- va -mo , ||| so it happened but ... well , i managed to escape .
ubwo baje a- ri mu ki- ha -e cya saa kumi n' ebyiri nigice . baza a- ri benshi , ki- ri nk' igitero cy' abantu ba- gera hafi nko kuri magana abiri , ||| they came at around six thirty , a big number ; it was an attack of about two hundred people .
kuko ha- ba- n- je abasirikare ba- fite imbunda , ||| soldiers came first and then the interahamwe followed .
nyuma y' aho nibwo ha- je kuza mo interahamwe , ariko nazo zi- ka- ba zo za- ri zi- tegereje ko u- ri bu- basha -e ku- rokoka a- simbuka nabo ba- basha -e uburyo ba- shobora kuba bamurangiriza nyine , ||| they [ interahamwe ] were waiting to kill those who would manage to escape [ the soldiers ] .
ibyabo ba- ita -aga ngo ni u- ku- rangiza . ||| they used to call it ‘ finishing off ’ .
ubwo ... bon , ha- ri ha- ri -mo a- ba- twite , ababyeyi ba- twite , abandi bantu b' inshuti ba- ri ba- ri aho , ||| then ... well , some of them were pregnant , all the friends who were there ... i am the one who came out of there alive .
ubwo ni n- jya -e muntu u- bashije ku- va mo muri abo bose . ha- ri igihe cya nimugoroba , ba- tu- rasa ba- ri abantu benshi cyane , ||| it was in the evening when they started shooting us and they were very many .
ku- sa ariko aho n- ri ndi n- bashije ku- ha- byuka ngo n- reba -e ko ha- ri uwaba ya- rokotse n- sanga nta n' umwe , n- sanga imivu y' amaraso , iki . ||| as i was lying down , i stood up and checked if there was anyone else who survived but there was none . there were only floods of blood .
ariko kubera ko icyo ki- ha -e n- n- jya -e ok , n- ri maze kuba igishushungwe n- umva -aga nta kintu n- shobora ku- basha ku- kora hagati aho , biba n- gomba -w ko n- n- jya -e n- shakisha uburyo n- shobora kuba n- va aho hantu . ||| but because by then i was ... well , i had become numb ; i could n't think of doing anything at that time yet i needed to find my way out of that place .
ku- ha- va bi- ra- n- goye cyane , kuko n- ta- ri ku- bona inzira y' ahantu n- shobora kuba n- ca n' iki . ||| it was n't easy to leave that place because i was difficult to find space where to step .
ok ! n- basha ku- i- hisha ahantu n- i- hishe , n- za ku- gira ima -an n- bona burakeye , ||| well , i hid myself and i was lucky to see a new day .
nibwo n- bashije n- n- jya -e ku- gerageza uburyo n- va aho hantu . ||| that is when i got out of that place .
kuko n- bona -aga ko bi- rangiye , nta ki- n- ri kintu n- ki- ha- tegereje , ||| i thought it was the end of everything and so , there was nothing i was waiting for .
n- ra- vuga nti @: n- n- jya -e reka n- shakisha -e uburyo n- shobora kuba n- ku- i- rwana -ho n- reba -e ko n- rokoka . ||| then i thought , " let me find a way of protecting myself and see if i would survive . @"
n- basha kubatoroka , ku- sa n' a- baje nyuma , kubera ko aho ba- n- rasa -iye n- ha- taye ishati y' icyatsi , ba- ri ba- ra- n- rashe hano mu mugongo . ||| i escaped them . even those who came later ... in fact , i left a green shirt where i was shot ; i was at the back .
mpata ishati yanjye , ubwo bukeye baje ku- sahura nibwo ba- menye ko ha- ri umuntu u- bashije ku- ha- va . ||| so i left my shirt there and the following morning , when some people came to loot , they realized that someone had managed to escape .
ba- gerageza ku- shakisha ngo ba- reba -e wenda ko ba- n- bona , ||| they tried to look for me but they could n't find me .
kuko ba- ri ba- tanze n' amatangazo cyane ba- vuga bati @: "@ umuntu tu- ri bu- sanga -an -e uwo muntu , nawe tu- shobora ku- mu- gira -ir nabi . @" ||| they even declared that whoever will be caught hiding me would also be killed .
ariko kubera ko hafi a- honga -ho a- ta- ri -ho n- bashije kuba natorokera , ubwo n- ta- komeza n- ra- genda , ||| but i did n't hide near there , i continued fleeing .
ki- ri igihe cy' imvura , imvura iga -w n' iki , n' abandi bantu ba- hunga , ba- gira ku- ta -e . ||| it was the rainy season ; it used to rain heavily and several people were fleeing .
n- shakisha uburyo n- shobora kuba n- hunga ngo n- jya -e kuri e.t.o [ ishuri rya kicukiro ] n- bona bi- ta- shoboka , kuko hagati a- honga -ho nta bu- fasha bu- n- ri n- ri n- fite . ||| i looked for a way of going to e.t.o [ a technical school in kicuciro ] but it was n't possible because i had no one to help me [ get there ] .
n- gerageza ku- shakisha uburyo bwose bi- ra- nanira -an , ||| i tried all possible ways but i failed .
ubwo nibwo n- giye ndorongotana ahantu hose n' iki , ||| then i started moving around .
ariko aho hose n- tekereza -aga ko ha- shobora kuba ha- ri abavandimwe , nabo ba- ri ba- maze ku- pfa . ||| however i thought there were relatives who had survived nearby but they had all died .
ubwo n- komeza gutyo iki , intambara i- ra- komeza y' i- ki- enda -an kane [ 1994 ] n- genda n- ca mu bantu ba- giye ba- pfuye , ||| i continued doing that and the war went on , the 1994 war .
abo ba- size babatemaguye ba- ta- ri bu- basha -e ku- gira icyo bi- mara -ir . ||| i would pass through dead bodies , people who were terribly hacked and could n't do anything for themselves .
kubera ko n- n- jya -e ba- ri ba- n- rashe ariko mu mugongo , n- ka- pfa ku- genda gutyo ku- sa . ||| i had also been shot on the back but i would try and walk .
kuko n- ra- bi- ibuka , ba- rashe a- ri muma saa moya , ||| i remember the shootings took place at seven in the evening .
ba- maze ku- rasa , n- gerageza ku- sohoka muri urwo rupangu tu- ri tu- ri -mo . ku- ru- sohoka -mo ariko bi- n- bera ingorane ndende cyane , kubera ko ha- ri abandi bantu ba- ri ba- maze ku- zitira aho i- n- y- uma , ||| later after the shooting , i tried to get out of the fence where we were but it was a problem to me as they had destroyed all the behind passages .
ba- tegereje ko ha- ri u- ri bu- simbuka -e . ||| they blocked the way out so that they could see anyone who would try to jump over the fence .
ariko noneho hagati a- honga -ho ba- tegereza ko ha- ri u- ri bu- koma -e , ubwo ba- ri ba- maze ku- ica mo indani ba- ba- bwira bati @: "@ nta ki- n- ri ki- sigaye mu- shobora ku- injira noneho mu- ka- tangira ku- sahura . @" ||| they waited and realized that there was no alive , then they told each other , "@ you can now enter and start looting . @"
n- za ku- ha- rokoka -ir gutyo ba- n- jyana mu bitaro , ||| that is how i survived and i was taken to the hospital .
ba- ra- n- vura , kubera ko n- ri nararashwe , ||| i was treated because i had been injured .
ariko ba- vura ibikovu ku- sa , nti- ba- basha ku- kura -mo isasu ryari ri- ri -mo . ||| but they only treated the wounds ; they did not remove the fragments that were inside the wound .
ubwo intambara i- ra- rangira mu kwa karindwi , ubwo nyine ibintu by' amashuri bi- ri bi- ta- ra- jya ku murongo . nibwo ubwo , ||| in july , the war ended but things such as schools had n't started operating .
f.a.r.g. [ ikigega gishinzwe ku- tera inkunga a- ba- citse ku icumu ry' itsembabwoko ] nyine ba- tangiye ku- tu- bwira ngo tu- itaba -ir -e ibintu byo ku- jya ku- iga n' iki , ||| then f.a.r.g [ funds for the assistance of the genocide survivors ] encouraged us to go back to school .
tu- jya mubyo ku- iyandikisha , ba- tu- ohereza ku- iga , kuko ba- genda -aga ba disitiribiwa [ bakwirakwiza ] abanyeshuri muri za minisiteri . ||| we started the registrations and the ministry split us up in different schools .
ubwo n- basha ku- iga , ariko kubera ko n- ri n- fite ikibazo nyine cy' akaboko kubera urutugu ahantu ba- rashe , kubera ko n- ri ntara ... , mu mu- ta -w -e n- ri ntara , ||| so i managed to study but because i had a problem with my arm , which was due to the wound where i was shot at the shoulder , i was not very okay mentally .
n- ta- ra- tungana neza . ubuzima bu- komeza gutyo , bu- komeza gutyo , ||| life went on like that .
ha- ka- ba ha- ri n' abandi bana nabo ba- ba ba- ragiye ba- rokoka , bamwe na bamwe tu- ka- sanga nabo ba- ri aho , ||| they were other children who survived .
tu- ka- gerageza ku- ganira ibyagiye bi- tu- ba -ho n' ibyo bagenzi bacu ba- giye ba- hura nabyo mu nti- ambara , ||| we used to meet there and talk about what happened to us and to our people during the genocide .
ariko u- ka- sanga yuko ibyo biha -e bi- ri ibihe bibi cyane . ||| but days were very bad during that period .
nta n' umuntu u- basha -aga kuba ... u- ra- bona ku- gira ngo wice umuntu u- ta- ku- rwanya burya , ||| no one was able to ... imagine one killing a person who is not fighting back .
byo buriya ni ikintu cy' ikibazo cyane . u- ra- umva nta kuntu u- ku- icwa n' umuntu u- ta- ku- rwanya burya , ||| it is a big problem ; killing someone who can never fight back , it is like killing a lamb .
u- ra- umva ni nk' aho a- ri intama burya , u- shatse u- mu- shinyagura -ir icyo wu- n- va u- shaka . ||| the killer was capable of torturing the victim as much as he wished .
ni uko nyine tu- gira ima -an tu- bona intambara i- ra- ha- gaze , ||| fortunately , the war ended .
ubuzima bu- ra- tangira uko bi- sanzwe , ||| life went on as it used to be .
yego u- ka- sanga ha- ri ibintu bimwe na bimwe bi- gora -an mu buzima ariko ku- va umuntu burya a- fite amahoro , ibindi burya umuntu a- genda a- bi- shaka buhoro buhoro . ||| well , life was still very hard but peace was certain . the rest comes slowly by slowly .
eh , ubwo nyuma y' aho nyine ku- geza ubwo iki ki- ha -e tu- geze -mo , ||| from then up to now life is going on fairly .
n- ra- bona ubuzima bu- ri -mo bu- genda nta kibazo , ok , ha- ri ibintu by' ibibazo umuntu a- genda ahura nabyo mu n- zira , ibibazo by' ubuzima , ||| well , people get problems like health problems and others but one keeps trying to look for a living .
ibintu nk' ibyo , ariko umuntu a- ka- genda a- gerageza , a- gerageza uko bi- shobotse ku- shakisha ubuzima . ||| we believe that it is god , who knows .
umuntu a- ka- vuga ati buriya ima -an ni -yo i- bi- zi kuko uko ibyagiye bi- genda byose muri jenoside no kuba abantu ba- ra- bashije ku- rokoka , n- umva ko hagati cyane ha- shobora kuba ha- ri -mo n' uruhare rw' ima -an cyane kuko , ||| when we consider what happened during the genocide and the way some people survived , we believe that god played his role .
abantu ubwabo bwo n- umva -aga ba- ta- ri kuba ba- fite ingufu zi- hagije cyane ku- sa ha- ta- ri -mo ingufu z' uwiteka . ||| because human beings would never manage it without god 's power .
u- tu- bwiye ubuzima bwawe kuburyo bu- rambuye . ndagirango , n- umva -aga n- ku- baza utubazo tumwe na tumwe ; ubundi u- tu- bwira amazina y' ababyeyi bawe ? ||| now that you have told us about your life in details , i would like to ask you some questions ; could you please tell us your parents ' names ?
eh , ubundi papa bamwitaga macumi francois , mama y- itwa -aga umulisa odeta . ||| eh , my dad was called macumi francois and my mum was called umulisa odetta .
mu- ka- ba mwaravutse muri abana bangahe ? ||| and how many were you in your family ?
tu- ri abanaa ... babiri murugo , batatu . ||| we were two ... three kids at home .
tu- ri batatu ba- ri abahungu . tu- esa -e tu- ri abahungu . ||| we were all boys .
ubwo rero nyine nibo ba- pfuye bose aba a- ri njyewe u- rokoka -mo . ||| they all died and i am the only one who survived .
ni wowe u- rokotse -mo ? ||| among all your brothers you are the only one who survived ?
ubu n- fite makumyabiri n' itanu . ||| i am twenty @-@ five years old .
tu- ki- ri mu buzima bwa mbere ya jenoside , u- ra- bi- zi neza ko abantu ba- kunda -aga ku- genda ba- higa , bagatorezwa , ba- ka- funga ibyitso ba- ka- gira ku- ta -e na ku- ta -e ; ||| before the genocide , you very well know that people would be hunted , tortured , others would be arrested saying that they were traitors or something of that kind ; did it ever happen in your home that you or your parents were tortured ?
ese iwanyu icyo kintu ki- geze ki- ha- gera wenda kuburyo wowe cyangwa se ababyeyi bawe ba- ta- ota -ije -w ngo u- ba -e u- tu- nyura -ir -mo muri make ukuntu ba- ta- ota -ije -w ? ||| if it so , please tell us in brief how it happened ?
yee , ki- ra- ha- geze , ki- ra- ha- geze cyane mu miryango , ||| yes it used to happen especially within families .
ha- ri bamwe na bamwe ba- giye ba- zira ibyo bintu , ||| some people were victimized in that way .
wenda nko mu miryango yacu ya- giye yimurwa . ha- ri aho ba- baga ba- tuye nko ku musozi , ariko kubera ko ba- vuga -aga bati @: "@ ha- ri -mo ibintu by' ibyitso by' inyenzi hariya . @" ||| our families would shift ; they would be living on a certain hill and because on that hill , it would be said that they were inyenzi traitors , then our families would be forced to shift .
bi- ka- ba n- gomba -w ko nabo ba- genda ba- imuka , kuburyo no murugo twaratotejwe icyo ki- ha -e tubura securite . ||| i remember how my family was tortured and we had no security .
kuko umusaza wanjye ya- ri umuntu u- kunda ku- kora hanze , mu bintu byo hanze by' amasafari , ariko tu- ka- toteza -w u- ka- sanga nijoro interahamwe za- teye mu rugo , ba- kubise inzugi , ||| my father used to work in exile ; he used to go on long trips and then interahamwe would attack us at night ; they would bang on our door ... but we would be patient because the same people we were supposed to report to were the ones to initiate everything .
ba- gize ku- ta -e . ariko nyine umuntu a- ka- pfa ku- ihangana , kuko abo u- rega -ir -aga ki- rya ki- ha -e ni nabo ba- na- bi- kora -aga . u- ra- umva rero ko hagati a- honga -ho n- ta- bu- n- ri buryo umuntu ya- gomba -aga kuba yakwidefanda [ ku- i- rwana -ho ] uretse wenda ku- hamagara nk' abaturanyi u- ka- ba- bwira uti @: ||| i guess you understand that we had no way to defend ourselves apart from telling our neighbours about it .
"@ tu- gize ibyago ibi n' ibi , " nabwo abo wishyikiraho wu- n- va -ko ba- shobora kuba bagufitiye i- ka- izera -e mufitanye i- ka- izera -e . u- ka- ba- bwira uti @: "@ n- huye n' ibibazo ibi n' ibi , ||| still you would tell it to some of the ones that you trust saying , "@ i got such and such problem . @"
" ariko nabo kubera ko nta kintu ba- ku- fasha -aga wenda ba- ka- ku- bwira bati @: "@ gerageza u- gira -e gutya cyangwa se ihangana -e cyangwa se gira gutya , nta ku- n- ri kuntu tu- bi- genza . @" ||| but since they also did n't have means to help , they would just tell you to do some things ... or ask you to be strong , there was nothing else that we could do .
ariko ibyo bibazo byo tu- ra- bi- gize cyane ku- geza n' ubwo jenoside ya- giye kuba mu rugo ba- maze ku- ha- tera nk' incuro nk' eshatu . ariko nti- ba- basha -e ku- gira icyo ba- gera -ho . ||| we definitely used to get such problems . in fact we were attacked three times at home before genocide started . but they never did any harm to us .
u- tu- bwiye ko ha- ri abantu ba- giye bimura bo mu muryango wawe . ||| you told us some of your family members would be forced to shift .
ha- ri abo wibuka u- tu- bwira amazina , ||| do you remember their names so that you tell them to us ?
ba- ba- kura -aga he ba- ba- jyana he ? ||| where did they go or where were they taken ?
yee , ok , ha- ri -mo nka mu ... ok namwita nk' aho a- ri marume , ||| yeah ... okay , there was ... well i can call him my uncle ; he used to live there in gikondo and in kinazi before .
kuko cyo ki- ha -e we ba- ri ba- tuye hano i gikondo ariko ba- ka- ba ba- ra- ba- n- je ku- tura i ki- na- zi . ba- va i ki- na- zi , ba- maze ku- va i ki- na- zi ba- jya i cyangugu , ||| when they left kinazi , they went to cyangugu .
naho barabimura nibwo ba- garutse ku- tura hano i gikondo . ||| they made move to cyangugu and then they came back here in gikondo .
so , hagati aho rero igihe iby' ibyitso bi- ri bi- komeye , ha- ri uwo ba- fashe -mo wacu . ba- ra- na- mu- kubise ku buryo ya- na- pfuye ya- ra- baye umusazi , ||| during the time when people were suspected to be traitors , there is one of my relatives who was beaten up to the extent that he died after going crazy .
y- itwa -aga francois . ||| his name was francois .
ubu jenoside ejobundi ni -yo yabatsinze i gikondo , ahantu ba- ita -aga ngo ha- ri interahamwe i- komeye ba- ita -aga kongore [ congolais ] . ||| he died in the genocide in gikondo , an area where there used to be a terrible interahammwe called ‘ congolais ’ [ congolese ] .
ba- ka- ba rero nyine uwo mukecuru baramwitaga ko a- riwe nyinakazi w' inyenzi muri gikondo hariya . ubwo nyine jenoside ni -ho ya- je ku- ba- tsinda nyine , ||| his mother [ francois ' ] was called nyinakazi w'inyezi [ meaning ‘ mother of inyenzi ’ ] in gikondo . the genocide found them in gikondo .
abandi ba- ka- genda ba- ba- aka ibyangombwa , nti- ba- basha -e ku- sohoka , nti- ba- basha -e ku- kora akazi . ||| their identity cards were taken away from them so that they would n't move ; they could n't even go to work .
ba- vuga ko iyo ba- sohotse ba- giye hanze , ba- ba ba- jyanye amabanga y' inyenzi , ||| whenever they would go out of the house , the authorities would say that they [ my relatives ] were carrying information to inyenzi .
ba- garuka ba- ka- ba aribyo ba- baga ba- garuka -an -ye . ||| and whenever they would come back home , they would say that there were some things that they got from inyenzi .
ariko ba- gerageza kubisaka nti- ba- na- bi- bona -e n' ibintu nk' ibyo ... ariko u- ka- umva ko hagati aho ba- baga mu muryango ha- ri insecurite . ||| they would try to go through their pockets but they would n't find anything on them . one could easily tell that there was insecurity in the family .
birazwi ko muri icyo ki- ha -e ha- ri ha- ri -ho intambara y' amoko , y' abahutu n' abatutsi . ||| it was well known that there was a tribal war between the hutu and the tutsi .
u- tu- bwiye yuko papa wawe ya- kunda -aga ku- jya hanze , na maman wawe a- ka- sigara a- honga -ho , ||| and you told us that your father used to go in exile while your mum would stay at home .
ubwo papa wawe ya- zira -aga ko ya- kunda -aga ku- jya hanze ? cyangwa ya- zira -aga ko a- ri umututsi ... ? ||| do you mean your father was victimised due to going out of the country or because of being a tutsi ?
eh , ya- zira ko ... we ya- zira -aga , si nibyongibyo by' ubututsi we ya- zira -aga ko a- vuga -ish ukuri , ||| well , he was not harassed because he was a tutsi but because he used to say things the way they were .
ubundi a- kaza -ir ko ya- shatse mu mafamiye ba- ita -aga ko a- ri iy' inyenzi nyine ibintu nkibyo . ubundi a- kaza -ir ko nanone a- ri umuntu u- vuga -ish ukuri , ||| another reason as to why he was harassed was the fact that he married an inyenzi .
a- ri umuntu u- kunda ku- gira inshuti cyane z' ahantu henshi cyane zi- tandukanye . ha- ka- ba -mo n' ibintu by' amashyari nyine by' amako ; iby' amoko bi- ka- jya ku ruhande , uturere ibintu nk' ibyo . ||| he was a person who could easily make friends no matter what their background was . then there was enmity not between different tribes but also between people from different regions and other things of the sort .
kuko n' ahantu tu- ri tu- tuye ha- ri habi cyane , ||| the place where we lived was located in a very bad area .
ni ahantu mwumvaga ba- ita -aga ngo ni muri "@ camp butaro @"@ , ||| you have probably heard of a place called ‘ camp butaro ’ .
za mpunzi za- va -aga za ruhengeri za he bose baza -aga hariya mri ako ka- ca -e . ||| all the refugees who came from ruhengeri and other areas used to live in that area .
u- tu- bwira muri makeya ... kuko wambwi ... u- vuze ko ba- mu- ziza -aga ko ya- vuga -ish -aga ukuri , ariko ... uko ya- bi- i- twara -aga -mo hagati a- honga -ho , ||| could you please tell us in brief ... you said he was harassed due to his honesty but ... what was his behaviour ?
n' iyo mwaganiraga a- vuga ati @: "@ bariya bantu ba- n- ziza iki ? @" ||| the times you talked , what did he say he was accused of ?
u- tu- bwira muri make ukuntu ya- bi- i- twara -aga -mo ? ||| tell us in brief how he used to handle it .
ubundi ikintu we ba- mu- ziza -aga , ba- mu- ziza -aga ko ... i- cya mbere ba- mu- ziza -aga ko a- ri umuntu donc ... u- ta- kunda ibintu wenda tu- ku- ita ko nk' ahoari amashyari cyangwa se by' irondakoko cyangwa se irondakarere . ||| in fact what he was accused of , he was accused ... first of all he was someone who ... did not like the ideas of jealousy or of ethnic or regional segregation .
kandi bakanamuziza ko we ya- ri wa muntu u- ta- tinya ibyo ku- vuga ngo n- ra- ku- tinya kuko u- ri umuntu , cyangwa se n- ra- ku- tinya kubera yuko n- bona u- kora aya makosa wu- n- va -e ko n- ya- ku- shyigikiye -mo , ||| secondly , he was not afraid of saying the truth , he did not fear anyone and he could n't support anyone he would see doing something wrong .

sasa bi- ka- tuma rero ba- vuga bati @: "@ uyu muntu a- ra- tu- rwanya , kuki tu- shaka ku- kora ibi , twe tu- mu- bwira ibingibi a- ka- bi- anga . @" ||| so , they thought he was against them . they would say , "@ why is it that when we tell him our ideas he never agrees with us ? @"

bi- ka- ba rero nyine bi- ra- tuma -aga ba- gira ikintu cy' ako kabazo cyane . kuko ... ||| so there was always a question mark .
mbese icyo ba- mu- ziza -aga n' uko abandi bahutu ba- vuga bati @: "@ uyu muhutu mwene wacu kuki a- ta- kora kimwe n- ta -w -e ? @" ||| he was victimized because other hutus would say , "@ this is our fellow hutu but he does n't behave the way we do . @"
nawe a- ka- ba- bwira ati @: "@ ibingibi ntabwo ariko bi- meze . @" ||| he would tell them , "@ this is not the way things should be . @"
u- tu- bwira muri makeya mu- ki- mara ka- umva ko indege ya habyarimana ya- guye , cyangwa ba- maze ku- yi- rasa . mu rugo iwanyu ba- bi- akiriye ba- ta -e ? ||| could you briefly tell us how your family reacted after hearing that habyarimana 's plane crashed ?

ni uko nyine nta ku- n- ri bi- ri ku- genda ariko iyo a- basha nko ku- bona ubu- fasha wenda aba ya- ra- na- kize kuko we ya- n- pfa -ir -iye mu ntoki kabisa gutya . nta bu- n- ri bu- fasha n- ri n- fite , nta ki ... ya- ri a- fite inda y' impanga , ||| she died in the banana plantation but i too was helpless , i could n't do anything yet she was carrying twins ; she was pregnant .
u- bona kabisa ko a- ki- fite umwuka . ||| for her she still had some strength to breathe .
kuko nta ki- n- ri kintu n- ri ku- basha ku- kora n- n- jya -e , n- umva -aga n- n- jya -e n- ta- zi ukuntu n- baye . kuko we mamusize a- honga -ho bi- maze ku- rangira , ||| there was nothing i could do for her , myself i had lost conscience due to what had happened to me .
nibwo njyewe n- hise n- genda . ariko ubwo muri uko ku- byuka , nta n' umwe u- koma -aga , umukecuru we ba- ri ba- rangije kumurangiriza , ||| i left her after she had breathed her last breath . by the time i left , no one was alive ; my mum was already dead .
ba- maze ku- mu- rasa , ba- mu- rashe amasasu atatu . abiri ya- ciye hano i- ri- n- ri ri- ca hano , ||| they shot her three bullets ; two passed here , and the third one through here .
barumuna banjye bo ba- giye babakubitagura u- bu- ha- i- ri , amasasu aha [ y- erekanye mu mu- ta -w -e ] n' iki , ||| my brothers were smashed with clubs and shot on the head .
kuko ya- ri umuvu munini cyane w' amaraso menshi cyane . ||| there was a big stream of blood .
ariko u- ra- ha- vuye ntiwongeye ku- menya ngo ... ||| but when you left , you never got a chance to know that ...
nta ki- n- ri kintu n- ongeye ku- menya . ||| i never got another chance to know what happened next .
ku- sa icyo n- zi cyo n- ongeye ku- menya nyuma yaho ni uko ku- sa n- je intambara i- rangiye bi- bi- n- ri nyine , jenoside i- maze ku- rangira , ubwo aribwo igihugu ki- ki- tangira nyine kwisanasana n' iki . ||| i came back after the genocide like others ... the time the country was trying to be reorganized up .
nibwo n- je n- sanga intumbi ku- sa zi- ri aho mu rupangu hose zirajyaye , ||| and i found only corpses lying in the compound .
ahantu hose . n- basha ku- shaka a- ba- n- fasha , kuko ha- ri -ho abandi ba- citse ku icumu bagenzi banjye bo kuri uwo mu- renga -e , ||| i tried to get people to help me ; they are some friends at the same sector who survived the genocide .
ba- bashije wenda ku- n- fasha kuba umuntu ya- pfa kubarenzaho a- ka- taka ku- sa ku- gira ngo umuntu a- reba -e ... ||| they helped me to cover them with some soil so that one would think of what to do next ...
icyo ki- ha -e u- shobora -aga ku- menya ababyeyi bawe cyangwa ... ||| by that time , would you tell who your parents were or ... ?
icyo ki- ha -e ntabwo n- basha -aga ku- ba- menya bu- retse nk' ipantaro papa ya- ri y- ambaye n' igitenge umukecuru ya- ri y- ambaye . ok , wenda na burumuna bwanjye nabwo n- basha -aga ku- menya wenda nk' igice cy' umwenda ya- ri y- ambaye , ||| by that time , i could n't identify my parents ' corpses ... wait , maybe the pair of trousers my dad was wearing or the loincloth my mum was wearing .
ikabutura cyangwa se ishati , ||| i could recognize my brother from the piece the shorts or the shirt he was wearing .
ibintu nk' ibyongibyo . ||| things like that .
u- bashije ku- ba- shyingura mu cyubahiro ? ||| were you ever able to exhume and rebury them officially ?
mu cyubahiro ntabwo bi- bashije , ||| i was n't able to do that .
kubera ko ki- rya ki- ha -e u- ra- bona ubuzima bu- ri , abantu ni -yo ba- ri ba- ki- va mu bibazo n' igihugu a- ri -yo ki- ki- tangira kwisuganya ku- gira ngo ba- reba -e ko ba- tangira kudemara . ||| you see those day life was ... people had just come out of those problems and the country was just trying to be rebuilt in an attempt to see if things could go back to normal .
u- rebye ntabwo tu- koze ibintu bi- n- ri bi- ha- ambaye nta ki- n- ri , ||| we did n't do anything special for their reburial ceremony .
tu- fashe ku- sa , tu- shaka imyenda myiza n' iki , ni uko tu- ra- ba- sasa -ir mo indani , turenzaho i- taka . ||| we just got some clothes and laid them inside [ the grave ] and covered them with some soil .
ku- sa icyo tu- koze tu- mennye -ho ikintu cy' igisima cyo hejuru ku- sa nta ki- n- ri kintu . ||| then we ceiled the grave with cement , nothing else .
ku- va u- vuye mu rugo . ||| from the time you left your home .
n- vuye mu rugo ubwo n- ra- komeje n- ra- genda , ariko ubwo muri uko ku- komeza , ||| when i left home i continued to walk .
niko n- ki- fite n' abampiga i- n- y- uma , kuko ba- gerageje ku- shakisha ahantu hose , ba- va ndetse n' aho ba- ita -aga ku kicukiro ba- jya i gikondo . ahandi hantu tu- ri tu- fite amazu , ||| but even as i was going , there were some people who were behind me . they tried to hunt me all over to the extent of leaving kicuciro for gikondo looking for me ; we had houses there .
baza ku- reba ko wenda abantu b' aho aribo ba- ba bampishe . ||| therefore , they came to see if those attendants were hiding me .
ahubwo ba- sanga na hariya nti- n- igeze mpagera . ||| they found out that i never went there .
ubwo hagati a- honga -ho aho souffrance [ imibabaro ] zi- rangiye , nibwo maze ku- hura n' inkotanyi n- bashije nabo ku- ba- sobanura -ir ibibazo n- huye nabyo , n- ba- bwira n' aho narokokeye . ||| after the struggle , that is after meeting the inkotanyi i told them [ inkotanyi ] all i went through and where i had been .
ba- gerageza ku- n- fasha uko bi- shoboka , ||| they helped me as much as they could .
ba- ra- n- bwira bati @: "@ ese bite ? @" ||| they asked me , "@ how are you ? @"
n- ra- ba- bwira nti @: ku- sa ikibazo n- fite ni i- n- vuna -e , ||| i told them that my problem was the injury i had .
kandi mu- ra- bona ha- ri ha- ra- boze kabisa , kuko nta muti n- bona -aga nta n' ikintu n- bona -aga ki- n- vura . ||| they could see it had rotten because i never used to get treatment .
ba- basha kunyondora , n' iki . ba- ra- n- bwira bati @: "@ genda u- subira -e mu buzima bwawe bu- sanzwe . @" ||| they treated me and later asked me to go home and start looking for a living .
ariko ubu hagati aha ibyo aribyo byose n- ra- bona ubuzima bwanjye , ok , si bwiza cyane , ariko nta n' ubwo a- ri bubi , ||| my current life ... well i can not say that it is very good but still i can not say that it is too bad .
kuko burya iyo u- basha ku- ryama mu mahoro , u- ka- ramuka , ubuzima bu- ra- komeza . ||| when there is peace in the country and one is able to sleep peacefully , then life goes on .
u- ki- mara ku- bona -an n' inkotanyi zi- ka- ku- bwira ngo u- jya -e mu buzima bwawe bu- sanzwe , u- koze iki hagati a- honga -ho , u- giye he ? ||| after you met the inkotanyi ... and they asked you to go and start looking for ways to live , what did you do or where did you go ?
u- banye na nde ? i- ki- ku- tunga u- ki- bona -aga u- ta -e ? ||| whom did you live with and how would you get your daily bread ?
hagati a- honga -ho ... ubwo ... ukuntu bi- genze ubwo nyuma , ba- maze ku- n- reka ubwo nibwo n- hise n- jya ku kicukiro , ha- ka- ba ha- ri umuntu wo muri famille u- ri u- ra- ha- rokotse . ariko nawe , ||| what happened later after they left me , i went to kicuciro .
n- ka- ba n- ibuka ko , eh , i- n- tuza ... intambara igeze , nyuma wenda y' icyumweru kimwe . ||| there is someone from my family who had survived but i never knew ... when the war began , i guess it was one week later , we were told that they killed them .
ba- ka- ba ba- ri ba- maze ku- tu- menya -ish ko bo deja ba- tu- tanze ku- pfa . n- umva -aga rero ibyo a- ri byo byose nabo ba- ta- ki- ri -ho , ||| therefore , i thought they had all died .
ubwo n- ra- genda n- jya i remera hafi na iamca [ aho k.i.e iri ubu ] . ||| i went to remera near iamca , where kie [ kigali institute of education ] presently is .
nibwo n- je ku- bona umugabo umwe u- ri u- vuye i buganda , ok nawe ya- ri a- zira -an -ye no mu rugo . ||| then i met a certain man who had come from uganda ; he knew my family .
a- za ku- n- jyana ku- iga i bugande niga -yo igihe gitoya n- ra- garuka , ||| he took me to school in uganda . i studied there for a while and came back to rwanda .
ino ahangaha n- ra- iyandikisha n- ta- komeza n- ra- iga buhoro buhoro buhoro . ariko uko n- rebye n- bona -aga ubuzima ibyo aribyo byose uko n- giye n- bu- ba -mo ... ubwo n' ukonguko bi- giye bi- genda , ||| i registered here and started studying from here slowly by slowly . that is how things used to be .
n- ka- hura n' abantu b' inshuti abari inshuti ab' inshuti nti- n- zi cya ... nabo wenda ba ... ba- angirira impuhwe kubera ibibazo n- fite n' a- ka- n- ri -mo . ubuzima bu- genda bu- genda gutyo ... ||| i would meet friends and they would help me because they knew what happened to me and life went on .
ku- geza ubwo n- je ku- menyera n- subira mu buzima bu- sanzwe . ||| i finally got used to it and started living a normal life .
nkanavuga nti ibyo a- ri byo byose n' ubwo na jenoside ya- baye ibyo a- ri byo byose ibyabaye , ||| i would say that , even though genocide took place , one has to look for a living and ignore all that happened .
ibyo aribyo byose ariko umuntu a- gomba ku- shaka ubuzima . n' ubwo umuntu a- ta- bi- ibagirwa ariko ubuzima bu- gomba ku- komeza . ||| one can never forget what happened but life has to go on .
u- shoboye ku ... ku- iga ? u- rangiza se ... ? ||| did you manage to finish school ?
n- gira -aga ikibazo cyo ku- rwara ku ... umutwe . ||| i used to have a problem of headaches .
n- ba nakurikiye n- ka- iga n- ka- iga ariko n- gera -ho n- ka- umva n- rwaye umutwe cyane , no kubera ikibazo cy' aka kaboko , ka- ka- rya cyane simbashe ku- gira ... n- tuza ... ||| i would be attentive in class but all of a sudden i would get terrible headaches . another problem was due to my arm ; it would hurt me so much and i would n't ...
wigeze ku- tu- bwira y' uko watesetse cyane . ||| you said you suffered a lot .
ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo u- tu- sobanura -iye neza uko guteseka ... ||| but you never explained very well to us how you suffered .
eh , guteseka kwanjye ukuntu bi- genze ... ||| eh ... the way i suffered ...
ukuntu bi- genze mu buzima ru- sanga -e u- sibye ibyo byose , ||| what happened in your life in general ?
mu buzima ru- sanga -e watesetse ku- ta -e ku- va ababyeyi bawe u- ki- mara ku- ba- bura ku- geza ubu , ||| not just that but also in your whole life from the time you lost your parents up to now .
wu- n- va a- ri iki cyagutushije ku- geza ubu ? ||| what has been the most challenging thing ?
ok , kuba n- bura ababyeyi ? ok ! ||| loosing both my parents ?
i- cya mbere , n- giye mu buzima n- ta- ri menyereye , ||| well ... first of all i started another kind of life , which i was n't used to .
surtout [ cyane cyane ] kubera ko burya iyo u- ri kumwe n' ababyeyi kandi u- ki- ri na mutoya , burya ha- ri ibintu ... ha- ri imyaka burya u- gera -mo , wenda ba- maze ku- ku- kuza nawe u- ka- menya aho niveau y' ukuntu u- shobora kuba u- ba u- shaka ubuzima bwawe . ||| because when you live with your parents especially when you are still young , there are some things ... there is a certain age you reach ... that is when they have brought you up and then you reach at a certain level where you can look for your own living .
ariko ubwo n- ri- n- giye mu buzima n- ta- menyereye . ||| i entered another life that i was not used to .
kuba nta muntu n- fite u- shobora kuba u- n- fasha wenda mu bitekerezo runaka , wenda n- vuga -e nti n- keneye iki mbe n- hita n- ki- bona . ||| living without anyone to help me in my plans ; let 's say , getting something i needed .
ibyo nabyo bi- ri ibintu bi- giye bi- n- gora . ||| those are the things that would disturb me .
no kuba byonyine ku- sa ... n' ibyo n- bonye byonyine , ||| the fact that ... those are things i noticed .
n' ukuntu n- bonye ukuntu abantu ba- pfa , n' ukuntu n- giye n- bona n- simbuka intumbi , abo n- giye n- gera -ho n- zi -ko aribo ba- shobora ku- n- rokora ahubwo n- ka- bona nabo ba- ra- shaka ku- n- yi- ca . ||| the way i saw people dying and the way i was skipping corpses , people i would run to hoping that they would save me who instead also wanted to kill me .
ku- geza ubwo n- je ku- hura n' inkotanyi . ||| until when i met the inkotanyi .
kuko n- ra- bi- ibuka ha- ri umugabo wa hano tu- hura -iye niba a- ri ... hano munsi ya sainte famille , ||| i remember there was a man who lived here and we met at sainte famille .
a- n- bwira ko a- giye ku- n- rokora . ||| he assured me that he was going to save me .
ariko tu- geze ahantu n- bona ahubwo ahantu a- n- jyanye , ni ku cyobo . ndamutoroka n- ri- ruka . nkwepera mu bantu ba- ri ba- ri a- honga -ho nti- ya- menya ahanyu n- rengeye . ||| but we reached somewhere and i noticed that where he was leading me , it was towards a certain pit . i escaped him and run away ; i escaped though crowds of people who were there and he never knew where i went .
so , n- giye n- bona rero ibintu bi- giye bi- tandukanye cyane mu buzima , ||| i saw different things in life .
n- ka- genda n- bona ukuntu abantu ba- fite ibibazo , ||| i saw people suffer .
n- ka- reba ukuntu nyuma y' aho jenoside bi- rangira -iye ukuntu imfubyi za- giye zi- hura n' ibibazo , cyangwa se n- n- jya -e ibyo n- giye n- bona n' iki . ||| i saw how after the genocide orphans got problems , i included .
n' ubuzima n- giye menyera n- ta- ri menyereye . ||| i got used to a different life style .
uko ima -an ya- giye i- n- fasha ubu maze ku- bi- menyera . ||| god helped me now i am used to the new life style .
burya yego ba- ra- vuga ngo @: "@ akabi nti- ka- menyera -w nk' a- ka- eza , " ariko bi- gera aho u- ka- bi- menyera bitewe na cas [ n' ubuzima ] u- ri -mo . umh ||| there is a saying that , "@ akabi ntikamenyerwa nk'akeza . @" it means it is more difficult to get used to bad things than to good things . but later you get used due to the situation . yeah ...
ubwo nyine ubuzima bu- ka- genda gutyo . uwo n- bashije ku- bwira igitekerezo cyanjye , ya- bona a- ri n- gomba -w ko a- n- fasha a- ka- n- fasha . ||| life went on like that ... i would tell some people my problems and some would help me when they could .
kuza ku- geza ubwo n- umva maze kabisa ku- menyera , no kuba maze ku- i- gira hejuru , n- umva a- ri ibintu bi- shima -ish -ije cyane . ||| until i got totally used to it and i grew older , which made me so happy .
wu- n- va kuri wowe a- ri iki wibuka ki- ka- ku- babaza ku- rusha ibindi , muri wowe ; ||| in your lifetime , what is the most painful memory ?
kandi ki- ka- ku- ta -ish kuba u- ku- ishima . ||| something that takes away your joy .
ni nk' iki wu- n- va wibuka ki- ka- ku- babaza cyane ? ||| what hurts you most whenever you remember it ?
kuba n- ta- ri kumwe n' abavandimwe kuba ... ok , nta famille , ibyo nabyo bi- ri mu bintu bya mbere , ko kuba -ho n- tawe n- fite n- bwira ibibazo byanjye nimba we yabikemura . ||| living without my relatives ... no family , which is the most important thing ... living without anybody to tell my problems .
surtout u- ka- sanga icyo kintu [ arimyoza ] n- ka- icara wenda n- ka- vuga nti iki kintu n- ka- gombye ku- ki- bona muri ubu buryo . ariko se ko n- bona n- tawe n- fite u- ki- n- fasha -mo , bi- genda ku- ta -e ? ||| sometimes i say , "@ i could get this or that in such a way , but since there is nobody to help me , what can i do ? @"
[ arimyoza ] bi- ka- tuma mpita n- ibuka nti @: ubu iki ki- ha -e iki n' iki , i- ya- ba umubyeyi aba andi hafi , cyangwa undi muvandimwe ya- ka ki- n- fashije -mo . ||| then i remember that , i could have been with my parents or relatives and they could have helped me in such a time .
ku- sa nti- bi- ca -e intege , kandi na none n- ka- babaza -w ubuzima imfubyi ba- ri -mo ku viva [ kuba -ho ] bu- ta- ka- gombye kuba n- gomba -w . ||| however , it does n't discourage me . secondly i am hurt by the kind of life orphans lead yet they were n't meant to live that way .
na none u- ka- sanga wenda muri ... surtout muri nk' imfubyi eshatu enye , ariko mu- esa -e u- ka- sanga ntacyo mumariranye , ||| especially when they are three or four orphans who can not help one another .
nabyo u- ka- sanga a- ri agahinda na none . ||| it is a pity .
ibyo aribyo byose , eh bi- garagara ko ni -yo u- ba u- ri imfubyi u- gomba ... ubuzima bu- gomba ku- komeza . ||| well ... even if you are an orphan , life has to go on whatever the case may be ...
yee , kabisa ibyo byo n- bona ko bu- gomba ku- komeza ... n' ubu bu- ra- na- komeza rwose . ||| yes , that is true life has to go on . and it is still going on .
eh ! n- ragira ngo nkawe u- bi- nyuze -mo u- fite experience [ inararibonye ] y' ubuzima bu- goye nk' ubwo , ni iyihe nama u- gira abantu ba- fite ubuzima nk' ubwawe ? ||| what advise can you give someone like you who passed through such hardships and who experienced a hard life ? those who lead a life like yours ?
ku- sa inama n- ba- gira , ikintu cya mbere n- ba- ha moral . ||| the advice i can give them ... first of all i would encourage them to have morale .
ba- ka- menya ko mu buzima biriya ni ibintu , ok bi- baye -ho kubera y' uko abantu ki- rya ki- ha -e ba- ri babaye inyamaswa kubera na politique mbi . ||| they should know that in life such things ... well , such things happened because people had become wild due to bad governance .
ikindi kintu n- ba- gira -ho inama , ni uko u- wu- n- va a- fite ubu a- fite occasion yo kuba igihe cye ya- ki- koresha neza , a- ka- ba ya- ki- koresha . ||| another advice i can give them is to use their time efficiently .
niba a- bashije ku- iga a- ka- iga , ||| if one has a chance to go to school , he or she should study .
niba a- bashije se ku- bona ako kazi a- ka- ka- bona , ||| if one gets a job then he or she should work .
niba se ha- ri n' uwo iwabo wenda ba- ba ba- ra- rangiye ariko a- fite n' ako ga parcelle wenda ba- senya -e ; n- ka- ba mu- bwira ko igihe cyose ya- ba a- fite possibilite i- shoboka nawe a- shobora kuba wenda ya- subiza -mo ... wenda nawe iye . a- ka- subiza -mo umuryango , ||| or if there is someone who has a farm with destroyed houses , he or she should try to build there his or her own house and put there his or her own family when they get an opportunity to do so .
mu ki- ha -e cyose a- za- ba a- fite ... possibilite zi- shoboka ku- zi- koresha . igihe cye a- ka- ba ya- ki- koresha neza . ||| any one who has a chance should use it well .
n- jya -e n- ra- umva a- ri cyo kintu n- ba- gira -ho inama . ||| that is the advice i can give them .
noneho u- mara ku- emera ko u- ki- koze , ubwo ibyo aribyo byose niba a- ri n' ibihano uzabigabanyirizwa cyangwa se ukuri ku- za- ba- ku- garagaye . ||| if you admit that you committed a crime then your punishment would be reduced or ... whatever the case , the truth would be revealed .
wenda nibyo ba- vuga ngo @: "@ umuntu ya- na- ku- babarira , " wenda n- ra- umva no ku- babarirwa wenda sinaku ... ha- ri a- ba- tanga imbabazi ha- ri n' abatazitanga . ||| maybe to those who talk about forgiveness ... well some people forgive while others do n't .
ariko , ba- banza -e ba- emera -e bati @: "@ tu- koze icyaha , twara -ish -e koko tu- mennye amaraso . @" ||| but they should first admit that they murdered people and shed blood .
ubwo nibamara ku- emera ko ibyo bintu kabisa ko icyaha ba- ki- koze ibindi bi- za- oroha . ||| after they admit their crimes , the rest will be easier .
ariko mu ki- ha -e ba- ta- emera ko icyo cyaha ba- ki- koze , kandi ha- ri n' ababi ... n' ibimenyetso wenda bi- ba- garagaza ko ba- bi- koze koko . n- umva i- bi- i- za ko a- ri uko ba- bi- emera ko ba- bi- koze . yee . ||| but since they do n't admit what they did yet there are witnesses and several signs that condemn them ... i think they should just acknoweldge what they did .
abantu ba- ba bara ... ri- rokotse iri tsembabwoko bo u- ba- ha ubuhe bu- tuma -w ? ||| what message can you give to the survivors of this genocide ?
ku- sa bo nabo ubutumwa n- ba- ha ... ok ba- ri -mo ingeri myinshi , kuko ha- ri nk' u- ba ya- ra- rokotse [ arimyoza ] ariko kubera kuko nabo imyumvire yabo si imwe . kandi noneho kubera ... n' ikindi ki- na- bi- tera ni u- ku- bera ubuzima ba- ba ba- ri -mo . ||| the message i would give them ... well , they have different categories , because some survivors ... their way of understanding things are different due to the kind of life they are leading .
ha- ri nk' u- hagarara ku mu- renga -e w' iwabo a- ka- reba a- ka- sanga nta kintu na kimwe ki- ki- ha- ri , umh ! ||| there are some who found none of their family 's possessions left at their home sector , umh !
a- ka- bona abo bantu bamwiciye wenda amafamiye [ imryango ] yabo a- ri -mo arakidegembya aho . ||| but the families of those who killed his or her people are still there living peacefully .
ku- sa n- mu- ha inama yo ku- gira ngo asa -e nk' umuntu u- bi- irengagiza gato , a- banza -e a- komeza -e ubuzima . a- shaka -e ubuzima n- mara ku- bona ubuzima a- za- bona ko n' ibindi [ arimyoza ] byoroshye . ||| the only advice i could give such a person is to kind of overlook what happened and go on with life .
yee , ||| he or she should look for a living .
ku- sa nti- bi- teze ku- mu- shira -mo , ibyo nti- bi- shoboka . ||| he or she will later find out that everything is possible . however , such a person will never forget what happened , that is impossible .
ariko bi- i- bura a- za- reba -e uburyo abyikarumamo [ yakwiyumanganya ] nawe a- reba -e ubundi buryo ya- bi- genza . ku- sa a- shaka -e ubuzima kuko niko bi- genda . ||| but he or she should just find a way to ignore it and look for a living because that is how life is .
kuko n' a- ba- tu- ica -aga ba- umva -aga ko tu- ta- shobora ku- rokoka , ||| because even those who were killing us never knew that we would survive .
ba- umva -aga ko no kuba tu- ra- rokotse ni ... bo ba- umva a- ri inzozi kuri bo . n- tu- shobora ka- umva ukuntu u- shobora kuza u- ki- ca tu- vuga -e umuryango w' abantu ijana , ha- rokoka -mo umuntu umwe . ||| to them , the fact that we survived is unbelievable ; imagine killing about a hundred people from the same family and one survives .
bo ba- umva -aga ko bi- ta- shoboka ariko ima -an yo ya- ba- eretse ko bu- ri kintu cyose ki- shoboka . ||| they never knew it was possible but god proved to them that everything is possible .
umh . ||| umh ...
iki ki- korwa cyo ku- ibuka abantu ba- jya ba- kora , wowe u- ki- vuga -ho iki ? ||| what do you think about the action of commemoration that people normally take ?
icyo ki- korwa n- jya -e n- ra- ki- shima cyane ni na kiza , ||| i appreciate that ceremony and i find it very good .
kuko nta kuntu u- shobora ku- bona milliyoni hafi zingahe za- pfuye . ngo tu tu- renze -ho tu- sa -e nk' aho ... tu- vuga -e ngo bi- ri- ba- gira -an -ye ? ||| there is no way one can see more than a million people die and act as though it has been forgotten .

ba- umva -e ko ba- gomba ku ka- unga ubumwe ba- ka- fatanya ba- ka- ubaka igihugu cyabo . ||| rwandans should unite and put hands together in the development of their country .

ubundi njyewe ukuntu n- bona ibintu bya jenoside ... bya gacaca . kuko wa mu- ka- ni ikintu ku- sa n- jya -e n- shima -iye -ho leta ya- koze ku- sa yacu , n- yi- shimira -ho ku kintu kimwe cyo kuba ba- ra- fashe bamwe ... abari ... donc a- ba- koze propagande ba- ba- jyana a- rusha . ||| the way i consider the issue of gacaca ... well , something i always thank this government for is the way they took all the people who did the propaganda to arusha .

a- za- za ha- ha- n- ri kavukire ke , aho ya- ri a- tuye n' ubundi . kugirango ba- basha -e ku- bona ko ibyo bi- ha koko bimukurikirana cyangwa bi- mu- hama . ||| therefore , it is better to keep people in the prisons located in their areas of origin so that they get convicted .
ibyo rero so n- umva a- ri byiza cyane , ||| i believe it was a very good idea .

n- ka- umva ko ibyo aribyo byose ibya gacaca a- ri ibintu byiza cyane . ||| i believe gacaca is very good idea .

n- ta -w -e n- ta -ho tu- sigaye . ||| we were left no where .
tu- gira gutya tu- manuka i- n- y- uma ahantu nyine mu gacaca aho ngaho ni muri secteur gacaca , ||| so we went through some place called gacaca ... in gacaca .
ahantu ha- ri akantu k' akayira k' ikinyarwanda tu- gwa mu muhanda . tu- geze mu muhanda , ||| there was a short cut to the main road .
eh ... tu- bona igitero ki- turutse ku n- tuza ... ba- ri -mo kuza ba- vuga bati @: @"@ n' abari ba- sigaye bose tu- maze ku- subira -mo . @" ||| then we saw a group of attackers who were coming from ... they coming saying that , "@ even those who had remained we have completed them . @"
umwe a- ka- vuga ati @: "@ njyewe n- ishe abo kwa kanaka . ati @: n- giye ahantu ha- ri ha- ri umuryango wo kwa kanaka , ||| one would say , "@ i have killed the family of so and so .

undi nawe tu- umva a- vuze gutyo , noneho umugabo umwe a- ra- vuga ati @: ||| then another one said the same story .
"@ muri famille [ mu muryango ] yo kwa ka- ha- i- zi , ati @: njyewe ... n' uko n- bonye nta bantu benshi n- ri n- zi mo . ka- ha- i- zi n- tawe n- bonye -mo , ||| and then another man said , "@ in gahizi 's family though i never saw many of the members ; i did n't see gahizi .

n- icara neza mu n- zira n- ra- ryama . ||| therefore , i came down the hill and laid in the way .
we a- hita a- n- bwira ati @: @"@ bayi njyewe nti- n- shobora ku- pfa n- icaye ahangaha . @" ||| then she said , "@ bye ... i can not dye just seated here . @"

ubwo n- ra- icara n- ra- ryama n- ra- sinzira -iye n- i- cura a- ri nka saa kumi n' ebyiri ha- tabona . umh ! ||| therefore , i laid down and i was taken by sleep . by the time i woke @-@ up it was about 6:00 p.m. in the dark .

ba- ra- za uwo mu ta- n- ta -e n' undi mugabo wa ta- n- ta -e nyine umwe ba- ra- za , ||| they came ; it was my aunt and the husband to my other aunt .
baza aho mu gacaca ba- ri ba- ha- zi . ||| they came to gacaca they knew the place .
ba- ha- geze bati @: "@ umwana ya- giye ku- iga . @" ||| when they reached at home they told them that i had gone to school .
noneho baza baje ku- n- reba ku ishuri . n- n- jya -e kwa ku- n- ri ku- i- taha -ir muri recreation , ||| therefore , they decided to come to school yet i was on my way coming back home , because i was used to going home at break time .
u- sibye ... ha- ri ukuntu u- bona ikintu u- ka- bona u- baye nk' igiti ... ubwo n- taha n- igendera mu muhanda ... n- baga n- i- bereye hanze n' ubwo n- genda -aga ariko nti- n- baga n- tekereza ibiri aho . ||| there is a way you see something and become stiff ; i was walking home but even though i was walking , i was careless of what was around me .
n- i- tekerereza -aga iby' ubuzima bwanjye bu- shize n' iby' ubuzima n- giye -mo , ||| i would be thinking about my own life how it was destroyed and how i was going to lead it .
n- ka- umva n' ibintu bi- meze gutya ... bi- ta- teze ku- za- hura . ||| it seemed like things were crooked ... and will never come together ; part of my life would be far from the other part .
kimwe ki- jya hariya , ikindi ki- jya hariya . nuko n- giye ku- bona n- bona tu- ra- ku- bi- tanye . n- vuye ku ishuri saa yine , ||| therefore , we met as i was coming from school ; it was at break hours ( 10:00 a.m. ) .
n- taha -aga saa yine igihe cyose kuko isaha zi- ra- gera -aga n- bona bu- ri umwe wese yi- bereye mu bye , n' undi yi- bereye mu bye , ||| i used to go back home at 10:00 a.m. always . because i would see every body busy without a single person paying attention to me .
nta muntu n' umwe u- n- yi- taye -ho ... nta n' umwe tu- vugana . ba- si . ||| i would talk to no body .
n- ka- hita n- umva ko ubuzima bwanjye bu- ha- gaze ... a- ri uko .. ||| so i would feel like life has stopped ... so i would finally go home .
n- tashye nibwo tu- kubita -an -iye neza mu n- si ya commune . ||| as i was going home , we met next to the commune .
baje ku- n- reba ku ishuri . ||| they were coming to see me at school .
u- ra- bi- umva bi- baye nk' ibindi bintu bi- ta- sanzwe . bi- baye nk' uko n- bona -an -ye na murumuna wanjye ha- ri ha- shize amezi atanu tu- tabona -an , ||| it was an extraordinary experience ; it was like similar to the time i saw my little sister after five months of not seeing each other .
umwe wese a- zi ko undi ya- pfuye . ||| each one thought that the other one died .
mera nk' igiti n- ra- vuga @: ||| therefore , i was shocked and stood like a tree .
"@ ese ta- n- ta -e ni wowe .... ni wowe n- bona cyangwa ntabwo a- ri wowe ? @" ati @: "@ ni jyewe . @" ... none se u- zi -ko doudou a- ri -ho ? ||| so i ask , "@ aunt , is it you ? are you the one i am seeing or it is somebody else ? @" she replied that was the one . "@ are you aware that doudou is alive ? @"
ati @: ||| i asked her once again .
"@ doudou a- ri -ho , n' aho aba n- ta- ha- zi . @" ||| she replied me that "@ doudou is alive and i know where she lives . @"
ubwo ntabwo n- hise ... ntabwo n- igeze n- komeza ngo tu- gera -e n' aho n- ri ndi , tu- hise tu- tambika -an , mu- jyana aho hakurya i ki- hara aho doudou a- ri [ murumuna wanjye ] . ||| therefore , we never reached at home where i lived , immediately i took her to gihara where doudou ( my sister ) was living .
ku itariki ya mbere z' u- kwa cumi , icyenda na kane [ 1 /10 /1994 ] . ||| it was on the 1st of october in 1994 .
mbese ku- va mu kwa kane ubuzima bu- saga n' aho bu- ha- gaze . ||| generally , right from april life seemed to be a terrible struggle ?
ku- va mu kwa kane ku- gera mu kwa cyenda , ubuzima bu- ri bu- ra- ha- gaze . ||| from april to september life was a terrible struggle .
tu- vuga -e se nko ku- va igihe mwabereye kwa munyagishali , intambara i- sa n' aho i- ta- ururutse bwo mwabanye ubuzima n- i- bura bu- baye bwiza ? ||| well , let 's talk about life from the time you joined munyagishari 's home ; that time when the war had seized , did your standards of living improve some how ?
u- ra- umva intambara i- sa n' aho i- gabanutse , u- sibye ko ... ubundi yenda n- vuga ko mu kwa karindwi ... u- kwa munani intambara ya- ri i- tangiye ka- oroha , mu kwa karindwi ku- n- za ya- ri i- tangiye ka- oroha . ||| when the war siezed ... in july , august the war was siezing ... in fact , in july the war was beginning to sieze .
ariko n- baga aho hantu mpaba na none nk' umuntu wihishe [ aho ngaho n- baga i gitesi ku mu- kobwa we ] . ||| i was living with that family as somebody who was hiding . i was living in gitesi at her daughter 's home .
noneho n- ka- haba ... kubera ukuntu ba- n- fata -aga , ba- n- fata kubera ko bampishe n- ka- umva ko nyine a- ri kwa ku- n- ri ko bakimpishe . ||| and due to the way they would treat me , i mean because they hid me i continued believing that they were still hiding me .
simenye yuko hanze ha- meze neza . ||| i never knew that outside the situation improved .
noneho n' aho mpaviriye n- giye kwa munyagishari nabwo n- ka- umva ko a- ri kwa ku- n- ri . ki- koze bi- tangiye ku- gabanuka ubwo n- ri n- tangiye ku- jya ku ishuri . ||| even the time i left their home for munyagishari 's , i still believe i was going to hide . however , that feeling started disappearing when i started going to school .
n- ra- taha -aga mu rugo nta kibazo , n- ka- rya ubundi n- ka- icara aho ngaho nta ki- n- ri kintu n- baga n- kora . ||| i could go at home with out any problem , i could eat , there is nothing i was obliged to do .
ejo n- ka- za- ongera n- ka- byuka n- ka- jya ku ishuri n- ki- taha -ir saa yine , bitewe n' uko n- bona -aga ndi jyenyine nta muntu wu- n- ri tu- vugana . ||| i wouuld wake up the following morning and again go to school . then i would come home at 10:00 a.m. depending on how i would be abandoned .
abana bo kwa munyagishali bo mwari muri ... u- bona -aga ba- ku- fashe ku- ta -e nyuma ya jenoside ? ||| how could you find your relationship with munyagishari 's children after the genocide ? how was it ?
ubwo nyine intambara i- maze ku- rangira u- rebye uwo mu- kobwa niwe u- komeje ... tu- komeje kuba -an , ||| after the genocide , we continued to live with that lady .
n' ubwo u- bona -aga ise arakajwe n' uko tu- rokotse kandi a- ka- ba nta kintu ki- ha- sigaye , inka zi- ra- mu- shize -ho kandi yenda u- bona ko nawe ya- ri a- bi- fite -mo inyungu , ||| definitely her father was not happy at all because , we survived but all properties were taken from him ; the cows were gone yet he was considering them as a profit .
ha- ri n' igihe rwose ya- jya -aga yi- vumbura a- ka- vuga ati @: "@ mu- n- sohoka -ir -e ahangaha . @" ||| some times he would loose his temper and chase us out of his house , "@ get out of here ! @" he would scream .
mbese nta jambo ... nta ku- vuga ngo yenda ... nta ku- vuga ngo yenda ngo mbe n- mu- bwira nk' ikintu runaka , y- umva -aga ko ndi uwa hariya wowe na bariya ... mbese u- bona ko a- fite umutima mubi . ||| one could not talk to him because he was ever moody ; he always had a bad temper .
bitewe n' uko ... uko n- bi- bona -aga u- bona -aga a- bi- tera -w n' uko ibintu byose bi- ri bi- shize ... inka za- shize , ||| and from my point of view , he acted that way because all properties were taken from him .
kandi nawe ya- ka- gombye kuba nawe ya- ri a- fite -mo inyungu , nk' ukuntu yenda ya- ri ya- tu- reze ... ya- ri ya- ra- tu- rinze muri icyo ki- ha -e cyose . ariko uwo mu- kobwa we tu- banye neza nta kibazo , ||| the cattle were taken , yet in principle , he was also supposed to profit from them ; if one considers all the time he took care of us , how he protected us throughout the war ... but the daughter , we had a good relationship ; she was the one who cared for me most .
niwe u- menya -aga . niwe u- menya -aga ngo n- keneye ikayi niba n- giye ku- iga ... ||| she could remember that i need books if it was time for school .
ubungubu se mu- jya mu- bona -an ... ha- ri ... ? ||| do you meet often ... is there ... ?
iwabo ho ntabwo n- ri n- subira -yo ||| i have never gone back to her home .
ku- va jenoside ya- rangira nti- u- ra- basha ku- subira -yo ? ||| since the genocide stopped you have never managed to go there ?
oya . ||| no !
n' ukutabishaka cyangwa n' ubushobozi bukeya ? ||| is it because you do n't want or it is failure to go there due to some other factors ?
si ukutabishaka ku- subira -yo , u- rebye ni ubushobozi bukeya . no kuba n- tekereza ngo n- ongeye ku- tekereza ku- subira ku kibuye ntabwo a- ri ibintu bi- jya bi- n- za -mo . keretse ha- baye nk' ikintu runaka , nk' impamvu n- giye ... i- n- jyanye yo ku buryo mpita n- garuka . ariko ntabwo n- ri n- subira -yo ku- jya ku- ba- sura . si uko n- banza -e ... si uko ba- ta- n- fashe neza se yenda nk' uko n- bi- ifuza -aga , ahubwo u- rebye ni ubushobozi buke . ||| it is not because i do n't want ; rather , it is by lack of means .
ni u- ku- vuga ko u- ta- ra- subira rero aho mwari mu- tuye ku- va jenoside ya- rangira . ||| does that mean you have never gone back home from the time genocide ended ?
ku- va jenoside ya- rangira tu- subiye -yo muri 1995 . ||| since genocide ended , we went back there in 1995 .
ubu se iwanyu ba- ra- ha- senya -e ... ha- sigaye a- ri amatongo ubwo se bya ... ||| has your property been destroyed ... ? are there only ruins left ? ... has it ...
yego neza uko ya- ri i- ri -ho n' irangi ni -yo ya- funga -ish -ije mu nzu y- ubatse kandi nayo y- ubaka -ish -ije ya matafari ya- giye yegura . ||| yeah ! the doors were still having the same color . you could also see that some of the bricks were from our house .
nonese cya ki- ha -e muri ge ... tu- subiye mu ki- ha -e cya jenoside , ||| let 's think back a little bit on the period during the genocide .
ha- ri iminsi u- baye mu masaka , u- baye hanze igihe kinini . icyo ki- ha -e u- baga ... ... u- gereranya wenda u- ka- vuga uti ni nk' iminsi i- ngana gutya ? ||| you spent a lot of time living in the sorghumfield and outside ... can you estimate how many days you spent in that time ?
nk' iminsi n- vuga ngo n- baye hanze ... n- taba mu nzu ? ||| the days that i spent outside ... it 's about a week .
u- rebye nko mu cyumweru niba baje gusaka nko muri iyo nzu kwa munyagishari , niba ba- ra- za -aga kuhasaka nk' iminsi itatu . u- ra- umva niba baje kuwa mbere ku munsi wa kabiri n' uwa gatatu ntabwo n- gomba -aga ku- ha- boneka . ||| in fact , if the perpetrators were to come three times in a week to look for me at munyagishari 's place @- for example , if they came on monday , i would n't have to be there on tuesday and wednesday !
kugirango ba- ta- hita ... ba- ra- garuka -aga ba- ka- ambura . ||| otherwise , they would ... so they would n't get me whenever they would come .
noneho ba- ka- garuka nka nyuma y' iminsi ibiri . na none baje ku- i- reba -ir inka , ba- zibura ... ariko baje bitwaje umuntu . ||| then , theyy would just come back after two days but the issue of their come back was just about cows though they would pretend that they were looking for someone .
ba- ka- garuka n- ka- umva baje , ubwo n- ka- mara iminsi na none n- ta- ha- ri ndi mu masaka . ||| everytime i would be aware of their arrival , i would gao and spend some days in the sorghumfield .
kuko ibyo aribyo byose ha- ri igihe ki- umvikana ko u- maze igihe kinini cyane wibereye mu masaka . ||| it is obvious that at a certain time , you spent a lot of time in the sorghumfield .
icyo ki- ha -e u- ri u- ra- vuye kwa munyagishali ba- sa n' a- ba- ku- irukanye noneho ... ||| can you tell me about the time that you were chased from munyagishari 's place ?
n- ra- genda n- ka- umva bi- naniye , ha- ri aho bi- gera -aga u- ka- umva mbese urupfu nti- ru- ku- shaka u- ka- genda u- ru- shakisha wi- bunza . u- ka- hita u- genda u- ka- subira mu rugo na none . naho baza ku- ku- shaka ba- ku- sohora u- ka- ongera u- ka- subira ha- ha- n- ri , u- ka- genda a- ka- ba a- ri -ho u- ba . ||| i would just go till ... so many times , one would feel like the doors of death were locked up for him @/@ her as he @/@ she would look for dying ... the next thing was just going back home and flee again in case the perpetrators were back again and so on ... that 's how life was like .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo igihe ... u- maze ku- tandukana na murumuna wawe bwo n- ri- baza ko a- ri igihe ki- shobora kuba ki- gera nko ku byumweru nka bingahe u- ba u- ra- baye -mo . nk' ibyumweru bingahe ... ? ||| i mean all the time right a fter being separated from your sister ... was it like one week or ... how many weeks did you spend outside ?
u- ra- umva tu- baye mu masaka ku- va mu kwezi kwa kane ku- geza mu kwa karindwi . njyewe n- vuga ko icyo ki- ha -e cyose , ||| we stayed in the sorghumfield from april to july and for me , there was no other hiding place .
nta bu- n- ri bwihisho . niba n- ri ndi mu rugo ba- ka- n- sohora , nta ha- n- ri n- jya -aga . n- hita n- jya mu masaka gutyo . ||| everytime i was chased from where i was living , my refuge was in the sorghumfield . there was nowhere else i could go !
none se iyo wibutse nk' ubuzima mu muryango ... iwanyu mu rugo ukuntu mwari mu- meze mbere ya jenoside . ||| how was your life like before the gebnocide ?
u- n- shira -mo muri make ubuzima mwari mu- baye -ho ... niba mwari mu- tunze inka ... ese mwabagaho mu- ta -e muri makeya ? ||| tell me a bit about the way your family .
uko mwasabanaga n' abavandimwe . ||| did you have many cows , how was your relationship to your relatives ... ?
muri iyi myaka icumi i- shize ubwo tu- ra- je niga -aga mu wa kane primaire , murumuna wanjye y- iga mu wa gatatu , ||| ten years ago , i was in the 4th class of primary education and my younger in the third one .
n- ra- za n- ra- ongera n- tangira ishuri n- ra- iga , primaire n- ra- yi- rangiza nta kibazo . ||| after the war , i went back to school and completed the primary level as long as my younger sister .
tu- bana n' umutante ubu tu- ra- bana n' iyi saha niwe tu- ki- ri kumwe . tu- ra- iga primaire tu- ra- yi- rangiza , ||| thereafter , i completed secondary school .
secondaire n- ra- yi- rangiza murumuna wanjye ubu ngubu a- ri muwa gatandatu . tu- umva -aga nta kibazo . ||| today , my younger sister is in senior six . i lived with my auntie by then till now .
yego nyine ubuzima ntabwo bu- shobora ku- ngana n' u- ba -w mbere , n' ubwo mu nti- ambara hagati , n' u- ba -w nyuma . ariko bi- giye bi- tandukanye . ||| of course life is not the same , it is certainly different from the one during the genocide but it not the same as the one before the genocide .
nonese wu- n- va u- fite ibyiringiro biha -e byo mu ki- ha -e ki- za- za ? ||| are you hopeful about future ?
ha- ri igihe kinini cyane mu ki- ha -e cya jenoside u- giye u- tekereza ... ... wu- n- va wifuza ku- pfa , wu- n- va wifuza ku- pfa ... ||| were there times during the genocide where you could feeling like you would better die than ...
cyane n- umva -aga aricyo gisubizo . ||| yeah , very often ! that was the best solution for me .
none rero uyu munsi bwo wu- n- va iyo u- ba u- ra- pfuye ... wu- n- va bi- tandukana -iye he n' uko u- ba u- ri -ho ? kuba u- ri -ho wu- n- va ... ||| does life make sense for you today or you wish you would die ... what 's your impression about life ?
kuba n- ri -ho bi- ra- tandukanye cyane n' uko n- ba n- ra- pfuye . kuko kuba n- jya -e ndi umuntu ndi ku isi , ||| being alive for me is very different from dying .
ibyo a- ri byo byose ntabwo mpora nezerewe , kandi na none ntabwo mpora n- babaye . kuko n' ibintu bibiri kandi bi- gomba kuba -ho . ||| of course i 'm human and i do n't rejuice everyday but neither do i feel bad everyday @-@ those are two facts about which we can n't anything about .
noneho n- tekereza -ho kuba n- ra- pfuye burya ikintu cyo ku- pfa ... urupfu n- ta -ko ru- sa , ||| on the other hand , when i imagine myself dead , i fell like ... oh !
urupfu ni rwiza . ||| dying is good !
ni rwiza kuko u- ba u- ruhutse . ||| it 's good because you rest .
kuko iyo n- za kuba n- ra- pfuye , kuba n- tekereza kuba n- hura n' akantu kakantusha , kuba n- hura n' umuntu runaka n- ka- mu- tekereza -ho ukundi kuntu . ||| i think that if it happened that i was dead , today i would n't be worryinng about people because i may meet someone in the street and start questioning myself about him .
ya- ba a- ri no muri abo bantu ba- tu- iciye , tu- hura n- ka- bona yenda ... a- fite ikibazo . bi- ka- tuma mu- tekereza -ho impamvu a- baye gutyo . bi- tuma n- umva ko iyo n- ba n- ra- pfuye ibi byose ntabwo bi- ri kuba -ho . ||| when i see that he is not very confortable when we meet , i start thinking that maybe he is the one who killed my people or ... i just become inquisitive about him .
nta n' ubwo n- tekereza ngo n- umva -e ngo kugirango bi- genda -e gutya , n- gombye ku- genza gutya , n- umva -e ni ibintu bi- shyuhije mu mu- ta -w -e , mbese ni u- ku- ruhuka niko n- bi- fata , ||| all this makes me belive that if were n't alive , i would n't have all those problems , i would n't think to do this or that according to the situation , i would just rest .
ni nako n- bi- fata . ||| that 's how i think it is .
mu biha -e tu- ri -mo ha- ri -ho ikintu cya leta ... kuko habayeho ku- shaka ubundi buzima bushya . ||| the programme that the government has adopted is to emphasize on the fact that people have got to live in a new way .
nka leta ha- ri ibintu ba- vuga bya gacaca , ibintu byo ku- fungura a- ba- emeye icyaha ... byo u- bi- bona ku- ta -e ? ||| what do you think about gacaca and the system of releasing prisonners who have handed themselves over ?
ndetse n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge muri ru- sanga -e . ||| can you tell me what you think about unity and reconciliation ?
ubwo rero n- ka- bona ko biriya bintu byo ku- vuga ngo ba- sohoye abantu gutya ku- sa , ku- bera -ko ba- emeye icyaha hano umwe hariya undi , hano batanu , hano ijana , ||| so , in my opinion , releasing someone just because they admit what they did , releasing a hundred ... a hundred people ... i think it 's a way of simplifying things .
hano ngo magana angahe ... ngo ba- emeye icyaha hano ngo ba- ra- sohotse , ||| i do not even dare imagine what the consequences of it will be .
n- umva a- ri uburyo bwo koroshya ibibazo nta n' ubwo n- jya n- na- bi- i- umva -ish ngo n- umva -e inkurikizi zabyo , n- umva -e n' impamvu ba- bi- koze . kuko niba umuntu a- tekereza , ||| we should wonder why this perpetrator never reflected on the reason why they have been in jail for all this time .
ntabwo a- shobora ku- mara imyaka icumi muri n- tuza ... a- ka- bona ku- ibuka yuko ... a- ka- bona ku- emera ko ha- ri icyaha ya- koze mu myaka yose i- shize . ese a- ka- injira -mo ukwezi kwa mbere ... umwaka u- ra- shize , imyaka ibiri ... ya- ri a- ta- ra- tekereza ngo a- menye impamvu a- ri aho ngaho ? u- ka- reba ko ha- ri -mo abantu ba- genda ba- reba -ir ku ba- n- ri , ||| some of them imitate each other and decide to do likewise their companion in jail .
kubera ko ba kanaka bi- genze gutya , n- ta -w -e bi- gomba ku- genda gutya . kandi koko u- ka- bona niko bi- meze . ||| at the end of it all , we realize that 's how things work .
mu bya ku- ri- kira -an -ye na jenoside ha- ri -mo ikibazo cy' ubupfubyi , wowe iyo u- reba nk' abana b' ipfubyi u- bona iyi leta i- ba- itaye -ho ku- ta -e ... ? u- bona i- ba- fasha ku- ta -e ... ? ||| after genocide , the country had to face the problem of orphans ... what do you think of the way the current government takes care of orphans ?
ese u- bona bi- kwiriye ? ||| do you think it is enough ?
u- bona uburyo bitwabwaho , ||| what do you think of the way you 're treated by the rest of the society ?
uburyo abandi bantu ba- ba- sura ... u- bona bi- kwiriye ? ||| do they pay you a visit ... ?
njyewe uko n- bi- bona n- bona n- ta -ko ba- ta- ri ba- gize pe ! kuko ubundi umuntu a- jya ku- rokoka cyangwa a- jya ku- sigara muri buriya buryo , ||| i think they really give their best because right after the genocide , no survivor ever thought they 'd one day go back to school or that they 'd even beneficiate from any medical care .
ntabwo ya- tekereza -aga y' uko cyane cyane ku- bi- erekera -an -ye n' ikibazo cy' amashuri . ntabwo ya- tekereza -aga yuko ya- ba ya- ku- iga ; ntabwo ya- tekereza -aga yuko ya- rwara a- ka- vuza -w ; ||| today , we have the funds of assistance to genocide survivors , fonds d' assistance aux rescapes du genocide ( farg ) in french .
nk' uko bi- kwiriye bitewe n' ahantu yenda ya- ba a- ri runaka . ||| it helps in paying survivors ' school fees .
ariko kuri ubungubu , n- bona ba- ra- gerageje , nka kuriya ha- je -ho ikigega farg [ ikigega ki- tera inkunga a- ba- citse ku icumu rya jenosidde ba- ta- i- shoboye ] kuriya ifasha abana i- ka- ishyura minerval [ amafranga y' ishuri ] , ||| survivors have health insurance cards that they can present anywhere depending on what sickness they suffer from .
umuntu a- ka- ba a- fite ikarita ya- rwara a- ka- ba yakwivuriza ahantu aho a- ri -ho hose bitewe n' uburwayi bwe . biriya nabyo n- ra- bi- shima cyane . kuko ha- ri benshi ba- ta- ri ku- iga , ||| i am extremely grateful because without that funds , many children would n't be going to school today and they would n't be getting any medical care in case of sickness .
iyo kiriya kigega ki- ta- za kuba -ho . ha- ri benshi ba- ri ku- rwara ba- ka- bura ki- rengera , iyo ikigega ki- ta- za kuba -ho . kimwe n' uko ha- ri benshi ba- tabonye n' amafamille [ imiryango ] ba- ba -mo bi- bana , ||| there are some children who never got families to adopt them but who live together and live a good life today .
kandi ba- ka- ba -ho neza . ba- ka- iga ba- rwara ba- ki- vuza , kandi no mu buzima bu- sanzwe ba- ka- ba babapangira nk' ibyo ku- rya n' iki ... n- bona bira -ho nyine nta kibazo . ||| the government takes care of them , feeds them , pays their school fees ... i think it 's good .
n- ri- baza nkawe nk' ukuntu u- sigaye , wu- n- va abandi bana bagenzi bawe n' ubwo u- maze kuba mukuru ariko u- maze igihe kinini u- ri umwana , kandi u- ri umwana w' imfubyi . wu- n- va u- ha ubutumwa ki abandi bana mwarokokanye mu ki- ha -e cya jenoside ? ||| you have been an orphan for quite a long time despite the fact that you 're an adult today ... do you have a message to give to other children who survived the genocide the way you did ?
u- rebye ikintu cy' ingenzi . nk' ubungubu n- ka- n- jya -e n- ihereye -ho , kuko ku- vuga ubuzima bwo kuba -ho mu bupfubyi , ni ubuzima bu- goye cyane . ||| in fact , the most important thing ... well , it 's a personal comment but it is a difficult life that requires patience and perseverence .
bu- saba ngo wihangane , bu- saba ngo u- gerageza -e ku- tuza , u- gerageza -e ku- kira ibyo u- bonye ibyo u- tabonye nyine n- tu- bi- rarikira -e . ||| it is a life that do not leave us with any other choice , you have to be contented with what you have without coveting anything more than that .

n- ra- ba- beshya n- ba- bwira amazina a- ta- ri ay' ababyeyi banjye ba- ra- n- reka . ||| i lied to them and gave them wrong names of my parents . then they let me go .
tu- ra- komeza tu- ra- genda , tu- gera ahantu za nyabikenke , tu- gera ahantu za bulinga , ||| we continued our journey and reached nyabikenke and bulinga . we went through all those areas .

tu- ra- ongera tu- ra- garuka tu- jya ... nyine n- subira aho intambara ya- baye ndi , ||| we went back to ... to the place where i was during war .
kuko nta wu- n- ri muntu tu- ri tu- ri kumwe . n- subira a- honga -ho muri runda , maze ku- subira muri runda , ||| since i was alone , i went back to ruda .
ubwo intambara ya- ri i- rangiye . ||| the war had stopped then .
ubwo tu- sanga wa mukecuru a- racya- ri -ho , ariko wa mu- saza ya- ra- pfuye . ||| i found when the old lady was still alive but the old man had died .

n- ra- mu- bura n- gumana n' abongabo . ||| i just stayed there with those people .
mu kwezi kwa munani muri 1994 , icyo ki- ha -e n- ri ndi ... tu- ri tu- giye mu misa , tuje tu- sa ... n- sanga mukuru wanjye ya- je , ||| in august 1994 ... i remember we had gone to church , when i came back , i found my sister there .

mbere yo ku- mu- suhuza n- ra- mu- bajije @: "@ ese u- ri muzima ? @" ||| before greeting her , i first asked her ; "@ are you still alive ? @"
a- ra- n- bwira @: "@ ndi muzima . @" ||| she said , "@ i am alive . @"
"@ ntabwo u- pfuye ? ||| then i asked her , "@ you did n't die ?
cyangwa ni umuzimu wawe ndi ku- suhuza ? @" ||| or am i just talking to a ghost . @"
a- ra- n- bwira @: "@ oya ni jyewe ndi muzima . @" ||| she said , "@ no , it is me , i am still alive . @"
"@ ese u- baga he ? @" ||| "@ where were you living ? @"
a- ra- n- bwira ngo @: ||| i asked her .
ya- ri ... ya- geze nyine a- honga -ho i mu- samba -ir , a- honga -ho haba -aga amafamilles [ imiryango ] yacu , ||| then she told me that she ... she went to musambira , where we had family members and continued to hide .
a- ra- komeza yi- hisha -an -w nabo a- ra- genda a- gera za- ira -e , a- ra- ongera a- ra- garuka . ||| later she went to zaire [ congo ] and came back .
tu- tegereza yuko rero mama yaza , cyangwa tu- tegereza ko n' abandi bose bo mu rugo baza , tu- ra- tegereza tu- ra- heba . ||| therefore , we waited to see if mum or other people from home would come but none turned up .
abantu b' iwacu ntabwo tu- zi urupfu ba- pfuye , nta nubwo tu- zi ahantu ba- bi- ciye . ka- ereka papa wenyine niwe bi- ciye ahantu ku ‘ gacenter ’ , aho ba- mu- jyanye , ||| we neither know how people from home died nor where they died except dad who was killed at a certain center where they had taken him .

ubwo intambara i- rangiye , ||| then the war stopped .

ba- anga ko n- subira ku- iga . ||| then they stopped me from going back to school .
noneho kubera ko mukuru wanjye we ... nawe ntabwo ya- ri mukuru cyane , ariko we ya- ri a- n- rushije ubwenge . a- ra- reba ati @: "@ ese ubu , ||| though my sister was n't so old , she was slightly wiser than me .

a- ra- mu- bwira ati @: "@ ese n- ku- korera -e iki ? @" ||| then he asked her , "@ what can i do for you ?

mukuru wanjye a- ra- mu- bwira ati @: "@ aho kugirango tu- guma -e mu buzima tu- ri -mo , tu- ba mu nzu yacu tu- shaka tukanapfiramo . @" ||| then my sister told him , "@ instead of continuing to live the way we are living , we 'd better live in a house alone . we do n't care if it means dying . @"
ubwo ha- ri ha- ri inzu z' interahamwe , interahamwe za- ri zi- ra- hunze . ||| by then there were interahamwe 's houses , which were empty ; the interahamwe had fled .
a- tu- ha inzu , a- maze ku- tu- ha inzu , ||| he gave us a house .
tu- ra- genda tu- yi- ba -mo . ||| then we started living in it .
ubwo ya- ri muri mirongo cyenda na gatanu [ 1995 ] , n- n- jya -e n- subira ku- iga . mukuru wanjye we , ||| that was in 1995 , i went back to school but my sister was confused about what to do .
a- reba ku- subira ku- iga bi- ra- mu- shobera , kubera ko ntabwo ya- ri ku- iga ngo n- n- jya -e niga -e . ||| we both went to school at the same time for as hort time .

a- ra- genda a- bona akazi , noneho n- n- jya -e n- bona ubushobozi bwo ku- komeza ku- iga . ||| so , when she started working , i was able to continue school .

haza undi . noneho ha- je undi u- ta- tu- zi , u- ta- zi ubuzima bwacu uko bu- meze , ||| they brought another one who was not aware of our life conditions .
ba- ba obliges [ biba n- gomba -w ] yuko abantu ba- ta- fite diplome [ impamyabushobozi ] ba- va ku kazi . mukuru wanjye a- va ku kazi . ||| they stopped all employees who did not have diplomas and my sister was among them .
ndi quatrieme [ mu mwaka wa kane ] . a- vuye ku kazi , ||| i was in secondary four when she left work .
noneho ubwongubwo kubera ko na farg [ ikigega ki- tera inkunga a- ba- citse ku icumu rya jenoside ] ya- ri i- maze kuza , ||| fortunately , farg was founded .
farg [ ikigega ] i- ka- za- jya i- n- diha -ir , ariko mu kibazo cyo mu rugo ubuzima bu- ra- tu- gora . ||| therefore they would pay for my school fees but as far as domestic needs were concerned , we got a lot of problems .
ariko icyo ki- ha -e ntabwo tu- baga mu mugi wa kigali , ||| we were not living in kigali then .
tu- baga i ki- ta- arama ku isambu . ||| we were living in gitarama at the farm .
ibwo iyo sambu , kubera ko mukuru wanjye a- ki- kora , ntabwo sambu nti- i- igeze y- angirika , ya- shyira -aga -mo abantu ba- ka- yi- kora , ||| our farm was well treated since my sister was working ; she would employ people to work on it and we would live on its harvest .
i- bi- vuye -mo bi- ka- tu- tunga . a- ki- mara ku- hagarara ku kazi , ubwo ibintu bi- ri bi- ri mu isambu nyine bi- ra- komeje bi- ra- tu- tunga . noneho ha- shize iminsi , ||| at first when she had just left work , havests from the farm continued to feed us .
ngo haza itegeko ri- vuga ko umuntu wese , ||| after some time , there was a new policy that was put forward ; everyone had to give everything that did not belong to him or her .
a- za- subiza iby' abandi . ya nzu ba- yi- tu- kura -mo . ||| therefore , we were asked to live the other house .
ba- maze ku- yi- tu- kura -mo , ubuzima bu- ra- tu- komera -an . ||| when they took us out of that house , life became hard .
ubwongubwo ni -ho tu- hise tu- umva isi i- ha- gaze , ||| it was as though life had stopped .
ariko mukuru wanjye a- gerageza ku- egera farg [ ikigega ... ] . y- egereye farg , ubwo farg y- umva yuko ikibazo cyacu ki- komeye , ||| but my sister tried to contact farg and then farg considered our problem .
i- ka- za- jya i- tu- ha inkunga ya bu- ri kwezi 20,000 frw @/@ mois [ ibihumbi makumyabiri ku kwezi ] . ||| and they would give us 20,000 frw per month .
ubwongubwo muri 2001 , aribwo nyine tu- bona -aga n' ayo mafranga ya farg , mukuru wanjye nawe ... ubwo n- ri n- geze muri cinquieme secondaire . ||| then in the year 2001 , which is when we used to get the funding of farg ... my sister too ... i was in secondary five .
a- bona ko [ mukuru wanjye ] ubuzima ... ubuzima bwe nawe , bu- maze ku , buzapondekara [ bu- za- angirika ] , kubera ko nta kintu ya- ri yi- gejeje -ho . ||| my sister realised that her life was also getting worse because she never had any documents [ diplomas or certificates ] .
kubera ko we intambara ya- baye y- iga deuxieme secondaire [ umwaka wa kabiri w' amshuri yisumbuye ] . ||| the war began when she was in secondary two .
ubwo a- ra- vuga ati @: "@ u- geze cinquieme secondaire [ mu wa gatanu wisumbuye ] , kandi u- ra- bona ko farg iduprotega [ i- tu- rwana -ho ] i- ka- tu- ha ticket n' ibikoresho , ||| then she told me , "@ you have reached in senior five and you can see that farg is helping us ; they provide us with school funds , transport and other school expenses .

a- ra- iga farg [ ikigega ] i- ra- komeza i- ra- tu- fasha , i- maze ku- tu- fasha bi- gejeje muri 2002 , ubwo farg [ ikigega ] i- tu- ha inzu mu midugudu y' abana bi- bana hariya kimironko . ||| farg continued to help us until 2002 when they [ farg ] gave us a house in the kimironko residences , which were constructed for children who live on their own [ orphans ] .
i- maze ku- tu- ha inzu tu- yi- jya -mo , ||| we started living in that house .
farg iba decentralise [ y- egereza -w abaturage ] , ku- fasha abantu iba i- ra- bi- hagaritse . i- maze ku- bi- hagarika , ||| later farg was decentralised and they stopped helping people .
ubwo jyewe n- ri n- rangije ku- iga ... i- maze ku- bi- hagarika ubwo njyewe n- ri n- rangije ku- iga ... mbere yo kugirango nyine ihagarika -e ku- tu- fasha , ubwo ngewe n- ri n- rangije ku- iga . ejo bu- n- ri , ||| when they did ... i had finished my studies before they stopped helping us .
n- bona ikiraka muri ibuka , n- ra- ki- kora , ubwo ki- ra- tu- tunga , na mukuru wanjye nawe a- bona ibikoresho byo kugirango a- jya -e ku ishuri . ||| then i got a temporary job in ibuka . i worked and the money was helpful . my sister was actually able to get some of the school material she needed .
ikiraka ki- ra- hagarara , ki- maze ku- hagarara ubuzima nabwo bu- ra- hagarara . ||| then the job stopped and life stopped too .
ubwo ubuzima rero , nti- n- zi ... nti- n- ku- bwira ngo ubuzima bwacu bu- meze gutya , ||| now i can not tell you hoe exactly life is , all i can say is life is really hard on us .
ubuzima bwacu bu- ra- komeye . wenda niba u- gize ikibazo , u- gerageza ku- ki- ihangana -ir , kuko nta wu- n- ri u- ki- ereka . ||| when one has a problem , he or she tries to bear with it because there is no one to solve the problem for you .

ariko n- gize ima -an n- n- jya -e n- rangije n- bona diplome , ||| i was lucky to succeed and get a diploma .
ariko ubuzima bwacu kuri ubungubu ni ubuzima bu- gora -an -ye . ||| however life is currently very hard .
wenda nti- n- vuga ngo umuntu a- ra- iheba , n- gerageza kwicalma [ ku- tuza ] . kugirango wenda u- bona -e imibereho , ||| well , i can not say that we are desperate ; we always try to be serene and look for a living .
ni uko u- ba u- bonye nk' umuntu a- ka- ku- gira -ir impuhwe , cyangwa se a- ka- ku- ibuka . a- ka- vuga ati @: "@ uyu mwana ibyo aribyo byose reka mu- fashe muri ubu buryo . @" ||| sometimes we meet good samaritans who have pity on us or remember us and say , "@ i will help these kids in such and such a way . @"

kuko minani we ngirango ya- na- ku- temye ku kaguru . ||| because , i believe it is minani who cut your leg ...
umh ! ||| umh !
intambara i- ki- rangira , uwo minani twaraa ... nyine tu- kiza tu- giye ku- reba ku isambu ukuntu ha- meze , ||| after the war , we met the so called minani ... well , when we came back , we went to see our farm in the village .
tu- sanga minani a- ra- ha- ri . ||| we found minani there .
a- ki- n- bona we ubwoba bu- ra- mu- riye , a- ra- ambaza , ||| when he saw me , he was filled with fear .
ati @: "@ ese muri wowe n- ra- bi- zi n- ra- ku- hemuka -iye , n- ra- ku- temye . ||| then he said to me , "@ i know i betrayed you , i hacked you .
mu ku- ku- tema n- umva -aga n- ta- keneye yuko u- ba -ho . ||| and while doing so , i did not want you to live anymore .
none u- ra- umva n- ku- korera iki ? @" ||| what can i do to make up for what i did to you ? @"
n- ra- mu- bwiye nti @: ku buzima bu- anga -e u- ta- ra- shaka -aga yuko n- ba -ho , ha- ri amategeko a- za- ku- hana . ||| i just told him , "@ there are laws that will punish you for the fact that you never wanted to see me alive again . @"
tu- giye ku- mu- rega ku ka- rera -e , ba- ra- mu- fata ba- ra- mu- funga , ||| we went to report him at the district and he was arrested .
ariko ya- guye mu munyururu . ||| he later on died in jail .
we na mushiki we bose ba- ra- ba- fashe , mushiki we a- racya- ri mu munyururu , ||| his sister too was arrested and she is still in prison .
we a- funga -iye i ki- ta- arama , ||| she is in gitarama prison .
ariko minani we ya- ra- pfuye ya- guye mu munyururu . ||| but minani died in prison .
izindi nterahamwe , zo ha- ri n' ubwo u- sanga a- ri nazo za- ku- iciye ababyeyi , cyangwa abandi bavandimwe , ||| what about the other interahamwe ... you never know they may be the ones who killed your parents or your other relatives .
zo ibyabo bi- ba bi- ra- genze ku- ta -e ? ||| do you know anything about them ?
kubera ko mu gitero ki- je iwacu bwa mbere , umuntu tu- bashije ku- menya -mo cyane ni karekezi . ||| in the group of attackers who first attacked our home , the person we managed to identify was karekezi .
ubwo niwe u- giye a- jyana papa , ||| he is the one who took our father away .
kandi papa ku- va ya- genda ntabwo ya- garutse . ||| and since our father left , he has never come back .
niba a- riwe wamwishe , niba a- ta- ri we kubera ko ba- ri abantu benshi , ntabwo n- bi- zi . ||| but i do n't know if he is the one who killed him or his companions because they were very many .
ariko ku- sa ni uko uwonguwo a- ri we n- menye mo , uwo ba- ita -aga karekezi niwe n- menye mo ku- sa , amazina . ||| but he is the only one i knew in the whole group of attackers . he is called karekezi . he is the only one whose name i knew .
ya- ba a- ki- ri -ho se cyangwa ... ? ||| undefined
ntabwo n- bi- zi ibyongibyo , ||| i do n't know about that .
niba abongabo nabo ... niba abongabo nabo a- ba- emera yuko ya- ba- ishe . ||| i do n't know if he actually admits that he killed those people .
ariko we iyo u- mu- bajije a- ra- vuga ati @: "@ n- ishe abantu benshi . abo n- ishe nti- n- zi umubare wabo , ku- sa n- zi ko n- ishe abantu benshi . @" ||| but when you try asking him , he says , "@ i killed a lot of people and i can not tell the exact number , all i know is that i killed so many people . @"
none se ya- ba ya- ra- je ku- ba- saba imbabazi ? ||| did he come to apologise to you ?
oya , ntabwo ya- je . ||| no he 's never come .
none se tu- ka- omoje kuri ibyo , wowe u- tekereza iki kuri gacaca ? ||| well , considering that , what do you think of the gacaca court ?
njyewe kuri gacaca ukuntu n- yi- tekereza -ho , abantu ba- ishe , ba- ishe babifitiye umugambi . umuntu rero njyewe a- je i- n- bera -e yanjye , ||| what i think about gacaca court ... people who killed had a goal in doing so .
a- je ku- n- saba imbabazi kubera ko y- ishe , ya- ra- n- yi- ciye . y- ishe a- bi- shaka kandi a- bi- kuye ku mu- ta- ima , ni uko ubutegetsi bu- mu- hana bukurikije categorie [ urwego a- ri -mo ] y' u- ku- ica kwe . ||| therefore , when someone comes to me asking for forgiveness because he killed people , my people ... they killed intentionally with all their hearts ... therefore , the law should punish them according their crimes .
ha- ri ibintu bimwe biku ... ha- ri ikintu ki- kunze ku- vuga -w cyane ki- jyanye n' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . ||| there is something that is often talked about , something concerning unity and reconciliation .
ese wowe nk' umuntu u- ki- riwe nabi bi- ngana gutya , na n' ubu u- ka- ba u- ki- baye -ho mu n- garuka zibyo bintu bi- baye . ||| to somebody like you who was hurt to that extent and who is still suffering the consequences of their deeds even today .
u- bona bi- shoboka cyangwaa ... wowe u- bi- bona ku- ta -e ? ||| do you find it possible ... or what is your point of view ?
njyewe ku ru- hara -e rwanjye , kubera nk' uko n- buze abantu n- ka- ba n- sigaye iheruheru . njyewe umuntu u- n- yi- ciye , ni uko ya- habwa igihano nawe kimutoucha [ ki- mu- kora -ho ] , ||| personally , as someone who lost everyone and is now living miserably , i believe those who killed should be strongly punished in a way that would affect them .
nawe a- ka- umva yuko nawe ya- gize nabi . ||| so that they also feel how wrong what they did is .
kuko nti- n- vuga wenda ngo ... ngo nibamwice , ||| because i can not say that ... that they should kill them too .
si njyewe u- bi- vuga ya- bi- bwira -w n' amategeko . ||| it 's not my place to say so , it is the role of the law , and i do n't have that right .
njyewe nta burengazira n- bona , ariko jyewe ku bwanjye bamwica . ||| but personally i would suggest they kill them .
ariko ku burengazira bw' amategeko , ba- mu- ha igihano ki- jyanye n' icyaha ya- koze . ||| but as far as the law is concerned , they should be given punishments according to the crimes they committed .
nonese ... eeh , ibyo aribyo byose iyo umuntu ya- nyuze mu bintu nk' ibyo u- nyuze -mo , a- ka- ba a- ba -ho mu buzima nk' ubwo u- ri -ho , kubera nk' ibyo u- nyuze -mo , ||| well , when a person experiences some things the way you did and then lives the way you are living due to his or her past , he or she gains some life experience .
aba a- fite umwihariko we . wowe nko kuba umuntu u- citse ku icumu wu- n- va a- ri ikintu ... bi- vuze iki ? ||| therefore , what does it mean to you as a genocide survivor ?
wu- n- va u- bi- sobanura ku- ta -e ... ? ||| could you explain about it ?
nk' umuntu ... nk' umuntu n- ka- n- jya -e u- huye n' ikibazo , ||| as a person who ... someone like me who got several problems .
ukuntu n- umva jenoside . ha- ri ukuntu u- tekereza nk' ubuzima u- giye u- nyura -mo , u- ka- gereranya n' ubwo u- ri -ho ubu , u- ka- bona n- ta -ho u- vuye , ||| the way i understand the genocide ... there is a time you think about all the things you went through and try to compare it with the life you are leading now ; then you come to realise that there is no difference between your past and your present .
nta n' aho u- giye . iyo u- bonye bi- meze gutyo , wi- ha amahoro . ||| and when thing are like that , you just try to ignore it all .
kuko u- ta- i- haye amahoro , washiduka u- giye no mu muhanda u- saze , kandi noneho u- ka- nezeza ba- ba- n- ri ba- ku- gira -iye nabi . ||| because if you can not find a way to ignore it , you might end up on the streets , crazy .
ariko iyo wihaye amahoro nta n' u- menya icyo u- tekereza , ku- sa u- ra- bi- ihorera u- ka- tuza , u- ka- tegereza ubundi buzima bu- ri i- n- bera -e , ||| this would only contribute to making happy your enemies . but when you try to be still and not let even a single person know what you are thinking about . you just have to calm down and think about the future .
ubu twe tu- zi ibyashize ariko ntabwo tu- zi ibiri i- n- bera -e . ||| we only know the past ; we do n't know the future .
utegeza nyine i- ki- ri i- n- bera -e niba a- ri kiza se , cyangwa se niba a- ri kibi , ||| we can only wait for the future , if it happens to be good , fine ; if not too bad .
nyine mu buzima u- ka- tegereza ibindi bi- ri i- n- bera -e yawe . ||| in life it is important to wait for what 's ahead of us .
ha- ri ikintu n- umva tu- vuga -ho cyane cyane ku buryo bw' umwihariko . ||| there is something i would like us to talk about more specifically .
u- ra- bona wowe u- ri umuntu u- nyuze mu buzima bu- komeye , kandi u- ciye mu ibintu byinshi . ||| you see you are a person who experienced tough times and you have seen a lot of things .
nonese ibyo aribyo byose ibyo u- ciye -mo wabitewe no kubura ababyeyi n' ibyabayeho , ariko ha- ri ubundi buzima u- baye -ho n' ubwo wenda u- ri umwana bwa mbere y' intambara . ||| however , all was as a result of the loos of your parents due to the war .
u- ba wibuka , cyangwa u- tu- bwira uti @: "@ jyewe n- umva mbere y' intambara nkurikije uko iwacu tu- ri tu- meze , ||| do you remember how things were before the war ? can u tell us about it ?
bi- ri bi- meze gutya ? ||| how were you living ?
u- tu- cira muri make ubuzima bw' iwanyu mbere y' intambara ? ||| would you please tell us about your life at home before the war ?
twebwe mbere y' intambara , twebwe tu- ri abana batanu . muri abo bana batanu ni jyewe u- ri uwanyuma . ||| before the war , we were five children and i was the last @-@ born .
kandi nta kibazo mu rugo tu- gira -aga , kubera ko a- ri mama , a- ri na papa bose ba- ra- kora -aga . ||| we never used to have problems at home because both mum and dad were working .
nta kibazo tu- gira -aga pe ! ||| for sure , we never had any problems .
wenda n' iyo no hanze haba -aga n' ibibazo , twebwe nta kintu bi- baga bi- tu- bwiye . kubera ko tu- ri tu- fite a- ba- tu- reba -ir . ||| sometimes there would be problems out there but it would n't mean anything to us because there used to be people to look after us .
ariko intambara ya- ra- rangiye , kubera ko jyewe na mukuru wanjye , ni n- ta -w -e tu- ri abanyuma , abari ba- tu- kura -iye bose ba- ragiye . ||| but after the war ... my sister and i ... yet we were the youngest ; all our elders were gone .
intambara rero i- rangiye ... intambara i- rangiye , n- i- buze nta na famille [ umuryango ] n- ima -w -e i- garagara , ya- ba ya- ra- sigaye , ||| even though the war stopped , not any family member was left .
ku buryo tu- yi- bwira ikibazo . ||| maybe we could be telling them about our problems .
famille [ umuryango ] na y- itwa ngo ya- ra- sigaye , ni za familles [ ya miryango ] nazo zi- ri -ho zi- ta- bashije . ||| those who survived only are those who can neither support themselves .
ubwo rero kugirango ubuzima u- ri u- ri -mo mbere , ubu comparer [ u- bu- gereranya -e ] n' ubw' ubungubu , ||| therefore , if we compare this life with life before the war , there is a very big difference .
u- bona ha- ri -mo difference [ bu- tandukanye ] . kuko ubungubu n- shobora ku- gira ikibazo , nti- n- gira -e uwo n- ki- bwira . ||| because nowadays i may be having a problem but i can n't find anyone to tell it about .
mbese ubu n- shobora ku- mara n' iminsi ibiri n- ta- ri n- rya , ariko mbere y' intambara nta n' umunsi ... nta n' i- sa ... igihe cyose n- umva -aga n- keneye ku- rya n- ra- rya -aga . ||| for example , i can spend two days without eating , yet before the war , i had never spent even a single day or an hour ... every time i would feel like eating , i would eat .
ariko ubungubu n- shobora no ku- mara n' iminsi itatu , kandi n- ka- ceceka . ||| but now i can even spend three days and remain silent .
kubera ko n- ba n- buze uwo n- tura ikibazo . ||| because there is no one i can share my problem with .
ubuzima bwa nyuma y' intambara , ni complique [ bu- ra- goye ] cyane . nta n' i- cya kane , cya mbere y' intambara . ||| life after the war is very complicated . mathematically , i would say it is not even a quarter of the life i was leading before the war .
undi muntu n- umva u- komeye cyane muri iki ki- ha -e nyuma y' intambara , cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe , ni mukuru wawe . ||| i noticed that the most special person in your life after the war is your sister .
nonese u- tu- bwira iki kuri mukuru wawe , angana iki ? u- bona a- fite imigambi i- meze ku- ta -e ? ||| what can you tell us about your sister ; how old is she and what are her plans ?
ubundi mukuru wanjye nawe , ni umwana ... si umwana cyane ya- vutse muri 1981 . ||| although she is not too young , my sister is also young ; she was born in 1981 .
ariko ubuzima bwe nawe ni ha- ta- ri . ||| but her life is also horrible .
kuko aho ya- ri a- geze , ya- ri kuba a- ri umuntu wenda nawe u- gize icyo yi- mara -ir . ||| at this time she should have been able to do something with herself .
ariko kubera ko ya- buze umuntu u- mu- sunika ngo yi- gira -e igihe , amashuri ye a- ya- rangiza -e . ubuzima bwe bu- baye n- ku- bu- subira i- n- y- uma . ||| but because she did not have anyone to push her so that she studies on time and complete her studies , her life seems to have declined instead .
kubera ko we ya- bonye ko a- n- sigara -an -ye kandi ndi umwana kuri we , a- bura ikintu ya- n- korera , a- va mu ishuri , kugirango wenda n- bona -e uko n- ku- iga . ||| when she realised that it was just the two of us who survived and yet she was the oldest , she had no other alternative but to leave school so that i would go to school .
we ya- subiye ku ishuri a- ri uko farg [ ikigega ] ije . kandi a- subira ku ishuri a- ri uko farg [ ikigega ] y- emeye ku- za- jya i- tu- fasha bu- ri kwezi . ||| she went back to school after farg was founded ; that is after farg had agreed to help us monthly .
ibyo byose bi- ta- ri bi- ba farg [ ikigega ] i- ta- ra- za , we y- emeye ku- n- vunikira , kugirango mbe n- jya ejuru . ||| but before farg came , she had sacrificed herself so that i also get to some grade .
ku- geza na n' ubu ntabwo amashuri ye a- ra- ya- rangiza , ||| up to now , she has n't completed her studies .
kandi i- n- tera ye ntabwo imwemereye kuba ya- ba a- ka- iga secondaire [ amashuri yisumbuye ] , ||| normally at her age , she is not supposed to be in secondary school but that is where she is now ; she is in senior five at the moment .
ariko ubu a- ri muri cinquieme secondaire [ muwa gatanu w' amashuri yisumbuye ] . kandi n' iyo a- geze mu rugo , a- sanga ibibazo a- ri byinshi , ||| and whenever she comes back home [ from boarding school ] , she finds several problems .
wenda n- ka- n- jya -e ya- ba ya- ra- size ... u- ba u- ra- sigaye i- n- y- uma , nta kintu mu- mara -iye . ndi gutya n- n- jya -e , nta kazi n- gira nta ki ... nta n' undi muntu wu- n- ri n- gira umproteja [ u- n- rwana -ho ] wenda ngo n- n- jya -e n- gira -e ikintu n- ba n- mu- mara -ir . ||| and me who remained behind , she finds there is nothing i improved because i have no job , no one to protect me , so that i also can help her .
a- va ku ishuri nabwo , a- kaza a- ka- subira muri bwa buzima bubi , ya- ri a- ri -mo mbere . ||| she comes from school and goes back into the miserable life that she left behind .
nta bu- tuma -w u- ha nk' imfubyi za jenoside ? ||| is there any message you could give genocide orphans ?
cyane cyane a- ri imfubyi zira -ir , a- ri n' imfubyi zira -ir -w . ||| especially those that take care of themselves or even to those that are looked after .
kuko ... cyane cyane abana , a- ba- ki- ri batoya . kuko bi- ra- garagara ko ba- gombye ku- gira uburyo ba- ku- i- twara . ||| those young kids should have a way they should behave ...
njyewe nk' inama n- ba- ha , ni uko ubuzima bwose ba- nyuze -mo , n' ubwo ba- ki- ri -mo ubu , ba- shobora kubwitwaramo neza . ||| the piece of advice i would give them is , "@ never long for luxuries because they can turn out to be so dangerous . @"
ikintu cyose ba- bonye , n' icyo ba- tabonye ba- ka- umva ko ki- ba- nyuze . ||| if they can appreciate who they are , be it those who are in families or those who are looking after themselves ... it is possible to live in a family and yet live in torture .
nti- ba- gira -e irari . ||| if you are not too patient to live with them , is when people start saying you are a spoiled child .
kuko ba- gize irari bi- ba- va -ir -mo n' ibindi bibi . ariko banyuzwe n' uko ba- ri , ya- ba ba- ri muma familles [ mu miryango ] cyangwa se ba- ba a- bi- rera ... burya ha- ri -ho n' ukuntu u- ba muri famille [ mu muryango ] aho kugirango u- ba -e -ho neza , ahubwo ya famille [ wa muryango ] ikagutesa . ||| and after misbehaving , she or he may suffer the consequences such sicknesses .
iyo u- ta- ihanganye rero ngo u- bana -e nabo , nibwo u- jya ka- umva u- ka- umva ngo umwana kanaka ya- rarutse . u- ka- sanga muri kwa ku- raruka kwe a- kuyemo consequences [ ingaruka ] z' indwara , icyo namukonseya [ inama n- mu- gira ] ho ni uko ikintu cyose ki- ba kiza , ||| therefore , all i can advise them is to look at everything before them positively ; be it good or bad .
ki- ba kibi i- n- bera -e ye a- shobora ku- ki- fata nk' i- kiza . kugirango mu buzima bwe bu- ri i- n- bera -e , ubuzima bwe bu- za- shobora -e gufonctiona [ ku- genda ] neza . ||| it will all contribute in building a better future .
eeh , u- ra- bona iyi cassette i- za- reba -w n' abantu benshi , ||| you know this tape is going to be watched by many people .
i- za- reba -w n' abana bawe n' abuzukuru kuko ni ikintu ki- za- bi- kwa . nonese nta zi- n- ri ... mu ki- ru- n- ri ho ba- za- ita impanuro . ||| your own kids or even grandchildren might one day watch it because it is going to be well kept .
inama cyangwa se ubutumwa u- tanga kuri iyi cassette yawe ? ||| do n't you have more advice or a message to add on this testimony ?
icyo u- shaka ku- vuga icyo aricyo cyose ku banyarwanda bose , ku ba- citse ku icumu muri ru- sanga -e . ||| anything you may need to talk about to rwandans at large or survivors in general .
u- shobora ku- gira icyo u- vuga . ||| you can say anything ...
jyewe ikintu n- gira nk' inama abantu ba- citse ku icumu , ni uko tu- vuga -e nk' abantu ba- koze jenoside , ba- ka- yi- korera nk' umuntu . yego u- gerageza uburyo bwose bu- ba -ho kugirango mu- vugana -e , ||| the advice i can give to the genocide survivors ... let 's talk about the genocide perpetrators ... well , we try our best to talk to them but however much you may try to talk to them , their hearts seems no to be at ease [ ubnormal ] .
ariko ni -yo mwavuga , mu- vugana nawe umutima wawe u- ta- ri normal [ u- ta- sanzwe ] . kuko nta untu umuntu ya- ba ya- ra- ku- iciye ababyeyi , ngo a- ku- icira -e famille [ umuryango ] u- sigara -e u- meze nk' igiti , ||| there is no way one can kill your parents , kill you entire family and you remain like a tree [ indifferent ] , and then expect to talk to him or her nicely .
wa muntu u- za- mu- vuga -ish -e neza . u- ra- mu- vuga -ish ariko umutima wawe u- ba wu- n- va a- ri ibuye . ||| well you talk to him or her but your heart feels like a stone .
yego ... ... njyewe inama n- gira nk' umuntu u- citse ku icumu , ni uko a- ta- komeza ngo yi- korera -e umutwaro , ||| the advice i would give the genocide survivors is ... they should n't always carry that burden .
a- komeza -e a- vunika -e hejuru y' abantu bamwiciye , ||| they should n't let themselves be stressed by the killers .
ahubwo ya- gerageza ibyo bintu a- ka- bi- i- kura -mo , a- ka- ongera umutima we u- ka- ba mushyashya . umutima w' ibuye nyine , wu- n- va yuko abantu ba- mu- gira -iye nabi , ||| instead they should try and ignore those feelings and kind of renew their hearts , i mean they should have a heart of stone .
a- ka- gerageza kuwikuramo , ||| they should try to ignore what happened to them .
ndetse a- ka- gerageza akanabegera nawe , a- ka- umva igitekerezo ki- ba- va -mo . ||| in fact they should try to talk to those who hurt them and listen to their opinion .
kuko burya iyo umuntu ya- ku- gira -iye nabi a- ka- bona utamufitiye uburakari , ahubwo a- ka- bona umwegera u- gerageza ku- mu- vuga -ish , nawe ntabwo yi- shima , ahubwo ubwoba ni -ho bumwica . ||| i believe when someone hurts you and do not react with anger and you talk to them instead , the person will never be at peace , they will always fear you .
n- jya -e ni -yo nama n- gira a- ba- citse ku icumu . ||| that 's my advice .
nk' abana bato ? ||| what about children ?
abana bato bo , ntabwo ... njyewe inama n- gira nk' abana batoya n- ba- umva -ish yuko , intambara n' ubwo ya- baye , ariko i- n- bera -e ha- ri ubundi buzima bushyashya . ||| well , concerning children , i can not ... the advice i can give them is , though there was a war , the future will make life new .
kuko nk' umutwe w' umwana u- mu- shyize -mo ngo intambara ya- ra- baye , u- ka- genda u- mu- shyira -mo ibintu bibi , we ya- kura nta n' i- kiza a- zi . ya- kura y- umva ko mu mu- ta -w -e we , ||| because if you tell them the history of the war , or tell them those bad stories , they may grow up without enjoying anything in life .
i- n- bera -e ye , i- n- y- uma -e ye , ibyamubayeho bi- za- ba prolonge [ bi- za- komeza gutyo ] . ariko n- mu- gira inama y' uko ibintu byose bi- baye , ||| they may mature up with a belief that what will happen in the future will be the continuation of what happened in the past .
bi- za- gira iherezo , ||| therefore , i would reassure them that what happened will end .
i- n- bera -e ye ha- ri ubundi buzima bwiza bu- ta- meze nk' ubwo ya- nyuze -mo . ||| the future will be very good , unlike what they went through in the past .
ni iyo n- gira abana batoya ||| that is the advice i would give children .
ukurikije noneho n' ikibazo cy' ukuntu amahanga u- zi ya- ba ya- ri- twaye ku bi- baye mu rwanda ... kuri jenoside ya- baye mu rwanda , yo wu- n- va nta kintu u- ya- bwira ? ||| considering the problem of foreign countries that deny that there was genocide in rwanda , do n't you have any message to give them ?
amahanga ? ||| foreign countries ?
ni uko akenshi amahanga y- umva yuko nta jenoside ya- baye mu rwanda . ||| the problem is foreign countries believe that there was n't genocide in rwanda .
ka- ereka ahari n- bonye ... nk' umuyobozi w' igihugu runaka u- ta- jya wemera ko ha- ri jenoside ya- baye mu rwanda . ||| unless i get ... a leader from a particular country that denies that there was genocide in rwanda .
nkamwumvisha uburyo jenoside ya- baye mu rwanda , ||| then i would convince him or her that genocide did take place in rwanda .
bi- ba n- gomba -w nkamwereka n' ahantu ha- giye ha- gwa inzirakarengane , bashyinguwe , ||| and if necessary , i would take him or her to those places where they exhumed and reburried those innocent people who died .
ayo magufwa yabo a- ka- gerageza ku- ya- bona . ndetse umuntu a- ka- jya amwereka n' abantu ba- mu- gaye ku buryo bwa jenoside . a- ka- gera aho ... ubwo y- umva ko jenoside ya- baye -ho mu rwanda . ||| i would make sure he or she gets to see those remains of people and show him or her all those who were handicaped due to the genocide until when he or she ... understands that genocide actually took place in rwanda .
kuko amahanga menshi , ntabwo a- jya y- i- umva -ish uburyo umuntu ya- fashe umuhoro a- ka- tema undi . ||| because most countries can not imagine how someone can hold a machete and hack his or her equal .
nonese wowe wu- n- va mu buzima bwawe bu- ri i- n- bera -e u- teganya iki ? ||| what do you plan for your future ?

ha- ri ikibazo ki- n- ri ki- erekana ko bi- ri bi- turutse ku bwoko bwanyu ? ||| is there any other problem you got as a result of your ethnic belonging [ tutsi ] ?
oya , ||| no , there was n't any other problem .

ku mpande a- ri bo ba- tuye a- ri abo bahutu ku- sa nta ba- n- ri . u- ra- umva ko a- ba- gomba -aga ku- bi- kora a- ri abo ngabo nyine . ||| all our neighbours were hutus . definitely one could tell they were the ones to do all those acts !
u- n- bwiye ko u- sanzwe u- ri umunyagitarama , ||| you told me that you come from gitarama .
u- ri kavukire kaho ? ||| were you born there ?
yee , u- sibye ko aho tu- ri tu- tuye , ku ivuko n' aho ba- ita ... ni ahantu ba- ita i karama u- sa n' u- gana i ki- ta- arama , ||| yes , but while we lived in mwendo , our home origin was in karama .
ariko aho ba- ita i mwendo ni -ho sogokuru ya- ri ya- ra- imuka -iye , ariko ya- ri isambu ya sogokuru yose . ||| our grandfather had shifted to mwendo and we lived on his land .
ku- vuga ko ya- ri nini , ||| he had a very large land .
n' uko a- riwe u- ri u- yi- ri -mo wenyine ariko ba- ri ba- fite abavandimwe ! ||| the reason i am saying that it was very large is because he was living there alone .
ariko kubera ko a- riwe u- yi- sigaye -mo wenyine bi- garagara -aga ko a- ri -yo nini kubera iyo mpamvu nta ba- n- ri bavandimwe ba- ha- ri . ||| he had few relatives and therefore seemed to own a big land . he was living there with a few of his relatives .
ha- ri ikintu u- hoze u- vuga , u- vuga ku banyakibuye ba- jya -aga ba- hungira a- honga -ho , ba- hungira -aga iyo za kabgayi . ||| you earlier talked about people who were fleeing from kibuye towards kabgayi .
sa nk' u- bi- sobanura -ho gake . ||| would you please elaborate more about that ?
abanyakibuye baza -aga ba- vuye ku kibuye kuko u- rebye bo ba- na- twikiye kare , ||| the population fled kibuye because their houses had earlier been burnt .
ba- ra- ba- irukana , ba- jya -aga baza ba- vuye ku kibuye ba- ka- nyura iyo n- zira y' iwacu tu- ka- ba- bona twebwe tu- ka- ba- kira kuko ba- ri bene wacu , ||| they were chased from kibuye . they used to pass through our home area while fleeing . we used to help them , as we knew we were related to some extent .
tu- ka- ba- gaburira tu- ka- gira ku- ta -e ... ba- ka- komeza ba- jya i kabgayi . ||| we would give them food and all we could to help them . then they would proceed to kabgayi .
abenshi nti- ba- na- gera -aga -yo kuko abo basore b' iwacu ubundi ba- shinga -aga amabariyeri mu n- zira ba- ka- ba- fata , ||| most of them would n't reach their destination because our neighbours had set roadblocks .
abakobwa bakabaviyora bamwe ba- ka- ba- gira abagore babo , ||| they would kill them ; ladies would be raped and sometimes made sex slaves .
ndetse muri iyo minsi ba- ri ba- tangiye ku- tema nta n' uwarengaga aho ngaho bose ba- ra- mu- fata -aga bakamutemagura ba- ka- jya ku- mu- jugunya a- honga -ho muri urwo rwobo . ||| in fact the killings had started and most people would not go beyond that roadblock ; they would be murdered and dumped into a deep pit that was in this area .
i kabgayi ha- gera -aga -yo bake cyane . ||| very few would reach kabgayi .
ku buryo nko muri uwo mu- sara -an -e ba- n- taye -mo , ||| for example , there were many corpses in the pit where i had been dumped by the time we exhumed them .
ha- ri -mo abantu benshi twataburuyemo ba- ra- genda ku- shyingura -w muri ru- sanga -e tu- ta- zi ahantu ... a- ri abo banyakibuye nyine ba- giye batemagura n' a- ba- turuka ku mpera z' akarere ba- ita aka ka- ba- ka- ri . ||| all the corpses were reburied together because we could n't tell their places of origin . perhaps they were from kibuye or areas around kabagari .
ariko benshi ba- bi- cira -aga mu n- zira kandi ba- icwa -aga n' abo bantu b' iwacu bose tu- ra- ba- zi . ||| most people were killed on the way , our neighbours killed them . and we know them [ the killers ] .

mu- ta- bu- rura se mwasanzemo bangahe ? ||| how many people were in pit the time you exhumed them ?
tu- ta- bu- rura , ||| while exhuming ... we first found my older brother on top , then we found our sister in law .

tu- ta- bu- rura rero ha- vuye -mo nk' abantu ba- geze kuri ... kuri cumi n' umunani . ||| i think they were about eighteen .
abandi ba- ri mu cyobo cyo hepfo , cyo nti- n- zi umubare wacyo u- ri -mo . ||| there were more people in the next pit but i do n't know the exact number of people who were there .

ibyobo bi- ri bingahe ? ||| how many pits were there ?
ibyobo bi- ri bibiri ||| two pits .
hagati yabyo ha- ri ha- ri -mo nka distance i- ngana iki ? ||| what was the distance between the two pits ?
ha- ri -mo nka distance ya 300 m [ metero magana atatu ] . ||| about 300 meters .

yee ! kuko a- ba- tu- ica -aga bo ni abantu b' abaturanyi u- ba u- ba- zi , ||| actually those who killed us were our neighbours and we knew them .
u- sibye no ku- tu- ica n' aho inka ya- giye , n' aho iki cyose u- baga u- ki- zi u- vuga uti @: iki ki- twaye na kanaka na kanaka ; ||| not only the killers , but also those who looted our properties .
na mukuru wanjye n- ku- vuga nti @: y- ishwe n' a- ka- n- aka na kanaka . ||| for example , i know who killed my elder brother .
ubu mama wawe a- tuye he ? ||| where does your mother reside now ?
ubu mama a- tuye , tu- ba- n- je ku- tura mu bi- ima -an mu gacentre ntabwo tu- ki- tuye ha- ha- n- ri tu- ri tu- ri , ||| now she is living in ... at first we lived in byimana centre .

papa ya- vutse muri mirongo itatu na gatanu [ 1935 ] icyo ki- ha -e a- shobora kuba ya- ri a- fite imyaka ingahe , ||| my father was born in 1935 that means that by then he was about 59 years old .

ya- ri a- fite nk' imyaka ... nka myakumyabiri n' umwe , ||| he was about 21 years old .
ya- ra- vutse irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] n- gira ngo uwo muhungu . ||| i guess he was born in 1974 .
ubwo muri genocide nti- ya- ri a- fite makumyabiri n' umwe ? makumyabiri ni irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] . ||| maybe he was 20 years during the genocide since he was born in 1974 .
ijwi nti- ri- umvikana ! ||| q ...
kuko iwacu n' iwabo aho ba- tuye ha- ri -mo nka cinq cents metres [ 500 m ] tu- ra- turanye mu by' ukuri , ||| we were neighbours . the distance between our homes was about 500 meters .
niwe tu- hana imbibi . ubu na se a- ra- funze , kuko muri urwo rupfu rwa mukuru wanjye ise ya- ri a- ri -mo , ||| presently his father is under custody because he was involved in my older brother 's murder .

ba- gize uruhare mu ku- ica uwo mukuru wanjye . ||| all that man 's family and the soldier were there while my brother was being killed ; they all participated in his death .
igihe ba- ku- jyana -aga ku cyobo . sa n' u- tu- bwira igitekerezo u- gize , ||| the time you were led to the pit , what was on your mind ?
u- tu- bwira -e experience yawe . ||| tell us a bit of your experience .
n- jya -e ku- sa igihe ba- jyanye ku mwobo n- bona -aga ko nta ku- n- ri n- n- jya -e n- giye ku- pfa ; ||| when they took me to the latrine hole , i thought my life was over .
ibyo ba- raye ba- koreye mukuru wanjye n- ra- bi- umva -aga , kandi n- ra- bi- bona -aga , u- ra- umva ko nta ... nta bu- n- ri buzima . ||| i had just seen and heard what they had done to my brother .
ndetse n- geze hejuru y' umwobo , icyo n- zi -ko cyo n- tekereje ko ... n- ka- umva n- fite amatsiko yo ku- jya mw' ijuru nta ki- n- ri n- ri- n- fite icyo ki- ha -e , ||| when i was on top of the hole , i was curious about what heaven looked like , that 's all i could think of .
ahubwo n- umva ba- ra- n- tinda -iye ku- n- yi- ca . ||| i was wondering what took them so long to kill me .
a- fashe inyundo n- ri- n- zi ko a- giye ku- yi- n- kubita mu mu- ta -w -e ugashwanyuka bi- ka- rangira , ||| when he snatched a hammer , i thought he was going to smash my head and finish with me .
icyakoze n- gize amahirwe ni ya mana i- za- rokora umuntu nyine a- yi- kubita ku gakanu , n- za ku- rokoka gutyo . ||| fortunately , i guess it was by gods will ; he hit my neck instead of my head and that is how i survived .
u- byutse u- bashije ku ... ? ||| when you gained conscious did you manage to ...
n- byutse ni -ho n- je ku- gira ikibazo , n- vuye mu mu- sara -an -e . n- tekereje ahantu ndi bu- gana -e , ||| when i gained conscious and moved from the hole , i started thinking of where to go .
n- reba amajyepfo n- reba amajyaruguru , n- bona wapi n- ta- ki- genda bi- ruta -w no ku- pfa . ||| i looked in the north and in the south and found no direction . i wished i had died !
kuko n- ra- vuga -aga ngo nibaramuka ba- n- bonye , nyuma yuko ba- n- koreye ibingibi , noneho ibyo ba- ri bu- n- korera -e bi- ra- renze . ba- ri ku ... ba- ri ku- ca urutoki ba- ri ku- ca ugutwi , ||| i thought in case they came across me , they would do worse things than what they had done to me . i thought they would first amputate me or cut my ears or fingers off .
nti- n- zi ikintu ba- ri ku- n- korera nuko n- gize amahirwe nyine nibambone . ||| fortunately , they never caught me again . otherwise , it would have been like dying twice .
ariko ikintu ki- ri ki- n- teye ubwoba n- ra- vuga -aga nti @: bi- ruta -w nuko n- pfa ku- rusha uko ba- garuka bwa kabiri nti- n- zi uko n- bi- ita ni u- ku- pfa ku- pfa kabiri nti- n- zi ! ||| that is waht i can call it .
wu- n- va -aga u- sa nk' aho u- tinye ko ba- garuka ariko u- rangije u- ba- genda i- n- y- uma . ||| you were so afraid that they would get you for the second time but you still followed them .
ni iki ki- tumye ubwo u- ba- genda i- n- y- uma ? ||| why were you following them ?
nti- n- zi njyewe ubanza a- ri umugisha w' ima -an ku- sa . ||| i can not tell . maybe it was by god 's mercy .
kuko abo bantu ba- tu- gira -iye neza , ni abantu mu byukuri tu- ta- kunda -aga kugenderana , ||| they really helped us yet we were n't friends .
nk' uwo mugabo n- ku- bwira -aga nti @: wenda ya- ri ya- ra- byaye mushiki wanjye muri batisimu , umugore w' ... uwo mugabo pascal . ||| for example , that man i was talking about , pascal ... he was my sister 's godfather .
ariko mu by' ukuri ntabwo a- ri umuntu tu- sabana -aga bi- ha- ambaye , ku buryo ibintu ya- koze , ||| however , we were not so close to his family . we never expected him to help us the way he did .
n' abo ba- n- ri bose tu- giye tu- hungira -ho bi- ra- tangaje . a- ba- kwa -iye ku- bi- kora ni abongabo tu- ri tu- turanye ko mu by' ukuri u- bona -aga aribo dufitanye ... abo tu- kwira -an -ye ku- gira -an ubumwe ba- ri hafi . ||| surprisingly those who were supposed to help us , i mean our neighbours , those who seemed to be our relatives .
ariko abongabo ukuntu baje ku- hinduka vraiment , ||| they surely changed !
n- gira ngo n- bi- gereranya n' uko a- ri wa mu- ta- ima w' umuntu w' ubwicanyi , ba- sanzwe ba- fite mu by' ukuri ba- ka- shaka kubyorosaho , ariko mu by' ukuri ba- fite wa mu- ta- ima . ||| i would say they had always had a cruel nature , they were killers at heart and they had been pretending throughout . maybe they had been sensitized to kill for ages but they had n't got courage to put it into practice .
cyane a- ri ibintu bi- igishijwe imyaka n' imyaka , a- ra- bi- fite ariko a- ka- bura imbaraga zo ku- bi- kora . iyo ariko une fois a- bonye i- ki- mu- tera inkunga a- ka- hita a- haguruka . ||| once such a person gets someone to motivate him to killing , he hurries up into the action .
ariko na ba- ba- n- ri rero u- ta- keka -aga , ko ba- shobora ku ku- gira -ir akamaro kurenza ba- ba- n- ri , ||| the strangest thing is that the people we never expected to help us are the ones who did and those we thought would be the first ones to kill us were the ones to save us .
u- ka- bona nibo ba- ka- ku- gira -iye ngirango simbizi bi- shobora kuba bi- tera -w na kamere y' umuntu cyangwa se za n- ba- raga z' ima -an , ||| i think it just depends on someone 's nature or personality . if not so , then it is by god 's power .
nti- n- zi icyatumye ba- hinduka gutyo . ||| i can not tell why they behaved like that .
nyuma ya genocide rero wiretrouva [ wi- sanga ] u- ri umwana u- tagira papa ... ||| then after the genocide you were fatherless ...
nyuma ya genocide ubwo , n- je ku- sanga ndi kumwe n' uwo mushiki wanjye mukuru w' imfura , n' uwo wa kabiri , ||| after the genocide , i was left with my older sister ; our first @-@ born . and then i found my younger sister and brother .
na karumuna kanjye ka n- ku- ru- kira bwa kabiri . u- rebye mu by' ukuri ni n- ka- n- jya -e muhungu mukuru ubwo u- ri u- sigaye . n- fashe nka responsabilite ya famille mu by' ukuri nta ... nta n' iyo n- shobora ka- uzuza . ||| since i am currently the oldest son in the family , i took upon myself all the family responsibilities yet i can not even fulfill their needs .
ku- sa ikintu ki- je ku- n- ba -ho ni uko n- kuze imburagihe . ||| as a result , i ended up growing up prematurely .
ubu n- ra- garagara nk' aho ndi umuntu mukuru muri famille , ndi umuntu u- gomba ku- tekereza , icyo famille igo ... uko iri n- ka- umva ko a- ri jya -e i- gomba ku- reba . ||| now i am considered as an old man at home ; i am the one who makes the decisions in the family . at my early age , i feel denied my freedom .
cyane cyane n- kata -w -e ba- ki- ri bato bikatubangamiraho ko tu- tagira umwanya wo kwisanzura nk' uko ubuto bwawe u- kwa -iye kubwisanzuramo , ||| i do n't find time to enjoy life like i should have at my age ; things like playing around with fellow teenagers or do other fun things .
nk' uko u- kwa -iye ku- kina nk' abandi basore n' ibiki ... ahubwo umwanya wawe u- ka- wu- twara mu bitekerezo kenshi bi- ku- vuna , kandi u- na- reba n- tu- bi- bonera -e n' igisubizo . u- na- ki- shaka hafi a- honga -ho u- ka- bona nacyo , ba- si . ||| instead i spend my entire time worrying about things that actually seem impossible to me , problems of which solutions are not easy to find .
none se u- bona iyongiyo a- ri avantage cyangwa ni ingaruka mbi ya genocide ? ||| so , to you fis that an advantange or it is a disadvantage of the genocide ?
n' ingaruka mbi ya genocide kuko iyo n- bi- tekereje , nk' iyo ndi mu ishuri ha- ri -ho igihe n- icara , n- ka- ba n- ri -mo n- bi- tekereza , abandi ba- ri -mo ba- ra- iga . ||| they are genocide disadvantages because whenever i think about it ... for example when i am in class ; sometimes i am absent @-@ minded , busy thinking about my problems while others are concentrating .
ariko ibyongibyo iyo uwo mukuru wanjye a- za kuba -ho simba n- bi- tekereza , n- ba n- vuga nti @: ibyo bi- ri occupe niwe bi- reba , n- jya -e icyo n- reba ni u- ku- iga . ||| but if my older brother had survived , i would have relaxed a bit because he would be busy with family issues , as i also get busy with my studies .
data we nti- n- baye n- bi- reba . cyangwa se undi wu- n- ri w' umu membre de famille , ba- n- ri ba- ri bakuru , ||| not to mention if it was my father who had survived or any other older person in the family .
nti- n- baye n- bi- reba ahubwo ni n- garuka za genocide . ||| i know everything is as a result of the genocide .
kuko uwo mwanya n- taye mw' ishuri abandi ba- ba ba- ri -mo ba- ra- ku- ri- kira n- gombye kuba nywufatamo ayo masomo nti- n- rangara -e , ||| i would have been able to use my time in class effectively rather than thinking about family problems while others are studying .
bi- n- ciye -ho ibyo ku- iga bi- ra- naniye za responsabilites n- ri -mo ku- reba nti- n- za- ujuje , nta ni igisubizo cyazo n- za- bona muri iyo minsi , n' ubwonko bwanjye bu- ra- nanirwa . ||| but now i am failing to concentrate in class and in the end i will fail in school . at the same time , i can not find a solution to my problems ; i can not meet my family 's needs .
eeh ! ||| eeh !
ni ingaruka mbi za genocide zi- ba zi- garuka ku muntu . ||| those are the consequences of the genocide that are affecting me .
ntabwo zi- tuma wi- heba ? ||| do n't you get desperate at times ?
n- iheba muri iyo minota , n- ri -mo ku- bi- tekereza , ariko iyo mpuye n' urundi rungano bi- ra- shira . ||| i feel desperate but only for the time when i am thinking about my problems . but when i meet friends i forget about it .
ku- sa n- ongera ku- bi- tekereza ndi muri vacance n- reba situation familiale ukuntu i- meze , ||| and then the feeling comes back during the holidays when i am at home seeing the situation in which my family is living .
ni -ho n- iheba kurenza . kuko u- ba u- bana nabyo bu- ri munsi kandi nta na kimwe u- ri bukemure ni -ho n- iheba kabisa . ||| i get so desperate because i see everything yet i can not improve anything .
biraguhungabanya ... bi- shobora ku- tuma wenda u- rara amajoro cyangwa u- sa nk' aho u- wu- taye [ umutwe ] mo gakeya ? ||| does it disturb you to the extent of spending sleepless nights or getting headaches ?
bon , n- ra- bi- kumbura cyane ko ntabwo niga -e ... u- ra- umva ko genocide ya- baye n- fite imyaka cumi n' itandatu . imyaka cumi n' itandatu umuntu aba a- geze mu ki- ha -e , cyo ku- idagadura cyo ku- byina , cyo ku- reba imipira mbese ibintu by' imyidagaduro u- ra- bi- zi ibintu bi- shima -ish abasore . ariko kubera situation n- ri n- ri -mo ntabwo n- igeze n- bona umwanya wo ku- bi- koresha n' ubu ahondi nti- n- shobora ku- bi- bonera umwanya nti- n- na- bi- kora , kuko noneho ubu n- umva a- ri stade n- renze . a- ri u- ku- subira i- n- y- uma ahubwo n- ba n- angiza ibintu byinshi , nta n' umwanya n- bi- bonera . umuntu a- ra- wu- kumbura ariko nta ku- n- ri kuntu u- bi- genza , u- ra- vuga uti @: tu n- ra- bi- renze n- gomba kuba umugabo uko bi- genda kose . niba bi- za- garuka umuntu nyuma simbizi ( a- ra- seka ) . ||| do you ever miss your childhood ?

njyewe ikintu n- ifuza a- ha- n- i- ni , nti- n- zi niba n- ki- ita icyifuzo , nti- n- zi . ||| what i wish , i do n't if i should call it a wish .
n- jya -e reka mpere wenda ku bintu bi- n- shima -ish nk' uko wa mu- ka- ni mugenzi ya- vuga -aga . ikintu ki- n- shima -ish ki- ba -ho , ||| let me say first what makes me happy .
ni uko n- umva n- gize icyo mara -ir umu rescape [ uwacitse ku icumu ] . ||| mostly it is to know that i have done something to help a genocide survivor .
ya- ba a- ri nama n- mu- gira -iye , ya- ba ara kantu n- mu- fashije ni -yo ka- ba ara kantu kadafatika , ariko n- ka- umva ko a- ri n- jya -e u- ki- tekerereje n- ka- gira icyo mu- fasha -ish nicyo kintu cyinshimisha . ikintu rero n- umva n- ifuza , ||| it may be giving advice or helping with something .

u- ta- zi genocide u- shobora ku- vuga ko a- ri iki a- ta- zi cyangwa ikintu a- ta- menye ni iki ? ||| what would you want someone who does not know what genocide is ? what would you want them to know ?
iyo u- rebye igihe ki- shize u- ka- reba n' ubu , n' izihe changement za- baye zi- shobora ku ... cyane cyane mu buzima bwawe wowe ? ||| when comparing the past to the present , what changes have you experienced in your personal life ?
wenda kubazadukomokaho ku buzukuru bacu n' abo tu- za- byara , ||| maybe reconciliation will be possible among our descendants if we will tell them the truth and show them the right path .

u- ta- emera genocide u- mu- bwira ngo iki , nka bariya bantu ba- yi- hakana ? ||| what can you tell people who do n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ?
ba- yi- hakana ? u- ta- emera genocide muri bariya bantu ba- yi- hakana , ||| people who do n't agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
nti- n- zi bi- tera -w n' uburyo a- yi- hakana niba a- ri ukwigiza nkana cyangwa se a- ta- y- emera by' ukuri . ariko umuntu u- ta- y- emera , n- jya -e mbere yo ku- gira n- gira -e ikintu mu- bwira , ||| it depends on the context in which they deny it ; some people pretend not to know what happened , while others really do n't know what happened .
n- mu- jyana nk' ahantu za nti- arama , n- ka- mu- jyana mu bisesero ku kibuye n- ka- mu- jyana nyamata , n' ahantu ha- ri inzibutso za gikongoro . nkamwereka ayo magufwa , ||| but to those who intentionally deny the genocide , all i can do for them is to take him to places like ntarama , bisesero , nyamata and other places such as gikongoro , which have genocide memorial sites .
noneho n- ka- mu- baza nk' ikibazo kimwe nti @: aya magufwa u- reba ahangaha ; ni inkuba ya- je ikubita abantu , ||| and then after i would ask them only a single question @: "@ what do you think was the cause of their death ? was it a thunder that killed these people and brought them here ?
i- ka- ba- andarika ahangaha ? ba- ishwe n' umuyaga se ? ||| were they strong winds ?
ni umwuzure se ? abantu ba- ra- i- ishe ? ||| were they floods ? or did they commit suicide ? @"
ni ibintu bi- baye ku manywa y' ihangu , u- ka- umva ikintu a- ku- subiza . ||| then i would wait to hear their answer .
ibyo aribyo byose ntabwo ... n- ra- umva a- tabona igisubizo a- ku- subiza a- honga -ho cyane cyane nk' umunyarwanda . nti- ya- bona igisubizo a- ku- subiza . ||| they would n't get any answer especially when they are rwandans .
nk' umunyamahanga ibyo aribyo byose nabo ni abantu , ya- reba a- kumira -w ku- sa . ||| but if it is a foreigner , i guess he would be surprised and just keep quiet .
nk' umuntu u- ki- ri mutoya , inzibutso zi- mu- bwiye iki ? ||| to someone who is still young , what do genocide memorial sites mean ?
inzibutso ni nziza cyane kuko ni urugero rumwe tu- shinga -iye -ho , ||| memorial sites are very good .
rwo ku- ta- za- ibagirwa ibintu bi- baye mu rwanda . u- n- bajije ikibazo mu kanya uti @: "@ nk' umuntu u- ta- emera genocide wamubwir' iki ? @"@ ||| because they are basics for our history . they will help us never forget what took place in rwanda . you have just asked me the question " what can you tell a person who does n't agree that genocide happened in rwanda ? @"
n- ku- bwira ko n- mu- jyana kuri izi nzibutso n- ka- mu- baza niba aya magufa ya- ri ... abo bantu ba- ra- i- ishe , cyangwa se a- ri umutako u- ri a- honga -ho . ||| i guess you heard that the answer was based on the memorial sites ; i told you that i would take such people to the memorial sites and ask them if those people committed suicide or if the bones are for decoration .
ariko urwo rwubitso ru- ri a- honga -ho no mu myaka n' imyaka , ru- za- ba ru- ki- ha- ri . ni ibintu tu- za- jya tu- igisha abana bacu , ni ibintu tu- za- korera visite a- ri abantu ba- iga amateka a- ri abantu ba- gize ku- ta -e ? ||| these memorial sites will be there for years and years .
u- ka- za- genda u- ka- reba u- ka- vuga uti @: imyaka n' iyingiyi no mu ki- ha -e ki- za- za , uru ni urugero rumwe ku bantu ba- hakana genocide , u- ba- ereka ko genocide ya- baye mu rwanda . ||| our children will see them ; historians all over the world can come for their research and see what happened .
urwibutso rero n- umva icyo ru- n- bwiye ni ukutibagirwa n' umunsi na gato genocide . kuri njyewe nk' urubyiruko ariko ku bw' umwihariko nk' umuntu w' umurescape , ni ukutibagirwa , bu- ri ki- ha -e . ||| therefore , memorial sites to me as part of the young generation , especially as a genocide survivor , are there to remind us and make us never forget what happened .
u- sa nk' aho u- rwanya ko genocide i- zi- ba- gira -an . ||| it seems like you are fighting against forgetting about the genocide .
ariko se ku- ibagirwa kuri wowe bi- vuze iki ? ||| what would "@ forgetting @" mean to you ?
kuki u- bi- rwanya cyane ? ||| why are you really against forgetting ?
ku- ibagirwa ikintu bi- shatse ku- vuga , ni u- ku- vuga iyo wibagiwe ikintu , cyane cyane ikintu kibi cya @- ku- baye -ho , ni u- ku- vuga ko nta gaciro u- ki- haye . niba n- ibagiwe n- pfushije data , n- pfushije bakuru banjye , n- pfushije abavandimwe n- pfusha ... , u rwanda ru- cura imiborogo abantu ba- ra- pfa ba- ra- shira . wibagiwe ibyo bintu u- ka- bi- hanagura kandi u- reba noneho u- sigaye wenyine , n- tu- gira hepfo n- tu- gira ruguru . nti- n- zi ukuntu ... n- ki- ta cya cyaha ba- ita sakirirego rwose . ||| listen ... what it means to me , when you forget things especially bad things that happened to you , it means that what happened meant nothing to you . if you can forget your father 's death , your mother 's death , and your relative 's death , deaths that caused agony to the whole country [ rwanda ] , and rub out all your beloved ones from your brain yet you were left alone in this world , without anyone to talk to or to run to , to me that would be an unforgivable sin .

iyo mpageze ... nti- n- zi ! mpita mpinduka ku buryo muri uwo mwanya simba n- ki- ri umuntu , ||| whenever i pass there , i change a bit and behave differently . i feel strange . it is as though i loose my humanity .

ariko n- ba n- umva nta n' umuntu wa n- vuga -ish . ||| i do n't feel like talking to anyone .

naho iyo u- tekereje kuri ... uriya mu- gora -e wa mukuru wawe ? ||| and what do you think about the other lady ; your cousin 's wife ?

u- ba -w mbere n- yi- tanze tu- ri tu- ri -mo ... ha- ri ahantu mu bi- ima -an tu- cukuye amagufa ; ||| the first time it was at byimana where we were exhuming remainings of people .
ahantu ba- roshye abantu benshi cyane aho tu- koze urwibutso rwo mu ka- rera -e kose . ||| many people were killed in that area and now we constructed a memorial site there on the behalf of the district .
uwo munsi tu- jya ku- ba- hamba nibwo n- tanze temoignage , ||| i gave out my testimony the day we reburied them .
ubu n' u- ba -w kabiri n- ongeye ku- yi- tanga . ||| this is the second time .
u- ba -w mbere u- yi- tanga nta kintu kibi wumvise ? ||| the first time you gave a testimony , did n't you feel anything ?
nk' ubungubu iyo u- bi- vuze wu- n- va u- meze u- ta -e ? ||| how do you feel now as you talk about it ?
ka- ereka umurescape wenyine niwe tu- bi- sangira kabisa , n- ta- wu- n- ri muntu n- shobora ku- bi- bwira . ||| maybe a fellow survivor ; it is the only person we share the same problems but i can not tell it to any other person . and it can only happen when we talk and find ourselves with common challenges .
nawe tu- ganiriye tu- ka- ka- huza urugwiro cyane cyane nk' abantu bo muri aerg , nibo tu- icara nk' ahantu hamwe tu- tangira ku- ka- ganira , cyane nk' umuntu w' inshuti . ||| for example the members of aerg ; we sit with them and talk like friends .
nka freddy uriya ya- na- bi- ku- bwira tu- ki- mara ku- bona -an , iyo mwicaye mu ka- ganira , u- ra- vuga wisanzuye kabisa u- ka- bona u- ri muri famille . ||| freddy can testify this .
ariko ku wu- n- ri muntu simfe n' uwakoze ... itsembabwoko , ||| the first time we met ... we talked and we were free as though we were from the same family .
n' undi n- umva tudahuje imyumvire bi- ra- goye kugirango n- jya -e ku- bi- mu- bwira kabisa . ||| but telling it to other people or to those who committed the genocide seems too hard for me .
abanyamahanga cyangwa n' abanyarwanda , ba- ba abubu cyangwa abo mu ki- ha -e ki- za- za . ni iyihe message [ ubutumwa ] u- shobora ka- ubaha ? ||| what message can you give to the foreigners or rwandans of today or in the future ?
message n- ba- ha , ||| the message i can give them ... i would like to give a message to especially rwandans who do n't know rwanda .
u- sibye ko iyo message yanjye akenshi n- umva n- yi- ha abantu cyane cyane b' abanyamahanga ba- ta- zi u rwanda , kuko umunyarwanda we ku- mu- bwira genocide , ||| because telling a rwandan about genocide is not very difficult .
nti- n- umva ko u- vunika cyane u- bi- mu- bwira n' aho ya- bi- irengagiza ibyo a- ri byo byose a- ra- bi- zi . ||| although they ignore it [ genocide ] , they know about it .
ariko nk' umunyamahanga message n- mu- ha u- zi yuko akenshi nk' abazungu ba- kunda ku- fata ibintu a la legele [ kubyoroshya ] nti- ba- bi- fata -e uko bi- gomba kuba . ||| but foreigners especially white people take things lightly .
nyamara mu by' ukuri ba- fite ... ba- hishe ukuri ... ba- ra- bi- bona -aga , ba- ri ba- fite amacamera . ||| they do n't consider this the way they are . but in actual sense , they shy away from the truth .
ha- ri -mo n' a- ba- bi- gize -mo uruhare nk' ababiligi n' abandi na bariya basirikare ba nations unies ( un ) ni minoir ha- rya ? ba- fite information [ amakuru ] zose . ||| because they had cameras and some of them participated in the genocide . for example the belgians and those un soldiers of unamir together with others , they had all the information .
ikintu n- ba- bwira ni uko iyo tu- vuga ibi ntabwo a- ri imyidagaduro tu- ba tu- ri -mo . ||| all i can tell them is ; when we say this , it is not a form of enjoying life .
iyo tu- vuga ibi , ||| when we say this ... consider the time i have spent here !
reba umwanya n- taye aha n- ka- ha . n- ra- iga n- gombye kuba ndi mu ishuri kimwe n' abandi , ariko n- igomwe uyu mwanya kuza ku- vuga ibingibi n- gombye kuba maze ku- fata chapitre runaka n- zi- soma . ||| i am a student , i am surposed to be in class now with other students . i had to spend my time here instead of learning extra chapters in class !
ariko n- umva ko a- ri ikintu ki- n- gomba -w n- gomba kuza n- ka- tanga nka temoignage i- za- bona abantu ku isi hose abantu benshi , cyane cyane abanyamahanga . ||| i know it is very important to give out my testimony so that the whole world especially the foreigners would see it .
ikintu n- bona rero ni uko genocide ya- baye mu rwanda ba- gomba ku- yi- ha agaciro . ||| i think the genocide that took place in rwanda should be given its value .
n' ubwo ntacyo ba- tu- mara -ir nk' abanyarwanda , ariko ba- ka- menya ngo genocide ya- ra- baye , ba- ka- yi- ha agaciro i- gomba ku- gira . ||| although there is nothing they can do to help us as rwandans , they should just believe that there was genocide in rwanda and give it its value .
iyo tu- irirwa tu- bi- vuga ntabwo tu- bi- vuga ku- gira ngo tu- bi- curuza -e . ||| when we spend days talking about the genocide , we do n't say it for sale .
kagame yi- geze ku- bi- vuga ati @: "@ nk' a- ba- vuga ko tu- curuza genocide uwamubaza ko ikiro ... litiro y' amaraso i- gura angahe ? @" ||| president paul kagame once talked about it . he said ; " those who say that we sell genocide , i wish they tell me how much is a kilogram or a litter of blood . @"
ku bwawe ku- ibuka no ka- ubaha genocide wu- n- va a- ri a- ka- ha -e kamaro bi- fite ? ni iki cyane cyane u- ta- shaka ko ba- ku- ibagirwa ? ||| to you , what 's the importance of remembering and giving value to genocide ? what would you wish to be remembered forever ?
icyo n- ta- shaka ko ba- ku- ibagirwa n' iyo n- baga y' abanyarwanda ya- pfuye i- zira a- ka- renga -an -e . ||| what i wish to be remembered is the massive innocent people that were killed .
ba- gombye kuba ubu ba- korera igihugu , igihugu cyacu ki- ka- tera i- n- bera -e kimwe n' ibindi byose . ku- y- ibagirwa rero n- umva a- ri amakosa a- komeye cyane . ||| now they would be helping the counntry and our country would develop like other countries .
kandi iyo u- y- ibagiwe , u- ba u- fashe na bi- bi- n- ri tu- vuga by' uburenganzira bw' ikiramwamuntu ntacyo bi- ba bi- maze . ||| therefore , forgeting the genocide is a big mistake . once you forget the genocide it seems like you do n't value human rights .
kuko uzubahiriza uburenganzira se ku- ta -e bw' umuntu , u- ta- n- emera ko a- ri umuntu . ||| because you can never obey human rights yet you do n't accept so and so as a human being .
ku- ta- y- ibagirwa rero ni ukudafata abantu nk' inyamaswa . u- ka- ba- ha agaciro ba- fite nk' abantu . eh , ||| therefore , considering genocide means considering people as human beings and not animals . and respecting people as human beings .
ni icyo kintu n- umva n- vuga . ||| that is all i can say .
ha- ri icyo u- shaka ka- ongera -ho ? ||| do you want to add on anything ?
n- ra- bona ha- sigaye iminota makumyabiri n' itandatu . ||| we still have twenty @-@ six minutes extra .
ikindi n- ka- ongera -ho , wenda tu- renze ibyo ngibyo byo ka- ubaha temoignage abantu ba- ta- zi iki gihugu , ku- ha temoignage abantu ba- hakana genocide . ||| the additional information i have is for those who do n't know this country , a testimony to people who do n't acknowledge that there was genocide in rwanda .
jya -e n- ka- ongera -ho n- ki- garuka -ir kuri cadre y' abarescape , cyane cyane n- bwira urubyiruko , kuko abakecuru abasaza ba- rokotse bacu , bo ku- gira ngo u- za- na- mu- bwira -e ibingibi , ||| what i can add on , i would first go back to the case of the survivors especially the youth because the old ones are too miserable to listen to this .
ba- ra- ihebye ku buryo bu- renze . ki- koze abantu ba- ki- ri batoya , cyane cyane b' aba rescapes , n- ba- ha temoignage n- gira nti @: ||| but young people especially the survivors i would give them my testimony saying that , "@ they should never despair . @"
nti- ba- ki- heba -e . ibyabaye bi- ra- baye simbivuga nka kwa ku- n- ri , ||| we can not change the past .
ngo @: " tu- bi- ibagirwa -e , ngo tu- iyunga -e . @" ||| i am not saying that we forget and reconciliate .
ariko ntabwo tu- shobora ku- hera -an -w n' ibyabaye . ||| but we should not be taken up by out past .
bi- ta- vuze ko tu- gomba ku- ibagirwa genocide . ahubwo genocide tuka @- yi- tekereza -ho , ikaduh' ingufu . ||| but it does n't mean that we should forget the genocide , instead we should always think about it because it makes us strong .
ku- ta- ibagirwa bikaduh' ingufu yo ku- rwanya ikintu cyose ki- za- tuma genocide y- ongera kuba mu gihugu cyacu . ||| remembering gives us power to fight against any other thing that would ever cause another genocide in rwanda .

imyaka ? ||| my age ... ?
n- vutse muri mirongo itanu na kane [ 1954 ] . ||| i was born in 1954 .
ubwo amateka ya mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] n- ri mutoya . ariko n- ri n- fite ngo nk' imyaka ine ngirango , n- ra- umva bikeya n- ki- bi- ibuka -ho bike . ||| well about the history of 1954 , i was still young , i was about four years old . i think i can only remember few things like when my family and i were migrating .
kuko n- ibuka iwacu tu- hunga . ibyo n- vuga -ho cyane n- zi , ni ibyo muri za mirongo itandatu na rimwe ... na gatatu ... gutyo . ||| but what i remember is the war that took place in the 1961 ... 1963 in the range of that time .
nabwo tu- ra- hunze , ba- rya inka z' iwacu , ubwo icyo ki- ha -e ni abahutu bi- ca -aga abatutsi , ba- na- ba- twikira ba- rya n' inka zabo . ||| even then we migrated while they were seizing and eating our cattle , burning our houses and still it was the hutus killing the tutsis .
ibindi rero na none n- zi , ||| they demolished the tutsi 's houses .
cyane ho n- ri mukuru n- zi ubwenge , n- ri inkumi , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] . muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] , ||| then other things that i remember well are the events of 1973 because then i was a wench .
na none ni abahutu bi- ca -aga abatutsi . ||| still it was the hutu killing the tutsi .
ba- ra- ba- senya -ir ba- ra- bi- ca , ||| they demolished tutsi 's houses and killed them .
bamwe ba- ra- hunga , ||| some tutsis fled .
icyo ki- ha -e tu- na- hungiye muri kiliziya yo ku kamonyi , i ki- ta- arama , mu ka- rera -e ka kamonyi . ubwo tu- ra- hunga , ||| that time we fled to kamonyi church in gitarama [ in kamonyi district ] .
ba- ra- tu- senya -ir tu- ra- ongera ... ba- ra- vuga bati @: "@ intambara ni i- hosha -e , ||| then they [ hutus ] said that the war should stop .
tu- ra- ongera tu- subira mu matongo , tu- ra- ubaka tu- rasa -an . @" ||| therefore , we went back to our stumbles and reconstructed the houses .
ubwo tu- ba aho , muri mirongo irindwi ubwo na gatatu . ||| then we stayed there ... that was in 1973 .
bi- ra- komeza nti- bi- ba byiza . na none abahutu ba- komeza gusarika abatutsi . bi- gera muri za mirongo inani ... inani n' umunani [ 1980 @-@ 1988 ] , ||| the situation never improved , the hutus continued to mistreat the tutsis .
nibwo hirya no hino ba- genda -aga nka za bu- gesa -ir ; za ki- bi- rira ; ba- komeza ku- genda mbese abahutu ba- komeza ku- toteza abatutsi . ariko bi- geze muri mirongo cyenda [ 1990 ] , ||| untill that period between 1980 and 1988 when tutsis were menaced so much by the hutus in areas like bugesera and kibirira .
inkotanyi zi- teye , na none abatutsi ba- ra- icwa . ba- ra- toteza -w , ba- ra- fungwa mu byitso , ||| generally , the hutus continued to torture the tutsis .
abandi ba- ra- icwa ba- ra- twika . za ki- bi- rira aho , za bu- gesa -ir , hariya mu bagogwe , ||| then in 1990 when the ikontanyi [ rpf army ] invaded the country , tutsis were subjected to serious torture ; they were killed , imprisoned accused of being traitors , others were killed , houses were burnt in all those areas of kibirira , bugesera and in the bagogwe in ruhengeri .
mu ruhengeri . bi- ra- komeza bi- geze muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] noneho , aribwo habyarimana indege ye ya- hanuka -aga a- vuye tanzaniya , ||| this continued up to 1994 when habyarima 's airplane crashed on its way from tanzania .
ba- hise bi- ca abatutsi ba- ra- ba- tsemba . kuko ba- vuga -aga ngo @: "@ abatutsi nibo ba- ishe habyarimana , ngo none ni ba- bi- tura -e ba- bi- ca -e . @" ||| then they started killing the tutsis with all their effort saying that tutsis were responsible for habyarima 's death . "@ therefore , they [ tutsis ] have to pay for it , " they said .
ba- fatanya n' abasirikare ba- ri -ho icyo ki- ha -e , ba- fatanya n' interahamwe za- toza -w -aga ... za- ri zaratojwe kera , ba- ba ... bamwe babatorezaga mu bu- gesa -ir , abandi mu mutara , ||| with the help of soldiers together with the interahamwe who had been given enough training in bugesera and mutara , they were trained posible methods of killing people .
baratojwe ibintu byo ku- ica ku- sa . ubwo ha- pfa -aga abatutsi , ba- ra- icwa ni abatutsi ba- icwa -aga . ||| then tutsis died , they were killed ... these were the tutsis being killed .
ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi . ||| and it was one clan killing the other .
ni ubwoko bwicaga ubundi , ntabwo a- ri u- ku- vuga ngo ni runaka u- nganye na runaka nk' abaturanyi , ni ubwoko ku- sa bu- ta- ota -ije -w , ||| it was a clan killing the other clan , it was n't like , ‘ a person had a grage with a fellow , ’ it was a certain clan that had been trained to kill the other clan .
ha- icwa ubwoko bumwe . ||| therefore , one clan died .
ba- ra- bi- ca pe ! ba- bi- ca urugaraguro . ba- bi- ca nabi @: ||| and , they really killed them ; they killed them so painfuly with a lot of torture .
abo ba- ta mu nzuzi ; abo ba- ta mu misarane ; abo ba- ta mu myobo ; ||| some were drowned in rivers and lakes ; others were thrown in latrines or pits .
ku- geza igihe inkotanyi zi- fata -iye iki gihugu ba- hosha iyo nti- ambara ... ba- hosha ubwo bwicanyi . ||| until when the inkotanyi liberated this country and ceased the war and the killings .
ubwicanyi ba- maze ku- bu- hosha , ba- shyira -ho ko , a- ba- koze ubwo bwicanyi ba- ba- fata ... ba- fata -w ba- ka- fungwa . ||| and later they set up a law of arresting those who perticipated in the killings .
ba- ra- ba- funga tu- ra- ba- vuga abantu ba- ishe ... ba- ishe tu- reba , ||| they were arrested ... those ones that we would see , we would report them .
ariko ikintu cya mbere na mbere umuntu y- ifuza , y- ifuza ko haba -ho ku- hana by' intangarugero , umuntu wishe undi . ||| but our primary desire is to see people being purnished accordingly .
umuco wo ku- ta- hana ukaranduka . kuko icyo ki- ha -e ku bwa habyarimana , ntabwo umuntu yi- ca -aga undi ngo a- bi- hana -ir -w -e . nta muhutu wicaga umututsi ngo a- bi- hana -ir -w -e . ||| a killer ... the culture of not punishing should be abolished completely . because during habyarimana 's regime no body would be punished over killing someone . a hutu would not be punished for killing a tutsi .
yemwe no ku- fungwa nti- ya- fungwa -aga . ||| neither would he be imprisoned .
kuko ya- ri gahunda yateguwe kera , ba- ri ba- yi- zi . ||| it was an earlier planned program and they all knew all about it .
n' ibyo ba- koze , ba- koze ibyo ba- ri basanganywe , si ibyo bi- giye -ho . ||| all they did , they were prepared for it [ genocide ] , it was not a sudden event .
ikintu cya mbere n- bona kiza rero , ni umuco wo ku- hana . ||| the most important thing is to set up a culture of punishing those who harassed others ... those who killed others .
ba- ka- hana uwibasiye undi ba- ka- hana umuntu wishe undi by' intangarugero , kandi kumugaragaro . n' abandi ba- ka- bonera -ho . ||| they should be punished accordingly and in public for others to see and learn a lesson .
ikindi rero kiza ni uko aya mateka , y' ubu bwicanyi bw' abatutsi ba- ishwe ba- hora -w ubusa ... b' inzirakarengane . n- umva ko bi- gomba ... nako sijye jyenyine , ni tu- esa -e . ||| and another important thing is ; this history of the killings of the innocent tutsis , who died for no reason , should never perish .
bitasibangana , bi- ta- kwa -iye kwibagirana , ||| not only my testimony but also everyone 's . it [ history ] should never be forgotten .
tu- kwa -iye ku- hora tu- bi- ibuka , ||| we should always remember it .
kandi bi- ka- andika -w no mu bitabo . n' abana ... ab' abana bacu ba- za- byara ba- ka- za- kura ba- zi ... ba- ka- vuka ba ... ibyo bitabo bi- ha- ri ba- bi- soma , ba- menya icyabaye , bitibagiranye . ||| it must be written in books so that our grand children will be able to read and know what happened .
ba- ka- menya icyabiteye icyo ki- ha -e , ba- ka- menya abantu bi- ca -aga abandi , ba- ka- menya ko abahutu ba- ishe abatutsi icyo ki- ha -e . ||| they should know the cause , who killed who ... they should know that the hutus killed the tutsis that time .
ariko ba- ka- hana ba bantu , by' intangarugero . ||| but they should punish those people accordingly so that the culture of not punishing stops .
ku buryo umuco wo ku- ica ... wo ku- i- cana u- cika . ||| that way , the habit of killing one another will stop .
n' u- tekereza ku- ica , a- ka- bi- tinya kubera ko a- zi ko ya- bi- hana -ir -w . ||| even that one who had a thought of killing would stop because he or she knows she would be purnished for it .
n- umva -aga ha- ri utubazo dukeya n- umva n- ku- baza , kugirango tu- komeza -e tu- sobanukirwa -e n' ibyabaye . ||| i would like to ask you some few questions in order for us to fully understand what happened .
u- tu- bwiye ko muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] u- ri u- ri -ho , ariko u- ri u- ki- ri mutoya . ||| you told us that in 1959 you already existed but you were still young .
ariko ... u- tu- sobanura -ir niba ha- ri utwo wibuka muri makeya @: uko ba- tera -aga , uko iwanyu bi- ri bi- meze , ||| but you can tell us the little you remember about the way they attacked how it was in your area , how you fled or what happened to you .
uko se mbese mwahunze . cyangwa se uko bi- genze ku- ta -e ... u- tu- nyura -ir -mo muri makeya uko bi- genze icyo ki- ha -e ? ||| just tell us in breif what happened during that time .
umh , tu- ra- hunze . ||| we fled .
n- ra- bi- ibuka n- ri mutoya muri mirongo itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] . ||| i remember that in 1963 i was very young .
tu- ra- hunze ba- teye iwacu ba- ra- twika , ||| we fled after they attacked our home and burnt our houses .
tu- hungira nko ku musozi wo hakurya , ha- ri ishyamba . ||| we fled to a certain hill , which was a bushy .
kubera ko ha- ri inka nyinshi tu- hunga -an n' inka . ||| we had a lot of cattle ; therefore we migrated with them .
ariko ba- ra- tu- senya -ir . ||| however they demolished our houses though .
mwavuye ku musozi mwari mu- tuye -ho witwa ... ? ||| what was the name of that hill where you were living before migrating ?
eh , a- honga -ho tu- ri tu- tuye ku musozi witwa ... hitwa i- ka- ibanda , ||| eh ... we were living on a hill called ikibanda .
tu- jya ahandi hantu hirya y' i- ki- na- zi , ||| we left that place and went to some place beyond kinazi .
ahantu ha- ri ishyamba ba- ita -aga inyabusunzu . icyo ki- ha -e abatutsi benshi ba- ra- ha- korana -iye , kuko ba- giye ku- twika ba- twikira rimwe . ||| there was a forest called nyabusunzu . that time many tutsis gathered there because most of their houses were burnt at the same time .
n' inka zabo n' abana . ||| they met there with their cows and their children .
bamwe ba- hita ba- genda ba- jya iyo za bu- gesa -ir abandi baza ba- na- za hano za sainte @-@ famille hariya . ||| some people [ tutsi ] went to bugesera and others went to sainte @- famille church .
burya kiliziya nta ki- ha -e abantu ba- ta- yi- hungiye -mo . uretse muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , nibwo ba- yi- hungiye -mo ba- na- y- ira -w -mo . ||| in the past , people had been running to church on several occasions unlike in 1994 when people ran there and died from there .
ubwo icyo ki- ha -e nabwo bi- ra- baye bi- komeza bityo ; ba- tera abantu ba- ka- rya inka , abandi ba- ki- ca ba- ka- kubita amahiri ... abantu ba- ra- na- pfuye , abandi ba- jya mu mahanga . ||| even that time same thing happened and continued like that ; they attacked and killed , hit tutsis with club , some people died , and others fled to exile .
ariko bariya ba- giye mu mahanga , ntabwo ba- giye ba- giye ku bu- n- ri buryo , ni ku buryo bwo ku- hunga abahutu ba- ri babamenesheje mu gihugu . ||| there was no other reason why people [ tutsis ] went to exile ; they were fleeing from the hutus , who were menacing them with in the country .
nta ki- ha -e umuhutu a- ta- toteje umututsi . ku- va muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ku- geza ejo bu- n- ri muri mirongo cyenda na kane [ 1994 ] , ||| there is no time when a hutu stopped torturing a tutsi ever since 1959 up to 1994 .
ni abahutu bi- ca -aga abatutsi . ||| it was always the hutu killing the tutsi .
ha- ri abo u- zi ba- ishwe , u- ba u- zi amazina wenda u- ka- vuga uti kanaka ya- ra- twika -iye -w baramwica ... ||| do you know by names , anyone who was killed ? for example you can tell us that ; so and so , their houses were demolished and later they were killed ...
eh iwacu ? ||| in our family ... ?
... icyo ki- ha -e muri mirongo itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] ? ||| are you talking about the time in 1959 ?
itanu n' icyenda [ 1959 ] .... itandatu na gatatu [ 1963 ] ku- geza aho . ||| yes between 1959 and 1963 , within that range ...
eh , ha- ri abasaza ... ha- ri abasaza , ba- ra- pfuye abo ba- saza , ||| yes , some old men died .
ariko abandi ba- giye mu mahanga ba- na- gwa -yo . ha- ri -mo na mu- saza wanjye u- guye muri tanzaniya . ||| though some went to exile and died there ; my brother died from tanzania .

ariko nyuma abana be n' umugore baje kuza , ya- ri a- fite abana batatu . abana be umwe yanagu ... banamwiciye hano ku mu- mena muri jenoside . ||| and later , his wife and children came back ; they were three children and one of them was killed during the genocide from a place called mumena .
ba- giye ba- pfa benshi ba- ra- pfuye , ba- ra- ba- ishe ba- ra- pfa . ||| several people died ; they were killed .
ni uko aba a- ri na kera umuntu ahari aba a- ta- bi- ibuka cyane . yee , ||| and since it was long time ago , somethings are hard to recall them well .
ariko ba- ra- pfuye . ||| but people died a lot .
ubwo mu- jya kuri uwo musozi mwagarutse mu rugo ? ||| when you ran to that hill , did you return home ?
eeh , muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] rero , ubwo ha- ri ha- ki- ri -ho ka- y- ibanda . ||| well in 1973 , it was kayibanda still on power .
habyarimana ya- ri umusirikare mukuru . noneho n- ra- bi- ibuka ha- ri muri mirongo irinda -w na gatatu mu kwezi kwa kabiri , kuri makumyabiri n' umunani [ 28 /02 / 1973 ] , nibwo bi- tangiye iwacu . ||| habyarimana was chief commander . i remember it was on the 28th feb 1973 , when they attacked our home village .
ba- ra- senya ; ba- ra- twika ; bi- ca abantu benshi . ||| they burnt and killed many people .
ba- ra- ba- ishe benshi cyanee icyo ki- ha -e ... ha- ri ni ... ha- ri muramu wanjye icyo ki- ha -e iduka rye ba- ra- ri- senya -e , ||| that time they killed so many people . i had a brother @-@ in @-@ law whose shop was destroyed .
ba- cika -ir mw' ishyamba , ||| he escaped through a bush .
ba- ra- mu- shaka ba- ra- mu- bura , ||| they tried to look for him but they never got him .
ariko bamusenyeye . ||| but his shop was already distroyed .
ubwongubwo tu- ra- na- je tu- ra- hunga tuza hano i kigali , hariya mu biryogo . ||| that time we fled and came to kigali in biryogo .
tu- ha- geze tu- ha- maze ... nta mezi abiri ... nta kwezi ku- shize . ||| we spent there less that a month 's time .
ba- kora umukwabu wo ku- tu- jyana i bu- gesa -ir , i maranyundo . ||| then they made a patrol of capturing all the tutsis and take them to bugesera in maranyundo .
ngirango ahari u- jya wu- n- va ba- bi- vuga . n- n- jya -e n- funga -iye -w i maranyundo . ||| i guess you have ever heard about it ... i am among the people who were imprisoned in maranyundo .
icyo ki- ha -e ba- koze umukwabu ba- ra- tu- twara , ariko nabwo a- ri mu buryo bwo ku- shaka abatutsi , ||| even that time they made a patrol but it was just for getting the tutsis .
kuko tu- rangije ku- bi- bona tu- geze i bu- gesa -ir . ||| we realised it when we were in bugesera .
ba- ra- je ubwo ba- ra- tu- tunze ba- tu- jyana i bu- gesa -ir , i maranyundo mu ishyamba , ba- tu- jyanye mu bikamyo , ||| they came and transported us to bugesera in maranyundo in the bush .
mu mabisi na ziriya modokari ... nka biriya bikamyo binini bi- n- jya -aga ku- zana amayoga za gisenyi , icyo ki- ha -e ba- ra- zi- fashe , baradutunda . ||| they used trucks , min buses , and those big cars that transport beers from gisenyi [ from bralirwa ] .
ba- tu- shyira -aga hariya kuri gereza ya mu- ha- ima ba- hita -aga komisaliya [ commissariat ] , ha- ri kuri komisaliya icyo ki- ha -e . ||| therefore they gathered us there in t he muhima prison . by then it was a police . it used to be called commissariat .
tu- ki- ri a- honga -ho ... nyuma ariko u- je ku- geza -ho u- ra- shaka ... ? ||| while still there ... meanwhile , you reached at some point and got married ... ?
yee , nyuma n- ra- shatse ha- ri muri mirongo irindwi na gatatu [ 1973 ] icyo ki- ha -e ... n- shatse muri mirongo irindwi na kane [ 1974 ] . ||| yes , that was in 1973 . i got married in 1974 .
noneho u- gize amahirwe yo ku- gira abana ? ||| so you had a chance of getting children ?
yee , ariko umwe ya- ra- pfuye , na se . ||| yes , but one died and the father .
noneho mu ki- ha -e cy' amashyaka se u- tu- nyura -ir -mo uko bi- genze k' umwihariko w' iwanyu uko ... niba bi- ra- ba- geze -ho ku- ba- toteza ... ||| would you tell us briefly what happened in the period of party @-@ struggles , was your family tortured ?
igihe cy' amashyaka a- ya- n- gaya ya habyarimana ? ||| during habyarimana 's party @-@ struggles ... ?
ha- ri cdr , ||| there was cdr , mrnd there was also another party , which was suppressed or discriminated against , because they considered it to be a tutsi 's party .
ha- ri mrnd , ||| this party was called pl .
ha- ri ... na ... ha- ri -mo n' i- ri- n- ri shyaka ri- toteza -w -aga naryo kuko ryari iry' abatutsi ... ba- vuga -aga ko a- ri iry' abatutsi nka plariko rero amashyaka ya- ri a- kaza -e cyane ya- ri a- na- komeye mu gihugu ni cdr na mrnd . ||| but the strongest and powerful parties in the country were cdr and mrnd .
twaratotejwe cyane , ||| we were oppressed and tortured very much .
twaratotejwe iwacu mu rugo , bu- cya -an ya- pfuye ba- ra- tu- teye . ba- ra- tu- teye umugabo wanjye ba- ra- mu- kubita , ||| after bucyana death , we were attacked and my husband was beaten .
ba- genda ba- zi ko ya- pfuye . ||| they left knowing that he was died .
ba- ra- tu- sahura , yemwe tu- ri tu- tuye hariya haruguru yo kwa kabuga ba- ra- ha- tu- mena -ish . tu- ka- jya tu- genda turaraguzwa nk' i ... nk' a- ba- tagira iyo ba- jya . ||| they robbed us ... by then we were living over there , near kabuga 's building .
ubwo bi- hereye aho ba- ra- tu- toteza aho tu- tuye ba- ka- tu- toteza , ||| but we were thrown out of our house and we started sleeping around like we did have where we belonged .
kubera ariya mashyaka . ||| that was the beging of those tortures ; just from those parties .
iyo cdr ya- baga ya- koze imyigaragambyo , abantu ba- ka- pfa ba- ka- kubita -w , yemwe bakanabica . ||| for example whenever cdr would strike , people would be beaten ... i am telling you , people would die .
ba- ri ba- fite n' amagrenade , ||| they used to have grenades .
ba- reba -aga ahantu nka nk' aka boutike ka- nywa -ir -aga -mo abatutsi , ||| therefore , they would throw grenades to places like shops where several tutsis would attend or drink beers .
ha- ri umugabo u- ri u- ri hariya ku mu- ha- ima ba- ita -aga kamanda , ya- ri a- fite boutique . ||| for example there was a certain man , who lived in muhima and owned a boutique .
boutique ya kamanda rero ya- kunda -aga kunywebwamo n' abantu kuko bo bi- ri n- gomba -w ku- gira ngo abe a- ri -ho ba- nywa -ir , iyo u- nywa -ir -aga muri ako ka- ba- ri ka cdr nti- u- ha- va -aga u- ta- ku- ba- iswe . ||| therefore , people were obliged to drink from kamanda 's boutique because if they went to cdr 's bars they would not get out still alive .
n- ta -w -e b' abagore iyo u- jya -aga ku- gura -mo isukari , ||| even if it were women like us , we would be so careful to buy something like sugar from there .
muri boutique u- sitara ku muntu gato u- ka- kubita -w . ||| because if you accidentaly stepped on somebody you would be beaten .
ubwo rero u- ra- umva ko uwo mugabo kamanda nawe ba- ra- mu- toteje baranamwishe ejo bu- n- ri . ||| even kamanda was one of the people who were being menaced . infact he was killed just of recent .
nti- ya- ri n' umugabo , ya- ri umuntu w' umusore ya- ri a- ta- ra- na- shaka . ||| he was a young man not very mature ; he was n't even married .
ubwo ba- ra- toteza nta ki- ha -e ba- ta- toteje , ni birebire . ||| generally they menaced people ... there is no single day when they stopped menacing people ; it is a long story .
ubwo cdr nk' a- honga -ho kwa kamanda ba- ha- kubise grenade . ||| therefore , kamanda 's shop was crached with a grunade by the cdr members .
iyo ba- baga ba- koze imyigaragambyo @: bi- ca -aga abantu ; ||| whenever they would strike , they would kill people ; they would burn places with grunades .
ku- fata amagrenade ba- ka- tera ... biti ihi se , ba- ka- tega -ir mu mayira ; ba- ka- ku- tera ibyuma ; ||| never the less they would ambush people on roads . they would stub people with bayonets .
ba- aka ... ubwo cdr ya- ri ishyaka ryo kwa ... rya habyarimana , nairyo shyaka naryo ryari ri- meze nka parmet hutu uko ya- ri i- meze mbere . ya- ri iye . amashyaka nabwo icyo ki- ha -e ... iryo shyaka naryo ryari ri- meze nka parmehutu uko ya- ri i- meze mbere . ||| cdr was habyarimana 's political party , it was simillar to parmehutu of the past .
ubwo baza iwanyu ... ? ||| and finally they came to your home ... ?
ubwo n- komeje ntya , n- ra- zamuka nyura iyo mu gakinjiro , n- shoreye abana . ||| therefore , i took off throught the gakingiro road with my children .
ha- ri mu- ra- mu- ka- zi wanjye ya- ri a- ri iwacu ubwo n' abana , nawe igitero ki- tu- teye ya- ra- simbutse a- jya ahantu munsi yacu , ||| i had a sister @-@ in @-@ law , she was at home with the kids ; the first time they attacked us , she jumped over and hid slightly below our home .
umudamu waho a- mu- shyira munsi y' igitanda . ||| and , a certain lady who was living there hid her under her bed .
n- ra- zamuka nyura iyo kuri burigade , ||| i continued and passed via the police station .
kuko kuri manumetal u- zamutse hariya ... ku- nyura hariya munsi ya manumetal ha- ri bariyeri mbi cyane , nta muntu u- na- yi- simbuka -aga -ho . ||| because , there at manumental ... there was a horrible roadblock that nobody would escape .

oya aba i nyamirambo aba kwa se . ||| no , she lives in nyamirambo at her father 's place .
ubwo se nawe ya- ra- rokotse ... se ya- ra- rokotse . ||| her father too survived .
ikindi hano n- ku- baza , nyine nyuma y' itsembabwoko ... eh , inkotanyi zi- ki- fata igihugu ha- giye -ho inzego inzego za leta ; ba- shaka -aga kugirango abanyarwanda ba- ongera -e ba- subira -an -e , ||| after the genocide when the inkotanyi liberated the country , there were several government bodies that came up , whicha emphasis much on unity and reconciliation policies .
mbese haba -e -ho ubumwe n' ubwiyunge . wowe iyo u- reba ubumwe n' ubwiyunge hagati y' abahutu ba- ishe abatutsi , wu- n- va bi- shoboka ? ||| form your personal point of view , do you thing it will work out for the hutus who perticipated in the genocide to reconciliate with the tutsi survivors ?
ariko rero ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge , ||| by the way , the issue of unity and reconciliation is not easy .
nabyo ntibyoroshye . ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge u- sanga a- ri ibintu ... nk' umuntu u- korewe biriya bintu ku- iyunga n' umuntu wa u- ku- iciye , ||| those ideas of unity and reconciliation are more like ... sincerely , reconciling with some one who killed your people , is next to imposible ; where would one gain that spirit in order to reconcile ?
nti- n- zi ahantu bi- turuka mbese kugirango mu- iyunga -e . n- umva nti- n- zi ... ubwo nti- n- zi uko bi- ba bi- meze . nti- n- zi intangiriro rwose yabyo uko bi- za . ||| i wonder what would have happened , for such people to reconcile . i can n't even imagine the beginning of all the act of reconciliation .

u- ka- iyunga n' umuntu u- mu- bwira uti @: ||| let 's say ; one can tell the other that , "@ please i am sorry !
"@ n- babarira n- ku- tutse . @" ||| i insulted you . forgive me . @"
ese umuntu u- ku- iciye a- ka- ku- icira abantu makumyabiri , a- za- za a- ku- bwira ngo tu- iyunga -e koko ... gutya bi- shoboka -e ? ||| but i can n't imagine someone who killed more than twenty people of your family members , standing infront someone asking him or her to reconcile . how possible would that be ?
ko a- ri ikibazo ! simbizi nti- n- zi ko ... wenda nti- n- zi uko bi- za- tegura -w , ariko simbizi . ||| it is a problem maybe there is a way they are planning to do it , which i can n't imagine .
u- bona iriya commission iba -ish -ije -w se i- za- gera ku nshingano zayo ... byo byoroshye ? ||| so , do you thing that the commission in charge of unty and reconciliation will reach its goals easily ?
iriya commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ? iriya commission y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge rero , ||| you are talking about that commission of unity and reconciliation ... ?
wenda ahari i- za- bi- gera -ho simbizi , ariko se n- jya -e n- bona a- ta- ri vuba . ||| that commission ... maybe it will succeed , who knows ?
n- bona bi- ta- za- shoboka vuba . ntabwo bi- za- shoboka vuba , kuko n' uwakwiciye a- fite umujinya . ||| though it will require them a lot of time . it seems too impossible to achieve their goals in a short time .
ukanabibona akanabikwereka . ||| because , it is astonishing how those who perticipated in the genocide [ interahamwe malicious ] still have strong hatred and whenever they see you , they try to show you that they still hate you .
ubwo se uwo mu- za- iyunga mu- ta -e ? ko a- ku- rusha umujinya a- riwe u- ku- hemuka -iye . ||| so , how do you expect reconciliation to take place since he or she , who did those things has more grievance than the one he or she hurt ?
ha- ri urwego ru- reba -an na jenoside nyine ya- baye mu rwanda , ||| there are other organisations concerned with the rwandan genocide , which are non @-@ governmental .
uretse inzego za leta ha- ri -ho n' andi ma commission menshi nk' ayo y' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge ... ariko mu rwego rw' ubucamanza ha- ri -mo , eh ... imanza ba- za- ca muri iyi minsi , ||| plus several other commissions around the contry like that of unity and reconciliation .
ndetse za- na- tangiye imanza ba- ita i- za gacaca , ||| and there are also judicially commissions called gacaca . i guess , are in operation .
zo u- ba u- zi- vuga -ho iki ? ||| what can you say about them ?
ha- ri icyo zizacyemura mu rwego rwo ku- hana ku- hana a- ba- zize ... a- ba- koze itsembabwoko . ||| do think they are going to help in purnishing those who perticipated in the genocide ?
igihugu cyacu aho ki- gana kugirango ki- gira iterambere , n- umva nk' abanyarwanda bose ba- shyira hamwe . ba- ka- ubaka igihugu . ||| in order for our country to experience development in the future , all rwandans should put their hands together and try to build their nation .
ariko bi- za- tera -w n' iki ? no ku- ca umuco wo ku- ta- hana . niba u- tekereza ku- kora ikintu runaka ki- ta- ri kiza , ||| but this shall be achieved only if they try to eliminate the habit of not purnishing .
cyo ... cyo ... cyane icyo ubwicanyi nicyo ki- shenye n' iki gihugu , ||| whoever that has plans of doing bad deeds especialy killings because it was one of the deeds that led into distruction of our nation .
a- hana -w -e hariya ku mugaragaro . a- hana -w -e bi- boneka , ||| should be punished in public where everybody will be seeing in order to frighten those who have the same plans .
n' undi u- bi- tekereza a- gira -e ubwoba . a- vuga -e ati @: ||| because they will know that , if they do the same thing , they will be treated in the same way .
"@ nimbikora n- ra- bi- zira . @" icyo ki- ha -e hagati aho ni bi- cika igihugu ku- za- ubaka -w , ki- ba -e kiza . rero ku- gira ngo igihugu cyacu ki ... ki- za- ba -e kiza , ||| therefore , if they stop that habit [ not punishing ] the country will be built and will become pleasing .
a- ba- ki- ri batoya ba- za- komeza -e mu majyambere , ba- iga -e , ba- gira -e icyo ba- ungura igihugu ; ||| therefore , in order for our contry to be pleasing , the young ones will have to continue in the line of development ; they will have to finish their studies and improve our contry .
ni uko mbere na mbere nibabanze ba- umva -ish -e ba bantu ba- fite umutima mubi wo ku- ica abantu , n' uyu munsi ba- ki- wu- fite ... kandi ba- ra- wu- fite ! ||| first of all , they have to know that the killers still have the intentions of killing .
ba- banza -e ba- ba- umva -ish -e ko ba- gomba kuba -an n' abandi neza , ha- ta- ri -mo ubwicanyi . ||| therefore , they have to first sencitize them and teach them that , they have to live with others peacefully without killing .
nka bariya bantu bo ku gikongoro nk' uko ba- vuze ko ba- ba- kata -iye urwo ku- pfa , ||| fir example those people in gikongoro whom they sentenced to death .
kandi ba- za- ba- rasa kumugaragaro , ibyo ... buriya nibakora biriya ntabwo ku gikongoro ... n- ra- izera ko bi- ta- ka- ongera . nibaramuka ba- bi- koze koko ku mugaragaro ba- hamagaye abantu bose , ntabwo bi- ka- ongera . ||| i hope they will shut them in open . and i believe that , if they do it in public , i guess in gikongoro there will be no more killings .
kuko ntawabona ba- mu- shyize ku giti hariya , noneho y- umva -e ko a- kwa -iye ku- bi- kora , ngo ba- mu- shyira -e ku giti . ||| because no one can see his fellow being shot on a tree and then he goes a head with his wrong plans that would take him to the same tree .
ibyo rero ni u- ku- ca ... ni u- ku- randura umuco u- ta- hana nyine nibyo byiza . ibyo ba- ramutse ba- bi- koze igihugu cyacu ki- tera i- n- bera -e . kuko n' abahungabana , ||| therefore , eliminating the habit of ont punishing is the best . if they do so , our country will develop .
no mu bihungabanya abantu ba- bonye jenoside ... ba- huye nayo ba- ta- ota -ije -w , na biriya byo ku gikongoro bi- je -mo . kuko twarahungabanye tu- esa -e tu- ta- na- ha- egereye . ||| because those are one of the things that distablise genocide survivors . because when we had about what took place in gikongoro , we were all afraid .
tu- hise tu- umva ko n- ta -w -e tu- esa -e ariko tu- gomba ku- mera . ||| we thought the same thing would happen to us ...
ikindi n- ku- baza , u- ra- bona ubu ni ubuhamya bwawe , nk' umuntu tu- vuga mukuru . ||| another thing i would like to ask you ; this is your personal testimony as a mature person .
bu- ka- ba kandi bu- za- reba -w n' abana bawe , ndetse n' abo ba- za- byara kuko bu- za- bi- kwa mu ahabigenewe ku buryo bu- za- mara igihe . ||| and your own children plus your grandchildren will see this testimony because it will be kept in the appropriate place for the future .
tu- ifuza -aga y' uko ukurikije ibihe u- nyuze -mo ; ukurikije ubuzima bu- komeye u- giye u- nyura -mo u- ri mu i- toteza -w . ha- ri uko u- giye ubyigobotora ; ||| therefore , according to your life experience ... the hard times you experienced , definitely there must have been a way you found yourself out of it .
ha- ri n' ubwo ababyeyi bawe ba- ku- bwira -aga bati @: "@ ntacyo ... kora gutya kugirango twigobotore mu buzima bubi . @" ||| maybe sometimes your parents would tell you to do this or that in order to defeat some tough situations .
ndagirango u- tu- bwira -e muri make impanuro u- ha abana @: ||| in brief , please tell us the advice you would give to the young children .
a- ri abawe ; n' a- baza ... n' abazaba abana babo , nka nyirakuru . ||| especially your children and those that will generate from them ; they will be your grand children .
ndetse n' abandi bana b' igihugu . icyo ba- kora nk' impanuro wowe ubwawe u- ba- ha kugirango ba- ba -e abantu , ba- za- shobora -e no ku- gira ubuzima bwiza . ||| in general what is your advice to the children of this nation ? what should they do in order to become responsible people in the future ?
impanuro n- ha rero abana ba- ki- ri batoya , i- cya mbere ni u- ku- gira urukundo . ||| the advice i can give to young children ... first of all they should learn how to love .
i- cya mbere ni u- ku- gira urukundo ; ||| the first thing id to love .
ikindi ba- ki- ha- tira ku- iga , kuko nta buzima bwiza ba- za- gira ba- tize . ||| sencondly they should put much effort in education because there will be no bright future for them if they do n't go to school .
ba- ka- iga ba- ka- gira urukundo ; ||| they should study and love each other .
ikintu cyo ku- ngana ba- ka- ki- randura mw' isi ikibaho . ||| they should avoid hatred among them in all their lifetime on earth .
n- i- haza urukundo nta n' ikizabura na kimwe . ||| because where there is love , nothing misses .
abana bato nibakundana ... kandi n' ubundi buriya , kugirango n' abo bana batoya ba- jya -e kuba interahamwe babitewe n' abakuru . n- i- baga -ir urukundo , ||| therefore , the youngones should love each other . i guess even those kids who became interahamwe ; it was due to their elders .
ba- ka- igishwa urukundo , ||| but if the children experiences love , and be taught about love rather than hate .
nti- ba- ishwe ibyo ku- anga ... ngo @: "@ uriya mututsi . @" ||| and avoid seeing their fellows and say , "@ look at that tutsi . @"
nk' uko n' ubundi ba- bi- ba- igishije . ||| like they used to learn in the past . in the past .
n' umwana w' umututsi a- ka- kura a- zi ko a- ri umututsi u- toteza -w , ||| tutsi children used to believe that they were ment to be menaced .
nko muri jenoside ha- ri nk' u ... nk' abana ... u- bwira -aga umuntu ati @: "@ u- n- babariye ko n- ta- za- ongera kuba umututsi . @" ||| like during the genocide , some children would tell the killers that , "@ please forgive me , i will never be a tutsi again . @"
i- baze w' uruhinja ! ni uko ya- ri a- zi ko ba- mu- toteza kubera ko a- ri umututsi . ||| just imagine , those were very young children but they already knew that they were menaced because they were tutsis .
ba- ka- randura rero umuco wo ku- ngana . ku- sa ba- ka- menya ko umunyarwanda a- ri umunyarwanda . ||| therefore , hatred should be up rooted and they should only keep in mind that there are only rwandans .
ba- ka- menya ko umuntu a- ri umuntu a- gomba kuba -ho , ||| and , every human being has a right to live .
a- ta- gomba ku- icwa . ||| no one should be killed .
ubwo nicyo kintu ki- za- gira -ir rero a- ba- ki- ri batoya akamaro . ||| that is the most important thing for the young ones .
nibakundana umuntu a- ka- menya ati @: "@ njyewe n- gomba ku- i- iga -ir amashuli , n- ki- korera n- ka- za- geza ahangaha , " undi ati @: ||| if they love each other , one would be knowing that , "@ i have to study for my own life . @"
"@ n- gomba ku- kora iki . @" ||| and the other one would say , "@ i want to do this and that . @"
nimba a- ri ubucuruzi a- shoboye , ati @: ||| if he or she is good at business , then he or she should run business .
"@ reka nikurikirire n- curuza -e ; " niba a- ri n' u- hinga , a- menye ko a- gomba ku- hinga . ariko nyuma a- ta- giye muri wa muco wo ku- anga umuntu ngo uriya ni uyu . ||| if one is good at cultivatng , then she or he should mean business and cultivate . but forgeting that habit of having second thoughts about his or her fellows .
ni -yo mpanuro n- ha abana batoya . ||| that is my advice for children .
ubwo ngirango nink' impanuro y' abana batoya b' abanyarwanda muri ru- sanga -e . ariko n- ifuza -aga ko kubw' umwihariko ku bana ba- ki- riwe itsembabwoko , ko ha- ri icyo u- ba ... u- ba- bwira mu rwego rwo ku- iyubaka . ||| hope that is the advice to the children in general . now can you give any piece of advice to the children who were affected by the genocide ? what advice can you offer them about how to improve on them selves ?
mu rwego rwo ku- iyubaka , abana ba- korewe itsembabwoko ba- sigaye iheruheru , ba- tagira ababyeyi ; ||| in the flame of development ... children who experienced genocide were left in misery without parents .
ba- tagira umuryango . ba- kwa -iye ku- ihangana . ba- ki- ku- ri- kira -ir ku- iga . ||| they were left homeless , they should be strong and patience and , mind about their education .
yego nta buzima bu- ri -mo bwiza , kuko mu mu- ta -w -e wabo hara ... haratobamye . iyo umwana a- ta- fite umubyeyi burya nta ... nta kiza aba a- fite . ||| i know there is no good life , their heads had frozen . because , when a child has no parents , life seem to be meaningless .
ariko nibihangane kuko nta ku- n- ri tu- bi- genza . ||| therefore they should be strong because there is no alternative .
yi- hangana -e n- bona uwo wahuje ikibazo ba- kundana -e ba- ganira -e , n- bona umubyeyi n- ka- n- jya -e u- huye n' icyo kibazo , ||| if they come across their fellows with the same problems , they should befriend one another and talk about their problems .
amwegere a- mu- bwira -e . niba ... wenda umubyeyi a- ra- mu- bwira ati @: "@ ihangana -e mwana wanjye u- za -e kuza tu- ganira -e . @" ||| if it is a parent , she will tell them that , "@ my children come we chat a bit . @"
iteka ryose iyo mu- huye mwarahuje icyo kibazo , ha- ri n' aho bi- ku- ru- hura kubera ku- bona uwo uwibwira , mu- bi- vugana -ho u- na- bi- zi . ||| ever , when you meet with people you experienced the same problem ; you fell relieved just because you found someone to tell about your problems , someone who understands it .
yee , ni icyo n- ba- bwira rero ... abana be ... ese ba- huye n' ibyo bibazo ... icyo n- ba- bwira ni uko ba- kundana nabo ubwabo , ||| that is what i can advise them . children who faced that problem should love and know each other .
ba- aka ... ba- ka- menya -an , ibibazo ba- ka- menya ku- egera wa mukecuru cyangwa wa mu- saza u- huye n' ibyo bibazo . ||| if they meet challeges , they should learn how to adress those problems to the older people who were once in the same situation .
a- ka- ba- bwira iyo u- ri umuntu mukuru u- humuriza umwana , u- ka- mu- bwira uti @: "@ ihangana -e nta ku- n- ri bi- meze . @" ya- ba a- ri no hafi yawe , ||| because grown @-@ ups know how to comfort children . you can tell a child that , "@ be strong there is no alternative . @"
u- ka- gerageza no ku- mu- sura , nawe a- ka- ku- sura . ||| and if you are neighbours , then you try to visit each other .
a- ka- menya ko ha- ri umuntu u- sigaye bahuje icyo kibazo . ||| that helps the children to know that there are some other people who faced the same problems like they did .
ubundi nk' impanuro u- haga abana , by' umwihariko a- ba- citse ku icumu ba- huye n' icyo kibazo . ||| that is the piece of adice that you have passed to the children .
ariko noneho ... ntacyo u- bwira noneho a- ba- koze itsembabwoko ? ||| what about those who perticipated in the genocide ?
ni ubuhe bu- tuma -w u- ba- ha ? ||| what message can you give them ?
a- ba- koze itsembabwoko ? [ arimyoza ] yewe ! ||| the perpetrators ?
a- ba- koze itsembabwoko ... ibyo se ... ubwo ... buriya rero bariya bantu ... ku- ba- bwira se ubwo n- ba- bwira ... umva simbabwira ngo @: ||| i wonder what to tell them ; i can not tell them that , "@ never do it again . @" because if they had a chance they would repeat it today .
"@ nti- ba- za- ongera -e . @" ||| most of them do n't even agree that they perticipated in the genocide .
kuko ku giti cyabo ba- shobora no ka- ongera uyu munsi . bariya rero , abenshi nti- ba- n- emera ko ba- bi- koze , kandi a- ra- bi- hakana kandi wowe ya- ra- bi- koze u- reba . ||| they deny it yet you witnessed them doing those deeds .
ubu se n- mu- ha mpanuro ki ? ||| therefore , which kinds of advice can one give such a person ?
ahubwo bi- hana -e nabo niba ba- umva ku mu- ta- ima ... niba ba- umva ku mu- ta- ima ... umutima u- ba ... u- bi- ba- bwira ... u- ba- cira urubanza . ||| instead they should repent for their sins in they feel it down inside their hearts ... if their hearts haunts them .
a- gerageza -e kugirango wenda yi- gira -e ha- ri a- saba -e n' imbabazi da ! niba a- saba -e n' ima -an imbabazi . kuko na bariya ba- ishwe ni ibiremwa by' ima -an yiremeye . ||| they should try to say the truth and ask for forgiveness as they say . they should repent before god because even those they killed were god 's creatures .
nibasabe imbabazi mbere yo ku- n- saba imbabazi . kuko nibemera ba- ka- ibuka ima -an , ba- ka- yi- saba imbabazi , ||| therefore they should repent before god because if they do so , they will be able to ask me to forgive them .
n- n- jya -e nibambona ntacyo ba- za- n- twara . ||| and i will be sure that if we met somewhere , they would never hurt me .
bariya rero ka- ubaha impanuro [ arimyoza ] n- umva n- ta- zi ibyo aribyo . ||| i just do n't know the kind of advice i should give to such people .
ubundi iyo umuntu ya- huye n' amahano nk' aya , aba a- fite ikintu y- ibuka cya kera . we y- umva ko ki- garutse ki- mu- ha amahoro . ||| normally when someone ever faced such scandles , always there is an event or something from his or her past , which he or she remembers and wishes to see again in order to gain peace of mind .
tu- vuga -e ha- ri ubwo u- bana -aga n' umugabo wawe amagambo ya- kunda -aga ku- ku- bwira a- ka- ku- nyura ; ||| for example ; in your marriage life , there were some words that your husband used to say to you and those words made you feel so good .
abana bawe ... n' uwo u- pfuye , ||| it maybe your children ... the one who died ... or your neighbours .
abaturanyi bawe ... muri wowe wu- n- va wibuka iki ki- ku- tera agahinda ku- rusha ibindi ? a- ka- ba a- ri nk' ingaruka y' itsembabwoko . ||| personally , what do you remember that gives a lot of sorrows more than other things yet it was as a result of the genocide ?
ku giti cyanjye ... nk' iyo n- gize ibibazo cyane nk' ubu umuntu ... abana ba- iga , nk' ubu abana ba- iga u- ka- bona ha- buze ... u- ka- bona ha- buze ikaye u- ka- bona ha- buze ikaramu , u- ka- bona umwana a- ra- ku- bwiye uniforme , u- ka- bona a- ba- iga primaire bo tu- ra- ba- i- ishyura -ir . ||| personally , when i get a lot of problems , let us say ; i have children who go to school , then you see them missing books , pens or a uniform ... for example , primary school children we pay their fees .
u- ka- bona ati @: "@ mwarimu a- ra- n- y- irukanye ngo nta gahimbazamuswi u- tu- ha ... umpaye , " yee , ||| and then you see your child coming back home that the teacher has chased them because you never sent him money .
aho u- ra- ibuka ... aho n- ra- bi- ibuka . n- ra- bi- ibuka . ||| i remember ... that is when i remember , when life becomes hard .
iyo imibereho ... ha- ri igihe n- shobora ku- bona nti ... nta ... noneho ejo nti- ba- za- rya , ejo nti- ba- za- ba -ho , ejo ba- za- jya ku- iga ba- riye iki ? ||| some times i get worried , "@ what will they eat tomorrow ? what will take before going to school ?
cyangwa se ba- ra- rara -ir iki ? ||| or what will they have for dinner ? @"
aho n- ibuka ko iyo ba- ba ba- fite se , ||| then i say , "@ if they had a father , would n't have been this worried . @"
n- ba n- ta- bi- i- baza . ibyo kandi nta n' ubwo bi- ri kuri jya -e njyenyine n' ukuntu ... umubyeyi wese ... ibyo a- ra- bi- gira . uwahuye n' icyo kibazo wese . ||| well i am not alone , it happens to every parent who faced that problem of genocide .
wu- n- va se , ku- gira ngo u- gerageza -e ku- bi- i- kura -mo , ku- gira ngo u- gerageza -e ku ... n' ubwo u- huye n' ubwo buzima bi- ka- ku- babaza , ||| in order to avoid those feelings though you faced those problems .
u- gerageza ku- bi- i- kura -mo u- ta -e kuri wowe n' iki u- kora ? ibingibi impamvu n- bi- ku- baza , ni uko ha- ri -mo na ... n' uwabona ubuhamya bwawe , ||| how do you fight againest those feelings ? what do you do personally ? the reason why i ask you such questions is , there are some people who may learn from you after they have seen your testimony .
ati @: "@ n- za- igana -e uriya mukecuru , ukuntu a- genda yi- kura mu makuba . bi- ka- ba nk' urugero kuri we . @" ||| the way you stand in tough situations may be a leason to her of him .
dore rero iyo u- jya ku- bi- i- kura -mo , u- ra- tekereza uti @: "@ hariya ha- ri imfubyi ... muri iriya nzu haba -mo impfubyi zi- bana enye cyangwa eshanu . ||| this is what you do to avoid such feelings ; you think about the orphans around you ... in that house , there are about four or five orphans who are living togeher .
ni u- ku- vuga ngo ha- ri -mo umukuru umwe u- baye umubyeyi wabo ; ||| it means that , the oldest of all acts as a parent to the rest and she or he is taken to be in charge of the whole home .
witwa nyir' urugo . u- ki- ha urugero uti @: "@ se bariya bana nti- ba- ri aho . @" ||| then you reflect their example to your life and say , "@ how come those orphans survive ? @"
u- ka- ongera u- ka- reba na none n' undi mugenzi wawe . u- ka- vuga uti @: "@ ese buriya , ||| and again , you think about your fellow survivors and ask yourself , "@ how are they surviving ? @"
n- i- babarira -e se njyenyine ? @" ni naho ki- bera kiza ... ninaho bi- bera byiza . ku- bona tu- bana mu midugudu burya ... iyo u- ri kumwe mu midugudu n' umuntu muhuje ikibazo ha- ri i- bi- ka- ubaka burya . ||| by considering other people 's lives , it will help you . we live together in the same residence for the survivors , but it is useful for us because we are neighbbouring each other yet we have the same problems .
bi- ra- ka- ubaka kuko u- hita wi- baza ko icyo kibazo a- ta- ri wowe ki- reba wenyine . u- ka- vuga uti @: "@ ese ko abandi bi- hangana , ||| therefore , you refer to your fellows and ask yourself , "@ how come they are still strong ?
reka n- n- jya -e n- ihangana -e . @" ||| let me try and be strong too . @"
ni icyo ki- bi- ku- kura -mo nta ki- n- ri . ||| that is all that can help someone .
ariko u- ri wenyine u- ha -e ... ahubwo u- hera hasi u- hora u- ri mu bibazoo ... iyo bikugonze u- ra- genda u- ka- i- egera -ir n' abandi mu- ka- seka . ||| but , if you are lonely you may spend your entire life in problems .
kandi wenda ha- ka- ba n' igihe mu- sanga murabihuje , naho ubundi mu- ki- seka -ir mu- ki- sengera mu- ka- biha ima -an . yee , ||| otherwise , when you are challeged by problems , you join others and laugh , share a drink and dedicate the rest to god .
nicyo ki- tu- fasha rero kenshi . ||| that is what helps us most of the time .
nta ki- n- ri wu- n- va u- ka- ongera ku ... ku bu- hamya u- tu- haye ? ||| do n't you have something to add on the testimony you have given us ?
nk' ubutumwa u- tanga ku bantu ba- za- reba ubu bu- hamya . ||| what message can you leave for the people who will see this testimony in the future ... ?
cyangwa se ku ... ubutumwa bwo ku- ihangana -ish se , cyangwa se ... uwo a- riwe wese u- shaka ku- ha ubutumwa , cyangwa ubuhamya . ||| it may be a message of comfort to any one of your wish ... it may be a testimony ?
ubuhamya n- vuga , n' uko tu- gomba ku- ihangana tu- esa -e a- ba- huye na jenoside . kuko tu- ra- n- ihanganye ibyo a- ri byo byose , ||| the message i can give to all those who faced the genocide is to be strong .
tu- ra- n- ihanganye . ||| though all the time we have been strong .
imyaka icumi ni myinshi . tu- ri aho , ||| ten years is a big thing !
tu- ri -mo tu- genda n' amaguru . u- ka- bona umuntu n- ta- saze , u- ka- bona n- ta- sebya -e , u- ka- bona u- ri aho imyaka i- ra- shize , ||| yet no one has ever run mad or looking funy .
ni u- ku- komeza tu- ki- hangana . ||| therefore , we have to keep it up and remain strong .
ni u- ku- komeza tu- ki- hangana kuko uko imyaka i- shira , uko abana bacu ba- kura uko ba- iga , niko imyaka iri i- n- bera -e tu ... ibibazo bi- za- genda bi- gabanuka . ||| because as years go by and as far as our children are growing and going to school , our problems will go on reducing .
ubu ... ha- ri icyo imyaka icumi i- shize , ejo bu- n- ri ha- za- ba -ho ku- ibuka ku nshuro ya cumi jenoside i- baye mu rwanda . ||| ten years have passed and in few days to come there will be an occasion of commemorating for the ten years that have passed after the genocide , which took place in rwanda .
bi- baye amahanga yose ya- ra- emeye ko jenoside ya- baye mu rwanda . ||| all other nations admmitted that there was genocide in rwanda .
wowe ha- ri icyo bi- ku- bwiye ka- umva ko amahanga y- umvise ko jenoside ya- baye mu rwanda . ||| does it have any meaning to you , hearing that other countries agree that there was genocide in rwanda ?
bi- ra- n- shima -ish -ije cyane . ||| i was very happy .
ku- bera -ko ha- ri ikintu ki- tu- babaza -aga . ha- ri nk' a ... nk' abantu b' abanyamahanga baza -aga , ||| because some of the things that used to hurt us ... for example there are some foreigners who used to come here in avega .
akenshi babaza -an -aga hariya tu- tuye ... abantu ba- kaza nko muri avega [ ishyirahamwe ry' abapfakazi ba jenoside ] ku- saba ... ku- saba ko ba- gera hariya iwacu . ku- reba ngo abo bantu ba- huye na jenoside , ha- ri na ... na bariya b' abayahudi ba- ra- je , baje iwacu . ||| and they would ask permission to meet us because they realy wanted to see those people who were victimised by the genocide .
ha- ri -mo n' umudage , yee . nti- n- ibuka n' abandi baje . ba- ra- ha- je nabo ba- huye n' ikibazo ki- sa nk' icyacu . ||| the jews also came to see us ; among those who came , there was a lady ... i do n't remember other people who came with her but some time ago , they also experienced genocide like we did .
ariko ha- ri uwaje a- ra- tu- bwira ati @: "@ n- jya -e ndi umwuzukuru w' abantu ba- korewe jenoside . ati @: ||| one of them told us that , "@ my grandparents are victims of the holocaust .
n- ri n- zi ko mu rwanda tu- bi- bonye n' uko tu- bi- umvise , ati tu- ri tu- zi ko tu- sanga tu ... mwasaze ... muri abasazi , nta n' umuntu u- na- ba- gera -mo . ||| according to what we saw and heard , we thought that in rwanda we would find when people had gone crazy . we thouhght that , it would be very hard to get close to you .
ati @: none rwose ... ati @: n- ra- bona mu- rasa neza , ||| but surprisingly you look good !
mu- ra- seka . ati @: mu- ra- seka ! @" ||| you are still able to wear a smile ! @"
u- ka- bona a- ra- tangaye . ||| and for sure , she was astonished .
ha- ri n' undi rero u- tu- bwiye ati @: ||| however , there was another person who came and told us that , "@ we do n't agree that what happened here was genocide .
"@ ntabwo twebwe tu- emera -aga jenoside ... ko ibyo uko tu- umva -aga ibyabaye mu rwanda nti- tu- bi- emera -aga . @" ku- ta- bi- emera rero kwabo bi- ka- tu- babaza . ||| according to what we heard that happened here , we do n't believe it was genocide . @" therefore , that denial of the genocide would terribly hurt us because we would n't imagine why they would denay genocide yet it happened !
nti- tu- umva igituma ba- ta- bi- emera kandi bi- ra- baye . ||| so what amases us is the fact that all nations agreed and realised that genocide happened in rwanda .
none rero ikintu kidu ... ki- shima -ish -ije rwose ikintu ki- n- shima -ish -ije ni uko amahanga yose ya- rangije ku- emera ko ... no ku- bi- bona , ||| it is so amasing .
ko bi- baye koko . ibyo bintu bi- ra- shima -ish -ije cyane . ku- hora iteka tu- bi- ibuka . nabyo mu bi- n- y- ubaka bi- ra- n- y- ubaka . ||| and among the things that keep me strong , is commomerating the genocide all the time .
u- ra- rangije ? ||| have you finished ?
ubwo nyine ba- hera -ko ba- ra- mu- kubita , nawe ya- ri ikimuga ba- ri ba- ra- mu- kubise muri icyo ki- ha -e . ||| so they started beating him yet he was already lame as a result of previous beatings .
ariko icyo ki- ha -e a ... ba- tu- bwira -aga ibyo tu- umva -aga a- ri nka histoire [ amateka ] , ntabwo u- tekereza -aga ko haba -ho jenoside nk' iyo tu- bonye . ||| people used to tell us about those days but for us it was just history , we never thought of something like the genocide we saw would ever happen .
tu- ka- umva a- ri ibintu bya histoire [ amateka ] mbese nk' uko wenda nk' abana tu- za- byara wenda ba- za- za ba- umva ko a- ri histoire [ amateka ] . ||| probably in the same way our children will be taking it as history .
nyuma yaho ubwo nyine ubuzima bu- ragiye bu- komeza . ||| later life went on as it used to be .
bu- komeza uko bi- sanzwe tu- ra- kura , bi- geze muri za mirongo yenda [ 1990 ] na ... mirongo cyenda na kabiri [ 1992 ] , nanohe i bu- gesa -ir ha- tangira kuza umwuka mubi . tu- ka- jya tu- umva ba- vuga ngo abahutu ba- ri ku- twikira abatutsi , ||| we grew up until the 1990s ... in 1992 in bugesera the athmosphere became negative , the hutu were burning the tutsi 's properties .
twe kuko tu- ri tu- tuye ahantu i nti- arama ... ahantu hafi y' i nti- arama a- ta- ri mu mujyi neza . ||| by then we resided in ntarama , which was out of [ ntarama ] town .
noneho bi- hera -aga za n- genda za gashora kuko ni -ho ha- ri ha- ri abahutu benshi , ||| so it started from the side of ngenda and gashora because many hutus resided in those areas .
u- rebye twebwe ahantu tu- ri tu- tuye ni nko ku rusisiro ; u- gereranya -ije ni nk' umudugudu mbega . ||| the area where we lived was some sort of a camp ; you could compare it to an agglomeration .

noneho rero ba- ra- vuga bati @: "@ hariya hakurya tu- ra- bona ha- ki- ri hazima reka tu- pfa -e ku- ha- hungira . @" ||| so they decided to come to our village since things were still fine there .

nuko uko n- ka- je ku- sesa -ir mu gihuru rero , nibwo interahamwe za- hise ziza nyine zirantemagura . ||| at some point , i penetrated another bush where the perpetrators found me and started to hack me .

n- n- jya -e wenda aka ... ubwo a- ka- yaga niba ka- ra- n- kubise n- ka- ka- rura ubwenge simbizi . n- umva abandi ba- ri -mo ku- gendagenda , ||| maybe it was when fresh air [ the wind ] blew on me that i gained back my consciousness and heard people moving around .

noneho n' abandi nabo aho ku- gira ngo baze ba- reba -e , ba- ki- ruka . nti- n- zi umuntu umwe u- ha- ciye a- ra- vuga , ||| but maybe those people thought that i was with perpetrators . instead of coming close to see , they ran away .
ngo @: "@ yewe we ! ngo mudahogora ba- mu- temye disi , ngo reba ukuntu ya- baye . ||| and a certain person came and said , "@ oh no , mudahogora has been hacked look at how she is hurt ! @"

kaza ku- gira anemie [ kubura amaraso ] ka- ra- pfa . ka ... ka ... nuko n- bona ka- icaye gutyo karakanuye , ||| he developed anemia and died ; he was sitting with eyes wide open just besides me .

i bu- gesa -ir ho n- ra- bona n- ta- ba- ha- ri . ni uko . ha- ri umugabo u- ri u- tuye ... tu- ri tu- turanye a- hita ampa ‘ lifuti ’ tu- ra- zana . ||| there was one man who had come from bugesera he gave me a lift we came , when we reached there at rwampara , i found that one of my aunts was still there .
tu- geze hariya rwampara , n- sanga uwo mu ta- n- ta -e wanjye a- ra- ha- ri , n- umva noneho nibwo agatima ka- tangiye ku- garuka , n- umva ko wenda n- bonye undi muntu tu- za- bana . ||| that is when i started gaining some hope since at least i was getting someone to stay with .
ni uko , tu- ra- bana gutyo ku- geza ejo ... mu w' ibihumbi bibiri [ 2000 ] nibwo nawe ya- pfuye . ||| we stayed together until she died in the year 2000 .
ariko u- ra- umva ko tu- ra- banye ... na ba- byara nabo ba- ri ba- ha- ri mu nti- ambara , n- bona ha- ri bake ba- giye ba- sigara . ||| we lived together until that time and a few of my cousins were also there . i was able to find some people who had survived .
ni uko n- bona ubuzima bwanjye bu- komeza gutyo , ||| my life went on like that .
n' uko bi- genze . ibyo muri genocide bi- garuka -iye aho ngaho . ||| i think that is all about my life during genocide .
wakomereza na nyuma ya genocide uko u- baye -ho n' uko mwabanye ... ||| can you continue telling us even the life after the genocide and who did you live with ?
nyuma y' intambara ubwo n- geze aho ... ntabwo n- komeje ku- iga kubera ko ha- giye haba -ho ku- jya mu n- tuza ... mu bitaro ibisebe bi- ra- komeje bi- ra- n- garuka . ||| after the war i did not continue to study .

n- baye -ho ndi ku- i- vuza . n- tabaye mu bitaro mbese nta myaka ingahe i- shize nti- vuza kano kaboko . haza kuza umu docteur u- turutse muri afrique du sud , n- tuza uriya nyaruhirira ya- ri a- ri muri stage , ||| dr nyaruhirira was on an attachment in south africa .

ni uko , n- raga -ije rero mara mu bitaro igihe kinini , nyuma yabwo n- bona ... nibwo n- komeza -aga ku- jya ... abo bana nta wu- n- ri muntu wabarebereraga ni njyewe u- ri u- ba- fite , niyemeza ku- gumana nabo nti- n- basha ku- subira ku- iga . ||| then later on , those children had no one to look after them , so that is why i did not go back to school .

u- sibye baje ... bi- je no ku- gera -ho haza umu oncle wabo u- baga hanze a- ra- ba- jyana . ||| afterwards their uncle who came from abroad took them .
nyuma y' aho ariko n- n- jya -e n- je ku- byara uwange ubu n- ra- mu- fite y- ujuje imyaka ibiri . ||| then i gave birth to my own child , she is now two years old .

itandukanyirizo ryo ri- ra- ha- ri kubera ko mbere y' intambara umuntu u- baga wi- kandagira , ||| there is a difference . because before the war people were scared .
n' aho wicaye u- baga wu- n- va ba- vuga ibintu by' amoko n' ibiki ... ariko ubu wenda u- bona nta bintu by' amoko bi- ha- ri , ||| wherever you would be , people would be talking about ethnic issues and such things ... but now there is no segregation .
n' ubwo u- ba wi- ca ... u- vuga uti ... ikibazo a- ri i- cya bariya ba- ri -mo ku- fungura . ||| maybe the only problem is about the prisoners they are releasing .
ariko ubundi u- bu- sanzwe u- bona ha- ri itandukanirizo . ||| but in general , there is a big difference .
ubu nta ... ntabwo a- ri kimwe na mbere y' intambara . ||| life nowadays is not the same as that before the war .

n- ra- vuga abo u- shobora ku- bwira ibibazo byawe wihariye , ||| i mean people you can discuss the issues related to the genocide .
wu- n- va ibibazo by' itsembabwoko abantu bose mwabiganira kimwe ? ||| can you discuss genocide issues with anybody ?
oya nawe , ||| of course not .
quand meme [ ibyo aribyo byose ] bi- ra- umvikana ntabwo ibibazo by' itsembabwoko ... ntabwo ikibazo ... ikibazo u- hura -iye -ho n' undi ntabwo u- shobora ku- ki- bwira uwo mu- ta- ki- hura -iye -ho ! ha- ri uwo u- shobora ka- umva wishyikiraho , ||| sincerely , you can not discuss genocide problems ... that problem ... a problem you share with someone else , you can not talk about it with someone you do n't share it .
muhuje . tu- vuga -e exemple [ urugero ] nk' umuntu mwarokokanye u- ri mu rwanda , ntabwo u- shobora ku- mu- bwira ikibazo cyawe nk' uko u- ki- bwira uwavuye hanze . ||| there are those you fell free with because you have the same problems , but ... for example @: the way i tell it to a survivor who was here in rwanda is not the same as the way i tell it to a person who came from exile .
u- shobora ku- ki- mu- bwira kuko wu- n- va muhuje mbese . ||| i can tell my story to a survivor because i know we have something in common .
u- za- reba -e nk' umuntu mu- vuga ururimi rumwe mbese muhuje ururimi ntabwo mwabivuga kimwe nk' uwo mutaruhuje . ni urugero . ||| it is like talking to someone you do n't share the same language , it is never the same as talking to that one you have it in common ... this is just an example .

u- bona ha- ri ahantu amahuriro n' imiryango y' abantu ba- ku- iciye , ku buryo ha- ri ikintu u- shobora ku- ba- bwira ? ||| is there any way you collaborate with the families of those who killed your people , to the extent where you can talk with them ?
n- ki- umva ... n- ki- umva nta kintu ki- ta- shoboka . ||| i simply consider it as an impossible issue .
ese u- ku- iyunga n' umuntu ... icyokora baje ... kubera ko umuntu nta n' icyo u- ba u- ri bu- mu- twara -e , a- tinyutse a- kaza a- ka- ku- saba imbabazi , u- mu- babarira . ||| how can one reconcile with a person who ... well , since there is no alternative , if he comes to you and ask for forgiveness you may forgive him .
ariko rero u- ra- umva nk' ibi ba- vuga mbese u- ba u- bona arinko ... nka kwa kubura uko u- gira n' ubundi . u- ra- bona nka bariya ba- vuga ngo @: "@ muri gacaca ngo bi- rega ibyaha ngo baga ... @" nyine ni kwaku ... buriya se u- ri- baza ko ba- bi- emera a- ri uko bi- ba- vuye ku mu- ta- ima ? ||| it is the same as those who say that , in gacaca courts people admit their crimes and then are forgiven .
cyangwa ni uko u- ba wu- n- va ba- vuga bati @: "@ nitubyemera tu- ra- fungurwa . @" ni -yo mpamvu rero nta ... ku mu- ta- ima wanjye ibintu by' ubumwe n' ubwiyunge n- umva ubwange ba- ita ... ||| but do you think they say it from the bottom of their hearts or is it so they may be forgiven ? that is why for me unity and reconciliation is impossible .
ha- ri ibintu leta ya- shyize -ho wenda byo ku ... byo ku- bwira abantu ba- rokotse ngo ba- jya -e bazenguruka mu magereza ba- jya -e ku- kangura -ir bariya bantu ba- koze ibyaha ku- i- rega . ||| there is a new government policy of asking the survivors to go round in the prisons and sensitize the killers to admit what they did and report themselves .

hano ha- ri icyobo ba- mena -mo imyanda , tu- ri tu- hungiye haruguru mu kigo cy' a- ba- bi- kira baza ku- ba- twara a- ri interahamwe zi- gera nko kuri makumyabiri . ||| here was a rubbish tip , we had sought refuge in a convent up there .
abenshi ba- ambaye imihoro , ba- fite imbunda ba- ra- ba- manura , tu- esa -e ba- ra- tu- manura batwicaza mu muhanda hagati nuko uwari u- kura -iye interahamwe a- ra- vuga ngo nti- ha- gira -e uwica umwana , ||| they came looking for them there , they were about 20 interahamwes . many of them had machetes , guns and they got them to go down , they got us to go down and sit in the middle of the road .
ngo bi- ca -e abakuru ku- sa . ||| the head of the interahamwes said they should not kill the children , that they should only kill adults .
nuko ba- maze ku- ba- manura nibwo ba- tangiye kubatemagura , abo ba- shyize muri kiriya cyobo ku itariki icumi , ||| and so after they went down , they started cutting them down , on april 10th , they threw them into this pit .
bo ba- ba- shyize -mo ba- sahura n' amamatela ya- ri a- ri mu rugo , n' ayarari hirya no hino ba- shyira -ho esanse ba- ra- ba- twika . ||| they also stole mattresses at home and in other houses in the neighbourhood , they poured fuel and burnt them .
ba- ra- ba- temye , ba- ba- ta mu cyobo ba- rangije ba- ba- shyira -ho n' amamatela ba- ra- ba- twika , ||| they cut them down and threw them into a pit , and then they put mattresses on top of them and burnt them .
nyuma nibwo baje ku- garuka gusaka mu kigo cy' a- ba- bi- kira , ||| later on they came back to the convent .
a- ri nabwo ba- twara -aga papa wanjye . ||| that 's when my dad was taken away .
bwo baje a- ri interahamwe eshanu , ||| there were 5 interahamwes this time .
ha- ri -mo babiri ba- fite imbunda undi a- fite inyundo n' abandi babiri ba- fite imihoro , nibwo nabo ba- ba- manuka -an -ye nabo ba- ra- bi- ca . ||| two of them had guns , one had a hammer , two of them had machetes , that 's when they took him down and killed him as well .
abantu bose ba- ba- ishe mu buryo bumwe cyangwa papa wawe bi- ri bi- kabije ? ||| were they killed the same way or was his situation worse ?
papa we ba- ra- ba- n- je ba- mu- kubita inyundo mu mu- ta -w -e , ubundi ba- mu- twara ba- mu- kurura hasi . ubwo u- ra- umva deja ba- ri ba- rangije ni nkaho a- ri ukumwica , ||| first , they hit him on the head with a hammer ; they took him pulling him across the ground . so you can understand that it was as though they had already killed him .
nyuma rero baranamutemaguye kuko nyuma tubataburura ku mu- ta -w -e ha- garagara -ho imihoro na hano ( ijosi ) ku magufa bi- ra- garagara -aga . ||| later again , they slaughtered him , because when we exhumed them , there were traces of a machete on his head and here [ on the neck ] , revealing the bones .
nibo noneho ba- shyinguye hano ? ||| so they are the ones who buried them here ?
nibo ba- shyinguye hano . ||| they are the ones who buried them here .
ha- ri abandi bantu u- ba u- zi , ba- ri abaturanyi banyu ba- ba ba- ri -mo hano ? ||| do you know anyone else who is in here , perhaps your neighbour ?

nta n' i- ki- hamya ka- erekana ko a- ri n' abantu ba- ha- guye mu nti- ambara . ||| there 's nothing that shows that these people were killed during the war .
n- umva i- kiza a- ri uko ba- jya nko mu nzibutso umuntu a- ka- jya a- ba- sanga -yo . ||| i believe it would be better to take them to a memorial site and people would visit them there .

ibyabereye aha ni a- ka- homa munwa , ||| what happened here goes beyond imagination .
uru rugo ru- ri urw' umuturanyi , ||| this was a neighbour 's family .
abantu ba- ha- guye tu- ri kumwe muri eto , ||| those who were killed here were with me at eto .

tu- sigara muri eto tuza ku- ha- va tu- jya i n- ya- n- za ariko abo tu- sigara -an -ye ba- ra- ha- guye , ||| we stayed at eto and we left there for nyanza . but those who had remained behind lost their lives .
bi- ra- umvikana benshi ba- ra- ha- guye , ni -ho nahonokeye njyewe ariko ubundi abo bantu tu- ri tu- turanye muri icyo ki- ha -e . ||| it is evident that many people were killed there . i escaped death then . those people were our neighbours .
abantu bi- ca -iye -w hano u- shobora ku- tu- bwira umubare wabo ? ||| could you tell us how many people were killed here ?
hano hano , ||| right here .

barabatemaguye , ba- ra- ba- rasa , ba- ba- tera amagerenade ba- rangije ba- ba- jugunya muri uyu mwobo , ||| they hacked them , shot them and threw grenades on them .
uyu mwobo u- ri umusarane , u- ri wagenewe kuba umusarane ariko u- ri u- ta- ra- koreshwa . ||| the pit was a septic tank ... they had planned to make it into one , but it was not yet completely built .
hanyuma ba- ra- bi- ca ba- ba- jugunya -mo rero . ||| so they killed them and threw them in .
ya- ri n- yi- ri urugo n' abana be , n' umugore we ? ||| was it the head of the family together with his children and wife ?
yeee , n- yi- ri urugo ni mama w' abana ise w' abana ya- ri ya- ra- pfuye ya- ri ya- ra- shaje , ||| yes , actually the mother was the head of the family , as the father died , of old age .
hanyuma ni nyina w' abana n' abana ndetse n' abuzukuru . ||| therefore , it was the children 's mother , the children and the grand @-@ children .

ba- ka- ba- shyira amagerenade mu mufuka ba- ka- vuga ko a- ri inkotanyi , kandi a- ri abantu ba- sanzwe ba- zi bahangaha . ||| they would then put grenades in their pockets and suddenly start calling them inkotanyi , yet they were the ordinary people from this place that every body knew very well .
ba- ra- genda -aga ba- ka- jya ku- bi- cira hirya ahangaha bugufi , ||| then , they would be killed just over there .

icyo ki- ha -e rero ba- injira -aga mu ngo uko bi- shakiye ba- ka- injira -ir igihe ba- shakiye ya- ba ku manywa ya- ba ni njoro , ||| during that time , they used to enter people 's homes as they wished and at any time they wanted @: either at night or daytime .

ba- ra- ki- mu- kubise n- ta- taka noneho umukecuru umwe u- ri u- tuye hano haruguru witwaga dina ya- zamuka -aga kuko n- umva -ish -ije n- ta- menye ibibaye , ||| i sreamed but a certain old lady who was living around here , she was called dina , she was also moving in the same direction like me and besides hearing , i never knew what was taking place .
a- hita a- n- kurura akaboko ati hoshi tugende n' interahamwe zi- ri -mo ku- ica uriya mututsi . ||| then she told me while she was pulling my arm , "@ let 's procced , it is the interahamwe ( militias ) killing the other tutsi . @"

ati a- ra- zira ko a- ri umututsi , ati we ku- bi- vuga ba- ta- ku- ica nawe , ||| "@ he is accused of being a tutsi and stop talking about it , otherwise they will kill you too . @"

lui il a droit de mourrir ni gutyo uwo mugabo ya- n- bwiye n- ta- komeza . ||| that is what that man told me . so i procceded .
nibwo rero ku itariki ya gatandatu ni njoro tu- umva -aga u- ra- bona tu- tuye bugufi y' ikibuga , ||| and then , on the sixth at night we heard that ... hope you can see that we are neighbouring the airport .

ku- geza mu gitondo mbese bi- geze nka saa cyenda z' ijoro tu- zi -ko tu- yobewe ibyabaye kuko nta nubwo tu- ri tu- bi- menye twebwe . ||| the trend continued until deep in the night at around 03:00 a.m. and we had not known what had happened .
i- ki- na- ni ki- pfuye ba- hise ba- jya haruguru hariya ba- tu- kata -ir ka- bura -e y' umuriro , ||| when president habyarimana . j. @"@ ikinani @" died they cut the cabble , which supplied electricity in our area .

ba- kata rero ka- bura -e ya- gera -aga ahangaha . ||| frankly speaking , i can not clearely explain the reason why they cut the electricity supply because by that time , there were no electric phones .

tu- bona ahantu hose ba- tangiye ku- twika , ba- tangiye ku- ica abantu . ||| they had started burning people 's houses and killing people .
ba- ba- n- je ruguru hariya ku mudamu w' umupfakazi witwa claudette muteteri ya- ri umudamu wa mutsinzi , ||| they started from up there at a certain widow 's home . she was called claudette muteteri . her husband was called mutsinzi .

( i had forgotten to tell you this but i have remembered as i mentioned her name ) between her home and aloys ' ( ngirabatware aloys was the president of the militias ) home , there was a field where all of us would gather for meetings .
muri iyo nama nibwo abantu ba- vuze ibintu by' umutekano . ||| in that meeting , it was where the security problem was mentioned .

bamwatse ibyo ba- shaka , ni nawe rero ba- hereye -ho igihe cy' intambara . ||| everytime they could be at her place and take her money and other properties of their wish .
icyo ki- ha -e rero muri iyo nama rero nibwo we n' undi mugabo nti- ibuka izina w' aha haruguru abaturage ba- ba- toye uwitwa modeste n- ibagiwe izina rye ri- n- ri abaturage bati ni mu- genda -e mu- gira -an -e imishyikirano na aloys , ||| when the genocide begun , she was killed first in our area . and then in that same meeting all people elected my husband and a certain man who was called modeste ( i do n't remember his other name ) to go and face aloys about that issue .
ariko tu- umva tu- gize ubwoba kuko umuntu abantu ba- ra- jya kwa aloys nti- ba- ri bu- garuka -e tu- umva -aga ko ba- ri bu- pfa -e . ||| however , we were very worried ; we knew that no body goes to aloys ' home and comes out alive . we thought they would die .
ubwo ba- ba- ha gahunda ko a- ri bugeyo bukeye ba -w -ho , ||| therefore , they decided to meet him the following day .

a- baza -aga benshi ba- ri abatutsi ubwo tu- fata umwanzuro wuko muri icyo cyumweru tu- imuka . ||| most of the people who would come were tutsis . therefore , we came up with a dicision of shifting in that same week .

tu- ha- enga -ir -aga ni njoro umuntu a- ka- pakira ibintu ni njoro tukabimura ba- ka- jya mu zi- n- ri ka- ra- ita -iye , ||| at night people would pack their properties and we would take them to other areas .

ubwo n- ta -w -e tu- ri tu- fashe gahunda yo ku- imuka a- ri ku wa gatandatu tu- bonye inzu i kabgayi , tu- gomba ku- za- genda , ||| we had also planned to shift on saturday ; we had got a house in kabgayi for rent .
nibwo bi- tangira -aga ubwicanyi bu- tangiye tu- ta- giye a- ra- itwa -e tu- sigaye n' abandi bakeya . ||| unfortunately , that was when the serious killings begun . others had left ; it was a few families and us who had stayed .
kuko abaturanyi bacu ba- ri ba- hungiye hano ba- vuga ngo hano ni mu bazungu nta muntu u- ri bu- ha- keka -e nta muntu u- ri bu- ha- gera -e , ||| because all our neighbours had sought refuge in our home with a belief that , since it was in a white family no body would guess they were there or bather to come .

ba- ri ba- fite ikintu cy' ubwoba ba- ra- shorera ba- geze haruguru gato hariya imihanda i- hura -ir ba- tangira ku- vuga ngo muri twebwe ha- ri -mo ibyitso . ||| they looked scared and when they reached in front at the juction of the roads , they started saying , "@ among us they are traitors and suddenely the shootings from the inkotanyi increased .

ariko n' inkuru ndende ku- gera i bu- ru- n- ri ni birebire , ||| however it is a long story about the experience in burundi .

n- za n- ihuta n' imfunguzo nyine n- vuga nti bi- i- buze n- giye ku- reba n' imyenda n- taha -e n' imyenda n' iki , ||| therefore , we came here and a rushed forward with the keys expecting to find my clothes or other properties that we had left behind .
nibwo n- sanze hano ha- shenye n' iriya nzu yacu yo haruguru i- shenye . ||| but i found when this part was demolished . even the other house of ours was demolished .

ubwo ha- tawe -mo umudamu umwe u- ri u- fite inda nk' amezi umunani u- ri u- hungiye muri iyi ka- ra- ita -iye , ||| there is a certain lady who had sought refuge in this area ; she was dumped in that pit yet she was pregnant . she had eight months pregnance .
abo bantu nti- tu- ba- zi amazina nti- tu- zi aho ba- turutse , ||| we never knew their names or where they were coming from .

noneho nyuma yo ku- ta- bu- rura tu- geze igihe cyo ku- ta- bu- rura , tu- maze ku- sa -an hano tu- ifasha -ish -ije minisitere ya affaire social ngo ba- tu- fashe ku- vana -mo abantu , ||| after some time we wanted to exhume their remains for proper reburial .
ariko ba- ra- bi- rangarana nti- ba- tu- fasha tu- bona tu- ta- komeza kuba ahantu mu nzu tu- kodesheje tu- cumbitse -mo , ||| after reconstructing our house , we asked the ministry of social affairs to help us in the act of exhuming and reburying those remains of people . however , they seemed not to consider that as an agent issue yet we could n't continue living in someone 's house .
ha- ri umuvandimwe u- ri u- tu- cumbikiye ku- komeza ku- cumbika kandi tu- fite inzu yacu . ||| a certain relative had sheltered us but we did n't want to stay in that house yet we had our own house .
tu- fata icyemezo cyo kuza nubwo ba- ri ba- ri -mo , ||| we came up with an idea of going to our house though the remains were still there .
ariko tu- ra- vuga tuti ngo ibyaribyo byose ni abacu ntawareka kuba -an nabo nta kibazo , ||| we would consol on ourselves that , "@ after all they are our people , we can live in the house while they are still there . there is no problem . @"
tu- ra- za tu- ba -mo ha- shize imyaka ine ubwo ni 1998 , nibwo mu rwego rwa komini yacu ya kicukiro ba- fashe umwanzuro cyo ku- ta- bu- rura abantu bose ba- ri ba- guye muri iyi ka- ra- ita -iye , ||| we started living in our house and four years later ... in 1998 that is when in the name kicuciro district there was a decision to exhume and rebury all the remains of people who lived in this area .
baza rero hano , ||| then , they came to our home too .
twarataburuye ha- ri -mo tu- vanye -mo u- tu- ta -w -e nka tune tu- ri tu- ra- baye decompose . ariko tu- maze ku- gera munsi tu- bonye -mo ba- vanye -mo imirambo mirongo itatu n' icyenda ariko yo i- ki- fite umubiri , ||| we first found about four skulls but when we scooped deeper , more fifty @-@ nine bodies were found , which still had fresh .
uwo mudamu u- ri u- twite u- basha -aga ku- mu- bona a- fite inweri a- fite inzara , ||| and , one could easily identify that woman who was pregnant ; she still had braids and nails .
umubiri u- ki- ri -ho u- na- bona n' inda ya- ra- homba -an -ye u- bona koko ko ya- ri a- twite , ||| she even had fresh and one could see that she was pregnant although her belly was deformed .

i- ki- babaje rero n' uko a- ba- bi- reba -aga banza -e ku- tu- bwira abantu ba- ha- ica -iye -w abo aribo , ||| the worst of all is that the people who witnessed those people 's death could n't tell us the names of people who died there .
kuko ha- ri -mo abo muri ka- ra- ita -iye ha- ri a- ba- turutse kure , ||| among them , they were those who were originally from this area but there were also those who came from other areas .
ariko nti- ba- shobora ku- tu- bwira . ||| however , the people who witnessed them the day they were killed could n't tell us who they were .
tu- gerageje no ku- reba umuturanyi ahangaha uwo tu- fatanya -ije urugo , we y- anze n' umunsi wo ku- ta- bu- rura y- anze ku- gera aha , ||| we even tried to contact my neighbour ( our houses are next to each other ) but he refused to step here the day we exhumed the victim 's remains .
ya- ha- gaze iwe ku- sa a- ka- jya a- reba -ir mu miyenzi n- ta- tinyuka -e ku- ha- gera . ||| he stood in his home and could peep through his fencing ; he did n't want to come here .
nti- n- zi rero ukuntu ku- gira ngo umuntu a- menye abantu , ||| it is hard to know the people who died here .
uko bi- za- genda n' ubu n- ta- ku- bwira a- ra- vuga ngo n' interahamwe n- bonye kanaka na kanaka ku- sa aribo ba- ha- hita , ||| up to now he can not tell you the truth ; he says that he saw the interahawe so and so passing by .

kuburyo mbese tu- ba- n- je ku- banza ku- hahamuka -ir hano kubera ibintu tu- ha- sanze . ||| in fact we suffered some trauma in this home because of the things we found here .
n- ra- umva aricyo n- vuga kuri icyo cyobo , ||| i guess that it all i can say about that pit .
icyakora nyuma yaho ibyo ba- ba- icishije n- bi- guma -ish -ije -mo nk' ibintu by' ibyuma by' ibishasi by' imodoka , ||| but i left all the weapons they used to kill them in the pit .

tu- ra- ha- reka . ||| therefore , we just buried them in the pit although we never covered it completely .
mu maze ku- tu- bwira ko hano ha- kozwe n' interahamwe z' aloys ese uwo aloys ya- ri muntu ki ? ese hano ha- je interahamwe zi- ngana iki ? ||| as you said that it was the interahamwe who were led by aloys , who did all those deeds . which kind of person was aloys ? and , how many interahamwe ( militias ) came here ?
aloys ya- ri perezida w' interahamwe y- itwa -aga aloys ngirabatware , ||| aloys was the president of the interahamwes . his full names were aloys ngirabatware .

aho hantu ni ahantu ha- nanira -an -ye ku- shyingura abantu ba- ha- guye mu nti- ambara yo muri mirongo cyenda na kane ( 1994 ) ariko ha- guye -mo abantu ba- tagira ingano ha- guye -mo abantu benshi . ||| it still has n't been possible to bury the victims who were killed during the 1994 war .
abantu ba- va ku mirenge i- tandukanye kicukiro , ka- garama , ||| in fact , thousands of people were killed here .
umurenge wa kanombe , ndetse n' utugari ba- ita ka- ba- eza ndetse na samuduha . ubwo rero aha hantu umwaka u- ba u- shize nkuko abantu ba- gomba ku- shyingura -w ba- zize itsembabwoko , aha hantu ha- ra- tu- naniye uru rwobo ru- ra- tu- naniye , ||| the victims were from different districts such as kicukiro , kanombe , sectors such as kagarama , kabeza , samuduha ... it 's been a year that the remains of these victims are supposed to have been buried but we have n't been able to do anything because of this pit .
tu- fatanya -ije n' abaturage ba kicukiro , na kanombe , na samuduha , na ka- garama tu- ra- gerageza bi- ra- nanira -an . ||| we tried with the people of kicukiro , kanombe , kagarama , kabeza , samuduha ... but were unable to .
kuko aha hantu ha- guye abantu ba- renga ibihumbi ba- renga nk' ibihumbi nka bitatu , ||| over 3,000 people lost their lives here .
mwambaza ngo ba- va -aga hehe ? ||| maybe you will ask @: where did these people come from ?
n' abantu ba- baga ba- ra- hunze , ba- ra- hunze ingo zabo ba- ba- sanga -mo ba- ka- bi- ca , ||| they were people who fled from their homes , some were killed in their homes .
abandi ba- ka- ba- vumbura mu bihuru a- honga -ho muri ferme ya ru- bi- ri- zi dore ko ha- ri inka nyinshi ha- ri n' ibihuru . ba- kaza ba- ka- bi- cira ahangaha , ||| others were found out in the bush near the rubirizi farm [ there were many cows and a very wide bush ] and then the killers used to bring them here to kill them .
abandi ba kabiri ba- ba- vana -aga iwabo mu ngo ba- ba- vana -aga ku mugabo u- ri umukonseye witwaga bi- zi- ya- remye niko amakuru ampa ba- ra- ba- zana -aga ba- ka- ba- fata mu modoka muri za kamyoneti , ||| they also brought some from the house of the then counselor named biziyaremye , after the latter had kidnapped them from their homes . those are the news that ... the victims were transported in pick ups and taken to the interahamwes who were at rubirizi .
ba- kaza ba- ka- ba- shyira interahamwe mu ru- bi- ri- zi ba- ka- bi- ca ba- ka- bana -aga mu cyobo muri iki cyobo . ||| they used to throw people into a big pit after killing them .
ni kirekire cyane iki ba- ri ba- ra- ki- teganya -ir -ije ku- shyira -mo inka za- pfuye , ||| this pit is very deep . it was dug in order for dead cows to be thrown there .
ni kirekire cyane ku buryo ki- fite nka metero nka mirongo ine ( 40 m ) z' ubujyakuzimu , ku buryo ntago a- ri bantu ba- ki- cukuye bwa buryo bu- sanzwe , ||| it is about 40 meters long and it was n't dug the usual way .
ni ikintu kirekire cyane ku buryo bi- ra- nanira -an -ye ku- gira ngo ba- ki- vana -e -mo abo bantu . ||| it is so deep that it has n't possible to exhume the bodies of the victims that are inside .
tu- ra- gerageje rero tu- gerageje ku- ki- cukura ariko ba- vuga ko ba- mennye -mo za acide , ||| we tried digging but we were told they poured acid into it .
ba- mennye -mo ha- ri -mo inka nyinshi , ||| there are even remains of cows inside !
mbega ku buryo ministere ya- tu- bwiye y' uko ubwo ki- nanira -an -ye tu- za- ha- shyira urwibutso , ||| we tried in vain and the ministry told us we shall build a memorial site there .
tu- za- ki- ubaka -ir tu- ka- za- ki- ibuka -ir -ho , tu- ka- jya tuza ku- ha- ibuka -ir hafi bu- ri mwaka ariko ha- koze neza . ||| that way , we will be able to visit the place every year after it 's been built .
ha- ri umugabo witwa ru- rangira -w damascene ku buryo n' ababyeyi be bose a- ri -ho ba- ba- shyize , ||| damascene rurangirwa is a man whose parents had been thrown into this pit .
ya- ri ya- ra- gerageje ku ki- sukura neza ku- ki- kora neza ngo ba- za- jya -e ba- ki- ubaha kuko ya- bona -aga nta bu- n- ri buryo bu- ha- ri bwo ku- vana -mo abo bantu , ||| he had tried to make it look better so people can show a bit of respect towards the place . he had realized that there was no other way of exhuming the corpses . he got it concreted .
a- hita -mo kuki betona ariko nyuma ministere i- tu- tije imashini ba- fatanya -ije n' akarere ka kicukiro na kanombe ba- ra- gerageza ba- geze nko muri metero umunani bi- ra- nanira -an . ku buryo ha- ri -mo za gaz n' ibindi bintu n' inka ba- ri ba- ra- na- za -e -mo , icyakora tu- bashije ku- bona -mo abantu nka batandatu ku- sa amagufwa yabo ba- giye ku- ya- shyingura hamwe n' abandi . ||| later on , the ministry lent us a machine and people from kicukiro and kanombe dug it up , but they were unable to go over 8 meters because of the gas and the cows remnant ... they were at least able to exhume the remains of 8 people that they buried in respect with other bones .
abantu bi- cirwa -aga hano ba- icwa -aga mu bu- ha -e buryo ? ||| how were these people killed ?
ba- ra- ba- rasa -aga ? ||| were they shot dead ?
babaza -an -aga a- ri bazima ba- ka- bana -aga -mo ? ||| did the perpetrators throw them alive into the pit ?
abantu babaza -an -aga a- ri bazima ba- ka- bi- cira uruhande rw' uru rwobo hanyuma ba- ka- bana -aga -mo , ||| the perpetrators brought them alive to the pit , killed them and then threw them in .
ha- ri -mo n' abo ba- na- za -e -mo a- ri bazima , ||| some were even thrown in alive !
njyewe n- zi nka mukuru wanjye bamunazemo a- ri muzima ya- maze -mo iminsi nk' ibiri a- ri -mo ku- vuga ngo ba- mu- ha -e amazi ngo ba- mu- ha -e amazi , ||| for example , my older brother was thrown in alive . he spent 2 days agonizing and begging for drinking water !
ba- maze ku- mu- ca akaboko bamunagamo a- ri muzima ba- ra- mu- bwira ngo niyihambe . ||| the perpetrators cut up his arm and threw him in mocking him and saying he should bury himself .
abandi ba- ra- rasa -w -aga ? ba- icisha -w -aga amahiri ? ||| what about the others ? did they shoot them or did they use clubs to kill them ?
hano akenshi n' imipanga , ||| here , most of the people were killed with machetes .
n' imipanga cyane cyane ha- rasa -w -aga nk' uwageragezaga wenda ku- iruka , ariko n' imipanga a- ha- n- i- ni n' impiri abandi ba- ka- bana -aga -mo a- ri bazima hano ba- pfuye urupfu rubi cyane . ||| only those who tried escaping were shot . the rest were killed with machetes and clubs or even thrown into the pit alive ! people were subjected to horrible deaths here and it was n't just here because there were other pits .
ariko ntago a- ri aha honyine ha- ri n' ibindi byobo ba- ri -mo ariko uru nirwo barwitaga urwabayanga , ||| this pit was called ‘ urwabayanga ’ and many cows were thrown in .
kubera ko ni ahantu ba- shyira -aga -mo inka nyinshi cyane kandi mu- ra- bona ko inka z' ahangaha za- ri inzungu za- ri inka ziriya za kijyambere , ||| i believe you saw the cows that were here . they are from a very productive race ... we were n't able to do anything about it !
ku buryo za- nanira -an -ye hano ha- ri -mo abantu benshi cyane . ||| there are many people here .
u- gereranya -ije haba ha- ra- tawe -mo nk' abantu ba- ngana iki ? ||| about how many people were thrown in here ?
a- ki- mara ku- pfa iryo joro , ||| the night he died .
ku buryo bamwe ba- ri ba- maze n' iminsi ba- hungiye muri eto , ||| there were people who had already sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro .
bi- ri bi- ra- tangiye kera abantu ba- ri ba- ra- tangiye ku- hunga mbere mu byo mu kwezi kwa gatatu 94 . abantu bamwe ba- ri ba- ra- hungiye ku ma paruwasi , ||| it had started way before ! people had been displaced since march 1994 . then , they 'd sought refuge in parishes .
ku- va ku itariki ya karindwi nibwo abantu ba- tangiye ku- hungira muri eto , ||| it 's only from the 7th of april that they fled to eto .
ariko muri eto a- ba- shoboye ku- va muri eto ba- geze i n- ya- n- za nabo ba- ra- bi- ca , ||| the ones who were lucky to survive the atrocities at eto went to nyanza . when they got to nyanza , they were killed .
ha- rokotse bake cyane kandi muri eto ha- ri -mo abantu ba- geze nko ku bihumbi nka bitanu . ||| very few survived . there were about 5,000 people at eto .
aba ni a- ba- shoboye ku- va muri iyi misozi ba- jya za ka- hanga ba- ra- ongera nanone bamwe ba- ra- bi- ca abandi ba- ra- garuka , ba- zi -ko ba- garutse ba- ba- tangira -ir ahangaha , ||| the ones you see are those who were hiding in the hills of gahanga . some were killed and others came back . when the interahamwes got to know that these people were going to come back here , they trapped them .
ba- ba- tangira -ir ahangaha bose interahamwe za- ri zi- ri kuri iriya misozi yose zabazengurutse . ||| it was all the interahamwes from all the hills around here .
ibyaribyo byose nk' umuntu u- tuye muri aka kagali ka bi- ima -an , kandi u- ka- ba u- ri umwe mu- ba- ba ba- ra- rokotse n- gira ngo u- fite icyo u- zi ku bantu ba- ta -aga -mo abantu ahangaha , ||| i believe that as a survivor and as somebody who lives in this cell of byimana , you know something about the people who were dumping people into the pits .
nti- n- zi niba u- tu- bwira mu magambo makeya ku- bi- erekeye abo bantu ? ||| i 'd like you to tell us about them if possible .
i- na- ha ha- ri interahamwe zizwi cyane , ha- ri interahamwe ha- ri uwo ba- ita -aga gerard karanga -an -w , ha- ri abo ba- ita -aga ba kabagabo , ha- ri abo ba- ita -aga ba bizimungu , ||| among the most popular interahamwes were gerard karanganwa , kabagabo , bizimungu , idi and kagarara .
ha- ri abo ba- ita -aga ba idi , ha- ri abo ba- ita -aga ba ka- ka- rara . mbega hano ha- ri interahamwe nyinshi cyane , inyinshi ntago za- garutse , ||| in fact , there were many interahamwes but most of them did n't come back .
abenshi nti- ba- garutse ndacyeka ba- ki- i- ri muri congo . ||| i think they are still in congo .
abo bose ba- ra- ba- buze , ||| all those interahamwes disappeared but maybe there 's still a chance with the gacaca jurisdictions .
ariko n- ituga -ir amahirwe ahari gacaca zi- ka- za- ba tu- za- komeza tu- ba- ri- rize kuko n- n- jya -e abo bantu n- ra- ba- umvise kuko n- jya -e n- hungiye hariya hafi kuri eto n- n- jya -e n- nyuze mu mirambo yo muri eto , ||| we will continue to get more information . i did n't personally see the people i told you about as i had sought refuge at eto @-@ kicukiro .
ariko ha- ri abantu bamwe ba- giye ba- sigara kuburyo izo nterahamwe za- fatanya -ije n' a- ba- itwa -aga ngo ni abazuru ba- va -aga za kanombe , ||| i crossed over dead bodies ... but some people still survived .
kuko iyi misozi yose ndetse nuko a- ri- n- jya -e u- tanga ubuhamya njyenyine ariko ha- ri abandi benshi ba- bi- zi ba- zi nizo nterahamwe . ||| i heard that those interahamwes were working in association with those of kanombe who were called the ‘ zulus ’ because all these hills ... maybe it 's because i am the one giving you this testimony but there are other people who know better than i do and who even know those interahamwes .
tuza ku- cukura uru rwobo abenshi ba- ri abaturage bo muri iyi misozi i- tu- kikije yose , abenshi ba- ra- ba- zi ba- zi n' a- ba- giye ba- bana -aga ahangaha . ||| we dug this pit ... most of the victims were from neighbouring sectors . those people know them and they know they threw them into this pit !
ariko cyane cyane abo n- ba- bwiye ba bizimungu , ba kabagabo , a- ba- itwa -aga ba karanga -an -w gerard , ||| but the interahamwes such as kabagabo , karanganwa gerard , such as ... are known because they lived here in byimana !
a- ba- itwa ... ibyo aribyo byose izo nterahamwe zirazwi ba- ri ba- tuye kuri uyu musozi wa bi- ima -an aba kanombe bo bazwi nabo ba- ha- tu- riye hariya . ||| i suppose that the interahamwes from kanombe are known by the people from kanombe .
ariko ku buryo hano ha- pfa -ir -iye abantu ba- renze nk' ibihumbi nka bibiri , abo muri uru rwobo n' aha iruhande ba- ra- ha- ri mu- shobora kuza mu- ka- ba- reba ha- ri n' abatarashyingurwa , ||| over 2,000 people were killed at this pit and nearby . you can see it , some of them have n't even been properly buried yet .
mu- ra- za ku- bona ibisigazwa byabo tu- genda tu- bi- bona buhoro buhoro . ||| you will see their remains as time goes .
hano ba- ka- za- ha- kora neza tu- ka- za- ha- ubaka mu nyuma bu- ri mwaka n- ta -w -e tu- ka- za- jya tuza ku- ha- ibuka -ir abacu . ||| we 're planning to build this place so that we can come and commemorate every year .

ubungubu tu- vuga -e -ko abantu benshi baza -aga ahangaha baza -aga mu ma ( pick up ) baje mu camionette ba- zanye n' abasirikare ba- ka- ba- rasa -ir ahangaha ? ||| if we agree that people were brought in pick ups ... were they accompanied by soldiers who shot them afterwards ?
abasirikare ba- ri bavanze n' interahamwe , ||| the interahamwes were mixed with soldiers .
ba- ri bavangavanze abasirikare ba- va -aga za kanombe kandi bose ba- ri ba- fite n' imbunda na za gerenade n' imipanga n' impiri byose . ntago a- ri turiya twonyine , ||| they all came from kanombe and were armed with grenades , guns , machetes , cudgels ... not the ones you sae , check on the other side .

hano ha- ri umuhanda rwose munini n' imihanda ya- ra- garagara -aga neza mbese ba- mara -aga kuba benshi ba- ka- ba- manura hariya , ||| there was a big road here ; the killers would put the victims together and whenever they reached a big number , they took them over there .
abo nibo ba- ha- gera -aga ba- pfuye . ||| the victims were already dead by the time they got there .
n- itwa n- za- ramba justin n- ka- ba n- vuka hano mu kagali ka bi- ima -an , umurenge wa niboye , akarere ka kicukiro . ||| my name is justin nzaramba and i was born here in byimana cell , niboye sector , kicukiro district .
ndi mu myaka mirongo itanu n' ibiri ( 52 ) , n- fite umugore n' abana . ||| i am 52 years , i am maried and i have children .
hano mu ru- bi- ri- zi ha- guye abantu ba- tagira ingano ku buryo ha- ki- boneka ibisigazwa , ||| a big number of people were killed here at rubirizi .
ha- ki- boneka amagufwa aho a- ri -ho hose kuko mu ru- bi- ri- zi ha- ri ibyobo bi- nyura -an -ye ba- giye ba- shyira -mo ibiryo by' inka . ||| they were so many that we still find their remains till this day , there are still bones all over . in fact , there were many pits in rubirizi , they served for the feeding of cows .
ariko imyobo miremire cyane ku buryo abantu ba- ba- vana -aga aho ba- baga bi- hishe mu ki- tu- raga -e ariko abenshi n- shoboye ku- menya nabo ba- vanye kwa conseiller ba- ita -aga bi- zi- ya- remye babaza -an -aga a- ri ninjoro abantu b' abasirikare , ||| however , the people who were hiding in their villages ... i did n't see the ones who were taken from biziyaremye 's house , he was the counsellor . the soldiers used to kidnap them and take them to rubirizi .
ku buryo ba- zanye -mo abantu tu- ri tu- turanye abenshi ba- ri bi- ganje -mo abakobwa , ||| among them were our neighbours , most of them were women .
ba- ka- ba- zana hano muri ru- bi- ri- zi hano . ha- ri umuhanda u- nyuze hano u- vuye hariya za kicukiro ukambukiranya ru- bi- ri- zi u- ka- gera samuduha aha hantu ni mu cyobo hano iruhande ni -ho ha- nyuze umuhanda . ||| there was a road from kicukiro that passed here , near this put and that went up to samuduha .
ha- ri ha- ri imihanda miremire ba- ka- bi- cira ahangaha noneho ba- ka- ongera ba- ka- zamuka -ir hano ha- ri imihanda myinshi ba- ka- zamuka -ir hariya haruguru ba- ka- taha , ||| there were big roads here . the perpetrators were bringing them , killing then and then use a different road to go home since they were so many of them .
ba- higa -aga hose n' a- ba- va -aga , ||| they were chasing all over !
ha- ri n' amabeni ( camion ) ya- jya -aga a- vana abantu ba- pfuye hariya i samuduha nabo babaza -an -aga ahangaha kuko ha- ri umugabo witwa gafaranga ya- n- bwiye yuko abantu ba- kora -aga muri minitrape ba- jya -aga ba- shyira abantu muri bya bimodoka bya minitrape ba- kaza ku- ba- mena -mo hano ru- bi- ri- zi . ||| they ... there were even trucks that brought corpses here from samuduha . there 's a man called gafaranga who told me that drivers from the minitrap [ ministry of transportation ] put corpses into the trucks and then came to throw them here at rubirizi .
ba- icwa -aga mu buryo ki ? ||| how were the victims killed ?
oooh , ||| oh !
barababatemaguraga abo ba- rashe ni bakeya , nti- ba- ba- rasa -aga cyane kuko ba- fata -aga umuntu ba- ka- mu- tema imirambo ba- n- gaga yuko i- guma a- honga -ho iwabo , ||| they cut them down into pieces . very few were shot . they mutilated their victims and then got rid of them because they did n't want to see the corpses of their victims near them .
ariko imyinshi n' i- ya- riwe n' imbwa nanone hano . ha- ri iyo ba- ta- shoboye n- i- bura ku- shyira muri ibyo byobo abenshi ba- riwe n' imbwa ba- pfuye nabi , ||| however , most of the dead bodies were devoured by dogs . they did n't throw all the corpses into pits , the rest was eaten by dogs .
bamwe ba- pfuye ba- umva bamwe ba- pfuye ntago ba- bi- ca -aga burundu barabakomeretsaga ku- sa ba- ka- za- icwa n' ibikomere , ||| in fact , some people were n't completely killed , they mutilated them and then left them to die of the wounds , after suffering greatly . they died a horrible death .
bi- ra- babaje cyane ino ha- bereye ibintu bibi cyane nubwo ba- vuga ibyabereye i n- ya- n- za , ||| what happened here is so atrocious !
cyangwa ibyabereye muri za eto hano ru- bi- ri- zi naho ha- bereye ibintu bi- komeye cyane ibintu bibi . ||| it was terrible even if it 's not spoken about as much as the nyanza and eto @- kicukiro events . there were dreadful scenes of atrocities here at rubirizi !
a- ba- citse ku icumu ni bakeya nkubu ku- bona abantu ba- rokotse muri iyi segiteri cyangwa iyo hakurya ni bake cyane ukurikije ukuntu ba- ri ba- tuye ni bake cyane abenshi ni bashyashya , ||| very few survived here ; when we consider the number of inhabitants of this sector or of the neighbouring ones , we realized that it 's very low compared to the number of the people who lived here before . most of those who live here today are new .
kandi abo bantu b' interahamwe a- ba- funzwe ni bake abandi ba- shobora kuba ba- ri muri congo . ||| in addition , very few interahamwes are in jail . the rest are probably in congo .
icyakora bamwe bi- geze kuza ba- shobora ku- i- rega abandi ba- ra- n- angiye ariko u- bi- rebye ha- pfuye abantu benshi muri kicukiro no muri ru- bi- ri- zi cyane cyane . ||| but some did surrender themselves ; the rest are not there anymore ... in fact , mostly the kicukiro and rubirizi inhabitants lost their lives here .
ibyo aribyo byose nubwo u- vuga ngo hano ha- guye abantu benshi , ||| obviously , if there was a big number of victims , that means the perpetrators were many as well .
bi- ra- umvikana ko ibyo aribyo byose abo bantu nabo ba- ishwe n' abantu benshi n- gira n- ku- baze niba ha- ri abantu mwaba mu- zi ba- ba ba- ra- gize uruhare muri ibi bintu ba- ba ba- ki- ha- ri bakidegembya ahangaha ? ||| i 'd like to ask you if you know some of the people who participated in those acts ... maybe they 're free ... ?
kwidegembya abenshi nti- ba- ki- ha- ri cyane cyane abari muri cdr , ||| free ... most of them are no longer free . those perpetrators were members of cdr and mrnd [ political parties ] .
