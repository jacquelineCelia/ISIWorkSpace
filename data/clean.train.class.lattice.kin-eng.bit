[ i have failed to get a better way of giving you examples ] normally there was a hill where we lived , that hill was called kayumba .
/nfs/isd/jlee/SMT/african/my_git/scripts/class_kin_sent_fsts/162/d1c6fcf21866bb451cb8458d64205dde.fst ||| then there were other hills called murama sector , mwogo sector and muyenzi sector , which sectors surrounded kayumba .
