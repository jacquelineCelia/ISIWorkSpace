I say was married because I am now a widower who left behind a precious baby four days before dying and a 10 year-old boy who unfortunately returned to his grandparents and who had to become separated from his little sister for legal , rather than sentimental reasons .
complications from a Caesarean section started the worst week of my life , the baby was born on Monday and my wife died on Friday .
I am sure that in Paraguay she would have died the same Monday , but there is no looking back to discuss that .

Nigeria : Jos erupts in violence again
in Jos , conflict seems to recur in ever-narrowing cycles : deadly riots rocked the city in 1994 , 2001 , 2008 and – not even two months ago – in January 2010 .
the current conflict is said to have started in reprisal for the destruction that occurred in January — there have been reports of children and the elderly being particularly targeted by roving gangs armed with guns and machetes .
like the previous riots , the current conflict in Jos has been fought along sectarian lines – Jos lies on the border between Nigeria &apos;s Muslim-majority North and Christian-majority South .
access to land and resources is often determined by whether one is a native , or “ indigene ” , of the historically Christian city , or a “ settler ” from elsewhere ( “ settlers ” are most often Muslims from the North ; see a Human Rights Watch report on the subject here for more on the subject ) .
many sources have placed the death toll in the hundreds : Al-Jazeera and the BBC both reported more than 500 casualties , although one government source put the figure at 55 official deaths . quick burials make it difficult to accurately assess the total dead , while political considerations also lead to discrepancies in the numbers .
Shuaibu Mohammed of Reuters gives one explanation :
death tolls have been highly politicised in previous outbreaks of unrest in central Nigeria , with various factions accused of either exaggerating the figures for political ends or downplaying them to try to douse the risk of reprisals .
in the blogosphere , horror , shame and empathy were the prevalent emotions .
Linda Ikeji posted a photo on her blog which graphically displayed the carnage .
she wrote :
no , I won &apos;t take the picture down .
this is our shame and failure as a country .
let &apos;s all stare at it !
a commenter on her site agreed with her decision :
thanks for leaving it up because we have to stop pretending everything is alright … it is time for these things to stop … .
several bloggers drew parallels between the earthquake in Haiti and the violence in Jos .
Tywo , another commenter on Linda Ikeji &apos;s post wrote :
God has blessed Nigeria so much .
I mean , we rarely have natural disasters and things like that .
we only have deaths that are caused by heartless humans .
the truth is we are not moving forward .
Babajidesalu shared a similar view :
as the world is experiencing natural disasters , Nigeria is experiencing self inflicted disasters .
the latest massacre in Jos attests to this observation .
in the aftermath of the January 2010 riots , one blogger started a site , We are Jos , to help the victims of the rioting .
she explained her motivation as follows :
it was the effort of wyclef jean that made other stars come together to give towards Haiti .
I noticed some Naija bloggers even gave towards Haiti while at the same time decrying what happened in Jos , VERBALLY while saying God should help Nigeria .
I &apos;ve often wondered why we Nigerians complain and proffer no explanations or solutions to the problems that herald us .
in whatever small way I can , I try to solve a problem or even make an effort .
f , another commenter on Linda Ikeji &apos;s post , saw the problem as broader than religion , and endemic to the country as a whole :
the nonsense will stop in Jos when the nonsense stops in Abuja .
all this shadowy politics needs to cease so that the people can have access to basic amenities .
they say a hungry man is an angry man .
it is the same in the Niger Delta .
if everyone was well-fed , had access to quality education , power supply , clean water and a decent standard of living , who would think of trying to kill off another religious / ethnic group seen to be “ competing for space ” ?
… We will continue to express anger / disgust at these killings- this will not stop them from happening .
dealing with the root cause is the only solution to this on-going tragedy .
Adeola Aderounmu expressed a similar view , laying the blame with Nigeria &apos;s leaders :
the Jos issue is not a local issue .
it is a reflection of the lack of democracy and failure of the system .
we have no defined system and the country is built on very useless people instead of strong institutions and good principles of governance .
but a commenter on his post disagreed :
you are always separating the elite from the masses .
at one time or another the elite emerged from the masses .
so you can ’ t really separate them .
( many members of the masses are striving to join the elite ) .
the failure of Nigeria and Nigerians as a people collectively has to be shared all round .
Nigerians will have to look at themselves as a society and question why they have systematically over 50 years done nothing to arrest the slide into oblivion and hopelessness ?
why is it when the get a sniff of power , they do all the wrong things ?
the fact is that most of society is corrupt , as such corrupt practices are condoned , in some cases celebrated …
since the violence began on Sunday , army and police forces have taken control of the city , making more than 100 arrests .
SolomonSydelle reported on the possibility that the International Criminal Court may step in to bring judicial resolution to the situation and avert a spiral of future reprisals .

Tunisia : 2011 in Citizen Media Photos
this post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Revolution 2011 .
the year 2011 has been an extraordinary year for Tunisia – a historic year that will be engraved into the memory of every Tunisian .
what started as a spontaneous act of despair in the forgotten and marginalised region of Sidi Bouzid , turned into a popular uprising that would sweep the country , topple the 23-year rule of Zeine el Abidine Ben Ali , and change the face of the entire region as one Arab country after the other picked up the revolution fervour .
a bloody beginning of the year

the year had a bloody and violent beginning .
authorities responded to the protesters ’ demands of “ employment , freedom , and national dignity ” with live bullets , and tear gas , killing more than 300 protesters and injuring many more .
the day the former president fled to Saudi Arabia
on January 14 , 2011 , thousands of protesters gathered outside the building of the Interior Ministry in the capital Tunis .
the protesters were chanting ” Interior Ministry is a Terrorist Ministry ” , and ” Ben Ali Dégage ” ( Ben Ali Get Out ) .
the demonstration which started peaceful , ended up with police violently dispersing protesters .
later on the same day , Ben Ali fled to Jeddah , Saudi Arabia .

Tunisians were keen to cut all ties with the past , and the battle for democracy in Tunisia , did not stop with Ben Ali fleeing the country .
Kasbah square , where the Cabinet building is located , became an epicenter of sit-ins and protests , which sought to overthrow the so hated former ruling party ( now dissolved ) , the RCD ( from its French acronym Le Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique , Constitutional Democratic Rally in English ) , which was associated with corruption and oppression .

the Islamist party Ennahdha won 41 per cent of the votes , and gained 89 out of 217 seats at the constituent assembly .
for liberals , the rise of Islamists in Tunisia , is a threat to the secular values of the state , and Tunisian women &apos;s rights , considered as the most advanced in the Arab region .

on December 12 , the national constituent assembly elected human rights activist Moncef Marzouki , who was imprisoned , and exiled under Ben Ali ’ regime , as the new President of the Republic of Tunisia .
as the year comes to an end , protests and sit-ins for democracy , employment , and dignity continue in Tunisia , as heated debates sweep the national constituent assembly , and an interim government presided by Hamadi Jebali ( from Ennahdha ) takes up duties .

Mauritania : mining Workers Protest ‘ New Kind of Slavery ’
the northern Mauritanian cities of Zouerat and Nouadhibou are witnessing protests by workers who are not registered .
more than 2,300 workers are protesting in the mining city of Zouerat , which has led to complete paralysis of some ten National Mining and Industrial Company sites ( SNIM ) in addition to disrupting work in other locations .
the workers are demanding to benefit from the wage increase granted recently by SNIM to its employees ; they are also asking for social security , in addition to the right to be given work priority for being Mauritanian citizens , compared to foreign workers from the neighboring states .
new kind of slavery
such workers , known as “ journalia ” workers in the local dialect , are also asking for a direct contract with SNIM rather than contracts with outsourcing companies , which only pay 40 per cent of the SNIM wages to every laborer , something they consider human trafficking and a new kind of slavery .
protesters also threatened to hold a march from Zouerat to Nouakchott , similar to the one organized by Nouadhibou activists earlier .
in Nouadhibou , “ journalia ” workers are also staging a protest against what they call human trafficking ; about 1,000 laborers are threatening to halt work and engage in an open strike .
photo of the Journalia Protest in Nouadhibou by Mauritannet blog
the demonstration in Zouerat
Mauritannet blog wrote about these protests and you can read about the Zouerat events in the Facebook Page of the 25th of February Movement :
the city of Zouerat has been living on the rhythm of the protest of workers , which has entered its second week .
Zouerat residents have shown their sympathy with the strikers and have manifested this by offering assistance to them so that their protest continues .
the city &apos;s artists and poets are performing every night for them to incite them to continue their struggle for their rights .
in Zouerat now , more than 2,300 workers are protesting against what they call human trafficking and they are calling to terminate their contract established with the intermediary companies .
Mauritanian blogger Alddedd Wald Al Sheik &#91; ar &#93; also wrote about this issue :
the problem lies in the fact that the companies pay to its legal official employees four times the salaries it pays to the “ journalia , ” and has also increased their wages while it ignored the demands of journalia workers , which is according to unionists a dangerous precedent that might lead to the escalation and explosion of the situation in the company .
Ahmed Haymoudane &#91; ar &#93; denounces the absence of any intention to solve the crisis by the concerned company :
there are no signs of solutions so far and that is due to :
- The insistence of SNIM to continue exploiting Mauritanian workers in a way that brings back the memory of African workers exploitation in sugarcane fields in America in previous times .
- The insistence of the workers to go on with their strike and not bow to pressures applied by the company against them threatening to replace them with foreign workers .
- The insistence of authorities to shut up anyone who raises his voice demanding his rights in the country so that the revolution contagion doesn &apos;t spread and things don &apos;t get out control .
Alddedd Wald Al Sheikh tweets as well :
@ dedda04 : rights revolution and signs of rebellion prevailing in Mauritania are starting to reach the journalia workers
Ukraine : Victor Yushchenko &apos;s Popularity Waning
according to a poll carried out last month , Ukraine &apos;s president Victor Yushchenko “ would have won less than 2.9 % of the vote if the presidential elections were held in late December 2008 or early January 2009 . ” Among reasons for such low approval ratings is “ the relentless infighting ” between the president and PM Yulia Tymoshenko .
on Feb . 5 , Tymoshenko &apos;s cabinet survived a no-confidence vote in parliament : the motion won 203 votes in the 450-seat assembly ; a minimum of 226 votes is required for a motion to pass .
LEvko of Foreign Notes wrote this about the implications of the vote for the president and his political allies :
only 10 &#91; NUNS &#93; deputies supported a &#91; PoR &#93; -sponsored no confidence motion in the Tymoshenko-led government in the Ukrainian parliament today .
amongst the 10 were presidential secretariat head Viktor Baloha &apos;s ‘ Yedyniy Tsentr ’ group , and Yushchenko &apos;s brother Petro .
the numbers are very bad news for the president .
the pro-presidential NUNS entered the current parliament with 72 deputies in Autumn 2007 .
with an ever-receding power base , the chances of a second presidential term for Yushchenko are almost nil .
also on Feb . 5 , LJ user kotyhoroshko wrote this ( UKR ) about the president :
a way out for the country
Yushchenko now has a historically ideal opportunity to resign .
his resignation will partly solve the political crisis .
he will avoid the unnecessary trouble related to the &#91; upcoming presidential &#93; election campaign .
he will not drown in the &#91; fecal matter of discrediting information on him &#93; .
perhaps , in some 20 years , he will be remembered as not the worst president .
people &apos;s memory is short .
below are some of the comments to this post ( UKR ) :
marmuletka :
unfortunately , Yushchenko isn &apos;t reading your LJ &#91; blog &#93; .
ukrainietis :
he will be idolized again not in 20 years but in two or three years .
because those who will replace him will most likely be &#91; extremely inadequate &#93; …
the problem is that Yushchenko &apos;s orbit is comprised of those who are profiteering from their proximity to the president .
it &apos;s them who are holding him by the throat , singing panegyrics to him and are assuring him with foam at their mouths that &#91; he &#93; hasn &apos;t fulfilled his mission yet .
and this is why Yushchenko &apos;s circle will not allow this to happen .
but I agree – it &apos;s a very good time to at least declare this : “ I &apos;m not going to run for a second term and I will not create obstacles for the government until the end of this term .
but from now on , all responsibility for the state of things is exclusively on &#91; the government &#93; . ”
irishhighlander :
the best option is this : let these non-traditionally gifted people collectively lead the country to default .
and then leave .
all of them – Yushchenko , and Tymoshenko , and &#91; Yanukovych &#93; , and the whole &#91; parliament &#93; .
and even better – a collective hara-kiri .

Zambia : President Angers Citizens in Diaspora
Zambia ’ s President Michael Sata has invited the ire of citizens living abroad for ridiculing them during a three day visit to neighbouring Botswana and also dashing their hopes for inclusion of dual citizenship , an issue discussed on many a forum , in the new republican constitution currently being written .
President Sata , before and after he took office .
photo source : Zambian People
part of the question and session went like this :
Questions- whats the status of the Dual citizenship ?
Sata : which town are you from ?
Monze &#91; a town in Zambia &#93; ?
do you want to belong to Monze and Namwala &#91; a town in Zambia &#93; ?
because RB &#91; Rupiah Banda &#93; was from Gwanda in Zimbabwe that ’ s why he wanted Dual citizenship
question : it is difficult for us living in Diaspora to get land back home , what is the Govt doing about it ?
Sata : what are you doing in Botswana ?
answer : I am a teacher !
Sata : go back to Zambia and teach your relatives then you will get Land
question : Mr President , you never consulted on the Ithezhi tezhi and Chirundu districts &#91; the two districts are being moved from Southern Province to Central and Lusaka Provinces respectively &#93;
Sata : whom did you consult to come to Botswana ?
concluding remarks- President Sata
all of you who are here with fake questions am very disappointed with you and embarrassed , are you not even ashamed of yourselves ?
you ran away from Zambia and thought we couldn ’ t find you and now today we have caught you .
you are refugees in Botswana being exploited by the Botswana Govt .
you left Zambia to come and work here for an extra K1 ?
on teachers and doctors working in Botswana where many flocked to from the late 1980 to the early 2000s , President Sata said :
you are busy educating Tswanas leaving your own relatives in Zambia uneducated and you are proud ?
all of you were educated by your parents who never even finished standard 7 and struggled to educate you and you run away from them ?
doctors
your relatives are dying in Zambia you are busy saving tswana lives ?
accountants
Botswana has only 5 shops and you call your self an accountant when Diamond mines want a consultant they will call a South African and not a Zambian , what are you still doing here ?
President Sata ’ s responses and earlier statement at another function during his Botswana visit , contrasted that of his foreign minister Given Lubinda who had told the Botswana-based Zambians that the PF government policy was that Zambians in the Diaspora did not have to relocate back to Zambia .
reacting to Sata &apos;s comments , John , a Zambian Watchdog reader , said :
the President ’ s speech was very personal , emotional and uneducated .
it is a pity for Africa because power is increasingly being handed to the biggest noise makers through the ballot ; rather than leaders with clear policies on how to govern and develop their countries .
what is H.E ’ s level of education ?
it is no longer plausible that educated people ( or even uneducated ones ) should live in their countries of birth .
that is so 1970s when Africa continously moaned about “ brain drain ” .
is the Zambian president aware of something called “ diaspora remittances ” or “ brain gain ” ?
is he aware that remittances from the Diaspora are currently being harnessed to build roads , airports , and technological cities in Nigeria , Kenya and recently the Republic of Southern Sudan ?
Nkoya Nationalist , one of the few , agreed with President Sata :
the President elect is right , Zambia has a small population of which out of that only a small percentage are professionals in various fields and disciplines .
of those professionals , almost 3 / 4 are out of the country working for other nations .
who then is going to develop the country if our professionals are all abroad working for other nations ?
why should anyone complain about substandard ministers and government officials when you professionals are not available to be considered for those same roles and positions ?
do you know that Zambia would probably be one of the best countries in the world if only our professionals would be more patriotic by coming back home to contribute towards the development of the country ?
an anguished Peace Maker wrote :
those doubting this story should think twice .
you mean you dont know our President ?
our President needs 24 / 7 monitoring because he will keep on embarrasing us .
he needs serious guidance in everything .
his energy should be guided to something productive and as much as possible try not to expose him to such situations and if so do it off camera for goodness sake . so far , I think prevention is better than cure !
we are already in a mess and nothing to defend but to help him !
ultimately it is not only him to experience the shame but every Zambian regardless of the Party one belongs to .
we have a task at hand ! !
this remains a thorn in my fresh , borrowing St Paul ’ s experience .
there is little we can do but nurse this issue up to 2016 when , with due respect , we must plan for a smooth exit strategy for him .
we cant continue like this thereafter.Its agony and terrible nightmare !
on the Facebook group , 90 days ( Government thumbs up / down every 90 days , Maria Kapambwe Kasolo , gave the reason why Zambians left the country en masse :
you know why professionals left for Botswana – better salary !
I know of a number of them who have done well for themselves n families .
had they stayed in zed they would not have achieved anything .
GRZ should improve condtions of service n pipo will not go searching for greener pastures .
some of u r saying mCS was right in answering the way he did – I am saying the president needs to use diplomacy regardless – he should ask why they left n not castigate them – aint right at all !
responding to Maria Kapambwe Kasolo ’ s post , Arnold Chinyemba wrote :
he is thinking every Zambian is a ngwangwazi ( tout ) .
hence to him allowing street vendors is empowering Zambians .

Somalia : deep Divisions Over New Constitution
Somalia has not had a central government controlling the entire country since the fall of Muhammad Siad Barre in 1991 .
the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) is the internationally recognized government of the Republic of Somalia .
after political discussions in Ethiopian , leaders of various Somali parties agreed to political steps to end the transitional period and elect a new president .
one of the steps outlined in a detailed timetable is the drafting of a new constitution .
technical Revision Committee for the new constitution participated in a 4-day working session in Nairobi :

a four-day working session with the Signatories ’ Technical Revision Committee has been concluded in Nairobi .
the working session is a follow up to the recent Addis Signatories ’ meeting were most of the constitutional issues were agreed and some of the provisions – prepared by the Independent Federal Constitution Commission – have been amended after congenial political negotiations between the signatories of the Roadmap to end the transition , which was adopted in Mogadishu last September .
the technical Revision Committee ’ s mandate as per Addis Ababa ’ s Communiqué is to complete the constitutional process .
the Minister of Constitutional Affairs who convened the meeting explained to the participants and the media that “ that road towards ending of the transition is getting closer and closer by the day , and we need to collectively work towards delivering a constitution that Somalia deserves and which serves its people .

Mahad Abdalle Awad , Deputy-Minister Ministry of Planning International Cooperation in Somalia , is optimistic that the country will soon have a new constitution :
Fearmongers use scare tactics to influence public opinion to impede change and progress by disseminating false information about the draft constitution and the planned Constituent Assembly meeting .
Naysayers , natural skeptics and cynical people among us , habitually express negativity about the accomplishment of others and are pessimistic about change .
Dale Carnegie ’ s famous quote fittingly describes the nature of Naysayers when he wrote “ Any fool can criticize , condemn and complain , and most fools do . ”
these Naysayers often spread blatant lies to oppose anything other people do .
in the case of the Constituent Assembly , they assert that the constitution can only be approved by popular referendum , disregarding discernible historical fact that the Somali Republic itself was founded by the 1960 Constitution , approved by Constituent Assembly of only 110 delegates , and a process that took only 29 days , whereby public referendum was held 21st of July 1961 , after more than one year .
however , Mohamed Ali Hassan , Chairman of the Somali-American Peace Council and Manuela Melandri , PhD candidate at University College London , note that most Somalis look at the draft constitution with deep skepticism :
the optimism of the international community is not shared by Somalis themselves , who instead look with deep skepticism at a document that they perceive as externally-imposed , faulty and fundamentally undemocratic .
to understand this dynamic , one should start by questioning the facts .
what is wrong with the new Somali Constitution and why has the adoption of this document been met with resistance by educated Somalis , religious figures , secularists , former Somali Prime Ministers , women , scholars and by Somali Diaspora organizations ?
first , there are issues concerning the content of the Constitution and the substance of its provisions .
above all , the question of federalism remains deeply divisive .
views can be found both in support of and against Somalia adopting a federal structure .

but one Somali argue that the new constitution can be improved in the future .
Somalis do not have time to wait for a a perfect constitution :
whether we like it or not , when we see images of the Somali people around the world and we compare our own situation ( at least , those in the Diaspora that live in peace ) , do we feel that those brothers and sisters need a constitution that works for them now since they are dealing with horrible situations ?
think about this : maxay ku gaaraan mustaqbalka ?
you have to know that I did not write those news articles mentioned above , Iam not part of the group that put together of the new constitution and I am not here to justify whether the new constitution is good , bad or ugly .
all I want to remind you is that : those that are in need may not have time to wait a new perfect and pretty constitution ; they need one that works for them for the time being . more importantly , I am not here to oppose anyone ’ s idea – I am just expressing my own views as anyone else .
however , the best solution that I see , at least in my opinion , let us commence discussing how to improve the new constitutions in the future .
Mohamud Uluso considers the draft constitution “ a hurried job , with the latest version available only in Somali language while various outdated or fake versions are circulating on the web ” :
it appears that the UN-wise roadmap for Somalia is nothing but part of a plan of perfidy to keep Somalia and the Somalis in turmoil .
instead of liberating the true Somalis , who need and want to continue living in and developing their own country and their communities inside Somalia , the planned constitution appears as the manifestation of the shackles of foreign as well as internal oppression of the indigenous Somali people in perpetuity .
according to insiders FGM &#91; Transitional Federal Government &#93; is now permitted by the newly proposed Somali constitution , which will be presented for adoption to selected “ traditional leaders ” .
a typical scheme how the UN and their stooges want to get it their way – or the way their master wants it .
Abduallhi Jamaa analyses various arguments about the draft constitution appearing online , vernacular radios and in village meetings and cafes :
analysts say the proposed law is seemingly a milestone , but one that may fracture Somalia further into autonomous and semi-autonomous regions as well as ministates .
“ There is absolute confusion .
there wasn ’ t any civic education to put across the letter and spirit of the proposed laws and this means that most people are not comfortable with the contents , many more have not heard about the whole process , ” he &#91; Hassan Sheikh , the leader of the Party of Peace and Development &#93; told Somalia Report .
amongst the contentious issues include the proposed model of government , the controversial issue of natural resources and the religious influence .
some players argue that the language of the draft is not understandable , an issue that can lead to various kinds of misinterpretation .
“ The issue isn &apos;t just about the dispute over the contents .
it is related to an absence of public representation .
I do not wish to be part of a constituent assembly that does not represent Somalia ’ s vision and mission , ” said traditional elder Mohamed Hersi .
Google Ideas developed a pilot project with the Somali service , Africa Division of Voice of America ( VOA ) to help Somalis register their opinions with just a few clicks .
the poll shows , among other things , that Somalis want a Somalia based on the civil and criminal codes of Sharia , a strong central government and are divided over the inclusion of women in government .
Honduras : Zelaya Arrested and Removed as President
the day started across Honduras with news that President Mel Zelaya was arrested in his home by armed soldiers .
a referendum vote was scheduled for the same day , which was one that was opposed by the Supreme Court , the Armed Forces and the Honduran legislature .
days earlier , Zelaya had removed the head of the Armed Forces , General Romeo Vásquez Velásquez , which was followed by the resignation by other top military officials because they would not support the vote .
it was soon learned that Zelaya had been taken to Costa Rica , where he continued to call himself as the legal head of state .
there was also a rumor that Zelaya had resigned .
however , the alleged letter turned out to be false notes Juan Carlos Rivera of Miradas de Halcón .
the reaction from the blogosphere and twittosphere ranged from calling the situation a coup d &apos;état to those who saw the move as the only way to stop Zelaya &apos;s controversial move .

there have been power outages in the capital city , as reported by Honduras Daily News , which speculates that it is an “ attempt to limit the passing of information . ” However , information is currently being passed through social networking sites like Twitter and Blipea , which were very active throughout the day .
a supporter of Zelaya , Hibueras wrote :
Manuel Zelaya was arrested and subjected to brute force by a criminal element that has enslaved the Honduran people , in order to prevent the people from obtaining power for the sake of inclusion and the construction of their homeland , those responsible for such a disgraceful act are well-known and they will pay for their abuses .
it is time to search by other means , those things which we are denied through peaceful means , and those responsible for their acts of treason will be judged .

later in the day , Congress voted to remove Zelaya as president and installed Roberto Micheletti , who had been president of the legislative body .
soon after , he announced that new elections would be held as scheduled in November .
however , the installation of Micheletti as acting president has drawn the criticism from many of Honduras ’ closest allies , especially from Venezuela , who has threatened military action if any of its diplomats in Honduras are kidnapped or killed .
in addition , President Hugo Chávez has said that the new government led by Micheletti would be defeated .
some twitterers like Hugo Chinchilla is worried about the statements made by Chávez and take it as a sign that there may be involvement from these allies .
he was told “ unofficially ” that the military is preparing for a possible intervention by Venezuelan and Nicaraguan troops .
there are others like Jorge Garcia , who is supporting the military new government and is urging his Twitter followers to provide support to soldiers with food and drink .
he also states :
in # honduras there was no coup d &apos;etat , the rule of law continues , the Constitution remains in effect .
now that much of the world &apos;s attention is on Honduras , Wilmer Murillo is worried about being isolated by the international community .
he pleads :
give back Mel !
we are looking like a backward ( country ) in front of the eyes of the world .

the international organization asks users to contribute comments to a project that has many bloggers worried about preserving cultures . UNESCO Map of Languages at Risk
Iglesia Descalza , a librarian , blogs :
as someone who loves languages , I am chagrined to read the news coming out of UNESCO &apos;s presentation of the updated Atlas of the World ’ s Languages in Danger of Disappearing .
according to the Atlas , unveiled on the eve of International Mother Language Day ( 21 February ) , nearly 200 languages have fewer than 10 speakers and 178 others have between 10 and 50 speakers .
the data shows that out of the 6,000 languages currently in existence , over 200 have died out over the last three generations , 538 are critically endangered , 502 severely endangered , 632 definitely endangered and 607 unsafe .
as the last remaining speakers of a language pass away , the language itself dies .
the language of Manx in the Isle of Man died out in 1974 when Ned Maddrell , the last speaker , passed away while Eyak , in Alaska , United States , met its demise last year with the death of Marie Smith Jones .
we need to prize bio-diversity , cultural and racial diversity , and linguistic diversity because we lose too much by becoming homogenized into one big , white , English-speaking society .
while disappearing languages are mostly those of indigenous peoples faced with globalization and state-nationalism , Daniel Moving Out , a blog by a Portugal native now in the UK , says not all “ unofficial ” languages are dying out :
the Galician sounds like a cross between Spanish and Portuguese , somewhat like a dialect originated from the second and enriched with vocabulary and accent of the first .
the language is originated from the Galician-Portuguese of medieval times , and it was spoken at all the County of Portucale . &#91; … &#93;
this week , the Unesco atlas of world languages was released , regarding Galician as a strong language among those that are not the main languages of any country .
it receives protection from the Castilian ( common Spanish ) from being geographically close to Portugal .
the blog , nonetheless , summarizes some of the worst data :
199 languages have less than a dozen of native speakers .
in Indonesia , the 4 remaining speakers of Lengilu talk within &#91; themselves &#93; ; the Karaim in Ukraine is kept by only 6 people .
over than 200 different languages have disappeared in the last 3 generations .
the Manx , from the Isle of Man , here in the UK died with the last native speaker in 1974 .
but not everyone is concerned with disappearing languages .
commenting on TED blog , user Magnus Lindkvist says :
&#91; … &#93; Why do we insist on romanticizing ancient languages that arguably noone wants to speak anymore ?
what about the hundreds of new programming languages that have sprung up in the past decades ?
or the infinite variations of English that people are adopting and “ remixing ” to make their own around the world ?
these are real languages and show a lot more vitality than Manx and Tirahi .
Abdullah Waheed , a native speaker of Dhivehi – an “ official ” language yet one with not many speakers in Maldives – explains in one example why language preservation matters :
Dhivehi language is absolutely vital to the identity of Maldivians as a people and Maldives as a country , because it is the only feature we all share and which few others have .
it is a strategic factor in our advances towards sustainable development and the harmonious coordination of our affairs .
far from being a field reserved for writers , Dhivehi lies at the heart of all social , economic and cultural life .
Dhivehi does matter to all of us .
it matters when we want to promote cultural diversity , and fight illiteracy , and it matters for quality education , including teaching in the first years of schooling .
it matters in the fight for greater social inclusion , for creativity , economic development and safeguarding indigenous knowledge .
Egypt vs. Algeria : the Twitter Match
in much of the world , nothing is more unifying – or in some instances , more polarizing – than a football match .
fans of Egypt and Algeria , across the Arab world and beyond , proved that this Saturday as their teams went head to head to qualify for the World Cup finals in South Africa .
while tensions ran highest in Cairo , they were also alive and well in the virtual sphere , including on Twitter , where many users reported their screen was filled with football sentiment .
Twitter user mbaa sent a capture of his screen , which was flooded with talk of the match :
a tweet from Egyptian embee demonstrated the fanaticism of some fans :
some reports claim that tickets are now entirely sold out !
at the same time , Egyptian NoraYounis expressed disbelief at the unifying power of football for Egyptians :
Egyptian NohaAtef ‘ s tweet , on the other hand , showed the uplifting properties of football :
in many instances , the football matched unearthed national rivalries .
Algerians and Egyptians went head to head on Twitter as the game was taking place .
Egyptian Sandmonkey quipped :
Algerian-American themoornextdoor fought back , joking :
finally , Algerian reemba reminded us that it ain &apos;t over till it &apos;s over :

Malaysia : press Freedom Advocate Sues Blogger
a veteran journalist-blogger is being sued for libel by a politician who is known for espousing press freedom in Malaysia .
Zaid Ibrahim , former Minister in the Prime Minister &apos;s Department , was offended by a blog article written by A Kadir Jasin last October .
aside from suing the blogger , Zaid wants the writer to apologize .
what is peculiar in this case is that Zaid is known for supporting Malaysian bloggers who have been sued by powerful individuals and corporations .
Zaid himself is also a blogger .
in fact , he made a rebuttal to the “ offensive ” article written by Jasin in his own blog .
Rocky &apos;s Bru is surprised that Zaid is now part of an elite group of individuals who are suing bloggers
I can &apos;t explain how Zaid Ibrahim , whom I once described as “ maverick ” , has gone down this way .
now Zaid has joined the queue of influential and wealthy individuals who are suing bloggers .
with his latest action , I no longer want to describe Zaid as a “ maverick ” .
a maverick is unique , someone who dares go against the flow , a person you respect – even grudgingly – for his principles .
Mat Cendana is worried that the case may lead to more defamation suits in Malaysia
in my opinion , this post , while certainly not flattering to Zaid , isn ’ t of “ saman class ” – heck , if this is ruled as defamation , then we ’ ll see at least 10 such cases being filed at the courts daily !
Jebat is questioning the basis for filing the suit :
what is so wrong about the article which made him issue a writ of summon to Kadir Jasin ?
is there any element of defamation in it ?
didn ’ t Zaid write a few allegatory statements concerning Kadir Jasin in his own rebuttal as well ?
so , what is the contentious issue ?
all of Pakatan Rakyat supporters are supporting Zaid Ibrahim anyway .
who cares if one negative article was published in blogosphere ?
you mean to say , people cannot write whatever they want ?
since when ?
when he and all the opposition bloggers write tremendous amount of unfair accusations and uncouth articles defaming everyone else , it is fine .
but when one is confronted with a ghost from the past , he became rattled and couldn ’ t sleep peacefully .
the irony is , he would like to be seen as liberal and the fighter of press freedom and freedom of speech .
nevertheless , it is his right to sue people as much as it was Kadir Jasin ’ s right to write that article .
unlike some people who ran away like a coward , I am sure Kadir Jasin will commence all the necessary legal actions to defend his article based on any evidence that he can produce .
at bigdogdotcom , the writer is disappointed that Zaid is using the case to gain political and media mileage
what Zaid is trying to achieve is unclear .
obviously , since joining PKR , Zaid how has been infected with the acute ‘ Suit Syndrome ’ that only Former-Abuse-of-Power Anwar “ Mat King Leather ” Ibrahim suffer .
now Zaid has been infected with the Acute Lackofattentionitis dissease .
how far can Zaid go with this is also unclear .
obviously , he needed the media and legal circus to make himself ‘ relevant ’ to stay on visible
Chile : earthquake Reveals Social Inequalities
the February 27 earthquake in Chile left more than 2 million displaced , at least 497 confirmed deaths , and an estimated US $ 30 billion in damage .
however , the lawlessness that ensued after the quake also left Chileans with a moral question : is Chilean society a just one ?
after the quake hit , a majority of Chileans helped others , assisted their neighbors in need , shared their food surpluses , and donated money in unprecedented ways .
nevertheless , a minority , however small , looted non-essentials , robbed homes , and intentionally set fire to department stores , despite the fact that the Chilean government allowed people to take essentials , such as milk , baby formula , bread , and flour .
photo of empty supermarket in Concepción by heedmane and used under a Creative Commons license .
Chilean TV stations brought this reality to the homes of millions in a fairly accurate fashion , and so Chileans saw how some helped themselves to plasma TVs , refrigerators , and DVD players .
the images of crime and looting , and especially the looting of non-essentials , began a national debate about existing social and economic inequalities in Chile .
in an article titled “ What type of wood are we made of ?
&#91; es &#93; , ” Ricardo Carbone , a blogger , professor , and Director of the Center for Social Reflection and Action at Alberto Hurtado University , argues that the quake exposed major social problems , and that it brought down the facades and appearances of Chilean society .
here , Carbone refers to the facades of people who looted non-essentials and worsened an already difficult situation :
… like the fallen buildings , the facade &#91; of Chileans &#93; was one of well-educated citizens that were connected with the world and consumerism , but their interior was not held by solid values or strong principles .
swiftly , and at the first sign of trouble , they hurried to take what they could .
the blogger exhorts Chileans to not only rebuild their infrastructure , but also to reinforce values that would create a better , more inclusive society .
he also asked readers :
can we expect something different in a system that generates segregation and social exclusion ?
is it a product of a society that forces competition and to fix things oneself ?
most readers of this blog post agreed with the notion that Chile needs to do a lot of groundwork in education and the inculcation of values .
one such reader was Alejandra Muñoz :
our bubble burst and the truth hurts .
now we ought to understand it , accept it and work for the reconstruction of our buildings and society .
we can forgive , but we cannot forget what has happened , for there will be a next time and it cannot catch us without learning from our errors .
though most Chileans agree that the public education system has not succeeded at providing equal opportunities to all Chileans , the looting of non-essentials could not have only been caused by a lack of strong “ good values . ”
Coyuntura Política , a Chilean blog , published the article The Earthquake and the Fractures of Chile by José Aylwin , Co-director of Observario Ciudadano , a Chilean human rights nonprofit located in Araucanía region .
with regard to the looting of non-essentials , Aylwin writes :
these lootings , at least in some cases , are explained by the perception of injustice that exists in segments of the population that , in moments of emergency such as this one , consider it legitimate to empty the shelves of superstores and supermarkets that , with the backing of the State , have accumulated wealth at their expense , while they remain poor .
in the article Collateral Damage , Patricio Navia , a blogger and professor , explains that in similar natural disasters in other countries , disorder has occurred too .
to him , the fault lies with the government :
video by YouTube user IORITER1 taken in Concepción :
in the blog Humanism and Connectivity , Andrés Schuschny posted an article titled Earthquake .
he describes the looting as follows :
it is terrible how a natural catastrophe unmasks the face of inequality in a country whose officials refuse to acknowledge it .
Chile , with a prosperous and growing economy in the past decades , is considered to be a country with “ high human development ” by the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) .
nonetheless , this economic growth is somewhat tainted by the country ’ s income inequality .
the data in the UNDP ’ s Human Development Report for 2009 ( .pdf format ) shows that out of 147 countries with an available Gini coefficient ( measure used to calculate income inequality ) , Chile ranks 124 , despite the fact that it is ranked number 44 in terms of human development .
after Kony 2012 , “ What I Love About Africa ” Reclaims Narrative
this post is part of our special coverage Kony 2012 .
anyone following online citizen media closely this month , would inevitably have come across the heated global debate over the Invisible Children viral campaign to stop Ugandan war criminal and rebel army leader Joseph Kony .
while the Kony 2012 campaign certainly received the attention it sought , many Ugandans and Africans felt its message lacked the nuance required by context , and was more focused on raising funds for the organisation &apos;s own survival rather than empowering the people affected by the conflict .
furthermore , many African citizens felt that once again , the narrative of a highly publicized story about Africa centered on a negative story and neglected the upwards trends the continent has been witnessing .
as a counter measure , many people started posting stories on Twitter about “ what they love about Africa ” with the hash tag # WhatILoveAboutAfrica .
what I love About Africa trending worlwide by Semhar Araia – @ Semhar
the initiative , spearheaded by Semhar Araia , a blogger at the Diaspora African Women Network ( DAWNS ) , started to trend worldwide on Twitter on March 13 , 2012 .
the other side of the story
while no one argues with the merit of exposing the despicable crimes perpetuated by Kony &apos;s Lord &apos;s Resistance Army , the following citizen media commentaries explain why this debate is more than just a “ meme war ” but a struggle to reclaim the international perception and narrative about an entire continent .
when a group of North Ugandans , the main victims of Kony &apos;s crimes , were showed the Invisible Children &apos;s video in a public screening , they were not particularly pleased with the content of the video as is seen in an Al Jazeera English video below .
“ If people in those countries care about us , they will not wear t-shirts with pictures of Joseph Kony for any reason , ” says one man interviewed .
“ That would celebrate our suffering . ”
a Ugandan man at another screening says , “ There is some kind of people , some NGO , who are trying to mobilize funds using the atrocities committed in Northern Uganda . ”
the campaign to show the positive sides of Africa has garnered quite a bit of clout as well in the social media scene .
American student and Afrophile Karen Kilberg collected a few of her favorite posts about the meme , and also quotes African blogger Tatenda Muranda on Twitter as to why she wrote the post :
@ IamQueenNzinga : it &apos;s about time we ushered in the era of afro-optimism through words and action Kenyan journalist Paula Rogo curated on Storify of the “ best and the worst ” of the “ WhatIloveAboutAfrica ” conversation .
here are a few posts from her selection :

the old struggle for the African narrative
Reclaiming the narrative about the African Continent through social media is not a new endeavor .
in 2007 , a similar campaign brewed throughout the African social media when several prominent bloggers invited fellow bloggers to weigh in on “ Why I blog about Africa ” .
Ivorian blogger Théophile Kouamouo asked in 2008 &#91; fr &#93; :
do we blog for the diaspora and for the world at large , cut off from our contemporaries on the continent ?
is blogging about Africa done in the same way as blogging about Europe or Asia ?
does the African-oriented blogosphere have something specific to offer to the world version 2.0 ?
the meme was remarkable in that it not only managed to spurt plenty of reactions in the West African region but also spread across the continent to the African Anglophone blogosphere .
as a commentary to the meme back then , Rombo of “ What an African Woman Thinks ” provided an inspiring response to What she loves about Africa :
Africa is under my skin .
Africa is the voices in my head .
Africa is the itch on my back that I can ’ t quite reach .
&#91; … &#93; She ’ s beautiful and she ’ s strong and she ’ s got so much to give , she inspires me and I love her truly madly deeply .
she ’ s battered and bruised and sometimes broken and I love her even more .
she ’ s always on my mind and in my heart .
it ’ s not so much , then , that I choose to blog about Africa .
I really wish the world would see in her all that I see in her .
that ’ s another reason why I blog about Africa : to make this wish come true .
Sokari of Black Looks added back then :
… she makes me angry and frustrated , lets me down , goes on walkabouts and is influenced by some pretty horrible characters many from distant lands .
but I cant help loving her deeply – she is alive , she is real and wise with so many wonderful meaningful stories of humanity and life .
she is rich in stature and spirit .
I love the way she moves , her facial expressions , the taste of her food and the smell and colours of the earth
the struggle for the narrative is an old story indeed .
Binyavanga Wainaina wrote a famous essay about “ How to write about Africa ” in 2005 .
this essay was turned into a video called “ How Not to Write About Africa ” narrated by actor Djimon Hounsou :
in view of the long , drown out struggle to portray the positive side of the continent , one might wonder why it is such a challenge to change the global perspective of the continent and why it matters so much to many people .
an answer to why it is important to highlight the positive side of the continent was offered during the TED Africa conference by Euvin Naidoo , president of the South African Chamber of Commerce .
he argues that trust is an important component for investments in Africa , and that a better understanding of all the nuances of the continent is required .
he states :
George Kimble said , ‘ The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it . ’ So let &apos;s start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer &#91; .. &#93; The first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country .
it ’ s made up of 53 different countries .
so to say ‘ invest in Africa ’ is a no-go .

Iranian Election in Photos
the Iranian presidential election will be held on June 12 .
only four men , out of more than 400 self-registered men and women , were given official approval by the Guardian Council for the candidacy .
the sharp eyes of blogger-photographers have captured moments and scenes in the streets of Iran where people promote their favorite candidates and political demands .
Maryam Majd has published several photos on Feminist School about “ women ’ s independent presence in the electoral space . ”
in Feminist School we read that “ Tajrish sq .
Emamzadeh Saleh ( a holy shrine in the north of Tehran ) and the memorable Tajrish Bazaar were hosts to the volunteer members of the “ Coalition of Women ’ s Movement ” . they enthusiastically demanded an independent presence for women in the city ’ s electoral space .
their slogan was : “ We Vote for Women ’ s Rights . ” Their wish is for Iranian authorities to put an end to all discriminatory laws against women .
Saba Vasefi also captured this movement in action on Feminist School .
in Zoherpix Photo blog we see how Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ‘ s and Mir Hussein Mousavi ‘ s supporters are waving the photos of their favorite candidates :
Philippines : Dita Tree saved 36 lives during floods
a 40-fee Dita Tree became a refuge for 36 members of 7 families in Barangay Bagong Silangan ( New East Village ) , Quezon City , Metro Manila as flood waters rose last September 26 .
the flashflood was caused by a record rainfall unleashed by Typhoon Ketsana which hit the Philippines last September .
it was the worst flooding in the country in the past 40 years .
there are only few Dita Trees left in urban Metro Manila .
Barangay Bagong Silangan is an urban poor community located in the northeastern part of the country ’ s capital .
more than 30 individuals died in this community during the flooding disaster .
Arkibong Bayan provides more details :
36 members of 7 families climbed up this dita tree as the flood waters was rising and were saved .
they stayed on the branches of this tree from 10 AM of Sept . 26 up to 3 AM of the following day when they climbed down with the waters still waist deep because they were cold and hungry for 17 hours .
the oldest was 60 years old and the youngest 2 weeks old
moral lesson : don &apos;t cut trees , they may save your life one day .
( in this case , literally .
survivors recounted that there were many big snakes which also sought refuge in the Dita Tree .
aside from the Dita Tree , there was another tree which residents claimed also saved the lives of other villagers
according to some villagers , there is another tree ( slightly smaller than a Dita Tree ) which was also used by a family as a temporary refuge .
there was also a two-month old baby who was swept by the flood current near the tree .
the baby was also saved .
task FORCE : children of the storm was able to visit the village and the group also saw the “ Tree of Life ”
we were also shown what we now call the “ Tree of Life ” , the Dita tree where 7 families ( 34 individuals ) sought refuge during the flood and were saved from the raging flood waters .
the surviving residents , who were surveying their homes for repairs , talked of how they climbed from roof to roof seeking higher grounds .
they recounted how they rescued a 2 month old baby on floating aluminum roofing .
Arkibong Bayan received a comment from a reader who shared a similar story about how a mango tree saved lives during a natural disaster three years ago
during the onslaught of Supertyphoon Reming on November 30 , 2006 , a mango tree saved 5 lives in Padang , Legazpi City ( Bicol Region in Luzon Island ) .
one survivor had two choices : the mango tree or the slab roof of a house .
she chose the tree ; those on the slab roof were entirely swept away to the sea .
lesson : plant a tree .
it may save your life
after surviving the deadly flood last September , residents of Barangay Bagong Silangan are facing a bigger challenge : rebuilding their homes and their lives .
the community is a changed community .
houses were swept away and many basic infrastructure were damaged .
we were told that before Ondoy ( Typhoon Ketsana ) the area was congested like any other urban poor area .
now , only the relatively sturdy homes survived .
and the area looks spacious with wide , open spaces — all because the homes had been swept away by rampaging and swirling flood waters .

Malawi : bloggers discuss 30 earthquakes in 3 weeks
in what some geologists have described as rare occurrences , Malawi &apos;s northern district of Karonga has in the past three weeks experienced a total of 30 earthquakes resulting in at least 5 deaths , over 200 people injured and over 3,000 made homeless .
fresh reports say another earthquake hit Karonga Sunday 27th December and more are expected .
since Malawi &apos;s president Bingu wa Mutharika declared Karonga as a national disaster area , appeals for help to the victims have been pouring to help the people in the uranium mining district .
bloggers have also been quick to share their reactions .
a question that lingers on the minds of many Malawians is the cause of the earthquakes .
in a well-detailed post titled The missing Pieces of the Karonga Earthquake Puzzle , Muza Gondwe attempts to raise and answer the question :
the first quake struck on the evening of Sunday 6thgovernment and Red Cross are providing assistance to the victims of the earthquake but equally the government should also provide answers as to what happened ?
do people understand what causes earthquakes : do they deem it an act of God , punishment from angry ancestors , or a sign of the end of days ?
December , then a larger quake the next morning , followed by a series of aftershocks in the Karonga District of Northern Malawi .
the ground was shaking as far as Mzuzu 150km away with the biggest quake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale .
my parents who live in Rumphi between Mzuzu and Karonga , ran out of the house during each tremor wondering whether this was final days .
Twelve tremors were felt across three days .
homes and buildings have been damaged , one fatality when a child died after a wall fell on him .
while Muza tries to provide the geological perspective , Ndagha shares his frustrations with the non-response of Malawi &apos;s political parties which he claims could have poured into Karonga if it were campaign time .
is it that the parties do not have the money to give out to the victims or the area is not campaign friendly ?
I remember that earlier in the campaign period for 2009 elections , politicians competed against each other by out-giving money to Ndirande market fire “ victims ” in Blantyre .
you may wish to note that no one was reported dead or even injured yet the victims got over 5 million Kwacha in total .
compare that with Karonga when only 2.5 million Kwacha was given by Dr Bingu wa Mutharika !
come on parties , be responsible and demonstrate that you are who you claim .
this is when your electorate reallyneeds you .
meanwhile the Ministry of Natural Resources , Energy and Environment has dispelled rumors that the Karonga earthquakes have been caused by the mining works at Kayerekera which is 35 km away from the district heaquarters .
the ministry says that the uranium mine is an open pit and has no underground activities hence has no connection to the earthquakes .
just before the earthquakes in northern Malawi , Malawi was experiencing four major economic challenges surrounding fuel , forex , power and water .
these left blogger Austin Madinga wonder if Malawi leadership was learning anything from the happenings :
we have water shortages in Blantyre , power and fuel shortages country wide and a general lack of foreign exchange .
left unchecked these can have debilitating effects on our economic growth .
various players have promised to resolve or ease the current pressures but when ?
the question I keep asking myself is will Malawians will come out of all these events any smarter ?
on fuel crisis , journalist Richard Chirombo tried to put the situation into historical perspective by pointing out that Malawi cargo was stuck in Mozambique due to a decline in the use of the Beira port .
Malawi has for the past ten years registered a sharp decline in the use of Beira Port in Mozambique , according to traffic statistics sourced from the port ’ s authority .
a report from Cornelder de Mozambique , the company that won a 25 year-long concession from the Government of Mozambique in 1998 to run the port , points to a sharp decline in the use of the port by Malawian exporters and importers .
it says , for instance , that , while the country ’ s imports and exports traffic amounted to 570 million metric tonnes in 1998- and went on to reach a 1 , 3 million metric tonnes peak in traffic in 2002- Malawi has failed to beat its own record peak of 2006 .
the fuel importers and governments of Malawi and Mozambique blamed each other for the fuel crisis that hit Malawi for a consecutive four weeks plus in November and December .
Iran : campaign to Free Jailed Photo-Blogger Hamed Saber
more than 70 Iranian university graduates and academics are calling for the release of Hamed Saber , an Iranian photo-blogger and computer scientist who was arrested for unknown reasons on 21 June 2010 in Tehran .
a friend has informed us that it was the first time Hamed was arrested .
the same source said several of Hamed &apos;s photos of the Iranian protest movement have been published in foreign magazines without his knowledge .
Hamed is also the developer of “ Access Flickr “ , a Firefox internet browser extension that bypasses filters on the photo-sharing website Flickr in Iran , United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , China and other locations where it is banned .
one of Hamed &apos;s friends posted a letter in a discussion forum on Flickr seeking support for Hamed :
as some of you might already know , it has been nearly a month since Hamed Saber our dear friend and artist and the founder of Iranian group on Flickr has been arrested for no apparent reason .
there has been no news of him except for two telephone calls from an anonymous place .
a group of his old friends , university class mates and professors from well-known universities around the world have issued a letter requesting Hamed ’ s release .
all of us know him for quite a long time , since our first days of membership in this group or maybe in trips we went together with him .
many of us started photography in Flickr and specifically this group and even made life-long friends here .
I myself feel indebted to him for finding many artist friends here and in this group .
today he is imprisoned for no clear reason and this is an opportunity to show our friendship and appreciation .
I thought we could write a letter or statement and defend his position as an artist and an old friend and ask for his release .
I am not that good at writing , any comment or idea or any suggestions for a solidarity gesture by anyone of you can be of help , so drop a line in the comment my friends , we have to take action as soon as possible .
Hamed &apos;s friends on the “ Free Hamed Saber ” blog wrote :
Saber , the winner of a Bronze medal in an international science competition , had the possibility to emigrate but he preferred to stay in Iran and work for its “ independence and economic progress . ”
the statement calls on Iranian leaders to give Saber a fair trial .

Egypt : bloggers arrested over Naga Hammady Visit
more than 20 Egyptian bloggers were arrested when their train arrived in the village of Naga Hammady in Upper Egypt .
led by Dr Mostafa Al Naggar , the bloggers left Cairo , Alexandria , and other cities in Egypt to pay their respects to the families of the victims of the Naga Hammady massacre .
seven Christian Copts were shot dead on the eve of their Christmas , on January 7 .
many others were injured as they left a church after the Christmas mass .
on his blog , Dr Mostafa Al Naggar wrote :
we were cursed by the reign of an oppressive system that ruined our lives and harmony .
we were robbed of our dreams and were left to suffer unemployment , fear , and deprivation .
Egypt that was once a secure haven turned into a waste land .
we are no longer safe in our homes for dawn visitors in uniforms can easily snatch us from our cribs .
we are no longer secure in our streets for vagabonds and criminals can arrest us and harass our women .
today we witnessed how hitmen can easily shoot us as we finish our prayers .
the bloggers unpoliticized visit to Naga Hammady was halted when the bloggers got off the train .

Cairo , 9 : 30am – Naga Hammady police forces have detained a group of bloggers and activists from different political parties and movements upon their arrival from Cairo to Naga Hammady .
their mission was to console the families of the victims and to take a stance against sectarianism .
upon their arrests , the officers took their IDs and mobile phones and they were taken in separate cars to an unknown destination .
followed by an estimated list of the names of the detained bloggers
Zeinobia commented saying :
most if not all these bloggers are among the famous citizen journalists .
I do not understand why these bloggers have been detained .
Georgia : let &apos;s talk about sex , baby …
perhaps the most buzzing topic in the Georgian social media scene was not politics , elections , sport , crisis , earthquakes or catastrophe .
instead , one of the most discussed topics was actually about a new television show , Ghame Shorenastan .
shown on Imedi TV , the title translates as Night with Shorena and covers topics about sex .
as the first to do so , and with former Georgian Playboy Playmate Shorena Begashvili , the show received a lot of feedback online , both positive and negative .
NightGravity was certainly delighted .
this show will work .
I &apos;m sure a lot of famous , not so famous and also conservative people watched it .
everybody agreed that Georgia needs a television programme about sex and most of the negative comments , such as this criticism by lukrenc , were of a more technical nature .
the show has an indisputably interesting and sexy hostess – Shorena Begashvili – but the show itself is not so much – I thought I was listening to “ Top 10 music videos ” .
popular Georgian blogger Tomushka made several posts about the show and reviewed every episode .
she also criticized the technical aspect .
there was not a main topic , and it looked like a MTV program .
during 45 minutes there was 20 minutes of advertisements and 20 minutes of MTV song videos : d last 5 minutes were “ hello , goodbye , sex is not bad , sex is good ” : d
Lishtota even conducted an online poll asking “ When will “ night with Shorena ” be cancelled ? ”
another blogger , Giorgi Benashvili was surprised that people did not react strongly against the show , especially as the authors and producers expected a scandal .
“ Today , in the year 2009 , teaching sex via television is not relevant anymore – this is the conclusion which is reached because of the silence with which the programme was greeted and which was not expected by its authors or me .
if the show was made in 2001 , I can imagine the effect it would have , as opposed to that we have now . ”
in fact , the lack of adverse reactions lead many to suppose that society , or at least that part of it online , was ready for such a show .
many posts on blogs and forums even complain that the show was not informative enough , as one comment complains .
the girl is nice for sure .
everything &#91; the show - D. &#93; was like our life – frigidity wrapped in an extravagant cover .
sex remained as a dream : d : d
perhaps the television show had hoped to make a sexual revolution , but failed because Georgia has already managed to escape from the mentality of there being “ no sex in the USSR . ” This topic is not taboo anymore and maybe a sexual revolution has already happened , albeit a velvet one .
Egypt : life Imprisonment for Mubarak
this post is part of our special coverage Egypt Revolution 2011 .
the world watched as an Egyptian court sentenced former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and his Interior Minister Habib Al Adly to life imprisonment today for their role in the killing of protesters .
the trial took 49 sessions , 250 hours and spanned 60,000 pages , tweeted Sultan Al Qassemi , quoting judge Ahmed Refaat .
the historic verdict was broadcast live , prompting netizens to post reactions online as the court session progressed .
Mubarak &apos;s two sons Alaa and Gamal were acquitted of corruption , as were Al Adly &apos;s senior aides , who were blamed for the death of protesters during the Egyptian revolution , which started on January 25 , 2011 .
following the verdict , Egyptian blogger Mahmoud Salem , or Sandmonkey , tweets :
@ Sandmonkey : # Mubaraktrial ended in a sham verdict : he and his Minister of Interior received an easily turnable life in prison sentence , every1 else free
adding :
@ Sandmonkey : the same people who have killed and tortured egyptians are now free to go back to their jobs at the MOI .

@ Beltrew : life time in jail for # Mubarak is not as bad as it seems .
journalist Patrick Tombola notes :
@ ptombola : # Mubarak ‬ &amp; Adly convicted for failing to prevent killings not for ordering them.Big distinction &amp; not a comforting one .

Mozambique : aid spat
Mozambique relies on money from other governments that give aid directly to its State Budget , making possible essential services like health and education .
the relationship between the “ donor ” countries , and the Mozambican government , which has remained in the hands of the strong ruling party , has had its ups and downs over the years .
and the donor countries are diverse , from Europe , North America and Asia , and they have rarely acted with a unified voice .
since the late 1990s , most donor countries have repeatedly demanded proof of improvement in “ governance ” – in what relates to corruption , improvements in accountability and the rule of law .
these demands were made concrete in written agreements between donor countries and Mozambique .
the murders of two high profile figures investigating corruption in 2000 and 2001 continue unresolved in the eyes of donor countries .
the recent trial of managers of Mozambican Airports , a state enterprise , for embezzlement of millions of dollars of state monies reminded that corruption continues to occur at a high level .
photo from Flickr user Sida – Swedish International Development Cooperation
yet , it is safe to say that , until Sweden decided that it would reduce its support to the Mozambican budget last year , most of the tension between donor countries and the receiving government remained behind closed doors .
Additionally , last year &apos;s presidential election also elevated public tensions , as donors challenged the administration of elections .
Joseph Hanlon , long-time Mozambique analyst , journalist and Professor at Open University , offers up a full section on his website documenting the “ donor strike ” of 2010 .
he summarizes
budget support donors ( G19 ) sent two letters to government in December 2009 , demanding rapid moves on electoral law reforms , corruption , conflict of interest , and the overlap between the Frelimo party and the state .
budget support was suspended .
on 5 February 2010 Aiuba Cuereneia , Minister for Planning and Development and the main government negotiator with the donors , sent a reply &#91; letter &#93; to the G19 , setting out the government position and making few concessions .
&#91; ... &#93; Negotiations in early March led to an agreement announced 24 March and a resumption of the flow of money .
Edígio Vaz kicked off a debate in the Mozambican blogosphere in March &#91; pt &#93; on the recent breakdown of communication between donor nations and his government
the biggest problem of the Government , according to the donors , was always to have accepted the goals , indicators of success and the objectives , negotiated with donors in the PAP &#91; Program Aid Partnership &#93; , without showing a tangible results or circumstantial report against them , as agreed .
delays , foot-dragging , excuses , very general and wordy reports , are in contrast with the advanced capture of the State by a cleptocrat gang established at various levels of the management of public goods .
Vaz describes the government &apos;s 18-page letter to the donors , as “ an irreparable shot in the air ” .
but he also blames the donor countries &#91; Pt &#93;
… The meglomania of the group of PAP &#91; Program Aid Partnerships &#93; was manifest , to the point of having dulled their intelligence , needed to discern the facts necessary to make decisions
in his view , the donor countries punished the “ new ” Frelimo government entering after the October election , including a new Prime Minister , preventing it from beginning anew with new social programs .
but readers responded to Vaz , reminding that many donor countries are suffering severe economic crisis .
Zenaida Machado writes &#91; Pt &#93;
in some European countries there are and there will be drastic budget cuts in 2010 / 11 and certainly , this will affect the Mozambique State Budget in 2011 .
even so , I think that the timing of this “ crisis ” serves as a punishment / lesson for our governmental and political institutions .
some took a more comical take on things , like an amateur cartoonist featured by Carlos Serra , who drew the Mozambican government having a shock at the “ donor cash machine ” .
the delay caused by the negotiations over aid this year did not , according to the Mozambican government , affect service delivery as the 2010 budget was still being finalized during the “ donor strike ” .
but Vaz concludes that
in some way or another , it is clear that both parties must sharpen their mechanisms of communication , political dialogue , and above all , be realistic in their decisions and the commitments they make .
Zambia : mixed Feelings Greet Big Brother Eviction
the eviction of Zambia ’ s representative , musician popularly known as Mampi , from the on-going Big Brother Africa seventh series , has been received with mixed feelings from netizens .
big Brother Africa : stargame is the seventh series of the Big Brother Africa reality television series which will air for 91 days and the winner will walk home with $ 300,000 .
produced by Endemol in South Africa , the show has become the most popular reality TV show in Africa .
Mampi , real name Mirriam Mukape , lasted three weeks in the house before she was nominated for eviction by other housemates .
while a lot of people felt that the musician , well known for her raunchy stage antics , was a let down to the nation for her conduct in the reality TV show , others thought that her experience in the house enhanced her “ relational capital . ”
when Zambian Watchdog broke the news of Mampi ’ s eviction , most of the readers did not hesitate to condemn the musician .
a TV screen shot of Mampi in the BBA House .

one reader , Gloria , did not mince her words , comparing to another Zambian contestant who won the inaugural BBA series , Cherise Makubale :
she is a big very big embarassment , the opposite of Cherese , listen to her words on this youtube She is a big very big embarassment , the opposite of Cherese , listen to her words on this youtube She is a big very big embarassment , the opposite of Cherese , listen to her words on this youtube video : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = P2w0EjH15q8
another reader , Violet wrote :
Yippee im so glad shes gone , she ’ s a hater and a gossiper .
I wonder if she was aware of that … .. Jooo Mampi we wont miss uuuo … .Now Maneta must follow her shes one irritating little bee BZZZZZZZ … .looks its not all that … .
manner and dignity they both dont have … .. Byeeee
said Ras-Kadafi of Mampi ’ s eviction :
is it so surprising , honestly ?
one reader , Ndumeleti , came to her aid :
which show are these guys watching ?
surely Mampi in the big brother house behaved far much better than some of the housemates e.g. Zainab , Lady may and even maneta .
talk of the dance yes , but nudity … .it reminds me of the Chansa kabwela saga !
Zambians learn to support your own .
she lost because you Zambians tagged her as a bitch and a bad person and didn ’ t vote for her .
in the house she tried to be as descent as possible given the circumstances , she never even took alcohol .
have you seen Zainab take off all her clothes or dance in her underwear on camera !
come on wake up !
but it is her fellow musician , Saboi Imboela , studying for a Masters ’ degree in New Zealand , who defended Mampi ’ s appearance on BBA on her Facebook wall :
Congrats to Mampi ( mwanenu ) for increasing your ‘ relational capital &apos; .
being on the BB show is like going to university in the academic world .
before , only the 13million people of Zambia knew you but now the whole of Africa does .
its not the degree or the relational capital a person has that makes them big , its what they do or plan to to with it that separates the boys from men , women from girls .
life will never be the same for u again just by exposing yourself to Africa in the past few weeks so what you do with that capital is all up to u . Lastly , i personally would do all i can to convince hubby and our sponsors to have u play the lead role in our upcoming project .
we are spending so much to bring in the Nigerian actors becoz we didnt have a Zambian star who was known to the whole continent .
Im ever so proud of u mwanenu- u r made of steel .
another netizen , Isaac Mwanza , also on Facebook , added a political dimension of Zambian women not supporting a fellow woman :
Mampi Mukape rejected by her own people and Zambian women were in forefront of decampaigning her .
I think its an illusion to support women in Zambia when they cant support each other .
let us all rally behind Roki of Zim or Prezzo of Kenya for BBA prize !
on another citizen media news website , Tumfweko , snr pastor wrote :
so please , my fellow zedians lets emulate other countries and do the rest for our surviving BBA stargame inmates .
I equally aware that Zedian housemates are currently feared because of their potential .
may God Bless Zed !
equally on Twitter , netizens expressed varied views :
@ ChibuyeK : RT @ skrypted : dear haters , mampi actually did something and got a wider coverage while u wasted work hours watching her &lt; she got some cash too
another tweep , still hopeful about another Zambia BBA participant , tweeted :
@ DJLBCZambia : now that mampi is out , my interest in BBA has dwindled , but wait , we still have Paul Ngozi &#91; a Zambia musician who died over 20 years ago &#93; ‘ s daughters in the game .
Ghana : regional Minister , Kofi Opoku-Manu , Going Under ?
Ashanti Regional Minister , Kofi Opoku-Manu , has recently taken great heat for remarks he made during a speech to supporters of the ruling party , National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) on January 6th .
according to Ghana ’ s Ato-Kwamena Dadzie , Opoku-Manu “ urged party supporters to resort to violence to resolve their differences . ”
Dadzie reports in his article , “ Opoku-Manu Must Go ” with a direct quote from the Regional Minister :
Dadzie states :
comments like these are reckless and irresponsible .
you don ’ t expect a man in Mr. Opoku-Manu ’ s position to utter them .
but he did .
two days later , he had no recollection of what he had said until a recording was played back to him .
that was when he came to his senses , acknowledged his momentous folly and offered an apology , which only came after some big wigs within the government instructed to clear the mess he has created .
below is Opoku-Manu ’ s apology as quoted by Dadzie :
I ’ ll be the last person to advocate for warfare of any type and having listened to this myself , I must say I really feel sorry .
Dadzie interjects with this comment :
but he didn ’ t stop there .
he offered a veiled defense .
he claims he was speaking in a “ charged environment ” , implying that he wasn ’ t using his head .
he was speaking by heart .
you could say he was farting with his mouth .
for opening his mouth too wide to spew such dangerous nonsense , Mr. Opoku-Manu has shown himself to be an irresponsible man who doesn ’ t deserve to occupy the position he does .
he must be sacked .
and if there is anyone who deserves a hefty slap it is him .
that half-hearted apology he offered only after he had been instructed to do so is not enough .
he must go .
responses to Opoku-Manu ’ s comment seem to be mostly in the negative .
David S. left this comment on Dadzie ’ s blog post :
at a time when Ghana &apos;s democracy is in its infancy , the last thing we need is someone encouraging political violence .
nobody wants this country to become like Zimbabwe or Iran .
he should be made to resign for encouraging people to damage our democracy with political violence .
he is an enemy of democracy .
Banske said this about the same post :
I wonder why people are asking for sacking-sacking doesn &apos;t solve the problem .
if Ohene Ntow made this statement , what would have happened ?
if Wereko-Brobby , Jake etc made the statement … .What would the BNI / National security do ?
and people pretend Mills is humane .
Sacking him wouldn &apos;t stop the order he gave and similar ones given by the Rawlingses , Vanderpuyes , Anyidohos etc .
Sack him as RM and bring him to the presidency ?
this man was the RCC chief director under NPP and that was not enough for him .
if you are born an idiot , you can be 1000years and will still be an idiot that is what OM has confirmed .
is only the fool we sees political appointment as a permanent job .
Idiocy can be seeing political appointment as a matter of life and death .
by the way Mills is dumb , timid , and powerless and so has not heard / seen anything .
Nana Poku wrote in his article at Modern Ghana , “ Opoku-Manu Must go , Apology or Not ” :
the more important point is this : how can he assure his political opponents of fairness ?
how can they trust him to be an honest broker should any matter of political violence come before him as the Chair of REGSEC ?
how does he ensure the safety and security of the very people he wants beaten up ?
I believe he &apos;s lost the integrity required for a position as Regional Minister .
he must resign or be made to .
we were all witnesses to the many cases of intimidation and harassment of political opponents during and after the 2008 elections .
the last thing we need in this country is for officials , who should know better , to be purveyors of violence and intimidation , themselves .
a press release by the Alliance for the Advancement of Democracy ( AAD ) , an interest group for the progression of Ghana ’ s democracy , posted by MyJoyOnline stated :
the Alliance for the Advancement of Democracy ( AAD ) wishes to condemn the Ashanti Regional Minister- Hon.
Opoku-Manu for his malicious and distasteful comments made over the weekend ; which have the propensity to destabilize the peace and security of this nation .
the Alliance for the Advancement of Democracy ( AAD ) also views the call by the New Patriotic Party on Hon. Opoku Manu to resign and the subsequent invitation by the appropriate Security agency on the subject matter as most unfortunate and highly hypocritical .
AAD believes that , he who seeks equity must come with clean hands and that the New Patriotic Party &apos;s blatant disregard and failure to condemn violent acts of the former Central Regional Minister- Hon.
Edumadzie , and the similar comments of Hon.
Maxwell Kofi Jumah , Hon.
Mike Ocquaye , Dr. Nyaho .
Tamakloe , etc. as morally reprehensible and ultimately negates any good intent to uphold the rule of law and to consolidate peace and security in Ghana .
AAD believes that the apology of the Ashanti Regional Minister is an indication of gross remorse and must be accepted in good faith but we however insist that his averments militates against his status as the Regional Minister and the Chairman of the Regional Security Council .
we therefore hold the strong view that he must honorably resign or the President must find it necessary to remove him from office .
during the 2008 General elections , the President was touted as a man of peace ( ‘ asomdwehene &apos; ) and must therefore be committed in working with public officials and appointees who reflect his character and principles .
Sonia left this comment in response to the AAD press release :
I have monitored the activities of AAD and have come to the conclusion that their sense of objectivity and insight in national issues must be commended by all well meaning Ghanaians .
I wish AFAG and all pressure groups learn from the brains behind AAD .
I believe in the point that he who seeks equity must come with clean hands .
the NPP must be bold to condemn their own else they will never be taken seriously .
video : the world commemorates the fall of the Berlin Wall
Berlin Wall by Natalie Maynor
today is the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , a complex security structure that once divided East and West Berlin in Germany .
today we are showcasing some of the videos from throughout the globe that are being uploaded to commemorate this date and what it meant to barriers not only in Germany , but throughout the world .
in Germany , a series of giant domino pieces crafted out of foam were erected , to be toppled down to mark the end of the Cold War .
this video by NoCommentTV shows the dominoes , which were painted by children in Germany and also by artists living in other areas where there are divisions and walls , being set up .
this other video &apos;s embed option has been disabled , but you can view how the dominoes were toppled by clicking this link to see it on its YouTube page .
in Colombia , students reenact the fall of the wall , by taking turns to demolish a concrete slab :
from Germany , domino toppling fan Annodomino2007 has uploaded his own domino tribute to the fall of the wall , and also to the 10 year anniversary celebration which kickstarted his passion for dominoes :
in the USA , college students erected a replica of the Berlin Wall that could be written on , as a way to raise awareness :
from Mexico , VarinVxx uploads a video featuring another wall that is still standing , in : is not Berlin , is not Palestine is US Mexico border The Wall of Shame in USA :
Krista Schyler also makes the comparison between the Mexico / US wall and the Berlin wall , in this case , not only focusing on the impact on human migration , but from a wildlife conservation angle as well :
this pilot for a documentary by Ziashere showing s other walls that are still standingIn this pilot , one in Ireland :
this last video is 2 years old , but is still relevant : adamfilmaker interviewed youth both from the North and South of the Nicosia wall in Cyprus , a green zone patrolled by UN blue helmets that divides Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots , earning the distinction of being the last divided capital of the world .
South Africa : Malema is Out , What &apos;s Next ?
South Africa &apos;s most controversial character and politician Julius Malema has been suspended from the ANC for five years .
Julius Malema is the former president of the African National Congress Youth League .
last year , Malema led students in singing an old anti-Apartheid struggle song called ‘ Kill the Boer ’ and a South African judge found him guilty of hate speech because of comments he made about a woman who accused President Jacob Zuma of rape .
in May 2010 , Malema was forced into making an apology to the nation and attend anger management classes .
he then changed the song ‘ Kill the Boer ’ to ‘ Kiss the Boer ‘ .
Malema is regarded by his supporters as the genuine voice of the poor in South Africa particularly with his call for nationalisation of South African mines .
fr Stephen &apos;s Blog writes about his suspension :
former President of the ANC Youth League .
photo released under Creative Commons ( CC BY-SA 3.0 ) by Gary van der Merwe .
Julius Malema is to be removed as leader of the ANC Youth League ( ANCYL ) after being suspended from the organisation for five years .
Malema is barred from involving himself in any activities of the ANCYL and the ANC for the duration of his suspension , which came into immediate effect today after Derek Hanekom , the ANC ’ s national disciplinary committee ( NDC ) chairman , announced the findings of a disciplinary process against Malema and the league ’ s top brass in Joburg today .
Malema was not present at the announcement at Luthuli House for the announcement .
he was reported to be in Limpopo writing an exam .
the committee found Malema guilty on two main charges .
one related to a statement he made on July 31 – that the ANC was no longer dealing with issues affecting the interests of Africa .
Malema was also ordered to vacate his position as league president with immediate effect .
he has 14 days to appeal …
Hardspear &apos;s post on Malema &#91; af &#93; is a simple expression of fear for the future :
I shiver to think what shit he &apos;s going to do next .
looking at events leading up to this point , we have to take a look at the recent “ Economic Freedom March ” led by Malema .
Leaboy &apos;s Domain gives us a fitting introduction to this by highlighting Zapiro &apos;s cartoon on the event in his post titled , “ Zapiro has a dig at Malema &apos;s ‘ Economic Freedom March ” .
the biggest argument in the South African blogosphere about this march was the inherent hypocrisy of Julius Malema who highlights the plight of South Africa &apos;s poor while he lives in luxury .
one Long Minute gives us his point of view in his post titled , “ What are you walking for ? ” :
first the March for Economic Freedom , well that was lead by Julius Malema , when he wasn &apos;t too tired and taking a break in his chauffeur driven beamer &#91; BMW car &#93; .
there is just so much irony in that I &apos;m headed for sensory overload .
lazy bastard still letting the masses do all the work for him but taking all the limelight for himself .
Vuilblog takes a satirical approach against Malema &apos;s followers with a picture of Malema , which has the following text :
you don &apos;t have running water , you live in a shack , you ride in a taxi .
I buy expensive cars , I buy expensive houses , I only drink Johnnie Walker .
you still like me .
thank you for being a $ % ^ &amp; ing idiot
other posts discuss the image and character which Julius Malema portrays .
covering what Malema thinks of himself with a hint of sarcasm is 2OceansVibe :
in his recent address at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha , Malema said it was the job of the youth to introduce radical ideas , but bemoaned the fact that these days , one is hauled before a disciplinary committee for “ telling the truth ” .
this from the man who was in the media again this morning for a using a racial slur against Indians .
poor Juju .
he really just feels misunderstood and unsupported .
Bibliopolit compares Malema to Lady Gaga :
of course , here in South Africa , we have the equivalent of Lady Gaga in Julius Malema !
just in the political scene .
should we call him Julius Gaga , or Lady Malema ?
if it were not for Malema ’ s outrageous statements and claims , he would not have had a fraction of the attention that he is getting currently .
for Malema , if it isn ’ t going to be controversial , it is not worth saying anything about it , according to how Lady Malema thinks .
Malema thrives on attention , and in my opinion , he falls in the same category as Lady Gaga .
although he is physically an adult , he has not matured mentally or sociologically to becoming an adult , and continues to crave attention like a 10-year old girl .
and , the only way he can get the attention he so desperately desires , he acts and says things that are controversial .
the Fire in My Eyes gets straight to the point :
Julius Malema has the makings of a dictator .
he encourages the black population of South Africa to procreate and seems to dream of a country where white people are erased .
the way he speaks makes on think of reverse Apartheid and he constantly speaks of white people as the enemy .
he has a huge youth following in South Africa even though he is facing allegations of corruption .
the bad press he has received seems to fuel the fire of his followers and he &apos;s become something of a ‘ saviour ’ figure for many .
the Property Mag summarises the current state of South African politics in light of recent events :
“ The dismissal of two cabinet ministers , the firing of the police chief , the enquiry into the arms deal and the fact that whatever the outcome , Julius Malema has had to go on trial , have all sent out a positive message that South Africa will not be allowed to drift into a chaotic Third World state .
these moves by the President along with the financial minister &apos;s new mini-budget , have very definitely restored confidence in a leadership which appeared to be losing control .
so we know where we are now , we still have yet to see what the future holds for Malema and South Africa .

children Crisis in Syria : how You Can Help
this post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011 / 13
consequences of war on Syrian children :
an estimated 4,355 Syrian children have been killed ( up to 15 / 1 / 2013 ) in the on-going conflict in Syria , according to latest report released by Martyrs of the Syrian Revolution Database .
thousands more have been wounded , detained , or left without family , or access to medical aid and humanitarian assistance .
according to the UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) , 650,764 Syrian refugees are registered or awaiting registration inside and outside Syria .
more than half of them ( 52 % ) are under 18 .
however , countless Syrian children have been confronted with the anguish of losing their home , their belongings , and parents .
the Children &apos;s Rights Portal reports :
Syrian Children in Crisis , bitter winter adds to suffering .
source : save the Children
in such conditions , practically all the necessary constants for child development are seriously disrupted , and the psychological damages of armed conflicts are incalculable … .
these children , unable to grow up in an atmosphere of trust and having had to face atrocities from a very young age , often develop the conviction that violence is a way like any other to solve disputes , and so it is difficult for them to send a message of peace and international security to future generations .
how to Help Syrian Children ?
earlier this week , we reported on the steep price Syrian children are paying in this war tearing their country apart .
today , we look at ways in which individuals could help alleviate some of their suffering .

Uganda : bloggers react to bomb blasts
soccer fans gathered in bars and restaurants around the globe to watch the final game of the World Cup last night .
in Uganda , these celebrations were interrupted when bombs exploded at two popular nightlife spots in Kampala , the country &apos;s capital .
Ugandan media are reporting over 40 deaths so far , with dozens more injured in the explosions .
Ugandan police have suggested that Somali militant group al-Shabab was behind the attacks .
one of the group &apos;s commanders recently called for attacks against Uganda , which contributes troops to the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia .
the group has praised the attacks but has not claimed responsibility .

Ugandan blogger Gay Uganda writes :
Uganda attacked .
really , it is humanity attacked .
who has the gall to be happy at such atrocity ?
apparently , Somali insurgents are happy .
because they are fighting African Union troops in Somalia , who have stopped them from establishing an Islamic state under Sharia law .
… .What I see are country mates , human beings who were doing nothing worse than watching a football match who were killed and maimed , in the name of ideals that they may have no real thought about , actions that they cannot control in the least .
Ernest Bazanye cautions against jumping to conclusions about who set off the bombs too soon :
it ’ s too early to say who is responsible or why , and even though it is whispered abroad that it was a pair of suicide bombings staged by Al-Shahab , the Somali terrorist organization .
we should know by now that the truth doesn ’ t get here that soon and that any conclusions now would be premature .
Trevor Snapp , a documentary photographer living in Kampala , was at Mulago Hospital , where many of the victims were taken , after the bombings .
he writes :
family members milled around the front reception area while doctors and bodies covered in blood were rushed in and out of surgery .
in the surgery hallway a man ’ s body lay in the floor bleeding by his head , it was impossible to know if he was dead or alive .
a few feet away in a small storage locker , staff had created a makeshift morgue , 6 bodies lay on the tiles , some had their clothes blown off .
they were all young .
many bloggers are shocked that the bombings happened in Kampala , widely known as one of Africa &apos;s safest capital cities .
Joshua Goldstein , a former Global Voices author who used to live in Kampala , describes the locations where the bombings took place :
Kampala &apos;s Rugby Club is a sprawling bar , adjacent to the pitch , where many of Kampala &apos;s college students come to hang with their buddies .
if Uganda had fraternities , this is where they would throw their parties .
here the smart set drink Nile Special with reggae and hip hop blasting in the background .
on weekend days the same crew watch rugby , collars popped to block the sun .
… .Across town Ethiopian Village , down the street from the American Embassy , is in the dead center of Kabalagala , the Las Vegas of Kampala .
the restaurant , the most high end of the half dozen or so Ethiopian restaurants within 500 meters , sits at the intersection of Ggaba Road and Tank Hill Road .
in the afternoon , Ethiopian dissident journalists pass their exile by chewing miraa and discussing the day &apos;s news .
at night , the neighborhood lights up with bars and dance parties .
Sleek writes :
to give this a little perspective , I ’ ll point out that up-til now , Kampala has been one of those places where at 03 : 00 AM , one can walk from one end of the city to the other .
and that we are the kind of people to complain about rising fuel prices , high Pay As You Earn taxes , impossible airtime charges … basically a very high cost of living .
but in all this , we ’ ll still go to that new hangout place and pay UGX 5,000 for a beer .
and we fill the place to the point that you literally have to fight your way to the bar to get a drink .
and that ’ s the average hangout .
and then you hear about bomb blasts …

Rwanda &apos;s strides to build a regional ICT hub :
Rwanda has positioned itself as a regional hub for information and communication technology ( ICT ) with a robust ICT industry , including e-commerce , e-services , applications development , and automation .
it is believed that ICT will be harnessed to generate wealth and be a key economic driver .
as part of its policy goal to progressively transform Rwanda from a predominantly agriculture economy to a predominantly information-rich , knowledge-based economy ( PIKE ) , the Government committed itself to the implementation of the envisaged four rolling NICI / ICT4D Plans over the 20 year life-span of Vision 2020 and the ICT4D Policy .

as highly expected by the fans , President Paul Kagame was among the four candidates cleared yesterday by the The National Electoral Commission to contest in the August 09 poll .

a speech by Paul Kagame at the 16th Commemoration of The Genocide is the latest message on Paul Kagame page .
one of the topics on the page is about the administrator / creator of the page .
there were fears that the administrator may have passed away without the knowledge of his followers :
Mukiza I have this feeling that the anonymous admin for this page may have silently met his or her creator without our knowledge .
for what explains the fact that this page has gone non-updated since august of 2009 .
that is a hell of a long time for a live person to be that un-responsive .
if my worries are founded , then my sincere condolences are guaranteed .
the administrator joined the discussion explaining his silence :
Paul Kagame Still kicking , I &apos;m afraid ; )
I recently moved cities and have been largely without the internet for the past 3 months as well as splitting up with my partner of over a year .
I &apos;m sorry for neglecting you , but I still check in whenever I can .
unfortunately even admins are human .
if anyone has any complaints all they have to do is make a topic and I &apos;ll see it .
as for the page , well it seems to take care of itself pretty much , or so it seems to me .
but I &apos;ll do some spring cleaning .
but maybe I &apos;ve grabbed the wrong end of the stick here , is this a coup ?
would the community like me to step down ?
~ The Administrator
Kagame supporters are also on the popular microblogging site , Twitter .
there is paulkagame , which is private ( 196 followers ) and PaulKagame with 964 followers .

we will have to wait and see the overall impact of social media in the 2010 presidential election in Rwanda .

new Year and Old Habits in Bahrain
this post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011 / 2012 .
while countries around the world ushered in the New Year with fireworks and celebrations , a special line-up of treats from the authorities was awaiting Bahraini protesters .
to mark the beginning of the new year , the Bahrain News Agency published a statement to celebrate the achievements of the previous year , saying :
the Kingdom &apos;s impeccable human rights record and bright image remain intact and undistorted by any futile false allegations propagated by hostile megaphones at international functions .
at the same time , Bahrainis experienced New Year &apos;s day with many twists .
Luckily , some of them have been documented by netizens and found their way to the world wide web , showing the world “ impeccable human rights record ” and “ false allegations ” the government is talking about .
blogger @ chanadbh tweeted the link to a video and added a sarcastic comment :
@ chanadbh : # Bahrain police officer attacks stationary car with bricks , in self-defense of course http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = HraRTyuvpOY …
the video shows a riot policeman throwing a brick at a parked car in the village of Jurdab .
Dr Abdulhadi Khalaf , an academic professor who was recently stripped of his Bahraini nationality , shared another video and commented :
@ Abdulhadikhalaf : Ministry of Interior thugs try to break a door * * * * is that why there are numerous injuries among thugs ?
@ AHRAR _ MURQOBAN , a Twitter account dedicated to publishing news of a village in Sitra , published a video of a similar incident .
the police forces in this video seem to be speaking in Urdu :
@ AHRAR _ MURQOBAN : Mercenaries planning to raid a house – Sitra
the haziness in the video is not from fog – but as a result of the heavy teargas thrown on villages on a daily basis .
human rights activist Maryam Alkhawaja also shared a video which shows police forces macing women – reportedly – for no apparent reason :
@ MARYAMALKHAWAJA : security forces pepper spray women in their faces for no reason RT @ : 1-1-13 http : / / youtu.be / 0wokYBRrxpM
Twitter user Mahmood Alshaikh tweeted yet another video which shows that no good dead goes unpunished in Bahrain :
@ M _ Alshaikh : Bahrain – Sitra &#91; An island in the east of Bahrain &#93; : youth chased after trying to rescue a family from suffocation 2013 1 1
last year , Physicians for Human Rights &#91; @ P4HR &#93; stated in their report
injured protesters whom PHR investigators examined suffered from blunt force trauma and lacerations to the head , torso , and limbs due to the impact of metal canisters being fired at them by law enforcement officials at close range .
a clear example of that was tweeted by 14 Feb Media Network , a network specialized in publishing news of Bahrain , on New Year &apos;s Day :
another very similar and clearer video was posted earlier by the same network :
Sitra – Sufala &#91; A village in the island of Sitra &#93; : a straight shot to the head of a protester 1 / 1 / 2013
police forces must be trained not to discriminate , not even age discrimination as this small child ( comments say he is four years old ) was not excluded from the joy of celebrating New Year &apos;s – the Bahraini way .
Moawen explains :
@ Moawen : riot police shoot tear gases that covered a small kid http : / / youtu.be / 4eQmT _ M7 _ is continuous violations against children &apos;s rights :
journalist Dima Khatib then shared a photo that clearly shows the incident :
@ Dima _ Khatib : Bahrain … again !
RT @ mohmdashoor : any chance you saw this from yesterday ?
photo shows how a small child was teargassed , picture published by @ 14febonline
using its Twitter account , the Ministry of Interior issued a formal reply on the events of New Year &apos;s day , saying :
@ moi _ bahrain : assistant Undersecretary of Legal Affairs : calls in websites to hold gatherings at 3 : 30PM on Tuesday in various areas in Bahrain are illegal
@ moi _ bahrain : public gatherings &amp; freedom of expression are protected by the constitution &amp; those who want to benefit from such right should follow the law
@ moi _ bahrain : security and legal procedures would be taken against lawbreakers to protect security
at the end of the statement mentioned at the beginning of this article , the Bahrain News Agency stated :
the Kingdom of Bahrain is confidently and surely heading towards the brightest future in 2013 .
personally I hope that will be true .

Togo Disqualified from African Cup Following Deadly Attack
Togo &apos;s national football team has been formally disqualified from the African Cup of Nations following Friday &apos;s deadly attack on the team &apos;s convoy in Cabinda , a region of Angola long troubled by separatist violence .
members of the Togolese national football team before a warm-up match in Biberach / Riss a few days before the World Cup ( Source : Wikipedia )
the team &apos;s assistant coach and media officer were killed and goalkeeper Kodjovi “ Dodji ” Obilale , seriously injured .
Obilale is reported to be in stable condition after undergoing surgery in South Africa , although he is still breathing with the assistance of a respirator .
FLEC , the rebel group which has claimed responsibility for the attack , indicated in a statement that the police envoy , and not the Togolese players , were the target .
the Angolan government , for its part , has called the attack an “ isolated incident ” and has guaranteed the security of the other teams .
matches continue as scheduled in Cabinda province .
although according to news reports , many players had indicated they wanted to keep playing , the Togolese government recalled the team on Saturday .
Togo , which was to play Ghana today , was officially disqualified when the team failed to appear .
since the attack , many Togolese have been asking difficult questions about what was a preventable tragedy : why was the team traveling by bus and not by air ?
did the Angolan government choose to stage a matches in Cabinda just to prove the rebellion was over ?
is football worth all the tragedy that seems to follow it ?
should the Cup be canceled ?
play on ?
directly following the attack , there was a big debate online as to whether Togo should withdraw .
Rêve d &apos;Afrique , the blog of Togolese writer Gerry Taama , argued the game should go on :
unless the CAN ( African Cup of Nations ) is canceled ( the other teams decide to boycott the event ) , we should play this match … We must be at this CAN , to take our place , to honor our dead , to express our love for them , and to show that we refuse that their deaths be in vain .
to play so as to not let the terrorists win , to not let savagery triumph over the law or our values .
to refuse to play is to give in …
Yipka-Au Village disagreed :
how can we hope that they &apos;ll play after narrowly escaping death while trying to do just that , and with two players and trainers and doctors seriously injured ?
Kangi Alem agrees , and goes one step further , arguing that the 2010 Africa Cup should be canceled :
CAF &#91; Confederation of African Football &#93; has a responsibility .
it had players pass through an area known to be dangerous , and it should now do the responsible thing and cancel CAN 2010 !
that &apos;s my opinion , a bit anti-sport , perhaps , but that &apos;s my opinion .
CAF has claimed it was unaware of the team &apos;s travel itinerary and that it had been advising teams to travel by plane .
Alem finds this “ bizarre ” since the team was accompanied by an armed convoy , courtesy of the Angolan government .
why play in Cabinda ?
of course a big question is why matches were being held in Cabinda in the first place .
Yikpa writes :
I think that it was a political decision on the part of the Angolan government , supported by CAF , to organize matches in Cabinda to prove that this region , rich in oil , was secure so as to attract investors there .
this attack proves the contrary .
Paul Archer , in a comment on Alem &apos;s post , writes :
they were on the rebels ’ turf .
I don &apos;t agree with it , but a war zone is a war zone .
sports &amp; Tragedy
David Kpelly , writing on Alem &apos;s blog , noted that this is not the first time sports , in particular football , have been associated with violence .
in 2007 , 13 members of the sport &apos;s officials and supporters , including the Minister of Sports , were killed in Sierra Leone in a helicopter crash .
he also notes that after the Togo-Mali qualifying match for the 2006 African Cup , several Togolese were killed in Bamako .
he also references an incident at the Kegue Stadium in Lome where several football fans died , not to mention a more recent tragedy in Cote d &apos;Ivoire , where 19 spectators were killed in a stampede .
he concludes :
in a similar vein another reader , Sami , wonders if , given the violence that sometimes surrounds them , “ Popular sports that stir almost primitive nationalist feelings aren &apos;t battlefields in disguise ” .
the Game Goes On
Felix Makayaba , in a comment on Reve d &apos;Afrique , laments a feeling that as the African Cup continues , the world , and even spectators in Togo , have already forgotten the tragedy :
as CAN continues , there will be a festive ambiance all around Togo .
and the pain of the deaths of some of our own risks being overshadowed by football .
I have as proof , the cries of joy that rang out all over Lome over just the 4 tie goals made by the Malian team .
already the people of Lome are putting themselves in the skins of their Malian brothers … Already we are less and less worried about our dead in Angola , before they are even buried .
perhaps it &apos;s just human nature that in spite of a horrible loss , life goes on .
Fasokan describes the festive feeling in Bamako yesterday just before the Mali-Angola match ( which ended in a 4-4 tie ) .
tonight , in Mali , we play against Angola .
it &apos;s a great event here in Mali and you can feel it everywhere with the Malian flag hung on motorcycles , bikes , cars , on the sheds and the roofs by supporters .
you can see men dressed in green , yellow and red , and some woman wrapping the Malian flag around their heads , like veils , all to tell the Mali Eagles that everyone is behind them .
Tehran &apos;s Deadly Air Pollution Illustrated
air pollution has been a public enemy to millions of Iranians for years .
it is no longer surprising news when the government some days shuts down public institutions due to air pollution .
earlier this month , the Ministry of Health declared that last year more than 4,400 people lost their lives because of air pollution in Tehran , Iran &apos;s capital .
dusty Tehran
there are several cartoons that have been shared with Iranian netizens about Tehran &apos;s pollution .
Omid drew a cartoon on Iroon.com to show dusty Tehran .
Omid , Iroon.com
Mana Neyastani did not forget politics in his cartoon on pollution : “ Grandfather ” says “ It &apos;s morning again , and I should wake up … all this bad news … executions , prison … ” “ Grandfather ” takes a deep breath to start his day and falls down beside a journal with the headline : “ Deadly pollution of Tehran &apos;s air ”
Mana Neyestani , Mardomak .
dark City
here is a video showing a dark polluted Tehran at noon as an airplane lands in Mehrabad &apos;s airport .
no Oxygen
Zeyton , an Iranian blogger , says :
we used to say there is no place to breathe in this country .
by saying this we referred to political and social repression by the regime .
but now there is literally no oxygen to breathe .
a regime which can not provide oxygen for its citizens claim to export its way of governing to the whole world .
we should not forget that people in many other cities in Iran have become the victims of pollution too , such as the southern city Ahwaz .
Uganda : yes We Kony !
this post is part of our special coverage Kony 2012 .
a social media campaign to raise support for the arrest of Ugandan guerrilla leader and wanted war criminal Joseph Kony has taken a new twist .
in a blog post titled “ # Kony2012 is a Parody , ” Sean Jacobs looks at online parody videos about the viral campaign .
the Australian “ rap news agency ” has come up with Kony parody titled “ Yes We Kony ” :
yes WE KONY .
it &apos;s March , and the Internet delivers 2012 ′ s first globe-consuming meme : the unstoppable , Stop-Kony 2012 video , which has highlighted the plight of African child soldiering like never before .
but is it really good ?
is it really bad ?
or is the world really more complex than ‘ good guys ’ and ‘ bad guys &apos; ?
Whatevers ; one thing &apos;s for sure , this is momentous : never had a 27-minute video devoid of both cats and boobs ever achieved such virality .
is this a demonstration of the internet &apos;s ability to instantly inform and engage tens of millions ; and a hopeful sign that there is a willingness among those millions , to engage passionately with something more meaningful ?
or does Kony2012 just mark the dawn of a rapacious new era of viral humanitarian marketing ?

Chile : Mapuche Prisoners End Hunger Strike After 60 Days
two young men , members of the indigenous Mapuche community from Southern Chile , were sentenced on August 13 , 2012 , to 541 days of prison for their responsibility in an attack against police officers during a clash on November 2 , 2011 , in the rural sector of the Ercilla commune .
Nineteen-year-old Paulino Levipán and eighteen-year-old Daniel Levinao started a hunger strike on August 27 , 2012 , along with Rodrigo Montoya Melinao and Eric Montoya Montoya to protest their detention .
the latter were accused of attempted murder of a policeman that was guarding ranch Centenario , in the same Ercilla community , on August 2011 .
they were still being processed in an oral trial .
yesterday , October 25 , the four mapuche prisoners decided to abandon their protest after the Chilean Supreme Court decided to comply with some of their demands .
they are already at the prison &apos;s nurse station receiving food .

the maximum Chilean court ruled to partially annul the trial that convicted them .
in Daniel &apos;s case , a new trial was ordered because the first one lacked enough proof to reach a sentence .
as for Paulino , the court changed his accusation to injuries based on “ evident mistakes in the application of the law ” , therefore his sentence changed from 10 years in prison to 3 years in parole .
the current government &apos;s stance
President Sebastián Piñera spoke about the hunger strike during a visit to the Ercilla commune this October , echoing the government &apos;s long-standing policy towards the clashes with these communities :
are we going to allow this attempted murder to go unpunished ?
justice decided a final ruling and therefore I think that if they committed a crime , the hunger strike is not legitimate or effective .
the conflict
the following video , uploaded by YouTube user PipeHenriquezO , summarizes the Mapuche conflict in Chile in 30 seconds .
the conflict focuses on claiming the preservation and autonomy of the lands that they have inhabited for centuries and that are now being exploited for their natural resources :
also , on The Ambivalent Abyss Tumblr blog you can find a photo gallery of the Mapuche movement throughout history .
netizens have also commented on the various reports about the protests in favor of the Mapuche , the government &apos;s reactions , and the diverse television reports that have come out on the issue .
opinions are conflicting .
journalist and golfer Alejandro Bascur ( @ AlejandroBascur ) was happy after a TV program aired on national television :
@ AlejandroBascur : great special report by TVN ( National Television of Chile ) .
they are finally showing the terror that the Mapuche sow in the South , with no respect to human rights # InformeEspecial
referring to the statements by President Piñera , journalist and blogger Francisco Méndez ( @ Franmen ) pointed out :
@ Franmen : President Piñera could give stigmatized students and Mapuche the same support he offers the police
furthermore , Mapuche journalist , writer and blogger Pedro Cayuqueo ( @ pcayuqueo ) asserted :
@ pcayuqueo : it &apos;s hard to talk about the background of the Mapuche issue when what triggers debates is police chronicles .
even so , some of us try .
meanwhile , Mapuche blogger Punngey posted the following thoughts on Tumblr regarding the end of the hunger strike :
today , 60 days of fasting … the counting has ended , 60 days of sacrifice to bring out the truth , a 60-day battle of courage , pride , that pride that accompanies each one of us who ARE Mapuche , although some say that we don &apos;t exist anymore .
WEWAIÑ .
the STRUGGLE CONTINUES …

Sudan : Unshackling the Sudanese Revolution
unlike other countries in the region , Sudan is grossly underreported , and this was ever so evident during Friday and Saturday ’ s street demonstrations .
the Sudanese government keeps a tight grip on local media and bans journalists from reporting on issues of human rights and corruption .
this however does not justify the blatant lack of interest from international media outlets .
Al Jazeera , for instance , played a prominent role in reporting the uprisings in several Arab countries , but netizens say it seems to ignore the events currently unfolding in Sudan .
Sudanese women at the forefront of # SudanRevolts .
the media coverage of recent protests in Sudan was confined to articles in Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera , including some snippets on Al Jazeera ’ s English Channel .
other news outlets to cover the protests include CNN , the Malaysian news outlet The Star , the New York Times , Yahoo News , ABC News , and the Chicago Tribune .
nonetheless , this has not brought enough attention to the issues on the ground , as most of these news outlets don ’ t have much impact in the region , say netizens .
the protests kicked off after Friday prayers in a mosque in Wad Nubawi neighborhood in Omdurman .
a call for protests tagged as # SandstormFriday was made a day earlier .
the demonstrations were organized to protest against rising prices and the government ’ s new austerity plans that were announced by Sudanese president Omar Al-Bashir and implemented last week .
those who heard about the protest made their way there .
Hamid was one of them ; he tweeted :
on my way to Al-Sayed Abdelrahman mosque in Wad Nubawi .
after prayer , people gathered in front of the mosque and marched on one of the main roads in Wad Nubawi chanting anti-regime slogans .
this protest lasted a few hours before police dispersed the crowd with tear gas and plain clothed police men infiltrated the ranks of the protesters .
after the protests were disbanded , Yousif Al Mahdi was on the scene and tweeted :
protest back on inside district , wad nubawi fighting back , police cars in sideroads &amp; firing tear gas @ houses
at the same time , similar protests started in Burri neighbourhood of Khartoum , and eventually in Al-Daim .
the protests in Burri were quickly suppressed by security personnel and police .
Al-Daim however was too much for the authorities to handle .
Ammar Mahdi tweets :
hours ago from ‪ # AlDaim district , ppl throwing police signs and step on them .
Moez Ali shares a photograph of a burning police car on Twitter
the protests in Al-Daim went on into the night with several police trucks burnt by protesters .
Haitham Makkawi was on the ground and claimed that Al-Daim residents have taken over the scene :
Al-Daim residents have completely taken over !
photos of burnt down police trucks were all over twitter showing the aftermath of the protests .
later that night another protest started in Siteen Street , a main road in Khartoum next to Riyad neighbourhood ; this photo shows protesters gathering around a burnt tyre in the middle of the road .
Girifna , a non-violent movement , used social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to convey information about the whereabouts of protests around the tri-state capital .
in this tweet &#91; ar &#93; , Girifna directs people to the location of new protests in Omdurman :
Girifna – Omdurman : calling on the residents of Omdurman to head now to Al-Sabeel and Al-Doha roundabout
Girifna ’ s efforts portray the advantages of citizen journalism in a country where free speech and reporting is suppressed .
the Sudanese online community was overjoyed by the events unfolding in the capital Khartoum ; Hamid Murtada , who was at the heart of the protests , tweeted &#91; ar &#93; :
Allah-u-Akbar &#91; God is great !
&#93; and Al Hamdulillah &#91; Thank God &#93; .. The country is on fire .. It &apos;s on , it &apos;s on !
some of the Sudanese Twitter users likened the events happening in Khartoum to those in other countries in the region and maintained solidarity with those struggling with dictatorial regimes elsewhere .
Khalid Ewais , a journalist with Al Arabiya , tweeted :
salute to the revolutionaries of Syria who are supporting our revolution despite their circumstances , as for those who are mocking Sudan and its people we tell them : this is not our first revolution
the Sudanese Diaspora were on standby for those who needed help on the ground giving tips on how to document the protests and possible use of social media sites in the advent of an internet shutdown .
Nada , a Sudanese residing in Egypt , advised on how best to cover the demonstrations :
if u are an IPHONE user &amp; are amongst the protesters in sudan , download USTREAM thru the app. world . ‪ # SudanRevolts .
the online Sudanese community seems optimistic about the course of the Sudanese revolution , where many promise that June 30 , 2012 will be the ruling National Congress Party &apos;s final anniversary .
Palestine : the Pain of Exile
Palestinian refugees are one of the biggest displaced populations in the world , with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) providing assistance for some 4.7 million registered refugees in the occupied Palestinian territory , Jordan , Lebanon and Syria .
millions more displaced and emigrant Palestinians live around the world .
however , their attachment remains strong to the home they , or their parents or grandparents , left behind .
two bloggers in Gaza have written about the pain of exile .
earlier this week the Libya-sponsored aid ship Al-Amal ( “ hope ” ) attempted to sail to the Gaza Strip ( but was forced to change course for Egypt ) .
in Gaza , blogger Kalam was thinking of someone he wished were on the ship :
she wears a prayer scarf and holds prayer beads between her hands , and asks God – or maybe she is just doing what she has seen her parents do when things get tough for them – she appeals to God to make real her wish or more accurately her grandmother &apos;s wish to see her and hug her and kiss her .
this is Hala , who has not yet completed her first year of life , but she carries the inherited feelings of every Palestinian exile .
she is the daughter of a refugee who has seen not a single inch of his land his whole life , and of a mother who lives with her heart split between her homeland and a foreign country , between her family and her marriage , between her mother and her home , between her siblings and her children .
her mind and an important part of her heart are there , and her family and the rest of her heart and her memories are here .
Hala
Kalam continues :
Hala is my young niece who lives in Libya and cannot come to Gaza – which has become everyone &apos;s focus these days .
praise God and ask him to allow her to come to Gaza … She is unable to come because of the difficulty of getting residence in Libya , which means she cannot be sure of returning there where her father who is a displaced person – he does not have an identity number – and the rest of her family are .
Hala is searching for someone to say , “ Welcome to your country ” , and is searching for someone to put her in reach of the affectionate embrace of her grandmother , who adores any picture of her or any video clip in which she appears .
Hala is waiting full of hope , a hope larger than the Libyan ship coming to us here , which I have wished so much she were on so I could embrace her ; when they reach I will see in every one of them a piece of Hala &apos;s image , and I will ask them why they did not bring Hala with them .
also in Gaza , Kawther Abu Hani listens to her mother reminisce :
“ I would love to know what happened to our small house which we left in Nazareth years ago … What do the hills look like now ?
and perhaps the scent of thyme has changed … How old my friends have grown , and I have become just a story for their children … Goodness me , I didn &apos;t even attend their weddings .
I wanted to live through the stages of my life with them , and most of all I was waiting for the day on which we would learn about love and forget about games , when we &apos;d fall in love until we became depressed .
oh dear , but the worry of love is not like the worry of &#91; the Israeli &#93; occupation .
now I remember … ” She is always remembering .
Russia : three Stories of Extreme Poverty
Russian photojournalist Oleg Klimov has recently spent two hours waiting for a train at the train station in Syzran , a city in Russia &apos;s Samara region .
while there , he interacted with a few locals and then jotted down their stories of extreme poverty ( RUS ) on his blog .
&#91; ... &#93; Mother , her daughter , and grandson , aged 5 or so .
have been living at the train station for two days .
are 400 rubles ( approx . $ 13 ) short of &#91; buying tickets &#93; to get to their native village , not far from &#91; Penza &#93; .
are coming back from a funeral .
are waiting for a female relative to arrive and bring those 400 rubles .
the relative isn &apos;t coming – possibly , because she is out of money , too .
they asked &#91; me &#93; to send a text message &#91; from my cell phone &#93; .
ordinary village people .
maybe they aren &apos;t too clever and aren &apos;t too educated , but they are open-minded and ingenuous .
qualities of no small value nowadays .
the daughter sometimes works in Penza , and sometimes doesn &apos;t .
the son doesn &apos;t attend a kindergarten .
&#91; because &#93; there is no kindergarten .
a female relative had died , they gathered all the money they had and set off to bury her .
“ How else ?
– One has to bid a decent human farewell … ” &#91; ... &#93;
&#91; ... &#93; Four ethnic Tatar women commute weekly from their village to Syzran to earn some money .
at best , they make a thousand &#91; rubles ; approx . $ 33 &#93; between the four of them , working as cleaning ladies at public facilities and anywhere else .
there is no work whatsoever in the village .
“ There is work , but none of it pays . ” Sometimes they don &apos;t have enough money to simply buy bread .
so they buy flour and bake their own bread .
to save money .
they have their own potatoes .
and cucumbers , and cabbage .
but they don &apos;t have money .
“ It &apos;s possible to survive , but very difficult .
his children threw him out of his home .
just like that : “ Get the hell out of here … Sometimes I stay with my acquaintances , and sometimes at the train station .
do random jobs , here and there … ” Doesn &apos;t consider himself a hobo , because “ there are no hobos in a small town .
people do help . ” He &apos;s got cold tea in a plastic bottle .
bread and foul-smelling cutlets are wrapped in some piece of rag .
he ate one cutlet with bread . washed it down with tea and fell asleep on the train station bench right after that .
just lowered his head onto his chest and fell asleep .
Klimov ends his post on an emotional note , writing that “ it &apos;s horrible to watch all this , ” and that there is no shortage of such stories in the “ sleek-looking ‘ Putin &apos;s Russia &apos; ” :
&#91; ... &#93; You can spend a couple more hours there and write a piece .
with no comments .
just by listening and writing down things that people say to each other .
it &apos;s that simple .
any journalist can do this .
and no damn intellectual analysis is required .
Haiti : Fanmi Lavalas and the next elections
last weekend , the Haitian blogosphere was buzzing about the exclusion of political parties from the April 2009 Senatorial elections by the Conseil Electoral Provisoire or Temporary Electoral Council – and on Friday January 6th , the CEP published a list of the candidates for the next democratic parliamentary elections in Haiti .
Vario Sérant presents in Alterpresse a list of the rejected candidates :
another rejected candidate is the CEO of “ Coeurs Unis ” David Chéry , who was enlisted with “ Alliance pour l ’ avancement d ’ Haïti ” ( Alyans ) .
it is also over for the leader of the “ Front pour la reconstruction nationale ” ( the National Reconstruction Front ) , Guy Philippe .
in the list published by the Temporary Electoral Council , only two thirds of the candidates enlisted were accepted into the competition , but the most surprising thing has been the rejection of all the candidates of Fanmi Lavalas .
the famous Radiokiskeya talks about this decision here :
late on Thursday night , the Temporary Electoral Council published a list of 65 candidates out of 105 , who are allowed to run for the Senatorial by-elections on April 19th 2009 .
none of the candidates from any of the two Fanmi Lavalas ( party of the former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide ) lists were kept in .
both lists were presented by two rival branches from Lavalas . many reasons have been put forward to explain this total rejection , like this one from radiokiskeya :
most of the candidates rejected by the Electoral Council were accused of being involved into criminal affairs and illegal drug trafficking , either by the national network of human rights watchdogs , Haiti National Police and Justice .
in HaitiRectoVerso , Decky Lakyel reports on the statement of Frantz Verret , president of the Electoral Council , as he explained the decision to reject all Lavalas candidates :
‘ We only considered the applications submitted by each candidate , ’ he added .
‘ The candidates of Fanmi Lavalas did not present any documentary evidence from their party &apos; , he explained without commenting on the inner problems of Aristide &apos;s political party .
but it is in the last part of this same post that one of the most controversial explanations can be found :
‘ We have abidden by the electoral law and the Constitution , ’ swears Mr Verret , who thinks that all the protagonists have to strive to respect the first electoral law of Haiti .
besides , the president of the Electoral council stresses that the Haitian President &#91; René Préval &#93; , has not , in any way , swayed the decision of the council .
the fact that Verret denies the influence of the President is not coincidental , since many think that it was done against former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
the rejection of the 40 candidates ( among which 11 are from Lavalas ) has triggered several reactions – and quite important ones at that – as we can read from this thread on Forum Haiti &#91; Fr / Creole &#93; .
according to radiokiskeya , who was quoted many times , both the USA and Canada have expressed their discontent at the supposedly biased rejection of some candidates :
Janet Ann Sanderson , Ambassador of the USA in Haiti &#91; ... &#93; insists on the fact that in democratic states ‘ honest and democratic elections are inclusive and not exclusive ’ and aim at supporting ‘ the unification of democracy ’ thanks to the involvement of all main political parties .
probably strengthened by this external support , Lavalas has decided to appeal the Electoral Council decision , even though the Council has announced that its decision is final :
the spokesman of the Temporary Electoral Council , Frantz Bernadin , informed the journalists on Friday &#91; Jan . 6th &#93; that since the Council is the ultimate electoral appeal court , its decision concerning the enlisted candidates cannot be appealed .
Tanzania : newspaper Shut Down by Government
the media industry in Tanzania has received with great astonishment news of the closure of MwanaHalisi newspaper .
a government report posted on Wavuti blog explained in brief that :
the government has decided to close down the production of Mwanahalisi for an unknown period of according to the Newspaper Act of 1976 , clause ( 25 ) ( i ) .
the clause will be in effect from July 30th , 2012 based on the government notice 258 published on the government newspaper produced in Dar es Salaam on 27th July , 2012 .
the edition that led to the closure of the paper .

the notice adds :
the government requires the owners , editors and journalists to abide by the law , patriotism , follow the guidelines and ethics of journalism in their aim to spread news , inform and entertain people .
through this notice , the government explains that the reasons for closing down the publication include the presence of articles and news that incite violence , enmity and give citizens a reason to doubt the authorities .
professor Joseph Mbele , the blogger behind hapa kwetu , commented on the closure of Mwanahalisi , saying :
if the government was wiser , it would have thought about the issues raised by Dr.Ulimboka &#91; the spokesman for Tanzanan doctors who was abducted and tortured by unidentified people during their strike &#93; as reported in the Mwanahalisi .
closing down this paper will increase people &apos;s fear that the government is involved in the attack on Dr.Ulimboka
it is probable that the government is not involved , but this actions may be detrimental to the government itself .
he concludes by saying :
I am not pleased with the interference of my right to read whatever I please .
I am an adult with my own brains .
I can discern what I read .
when the government closes a paper or bans a book , it is an insult on the people as it translates to mean that they can &apos;t read and interpret on their own .
Geophrey Mlewa through Facebook asks :
where , are we heading to with such dictatorship ?
they claim that the law was not followed , but had it been stories praising the government would they have closed it down ?
… the stones will talk.Amen !
Facebook user Hilda M. Mbangati writes on the opinion section of Geophrey &apos;s page :
Duuh , this is the government !
CCM hurrah …
Simon Mkina was tagged in a Facebook picture that had Mwanahalisi with the caption :
R.I.P MwanaHalisi , now let us read the rumuors . on his Facebook page , Ismail Mbuyu writes :
the closure of Mwanahalisi has hurt me.I hope that president Kikwete will open it .
it will reveal weaknesses of his leaders.How will Kubenea &#91; the Acting Editor of the paper &#93; get innermost details when he is not at the source ?
let the journal continue giving us the facts .
it is upon the government to check its house not Kubenea
the notice of the paper &apos;s closure was announced on JamiiForums , which generated the following comments :
the government wants to seal our lips so that we do not know of their evils and continue being in darkness .
Ndahani wrote :
Haaahaa !
Kubenea &#91; Mwanahalisi Acting Editor &#93; exposed this people .
JF Senior Expert Member Osokoni asks :
why is Radio Imani that preaches religious hatred still not closed ?
are there double standards in the media ?
however , this move is a little too late .
this is not the first time the paper has been banned – it was withdrawn for three months in 2008 .
the history of banning newspapers in Tanzania began a long time ago .
in Kulikoni Ughaibuni blog by Chahali , there is an article that questions freedom of information in Tanzania : ‘ Is the problem the state , fear or self-protection ? ’
there are still many questions about media freedom in Tanzania : what will happen to other media outlets ?
what does the Opposition have to say about this issue ?
let &apos;s wait and see .

the Pope in Cameroon ( 2 ) : of Clerics , Corruption and Politics
the visit of the head of the Roman Catholic Church to Cameroon this March 2009 has ignited some Cameroonian bloggers to point the search lights on the political effects ( if any ) of a Papal visit to country like this .
Neba Fuh blogging at Voice of the Oppressed is one of them :
two times before , Late Pope John Paul II visited The Cameroons and the effect on the already impoverished populace was nothing more than a religious euphoria at the expense of their personal financial contributions and the public treasury .
the unanswered questions of the Biya &apos;s repressive acts were still unanswered .
Aloysius Agendia , a journalist and ex-seminarian in a post entitled Pope Benedict XVI visit to AFRICA : going beyond spiritual rhetoric seems to suggest that the Church should denounce acts by states and politicains that harm the people &apos;s interest instead of being clothed in diplomatic robes :
we understand the Church and the Vatican as a state , and as a religious body , though with political connotations , sometimes has to be diplomatic in its approach .
in my opinion , true religion must not be indifferent to injustices , oppression , exploitation , colonialism in all its forms and other vices .
the Catholic Church has done much and is still doing a lot but a lot more still has to be done.However , diplomacy though good in its own ways , must not be of too common usage in the Church because , a spade must be called a spade .
in trying to always use “ subtle ” means to explain burning issues , the message is either lost or the meaning / importance , seriously minimized .
Church leaders must not choose to dine only with those in power , the rich , and the powerful .
they must not necessarily be with the opposition , but , they should stand beside the weak , the oppressed , the sick etc .
he is clear about what he expects from the Pope :
as a spiritual leader who represents hope , he must not only tell us to just keep waiting and hoping .
we expect him to be courageous enough to tell those thwarting the hope of Cameroonians and Africans to at least , have some feelings for human beings and or their fellow citizens .
on the other hand , Voice of the Oppressed wonders if the clergy particularly in Cameroon has the moral high ground to demand change from those who govern the country when they themselves are not shinning examples :
what lessons can an already morally impoverished society learn from a bishop or priest who fathers children haphazardly in his community ?
what lessons can that society learn from a priest who has numerous ‘ girlfriends ’ in his community , under the excuse that he is only as human as everybody else ?
or sponsored a girlfriend &apos;s trip abroad , away from his community , so she can bear him kids , and when he takes his vacation or study leave , he &apos;s welcome abroad by ‘ his wife ’ and ‘ children &apos; ?
or a Principal of a school , who is a priest , who embezzles school money through fake bills and accounting ?
or priests that have become predators to vulnerable children put at their disposal ?
to Aloysius Agendia should Pope Benedict XVI of the perceived waywardness of Catholic prelates in Cameroon :
as the Holy Father visits Cameroon and Africa , he should note this .
first and foremost , the Catholic Church and most of its ( shepherds ) in Cameroon in particular , need serious “ redressing ” or “ overhauling ” .
the numerous stories about promiscuity , extravagance and gallivanting attitudes of some of our priests including some bishops , some even go as far as bearing children , others fornicating with their students , peoples ’ wives , parishioners etc must be addressed …
this blogger belives if these issues of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church in Cameroon are not handled by the Pope then the visit would have no meaning to him :
Mortgaging the Church and its assets for “ loans ” , as if to sell Jesus Christ again for FCFA 950.000 . 000 as Judas did for 30 pieces of silver .
Tis follows using a famous Cathedral in Cameroon as a security for a loan taken by one of its bishop .
the serious and terrifying cases of embezzlement among others , merit papal attention .
these are issues which if the Pope fails to address even in private with his priests , then his mission to Cameroon , I must admit , must have fallen far belowexpectations , and why not , a non-starter .
will the Pope dare ?
that may be the next point of interest of the Cameroonian blogosphere .

Thailand : calm before the storm ?
the March 12 anti-government rally ended peacefully with the Red Shirts vowing to return to the streets this weekend as they continue to push for the dissolution of Parliament and the holding of new elections .
the Red Shirts are planning to stage a “ million-man march ” on March 14 , Sunday , to topple the current administration .
many Red Shirts are supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra but not all of them are fans of the fugitive leader who was recently found guilty by the court of corruption charges .
the Red Shirts view the incumbent Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva as being illegitimate and undemocratic .
the March 12 rallies in Bangkok and in the rural north marked the beginning of a series of protests that are scheduled to take place this weekend .
the government estimated the crowd at 6,500 but rally organizers claimed they mobilized more than 30,000 people in the streets .
the Red Shirts have promised not to use violence in the rallies but this youtube video shows a scuffle between a Red Shirter and a motorist
another video depicts alleged members of the Red Shirts in an act of distributing cash to rally participants .
the D-Day is still two days away but many Bangkok residents have chosen to stay away from the major rally sites .
banks were closed ; dozens of countries issued travel advisories against going to Thailand this weekend ; and residents were told not wear red or yellow which are “ politically charged colors ” in Thailand .
the Yellow Shirts are supporters of the government .
Christopher Moore identifies the new media as alternative source of information about the situation in Bangkok
in Bangkok , at the best of times , it is difficult to get a static free signal .
in the worst of times , it is impossible .
there is too much noise rattling around inside the system .
TV and radio is still under the control of the government and the information broadcast is generally pro government .
but there is no longer a monopoly on broadcasting information .
the Internet , Twitter , cell phone text messages are running hot with information , rumors , threats , warnings , and fear .
the clash of messages has led to uncertainty and confusion .
what we have at the moment is fear , passion , anger , hatred and distrust .
the information and knowledge is being filtered through these emotions
Newley observes that no extraordinary event took place on March 12 in Bangkok
many people here in Bangkok expected the day to be chaotic .
businesses closed early .
schools cancelled classes .
and while there were small demonstrations in some parts of city , it was largely a day like any other in central Bangkok .

Iran : has blogging become less popular since the election ?
Eleven Iranian bloggers and media professionals representing different parts of the political spectrum have answered a questionnaire about the changing dynamics of Iranian citizen media since the election .
before the June 2009 presidential election the most dynamic pillars of citizen media in Iran were YouTube and blogs .
the election and the crisis that followed introduced Facebook and Twitter as two new primary channels of online citizen expression .
for a short time during the election , the Iranian government blocked access to Facebook , YouTube , Twitter and several other websites .
some , including one leading Islamist blogger , called it a miscalculated strategy that helped the Iranian opposition dominate in the virtual realm .
despite the regime &apos;s attempts to filter social media websites , they became a powerful communication platform for the Green Movement .
so did the Iranian presidential election change the dynamics of citizen media tools and channels ?
are Facebook and Twitter the dominant players ?
are blogs gradually become a second hand channel for sharing ideas ?
what are the channels political activists use the most ?
I asked one leading Islamist blogger ; three Green bloggers ; one leading environmentalist blogger ; five media people ; and one active blogger , to participate in a short multiple-choice survey .
a group of eleven netizens could never represent the entire Iranian blogosphere , but it is a small step to gain insight .
1-Which are the sites you visit frequently since the presidential election ?
Facebook was the favorite with six points , Twtter is at the bottom with one point .
blogs got two points and FriendFeed and YouTube three each .
2-In your opinion which sites do political and civil society activists use ?
blogs are still king with six points , Facebook gets three points , you Tube two points , FriendFeed one , Twitter got zero , and None gets one point .
six of our netizens believe the importance of the blogs after the presidential election did not diminish , two think blogs became more important , and three believe their importance was diminished .
of the latter group , two think that blogs became less important because of Facebook &apos;s growing popularity , and one thinks the reason is that bloggers became less active .
3-What is / are the site / s you prefer to discuss your favorite topics :
blogs are mentioned 4 times , Facebook , 6 times , FriendFeed 3 times and Twitter one time .
in sum , reading this survey shows that after presidential election Iranian netizens have gone more visual and that Facebook has become a place to be for many of them including political leaders .
the survey also shows that the so-called ‘ twitter revolution ’ ( at least for our 11 participants ) may have been more a phenomenon of western media than one of lasting consequence in the Iranian virtual world .
blogs still remain a valuable place but are losing the ground to the newcomers .
probably there is one certainty that after presidential election , nothing remained the same in Iranian community , the virtual as well as physical one .
Ghana : Accra Twestival 2010 : social Media Activity With Substance ?
if social media is changing communication patterns in the West , it sure has not fallen short of touching interesting places on the African continent .
during the 2008 Ghana Presidential elections , many Ghanaians took to social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to share concerns and opinions about the process .
when the winner of the race was announced , these same sites became spots for jubilation – at least for supporters of the winning party .

online celebration events have been scheduled , for instance , after the 2008 U.S. Presidential elections , and thousands of people from all over the world have signed up to attend , virtually .
so it is no surprise that people from this same digital era have decided to take advantage of the techno-crazed lifestyle and jump on an Accra Twestival in Ghana .
well , this time it will take place offline .
MacJordan , one of Global Voices ’ own , is collaborating with Rodney Quarcoo , a recognized Ghanaian photographer to bring this seemingly entertaining event to the people of Ghana .
but this is no ordinary affair .
as MacJordan coined it in a post about the event :
&#91; it &#93; is aimed at supporting a great cause ; that is securing Educational materials for children in deprived areas in Ghana .
he further elaborates in the post :
on Thursday 25 March 2010 , people in hundreds of cities around the world including Accra will come together offline to rally around the important cause of Education by hosting local events to have fun and create awareness .
Twestival ™ ( or Twitter Festival ) uses social media for social good .
all of the local events are organized 100 % by volunteers and 100 % of all donations go direct to projects .
where will the funds go ?
the same thread provides this information :
each city hosting a Twestival will be given the opportunity to select an area of education to support .
this will be recognized with a special icon on their website once they have set a goal .
for as little as $ 28USD they can provide the uniform , books , pencils , and paper a child needs to attend one year of school .
concern Worldwide is able to guarantee that 100 % of Twestival funds will go direct to project costs .
the vibrantly designed logo for this event , created by Quarcoo , does a great job of evoking excitement about the festival .
a February 9th tweet on Quarcoo ’ s Twitter page in response to the announcement of the event read :
let &apos;s go tweople .
let &apos;s make it happen .
Accra Twestival ’ s Twitter Page has been calling on people to sign up to volunteer at the event .
according to this page , the organizers seem to be reaching out to some of Ghana ’ s popular music artists to get involved and make a event successful .
an eye-catching message on Accra Twestival ’ s Twitter page read :
education gives people a voice in their communities .
it also makes people aware of their rights and opportunities .
indeed .
education is an area with much need of intervention on the continent , especially rural Africa .
it would be interesting to see how much need is met with Accra ’ s Twestival .
Bangladesh : court Orders Shutting Down of Facebook Pages for Blasphemous Contents
on 21 March , 2012 , a Bangladesh court ordered concerned authorities to shut down five Facebook pages and a website for blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed , the Koran and other religious subjects .
the ruling has also demanded why hosts / creators / administrators of the website / pages should not be be brought to justice for uploading indecent materials .
the most worrying aspect is that the order also asks why the process of shutting down such websites / pages in the future should not be initiated .
two university teachers filed a law suit earlier complaining that these pages and the site were hurting people &apos;s religious sentiments .
Facebook is extremely popular in Bangladesh and there are an estimated 2.5 million Facebook users and the country ranks 55th .
in 2010 , Facebook was temporarily blocked for sometime on charges of malicious propaganda against the Prime Minister and hurting religious feelings .
according to reports the accused pages contain disparaging remarks and cartoons about Prophet Mohammed , the Muslim holy book of Koran , Jesus , Lord Buddha and Hindu gods .
some of the cartoons of the Gods are said to be very close to pornography .
the netizens were slow to react on this as they know that there had been a law suit against an University teacher for his Facebook Status .
furthermore , there is an increasing pressure on the government to closely monitor Facebook activities as it is being used for all sorts of purposes .
they are also concerned whether this ruling , if imposed , will be used as a precedence to curb freedom of speech of netizens .
Facebook user Tanvir questioned in a note &#91; bn &#93; :
the 27th section of the constitution : every citizen is equal in the eyes of the law and protected by the law equally .
I want to know whether the respected court feels that the numbers of Hindu / Buddhists / Christian / Atheist / Non-believer / Agnostic etc are less in the country so their feelings are not that important and because we have a Muslim majority their feelings are far more important .
whether the respected court is interested only to protect only from hurting religious feelings or from other feelings too ( e.g. feelings on court rulings , feeling on science , feelings on history , feelings on sports etc ) … . we see that people are hurting all sorts of feelings of others .
we Bengalis are very emotional with our feelings .
Tanvir comments :
I am against such ridiculing and parody of the religions but cannot support the measure to shut down Forums / blogs / websites as a measure to deter such ridiculing .
because it shuts down the avenue of all constructive and logical criticisms .
we have to keep in mind , the reply to pen should be given with pen , not with sword or muscles .
some Facebook users are supporting this ban and reminds that there are a few atheist sites in Bangladesh who do not have blasphemous contents but have constructive criticisms .
the recent court ruling is not on those but on sites that are really harmful .
another Facebook user Ranadipam says &#91; bn &#93; :
the silence of the internet sites do not disturb me because I have the right to enter or avoid those sites .
but the religious sermons and the loud sounds of other religious activities around me hamper my individual rights and disturb me .
they hurt my all types of feelings .
where from will I get justice ?
the concerned authorities said that they have contacted Facebook authorities to block these pages and the Bangladeshi netizens are fortunate that this time the authorities are following the court order prudently and there is no blanket ban on Facebook .
Iran : protests and Repression
Tehran protests , via jomhour.info
hundreds of thousands of Iranians in Tehran and several other cities have rallied to support presidential candidate Mir Hussein Mousavi , defying a government ban on demonstrations .
protesters are calling for the annulment of the presidential election results , saying President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ‘ s victory in the 12th of June election is a fraud .
security forces have struck down hard on demonstrators , and at least one person was killed in Tehran today .
although Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are currently blocked in Iran , many Iranians have been using proxies to bypass filters and report up-to-the-minute news .
Iranian authorities have also blocked SMS text messages , and are also filtering several news websites reflecting reformist opinions .
Iran09 tweeted earlier today :
“ I confirm that there &apos;s a Basij &#91; Islamist militia &#93; station around the square and they shot ppl from the roof .
# iranelection ”
Jadi tweeted :
“ People are still joining to the demonstration .
chanting ‘ Mousavi !
Mousavi !
take back my vote ’ # IranElection ”
Mousavi spoke and called for the election results to be reviewed .
he said he is ready to take part in a new election .
there are some video news clips about the election here .
as protest grows so does repression
students who protested against the presidential election at diffrent universities were attacked by security forces .
here is a video film showing a dormitory of the University of Tehran on Sunday night .
update : here is a Flickr slideshow of photos showing more of the destruction left behind by security forces in University of Tehran dormitories on Sunday night .
according to the Flickr user , Agha Hadi , many students were jailed .
below , is a film showing an Iranian woman taking on security forces by a bus stop .
Azarmehr comments on this film :
look at this brave Iranian lioness , first she swing kicks and then she side kicks the neanderthal truncheon wielding riot guard !
she gets a few baton strikes but this is the price for freedom and she cares not.Blessed is our motherland Iran , for having such daughters .
the fear is gone and the momentum continues .
thanks to Tehranlive we have several photos of Iranian people &apos;s protest and resistance movement :
green Vote tweeted that one of people &apos;s slogan is , ‘ Don &apos;t be afraid , we are all together &apos; .
green Vote also tweeted that Mohammad Ali Tarekh , a student activist , was arrested in Shiraz .
several bloggers such as Zeitoon report that people chant Allah-0-Akbar ( God is Greater ) from their houses during the night .
Mousavi asked people to chant Allah-o-Akbar from the rooftops of their homes .
during 1978-79 Islamic Revolution people use to do the same as a protest move against Shah .
where is Obama ?
view from Iran , an American blogger , writes :
ultimately , I know that rhetoric is just rhetoric .
that the words of a president do not actually change history even though they become part of it .
if ever there was a time for Obama to turn on his rhetorical charm , it is now .
today at 4 pm there will be demonstrations in 20 cities in Iran .
my friends * want to be on the streets .
* They are parents , civil servants , accountants , receptionists , and yes students .
in the end , with all of the violence , I am not sure that they will show up .
so Obama , turn on your charm .
use your powers of rhetoric to tell Iranians that , while we won &apos;t be sending in the marines , our hearts are with you .
I know you can do a better job than I can .
Isfahan &apos;s suffering
Tehran is not the only city where people protesting have been repressed .
protesters in Isfahan , have also been the targets of security forces .
Iranevents has published several photos of Iranian protests .
people are being chased by security forces here :

Tanzania : farewell to a Film Star
Tanzania bid farewell to one of its most popular film stars , Steven Kanumba , with an emotionally-charged funeral on 11 April , 2012 .
he died early on Saturday morning , aged 28 , after an altercation with his girlfriend Elizabeth ‘ Lulu ’ Michael .
more than 30,000 people gathered to pay their last respects .

some mourners took photos and tweeted live as people grieved , fainted &#91; sw &#93; and demanded to carry the coffin of the much-loved iconic actor to the cemetery .
@ BongoCelebrity tweeted :
@ BongoCelebrity : people are chanting heartily saying they want to take him from the car and carry him themselves ! news of Kanumba ’ s death broke out on early Saturday morning via social media .
blogger Pretty Sintah wrote &#91; sw &#93; :
dear people ,
I am saddened to inform you of the death of Steven Kanumba who died at one o &apos;clock in the morning , his body is at the Muhimbili hospital .
cause of death , it is alleged that Lulu &#91; his girlfriend &#93; and Kanumba were dating secretly , and were together when he died , Lulu pushed Kanumba when they were arguing and Kanumba fell , bled and met his death .
now Lulu is at Oysterbay police station .
I will bring you more updates
but let us not blame Lulu because sometimes arguments arise in a relationship
when you write a comment know that I was at the scene , from his home and when we took his body to the hospital and back to his house in Sinza .
that is all
much has been written about the death of Steven Kanumba and the alleged role that his girlfriend Lulu played , but probably one comment on Pretty Sintah ’ s blog sums up &#91; sw &#93; the mood on social media regarding this tragedy :
it ’ s so painful to lose you our Hero and the only existed Steven Kanumba ‘ the great &apos; .
Tanzanians gonna really miss you our best friend .
am sending my condolence to your lovely mom , your young bro , your family members , our bongo movie friends and the entire TZ community .
its not good to judge anyone on this issue , only God can judge a person , Imagine if you are the one judged by everyone as what is happening to lulu now ! !
I am very sure that Lulu was not intending to do any bad thing to Kanumba , and am also sure that Lulu was not involved in this matter in any way , may be there was something else concerning Kanumba &apos;s health , but let us wait for the Doctors and Lawyers to play their part .
R.I.P our beloved Kanumba .
it ’ s a high time for our guys like Vincent Kigosi and others to go on with this good thing Kanumba started ; we still have good actors and actresses who can take us to the next level .
I really believe in you Ray .
Wavuti has a curated commentary from social media including Kanumba ’ s last tweets as well as tweets by his fans after his death .
Rwanda : fifteen years after the genocide
today marks the end of a week of national mourning in Rwanda to mark 15 years since the genocide which killed 800,000 people .
on the 7th of April ceremonies were held in the capital Kigali , and in Nyanza , where more than 5,000 people were slaughtered .
at a stadium in Kigali , thousands of candles spelt out the word “ hope ” in three languages .
Rwandan blogger Negrita &apos;s Chronicles asked her readers to join the nation-wide candlelight vigil for the victims through her blog :
it has been 15 years since the Genocide forever changed my home and my people .
the world stood silent as cries for help went unheeded .
please join us in lighting a candle in memory of those whose lives were taken and in hope for a future of peace , justice , and true reconciliation .
in succesive posts , Negrita posted a video for the campaign Candles for Rwanda , and the song ‘ Never Again ’ written and recorded in commemoration of the Genocide .
the song was composed by Rwanda &apos;s gospel singer Jean Paul Samputu in Kinyanrwanda , but its choruses are sung in different languages ( English , French , Swahili , Kirundi and Kiganda ) by various popular regional musicians .

Martin Leach , the head of the DFID ( British Department for International Development ) in Rwanda attended the ceremonies in Nyanza , which he describes in his blog :
hundreds of people trudged up the long hill to Nyanza , many of them wearing something purple , a neckscarf , a wrap , even a purple wristband .
the colour purple is the colour of mourning in Rwanda and yesterday , 7th April , was the 15th Anniversary of the Genocide .
at the top of the hill I joined the large crowd at the Commemoration Ceremony .
Wedged between two ambassadors , I heard heart breaking accounts from survivors of the massacre which took place on the site where we were seated , with no one to protect them against the brutal attacks of the militia .
and it was emotional . even the Government Ministers were shedding tears , remembering their experiences and lost loved ones .
I can &apos;t imagine it – one million people killed in 100 days : as the Lady Mayor of Kigali said ‘ an unspeakable evil ’ had gripped the country .
Michael Abramowitz of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum was in Kigali for the ceremonies .
in the blog World is Witness , Abramovitz recounts the testimony of a genocide survivor called Venuste that moved the audience with his story during the ceremony :
Venuste , who looked to be in his 50s or 60s , with a dignified bearing , proceeded to tell the hushed crowd how his family and neighbors decided to take refuge at the nearby L ’ Ecole Technique Officielle , thinking that might be a safe refuge because of the small contingent of Belgian United Nations soldiers stationed there .
but four days later , to their great shock , the small U.N. force departed , telling those gathered on the school grounds that “ gendarmes ” would rescue them .
the U.N. soldiers ignored their desperate pleas not to leave them at the mercy of a menacing crowd of government soldiers and armed militia that surrounded them outside the gates of the school .
after the departure of the last U.N. soldier , Venuste and some 5,000 others who were gathered on the school grounds were forced to walk a jeering gauntlet of Hutu militiamen , soldiers and civilians wielding machetes , guns and other weapons .
some of those who survived described it as a “ death walk . ” Venuste lost his right arm , hacked off by one of the tormentors .
the walkers came to this unremarkable hill , where they were encircled by a gang of killers and set upon with grenades , machetes and clubs .
within a few hours , Venuste said , “ We were lying in pools of blood . ”
of the 5,000 or so who sought refuge from the U.N. near here , roughly 100 survived , according to Venuste .
he lived only because he laid still under dead bodies , overlooked by the killers searching the carnage for signs of life .
impressed by the economic development of Rwanda , Abramowitz sees no traces of the atrocities experienced 15 years ago :
as I first-time visitor to Rwanda , it ’ s hard not to be mystified by the mismatch between the ferocious events of just 15 years ago and apparent calm and prosperity in Rwanda , which aspires to be the hub of an economically vibrant East Africa .
as we drove out of town to one of the churches where you can still see the skulls and belongings of murdered Tutsi , we passed by workers digging up ditches on the side of the road to lay down new fiber optic lines .
a newcomer thinks : how can this beautiful country , routinely described by Africa hands as one of the better functioning countries on the continent , have experienced such savagery ?

Colette Braeckman , a Belgian journalist and author of several books about Central Africa , was also present at the anniversary ceremony in Kigali of which she writes :
from the crowds gathered before the “ garden of remembrance ” and the genocide memorial , cries are bursting out , disrupting the official speeches .
the whole time , convulsed or fainting bodies are taken away by the ambulances .
when Venuste Kasirika takes the stage and tells about his ordeal , his story is punctuated by the sobbing that shakes up the audience .
walking around modern-day Kigali , Braeckman makes a similar observation as Abramowitz about the disconnect with the horrible past :
in this modern , ambitious city , where the low-income neighborhoods have been razed and its inhabitants have been moved further away ; amid these buildings with banks , stores and offices , seeing these perfectly manicured flower beds and these green spaces that look like English gardens , how can we believe that , fifteen years ago , garbage trucks were collecting corpses by the loads and were dropping them at the hospital , like piles of refuse ?
seeing these well-dressed people , all wearing city shoes ( going barefoot is forbidden ) how can we remember the killers with the lunatic gaze , drunk with beer , with pot and with hate , adorned with amulets , brandishing shotguns and long machettes and were hounding , like you hound animals , their Tutsi neighbors that were forced to hide in the double ceilings , in the ditches and in the hedgerows ?
Yves Zihindula , a Congolese blogger based in Goma , remembers the genocide as seen from the other side of the border :
exactly 15 years ago hundreds of thousands of people ( refugees ) poured into the Democratic Republic of Congo .
this date brings back the appalling images of women and children weakened by hunger on the streets of Goma .
I remember having seen human corpses in the Kivu lake , thrown from the Rwandan side of the lake and brought by the waves to the Congolese side .
at the time I had seen garbage trucks transporting human bodies and droping them off in mass graves .
not good memories at all .
it still feels weird to realize this tragedy .
humans killing each other .
even between animals these kinds of situations rarely happen .
I dare to hope that this is not going to happen again and that the whole Africa ( and the whole world ) have learnt a lesson .

Pakistani Activist Khudi Ali Killed in Bombings Targeting Hazaras
on 10 January , 2013 in Pakistan &apos;s southwestern city of Quetta , 82 people lost their lives in back-to-back bombings that hit an area populated primarily by ethnic Hazara Shia Muslims .
Irfan Khudi Ali , a prominent human rights activist who tirelessly highlighted the persecution of Hazara Shia in Pakistan , passed away in the second attack .
vigil for @ khudiali in Islamabad .
picture by @ ali _ abbas _ zaidi
on Twitter , Ali reported narrowly escaping the first bombing in Quetta :
@ khudiali : # Quetta , was on the way to home nearly escaped from bomb blast 11 ppl dead .
Maria Memon tweeted :
Ali cldnt survive the 2nd blast tonite.RIP @ khudiali RT @ khudiali # Quetta , was on the way to home nearly escaped 4m bomb blast 11 ppl dead
his killing has sparked a tribute to his struggle and reignited protests on Shia killings in Pakistan .
Ali &apos;s last tweet was a report from the ground regrading the migration of Hazaras as a result of persecution :
@ khudiali # Hazara families of # Machh , Khuzdir finally succumbed to the genocidal pressure &amp; moving out .
sad day for diversity in # Balochistan .
Irfan Ali during a protest against sectarian violence in Islamabad , September 2012 .
from the Facebook page of Pakistan Youth Alliance .
since 2001 , Hazara Shia Muslims from Quetta — have routinely been targeted by militant groups .
being a minority within a minority , the killing of Hazara Shias is one of the most underreported cases of violence in Pakistan .
Hazara.net archives statistics of killings of Hazara Shiites in Pakistan , including number of attacks and the number of people killed in the attacks thus far .
according to the statistics on the site a total of 1100 Hazara Shiites have been killed in Pakistan since 1999 .
media outlets often face the heat for not acknowledging the nature of the attacks and when they do they are criticized for using the term ‘ sectarian ’ when a particular sect is being targeted .
in an effort to create more noise and build pressure on law enforcement agencies and the government , there &apos;s been an active debate on social media regarding the targeted killings of Shiites using the # shiakillings and # shiagenocide on Twitter .
Hazara activists have , in the past , used social media to get international media &apos;s attention in order to get their stories reported .
well respected journalist Mohammad Hanif writes :
@ mohammedhanif : there seems to be a near consensus here that calling a sectarian attack , a sectarian attack , is the major cause of sectarian attacks
@ zainabimam : well done , Faisal Qureshi ( actor ) for a detailed morning show on the Shia view of belief .
daring of him .
thank you from a # Shia .
# Pakistan
@ adyadeel : # ShiaGenocide must end .
govt must take concrete steps to show that they r serious to save innocent Shia lives
blogger Omar Biden wrote a brief yet moving tribute to Irfan Khudi Ali on his blog :
yesterday was one of many blood-soaked days for Balochistan ’ s capital , Quetta .
already in the morning the residents of city got to hear a blast pow , where explosives were planted in a Frontier Corp vehicle at Bacha Khan Chowk .
the explosion resulted in 12 innocent lives being perished .
indeed , it created helter-skelter between the residents to bury the dead bodies .
yet the more-then-enough rule doesn ’ t work in Pakistan , at least not in Quetta .
after an interval of only few hours Alamdar Road , a majorly Shia Hazara people territory , witnessed another mass massacre , still the same tactic as in the morning -bomb blast .
nevertheless this time planned “ Mardanawar ” , boldly , a twin-blast to claim an unforgettable catastrophe ( … )
he brutal incidents cost an enormous loss to humanity indeed .
it also happened to be the death of an admired friend , a human rights activist – Irfan Ali Khudi .
allegedly , Irfan Ali Khudi , 33 , had come to Quetta so that he could “ deliver peace training to young activist ” .
although I intended to write my feelings , yet am leaving this post incomplete …
the blood soaked day in Quetta , as Omar puts it , is not the first of its kind and may not be the last one .
the indifference has angered many , especially since the banned militant organization , Lashkar-e-Jhangvi , that claimed responsibility for the attacks are yet to be apprehended .
@ sehartariq : why do we feel more sympathy for Muslims in Gaza than we do for Muslims in # Pakistan with whom we share history &amp; citizenship # shiagenocide
@ zzzAsad : Shia pilgrims are frequently targeted on buses by sectarian militants # LeJ # ShiaGenocide
@ FahidJaved : you bloody # LeJ butchers , kil me # WeAreAllHazara .
every Pakistani is Hazara , each one of us .
how many wil u kill ?
how many bullets do u hv ?
@ Naseer _ Kakar : latest on # Quetta : all the victims r shifted to military hospital as doctors were threatened by # LeJ in Civil Hospital . # Balochistan # blasts
@ AhmadShuja : RIP @ khudiali .
they took your life , but your courage and inspiration remains .
# LeJ # Quetta
@ ZakirChangezi : quoting # KhudiAli “ My people the Shia are dying .
if I die , I want to die trying to help them ” . # RIPKhudiAli
the families of the victims have refused to bury their dead and have announced that they will continue a sit-in unless the army takes action against the killing sprees .
this image uploaded on Twitter shows thousands of Hazara sitting in the rain with the dead bodies of those massacred in the Quetta bombings .
@ ammar _ faheem : Shia protesters stage sit in on Quetta &apos;s alamdaar road along with bodies of those martyred in yesterday &apos;s blasts # ShiaGenocide
@ AdnanSarparrah : sit-in by the Shia community continues but handing over # Quetta to army won &apos;t solve anything , Quetta is already under control of Army ( FC )
Ali spoke at Tedx event in Rawalpindi city just a few weeks ago , watch his powerful speech here .
Ali dedicated most of his life to highlighting the plight of Hazara , for those who knew him and even those who did not , he has become a symbol of the struggle for justice for the Hazara Community in Pakistan .
as the sit in continues , amid cold and rain , as families refuse to bury their loved ones , will the authorities finally take action to stop the bloodshed ?
till then Ali &apos;s story needs to be heard .
media Freedom Still Murky in Myanmar Despite Progress
Myanmar &apos;s decision to dissolve its notorious censorship board was praised by many groups as a step forward in promoting media freedom in the country .
but press freedom watchdogs also highlighted the continuing threats , difficulties and attacks experienced by Myanmar-based journalists throughout the past year .
for example , independent reporters continue to face a high risk of being slapped with various lawsuits if they expose controversies in the bureaucracy or criticize high ranking government officials .
on February 7 , 2013 , Myanmar parliament has formed a commission to investigate the writer behind the internet blog post titled “ Above the Law ” &#91; my &#93; .
the post was written by someone who used the pseudonym “ Dr.
Sate Phwar ” in the blog Voice of Myanmar &#91; my &#93; .
the article accused members of parliament of disregarding the constitution and also for making decisions on their own without regarding the president &apos;s remarks .
he sarcastically wrote :
why not add this new amendment in the constitution that whatever the constitution may dictate , the Chairperson of the Hluttaw ( parliament ) and his companions can decide among themselves by casting votes in the Hluttaw ( parliament ) .
photo shared by Freedom Media Group ( Burma ) which wrote that a reporter is being attacked by squatters in a relocation area .
the caption also added that “ it is said in some news that this is set up by the special police force to make people hate the squatters . ”
similarly last year , domestic journal The Voice Weekly was charged with defamation by the mining ministry for reporting the misuse of funds and fraud inside the ministry .
fortunately , the ministry dropped the charges earlier this year .
recently , a number of journalists received &#91; my &#93; warnings from Google that there may be pending attacks from “ state-sponsored attackers . ” The warning was given after the Facebook pages of independent local journals The Voice Weekly &#91; my &#93; and Eleven Media Group &#91; my &#93; were defaced by a group called Anonymous Myanmar .
however , the government denied any involvement in the cyber attack .
perhaps in response to the hacking of media sites , the official website &#91; my &#93; of Myanmar &apos;s president was attacked last February 5 , 2013 by hackers suspected to be members of a group called “ Indonesian Fighter Cyber ” .
it is also common to find various hate groups , propaganda photos and messages on the social media .
during the Rakhine riot in 2012 , propaganda photos from both sides of the conflict circulated on the internet .
meanwhile , Taw Win Daund shared on his Facebook page a photo which is thought to be the photo of hired comment writers .
he labeled the photo :
hired comment writers or military students ?
photo shared by Taw Win Daund
hired comment writers , lobbying the fight between the president Thein Sein and Vice-senior General Min Aung Hlaing by writing hate comments under the posts of the Eleven Media , the Voice Weekly and 7 Days News journal .
there are mixed views on the photo .
Steven Myo commented
the writers also include those who have learned in Russia .
la Min Aung refuted the allegation :
this is wrong , using the photos of the students of the military academy to mislead is not good .
this is to divide the people and the army .
although it is hard to say whether it is true or not , hate comments using vulgar language are very common on Facebook in Myanmar .
Syria : sea Side Story
an English literature professor from the little Mediterranean city of Tartous and a Syrian-Canadian writer on a trip to her mother country exchange glances at a cafe called Sea Breeze .
that &apos;s how Mariyah and Abu Fares chose to start their adventure , and their readers ’ new addiction .
a low rumble in my stomach broke into my daydream as a waft of spices and seafood drifted enticingly by me .
I felt as though I hadn ’ t eaten in days .
I looked back through the window and spotted the waitress , resting casually near what appeared to be the kitchen door .
she had been immersed in a book but as though she had a sixth sense , she caught my gaze within seconds of it falling on her .
she smiled knowingly and approached my table .
do you have a menu ? ”
“ Not here .
but I ’ ll tell you what ’ s being made fresh today . ”
“ Oh heaven . ” I thought to myself and smiled back at her , enthusiastically awaiting her description of dinner .
the story starts out as simple as that .
the two writers , who are switching places every week , went from there .
we learn about Yasmina , Prof. Youssef &apos;s former student and the waitress at Sea Breeze , and Yazan , the nonchalant chef , all to the backdrop of Tartous ’ marvelous sea side , and Abu Fares ‘ and Mariyah ‘ s exquisite writing .
when Yasmina was introducing herself my eyes were distracted by the other woman .
with delicate fingers , she picked a small hot fish by the tail , dipped it slightly in a bowl of sauce , brought it close to her lips , blew on it to cool it down then swallowed it all , head , bones and tail like a true gourmet .
she closed her eyes and swam in her own pool of ecstasy .
then … then with her other hand , she pulled at a lock of hair which went astray in front of her face and shepherded it to join the others behind her ear .
it was precisely the way she pulled at her hair that made me utterly defenseless .
we are at Part 16 at the moment , but be sure to catch it from the beginning .
Iran : when Earthquakes Kill , “ TV Broadcasts Prayers ”
two powerful earthquakes hit the northwest region in Iran , East Azarbaijan province on Saturday ( August 11 , 2012 ) , killing 250 people and injuring around 1,800 .
the earthquakes measured 6.4 and 6.3 in magnitude , leaving a trail of destruction and suffering .
Iranians flocked to the Internet to mourn the victims and to appeal for blood donation and help .
they also expressed their anger at the Iranian national TV , which broadcast religious programmes , instead of providing viewers with information about the earthquakes and how to help .
source : international Campaign for Human Rights in Iran
Damavandiyeh writes &#91; fa &#93; :
many people are still under the rubble in the villages .
all State run channels &#91; in Iran there is no private channel &#93; are broadcasting religious programmes , instead of calling people to help .
Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader &apos;s representative in East Azarbaijan said this earthquake reminds us “ the Day of Judgement &apos; .
green City adds &#91; fa &#93; :
people are under rubble needing help but Iranian channels broadcast religious program &#91; Dua &apos;a Jawshan Al Kabir &#93; and one of them is showing “ Down with USA ’ &#91; slogan &#93; …
Aandishe reflects on the tragedy , wondering why mistakes are never learning experiences :
each of us may have been at that place … why we do not learn any lesson from previous earthquakes … shame on liars who come on TV and talk about their accomplishment to increase the resistance of buildings to cope with earthquakes in Iran .
Bidad shares &#91; fa &#93; similar sentiments :
all the telephone communication is interrupted , half province is destroyed and all that the television talks about is religious issues such as fasting instead of informing people about the earthquake .
Venezuela : ‘ Faces and Voices ’ of an Election
Portuguese photographer Eduardo Leal has published an online photographic gallery that aims to “ give a voice to both sides , the supporters of &#91; Hugo &#93; Chávez and of &#91; Henrique Capriles &#93; . ” In ‘ Faces and Voices of an Election ’ , Eduardo captures the thoughts and feelings of the Venezuelan people as they explain who they will vote for in the presidential election on Sunday , October 7 , 2012 .
he opens the introduction to his online gallery with a brief overview of the last 14 years under the government of President Hugo Chávez :
with him in power a new socialism government change &#91; d &#93; the face of the country , previously better known for beauty pageants and as the birthplace of Simón Bolivar , the Latin America liberator .
social reforms were established , help to the poor increased in housing benefits and school programmes .
a voice was given to the ones that never had it .

Eduardo continues explaining that , for many years , Chávez ruled with minimum opposition .
this opposition was “ usually composed by an elite class that for decades enjoyed the benefits of living in an oil-rich country , ” he says .
but Eduardo also points out that , over the years , opposition to Chávez has grown as problems become more evident .
violence on the streets went to levels never seen , putting Caracas on the top of the list of the most dangerous cities in the world .
electricity and food shortages , raising inflation and inflammable speech ’ s from the President start to create new winds and opportunities to the opposition .

Eduardo goes on to discuss the current division in Venezuelan society :
the supporters of Chávez , known as Chavistas , in one side and on the other the opposition composed not only by the middle class and the elite as before , but also by common people that feels that the country needs a change .

he refers to Henrique Capriles , Chávez &apos;s opponent , as the face of “ the rise of the opposition ” and “ the one that for the first time can challenge President Hugo Chávez . ”

Australia : Indian Homicide Reignites Racism Ruckus
the murder of an Indian man in Melbourne has reignited the debate about racism in Australia and the safety of overseas students .
it has also severely strained relations between Australia and India :
Indian diplomats are expected to meet their Australian counterparts for crisis talks in Canberra today following the murder of an Indian migrant in Melbourne .
the murder of 21-year-old accounting graduate Nitin Garg in a Yarraville park on Saturday night was yesterday condemned by politicians in India and Australia .
diplomatic crisis erupts after Indian student &apos;s murder
Australian bloggers ’ responses show a very diverse range of views .
Gerard Henderson , Executive director of The Sydney Institute , speculates on the geopolitical undertones in an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald :
the tragedy happened to coincide with a distinct cooling in the relationship between the two nations over the past couple of years .
during a visit to India in late 2008 I was surprised to hear strong criticism of Kevin Rudd at the highest levels of the New Delhi administration .
India &apos;s prime gripe turned on the refusal of the Rudd Government &apos;s to sell uranium to India , which overturned the intention of John Howard and his senior ministers .
student assaults teach some harsh lessons about racism
Loon Pond , aka Dorothy Parker , takes Henderson to task :
is it just me , or is it just grubbiness of an arcane kind to link the assault and murder of Indians in Australia to Australia &apos;s current policies in relation to the sale of uranium to India ?
that &apos;s the convoluted tap dance performed by Gerard Henderson in Student assaults teach some harsh lessons about racism .
Gerard Henderson , India , uranium , street crime , and a particularly grubby column
Peter Maher blogs for Melbourne radio station 3AW . he is concerned that there is a culture of denial , whether or not the killing was racially motivated :
how anyone can say it is not race related when they do not know the circumstances of the murder as I said earlier is difficult to comprehend .
what I do know though is that this abusive , violent , murderous behaviour towards Indians in this country is far too prevalent to suggest that we do not have a problem with racism in this country .
… We are so quick to brush these racist tendencies under the carpet and provide the world with this image of us as being non-discriminatory and all-inviting .
I think it is time we took a real good look at ourselves and do something about the racism that exists in this country .
wake up Australia !
we are racist
Dave , blogging as True Blue Aussie , has little doubt about the nature of any racism :
of course everyone in Melbourne is aware , that Footscray , which used to be an Australian suburb , is now full of Islamic Sudanese , Middle Eastern Arabs and Somalians .
there is hardly an Australian to be seen in Footscray .
so , welcome to the divisive multicultural , ethnically diverse , immigration hell hole where immigrants ( in this case likely be be muslims ) attack other immigrants and Australians are blamed .
Dave
racist immigrants will be blamed for the fatal stabbing of an Indian man
a Facebook group , 1,000,000 True Aussies Against Racism , has a very different view of what it means to be an “ Australian ” .
stop the vocal minority who are using Facebook and talk back radio to make this wonderful country look like REDNECK nirvana .
Andrew Bartlett , former Democrats Senator and current Greens candidate for the next Federal election , wants more action from both State and Federal leaders .
writing for Asian Correspondent he argues :
it is the responsibility of government and community leaders to take effective steps to assure people that ( a ) the issue is being treated with maximum seriousness , and ( b ) everything reasonable is done to ensure peoples ’ safety .
when there is a plausible prospect that people are being targeted because of their race , it is essential that all is done to reduce the risks to them .
tragic murder puts spotlight back on safety of Indians in Australia
meanwhile the safety of athletes and visitors at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October is an ongoing issue that could erupt at any time .
the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a High Degree of Caution as its current travel advice for India .
Tit for tat coming up perhaps ?
the Times of India reports that an advisory warning has been the result :
Succumbing to popular outrage over continuing attacks on Indian students in Australia , the government on Tuesday issued an advisory warning students heading to Australia for studies and those already there .
the foreign ministry cautioned students that incidents of violence had started affecting the larger Indian community in Australia .
the advisory came three days after accounting graduate Nitin Garg was knifed to death , the first fatality in the attacks .
it also came on a day when Indian and Australian officials met in Canberra to search for better ways to deal with the continuing violence even as the partially burnt body of another Indian was found .
advisory asks students to be careful in Australia
South Korea : North Korean Dictator , Kim Jong Il Is Dead
Kim Jong Il , the North Korean dictator who ruled the hermit kingdom for the past three decades , has died at the age of 69 .
according to North Korean state television &apos;s official report on Monday , Kim passed away from “ mental and physical strain ” during a train ride on December 17 , 2011 .
the South Korean Twittersphere erupted with various responses .
although the death of one of the world &apos;s most notorious dictators is something people might welcome , most South Koreans have expressed concern about the instability his sudden death might bring to Korean peninsula .
the South Korean public &apos;s initial response to the news was pure shock .
son Byung-gwan ( @ sonkiza ) , a reporter from the South Korean citizen media site Ohmynews , tweeted :
North Korea reported a breaking story on Kim Jong-il &apos;s death .
the story is such a huge news even our company &apos;s ‘ news desk ’ was bewildered .
instead of feeling relieved , I feel concerned by the news on Kim Jong-il &apos;s death .
it is probably because I am an old man .
many on Twitter also worried that the ongoing allegations of election fraud by the ruling party would be eclipsed by the news . @ photo _ jjang tweeted :
on all media companies ’ homepages , Kim Jong-il &apos;s death made headlines … which means all the other issues ( displayed below that news ) will be ignored .
after the initial wave of shock , many on Twitter started blaming the South Korean government for its slow reaction .
it is believed that they had no clue about Kim &apos;s death for over 50 hours .
for now , South Korean President Lee has ordered a state of emergency .
Kim died on Dec 17 .
and President Lee Myung-bak was visiting Japan from Dec 17 to 18 .
if President Lee had not really heard the news , that means the South Korean government &apos;s intelligence is really awful .
or if he had known about the news , that would mean he is really lousy at risk-management .
South Korea &apos;s Twitter timeline was filled with speculations on the future of North Korea and its impact on the peace of Korean peninsula.Twitterer CafeVine ( @ CafeVine ) tweeted &#91; ko &#93; :
the elements which cause great instability are NOT the chance of commotion within the North Korean military , BUT the change of political situation of Korean peninsula by adjacent strong countries ’ moves and also reactions by the North Korean citizen .
what if there is a sudden increase of North Korean defectors because its military has become unstable ?
that can be dangerous .
@ trimutri100 expressed concern over North Korea &apos;s inexperienced , 27-year-old heir , Kim Jong-un :
North Korea is in real crisis .
that fledgling ( referring to Kim Jong-un ) would never be able to smoothly succeed the regime … Is there a chance they would send an emergency call for help to Kim Jung-nam &#91; the eldest son of Kim Jong-il &#93; ?
later he expressed the opinion that the fact the news was broken by North Korea &apos;s state media means that situation is fairly under control :
the fact that the North Korea announced the news means that the power transition has taken a fairly good shape .
but the remaining problem here is WHO has taken the power …

Dr of Congo : videos Helped Convict Thomas Lubanga of War Crimes
this post is based on content originally posted on WITNESS .
on March 14 , 2012 , the International Criminal Court found Thomas Lubanga , a former rebel leader in the eastern Congo , guilty of using children in armed conflict – a war crime .
this is a major milestone for international justice , for victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and for video for change .
in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo , where civil war has taken more than four million lives , children as young as six are routinely recruited by militias and taught to kill .
it is estimated that children , most between 8 and 16 years old , make up 60 % of combatants in the region .
a 5-minute video by WITNESS called “ A Duty to Protect ” was screened early on in the court proceedings , and was credited by the judge for having played a role in the outcome along with other visual evidence .
it tells the story of Mafille and January , two young girls who were recruited into the military .
the video looks at the effects of child recruitment on families and the broader community .
witness staff member , Bukeni Waruzi , originally from the eastern DRC and a long-time human rights advocate , was in The Hague to hear the verdict .
he appeared in a Q &amp; A with journalists following the verdict on March 14 explaining among other things the importance of video in the trial .
in the video below , uploaded by WITNESS to YouTube on March 13 , the day before , Bukeni speaks with Madeleine , a former child soldier of the eastern DRC who he demobilized when she was 15 and then adopted .
in 2007 , she testified at the UN to share her experiences as a child soldier .
Bukeni and Madeleine discuss their hopes for the outcome of the Lubanga trial and hopes justice will be served for child soldiers everywhere .

Myanmar : Post-Earthquake Stories from Aid Workers
a 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the northern Shan State in Myanmar on Thursday , and according to a state-run TV report , the death toll has increased to 74 people , and the number of injured has climbed past 100 people .
according to an updated report from Weekly Eleven , several aftershocks have been recorded in areas near the eastern Shan State spreading fear among the residents .
one resident in Oak Kyin village said on March 26 , around 12pm :
there was another earthquake last night and one this morning also .
I don &apos;t dare to stay in my house anymore .
the shaking is felt more because my house is ground-based .
nothing can be predicted because it is a nature event .
I will let fate decide .
residents also said that because of the earthquake , the death toll in Tarchileik , Tarle , Nar Yaung village , Mine Lin village , and Mine Koe village is estimated to be more than a hundred , with Mine Lin village having the most number of casualties .
earthquake damage in Myanmar .

in the same report by Weekly Eleven , an aid worker described the situation in Tarle :
wounded people have been sent to Tarchileik Hospital and Mine Phyat Hospital .
aid groups from Tarchileik and Kyaing Tong have based their camps in Tarle .
I can say that the situation has calmed down a little .
Reconstructions have begun .
rehabilitation camps have been opened in Tarle and Nar Yaung village .
an aid worker who went to Tarle , one of the worst-hit areas , was interviewed by The Irrawaddy :
I arrived in Tarle around 10am .
most of the 3-storey buildings on the side of the road only has 2 stories now .
many 2-storey buildings have also collapsed .
some of these buildings are more than 20 years old , so it made things worse .
not only residents of Tarle , but also the residents in Tarchileik had to sleep on tarpaulins .
when I arrived in Tarle , I saw that some people were clearing the things at their house by themselves .
some were crying in front of relative &apos;s houses .
I also saw some crying because they lost their relatives .
I couldn &apos;t ask them anything .
I should say some were lucky to be alive .
the government hasn &apos;t done anything yet .
some were sent to hospitals .
but I didn &apos;t go to the hospital so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening there .
as far as I see , I see that there are about 60 deaths in Tachileik .
there were about 20-30 deaths there ( in Tarle ) .
death toll would be above that .
I donated some materials , instant noodles and water .
I gave all of them to residential officials .
I don &apos;t know what they will do with these things .
they have opened temporary shelters .
those who have relatives go and live at their house .
now , the highway has been closed temporarily .
they said that it will be going under maintenance .
another aid worker from Tarchileik said :
the earthquake happened on March 24 , 8 : 25pm .
some hours after , officials from Tarchileik came and asked me to volunteer so I went with them .
I arrived in Tarle at midnight .
on the road to Tarle , there is one big bridge .
when we reached that place , our car cannot go forward anymore .
so we had to cross the bridge on foot and continue on to Tarle .
the road at the edge of the bridge had moved down about 5 feet .
there was a great deal of destruction .
with some houses , only the roof was visible and the whole house has went down into the ground .
what I had to do there was to send wounded people to Tarchileik hospital .
there is a hospital at Tarle , but that hospital had also collapsed .
so at first , we had to place the patients at the empty yard in front of the hospital and give them treatment .
afterwards , they were carried by stretchers to the car at the other side of the bridge .
the walk there takes about 15 minutes .
when we get to the other side of the bridge , we can &apos;t immediately send the patients to the hospital .
because we didn &apos;t have many available stretchers , we had to take that stretcher back to the hospital and carry another patient .
there wasn &apos;t enough cars so we couldn &apos;t send one patient to Tarchileik hospital with one car .
therefore , the patient who was sent first to the car had to wait for other patients to arrive .
another thing is we had to wait for many levels of officials ’ approval for clearance in order for the car to leave to the hospital .
that wastes a lot of valuable time .
in the car I had to drive , one patient died when we were about to reach Tarchileik Hospital .
there were people who had survived the earthquake , but died when they shouldn &apos;t have because they were not treated in time for their sustained injuries .
it really makes me sad .
u Win Swe , president of Myanmar Geological Society , said to Weekly Eleven :
in the past , strong earthquakes have occured in areas around Shan State .
but it has been awhile since that has happened .
earthquakes usually reoccur in areas that were previously hit before .
it was only a matter of how frequent .
in areas among the quake fault line , there is a tendency for after shocks to follow after a big earthquake has hit .
he also warned that because the Indian plate keeps pushing into Asia , Myanmar should be on alert for earthquakes in the future .
diplomatic Passports for Religious Representatives in Brazil ?
recently a lively debate has been ignited in Brazil after the country &apos;s Ministry of External Relations , known as Itamaraty , issued two diplomatic passports to the heads of the evangelical Igreja Mundial do Poder de Deus ( World Church of the Power of God ) pastor Valdemiro Santiago de Oliveira and his wife Franciléia de Castro Gomes de Oliveira .
the concession of diplomatic passports is regulated in Brazil by constitutional Decree 5.978 which determines that these official documents can be issued to presidents , vice- presidents , ministers , congressmen , heads of diplomatic missions , ministers of the supreme court and former presidents .
however , diplomatic passports have also been traditionally conceded to representatives of the Catholic Church , based on the interpretation of Article 6 , Paragraph 3 :
photo of Pastor Valdemiro Santiago from his public Facebook page
… to people who , although not listed in this article , need to attain it while fulfilling a role of interest for the country .
although , as mentioned above , Catholic Church cardinals have benefited from this concession , other religious institutions recognized by the Brazilian state are not excluded from the application for diplomatic passports and indeed other evangelical representatives , such as controversial pastor Edir Macêdo , leader of Brazil &apos;s Igreja Universal ( Universal Church ) have received diplomatic passports in the past .
thanks to the visibility drawn by the media to this particular case though , the Itamaraty has fallen under heavy criticism by the online community for its decision , sparking a discussion on the institution &apos;s power and on the violation of the very notion of secularism enshrined in Brazil &apos;s constitution .
a reader of the Folha de São Paulo newspaper , Renato Khair , posted the following comment in response to an article covering the case :
is is unacceptable that a government makes use of the Itamaraty to concede diplomatic passports to the World Church .
it is an aberration that people who do not fulfill the legal requirements get to receive diplomatic passports , such as the sons of former President Lula , the Reverends in question and many others .
what ’ s being done to the Ministry of External Relations is demoralizing institutions that were considered respectable and serious .
blogger Parsifal Pontes also criticized the issuing of diplomatic passports by emphasizing :
the way in which our ministry takes for granted the concession of diplomatic passports will soon lead foreign customs officials to burst into laughter when they see yet another one .

on Twitter , under # estadolaicoja ( secular state now ) the general consensus is that the Brazilian state has gone overboard by violating the basic rules of secularism that it is meant to uphold .
lawyer Thiago G. Viana ( @ thiago _ fiago ) , who blogs with Comendo o Fruto Proibido , tweeted :
legality , equality , morality and secularism : these are the “ only ” principles violated by the special passports for pastors .
public prosecutor Chico ( @ chiconob ) continues along the same line of thought :
there is simply no plausible argument to concede a diplomatic passport to religious representatives .
how embarrassing !
the discussion online brings to light an old and ongoing debate regarding secularism in the Brazilian state .
although the constitution affirms the independence of State and religion , in practice the concession of diplomatic passports to religious leaders appears to violate this principal , after all , how can a religious leader carry a diplomatic passport without infringing the basic principal of secularism ?
a representative who carries an official privileged diplomatic pass should not , at any time , harbor a religious flag , let alone preach his / hers religious beliefs on foreign soil .
Cameroon : from “ kind ” thieves to mobile credit as legal tender
the nearly 20 million inhabitants of Cameroon are facing rising levels of criminality .
bandits even stormed the national headquarters of the police and the Ministry of External Relations ( Foreign Affairs ) in the capital city , Yaounde .
PNT Attitude shared her experience with crime in a recent post describing how her hand bag was stolen from her car :
… I pulled over to buy some mangoes .
mangoes bought , I open the door of the vehicle to put the mangoes on the back seat .
just then I saw this guy loitering on the other side of the car .
I paid him no attention .
suddenly he opened the passenger door , grabbed my red handbag lying on the front seat , and dashed into the market .
I initially thought he wanted to do a carjacking , or was he just trying to make me uncomfortable by getting into the car ?
could he be mentally deranged ?
I screamed “ voleur ” and ran after him with the mangoes , which I threw at him before he made the corner , thereby getting out of sight .
yes , you might be thinking I was careless leaving the bag there , fyi , it was hidden beneath that same seat until when I thought I had finished shopping ! ”
but the beautiful twist in her story is that some of the thieves in Yaounde could be really “ kind ” .
even the police know that if one is lucky they can have their personal belongings back by visiting the place where they were robbed ( mugged ) .
so she drove there :
I was told that a guy with a red bag came a few minutes after I left asking “ where is the lady whose bag was snatched ” .
since they didn ’ t find me , they took it away .
my friend and I searched around the escape route for a little bit and another person advised that we check with the nearby radio station .
we went there and the receptionist said : “ … yes we received a bag this morning and the contents belonged to … Ntemgwa … ! ” that was it , I was SOOO RELIEVED that I found the bag , she brought it out , I checked the contents and I said everything was in tact , unless of course the money and fuel voucher .
I tried to argue and realised whatever was still in that bag had more value than the amount requested .
I however negotiated for 5.000frs and I got the bag , went back home , happily . ”
after such an experience here are some of the lessons learned by PNT :
- Not all thieves have evil intentions , some are opportunists who are just hungry ;
- There exist organised ( petty ) crime in the Mokolo market , beware in all you do whenever you find yourself there , organised because all they want is your money , and everyone around knows where you can find your bag after the incident , who knows if there is more to the whole setup than meets the eyes ?
- It is normal to be attacked in such crowded markets , the policemen played down the whole drama , wondering y I was feeling bad ( at all ) , yes there is no service to take care of trauma victims in the police station since it is “ normal ” to be victimised like that …
- I miss those mangoes and I have nothing against them ; ”
speaking of buying fruits in Yaounde , a U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer blogging at Adventures of Aubrey seems to have been haggling a bit over the price of apples .
the conversations with those selling the apples certainly reveal a lot about the perceptions associated with race which engender misconceptions :
during my trip to Yaounde this week I went to buy apples , twice .
the first time I was walking down the street and saw a man with an apple cart .
I asked him the price and then told him that was the white person &apos;s price and apples should cost this and that I wanted to buy these two apples for this much .
he laughed and went down in price but not enough .
… I saw another man with an apple cart outside of a white person store in downtown Yaounde ( that was mistake one , trying outside a white person store ) .
I asked him how much the apples were , went into the store with my friend and her mom , and we came back and I decided I wanted apples and began to bargin .
he got angry and started screaming at me that why would I assume the price could change – he told me the price and I should have accepted it and blah blah blah .
so I laughed it off telling him , this is Cameroon you discute for all the prices and tried again to bargin with him .
he got angry again .
then , I got mad .
I told him he was very rude and that I didn &apos;t care what his apples cost now I wasn &apos;t buying any from him .
he yelled back that I was rude to try to bargin with him when I was rich ( aka white ) .
I repeated that he was rude and wouldn &apos;t get my money today or in the future and left .
a year ago that interaction might have upset me but now I simply ran to catch up with my friend and her mom and repeated it while laughing and saying that I guessed it wasn &apos;t my day for apples . ”
instead of nearly running into trouble haggling , maybe Aubrey ( or anyone else planning a stay in Cameroon ) should use pay-as-you-go mobile airtime credits as legal tender .
it seems a much easier way of buying things without cash if one goes by PNTs Attitude :
I almost finished buying the items on my list when I decided to go into a lingerie shop to look for an item that has been on my shopping list forever : a seamless wireless bra .
I was very lucky to find it in this shop , and as fate would have it , it was the last one available and I hadn ’ t seen it in any other shop .
the salesperson said it cost CFA 4,500 .
Behold I had just CFA 3,500 on me !
I tried to haggle the price to the amount I had on me , in vain .
I thought of taking a much dreaded along walk to the car and also the possibility of paying partially by a telephone credit transfer .
the latter option seemed more likely .
so I asked her if she had an MTN phone so I could complete the payment through a phone credit transfer .
she said no , she had an Orange phone .
however she added , “ I have a friend on the MTN network you can send the remaining CFA1000 to ” .
problem solved , I went away with the much-sought-for bra , smiling as I walked away . ”
Colombia : first Reactions to the Death of FARC Leader ‘ Mono Jojoy ’
early on Thursday September 23 , Colombians woke up with the news : the day before , 30 airplanes and 27 helicopters of the Colombian Air Force raided a camp where Víctor Julio Suárez , better known as Jorge Briceño or Mono Jojoy , one of the top leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , was hiding with dozens of guerrillas near La Macarena , Meta .
Suárez , 57 , was killed in the so-called “ Operation Sodom ” , as president Juan Manuel Santos confirmed from New York , where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly .
five members of the State security forces were injured and a female police dog was killed .
other top guerrilla members might have been caught in the 300 square-meter camp — which reportedly included an underground bunker — and the Colombian Armed Forces ( mostly members of the Colombian Army and the Colombian National Police which landed after the combats ended ) are identifying them as this post is being written .
on Thursday afternoon unofficial sources claimed that FARC leader Henry Castellanos , Romaña , had also been killed in the operation
Mono Jojoy , who was tipped off by an informant , was considered the leader of the hard-line military wing of the FARC and was the commander of its Eastern Bloc .
regarded as “ one of the most blood-thirsty ” guerrillas , he had 62 arrest warrants against him , had been sentenced 5 times , and the United States had asked for his extradition for drug-trafficking related charges , offering a reward for his capture .
a controversy arose when El Tiempo , the daily newspaper with the highest circulation in the country ( and partially owned by President Juan Manuel Santos ’ family ) , posted a series of tweets regarding the news :
@ eltiempocom
Corferias parking lot guards : ‘ We have to ask for the afternoon off to celebrate Jojoy &apos;s death ’
@ eltiempocom
how are you celebrating Jojoy &apos;s death at your workplaces or wherever you are ?
@ eltiempocom
for those offended with the celebration question , our apologies .
better way to ask : what is your reaction to Jojoy &apos;s death ?
Twitter users immediately reacted to these tweets .
Miguel Olaya ( @ juglardelzipa ) said :
so far we have not gotten the day off at the University of Los Andes .
@ eltiempocom should denounce them for not being patriots .
user @ PAPerezA criticized the newspaper :
Agnes Dantés ( @ Agnes _ Dantes ) joked :
ooooh those fellas from @ eltiempocom are so funny .
but well … good for them for not deceiving us with fake impartiality and professionalism
with irony , Clo Calao ( @ cloquis ) wrote :
there are some displaced people in front of my house begging for money , I &apos;m gonna ask them how they celebrate # Jojoy &apos;s death # eltiempostyle
Adriana ( @ Adridice ) commented on the apology tweeted by El Tiempo :
the @ eltiempocom apologies are so lame , “ those offended ” , pure sensationalism , they &apos;re worse than El Espacio &#91; a sensationalist national daily &#93;
others joked about the name of the operation , which according to Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera was chosen because “ the core of the evil was there .
and we needed help from heaven . ” Orlando ( @ DanielitoBang ) said :
&#91; Inspector General &#93; Alejandro Ordóñez will investigate Rodrigo Rivera and the military leadership for using the deviant name of ‘ Sodom ’ for this operation .
Ramírez Jaramillo ( @ egolaxista ) :
the movie about Operation Sodom will be rated R , because its name is suggestive
jokingly , Miguel Olaya ( @ juglardelzipa ) wrote :
at the Defense Ministry focus groups are organized to decide the names of the operations
Alvaro Sáenz ( @ AlvarettoS ) :
other Twitter reactions reflect current issues in Colombian politics .
Manuel Carreño ( @ Popcultura ) directed his message to those who oppose the current and former government :
Anti-uribista friend : feeling joy for this news doesn &apos;t make you a right-winger : it just shows that you &apos;re happy for the death of bastards like that .
but Juan C. Rodríguez ( @ JCRodriguezMD ) does not see the outcome of this operation as a sign that the government is successful :
the success of an administration is not measured by the number of enemy casualties , but by the welfare of its population .
on that &#91; issue &#93; , we &apos;ll go on doing badly .
user @ Vulturno said :
there &apos;s no doubt it &apos;s the biggest accomplishment by the Military Forces , it doesn &apos;t matter if they had to kill him from afar and with barbarity
Daniel Arango ( @ stultaviro ) described what the success of this operation means to some Colombians :
what a good slap in the face for those who were announcing and celebrating the failure of the Democratic Security
in his tweet , Alejandro Gaviria ( @ agaviriau ) refers to the idea of justice :
it &apos;s not &#91; his &#93; death which makes most people happy : it is the idea or the feeling of justice
but Orlando ( @ DanielitoBang ) thinks that justice was not completely served :
I &apos;m angry that stupid fellas like him die .
you feel some kind of justice , but the bastard actually died unpunished
“ El Chiflamicas ” ( @ elchiflamicas ) wrote :
if they hadn &apos;t killed Mono Jojoy he would have escaped through some airport .
Alieth Acosta ( @ _ InTheMood ) criticized the pressure to show patriotism :
if I don &apos;t attach a Colombian flag to my &#91; blackberry &#93; nick them I &apos;m a terrorist ?
such nonsensical crap .
“ La Morenita ” ( @ lapetitebrune ) said :
the day we celebrate life , instead death , that day there will be hope for us .

China : Wang Hui &apos;s plagiarism scandal , international turn
a plagiarism scandal broke out in March in Chinese academic circles when Nanjing University literature professor Wang Binbin charged that Wang Hui &apos;s dissertation on Lu Xun -Resistance to despair – contains a number of passages lifted from other books without citation .
( more background information from Granite Studio and ChinaGeeks )
Wang Hui is honored as the spokesperson of the Chinese “ New Left ” intellectual circle and in spite of the scandal , in May he was nominated by Tsinghua University and successfully received a scholarship award from the highest government authority , the State Council .
while Wang Hui kept silent and expected the matter to be “ clarified within the academic community ” , many scholars and public intellectuals have commented on the issue via local media outlets .
some defended Wang Hui ; some pointed out that the dilemma is one of non-standard citation rather than of intentional plagiarism ; some have suggested a thorough investigation be led by an independent academic committee .
the whole debate has mainly taken place within the local academic circle and online public sphere until very recently ( July 7 ) when a local media outlet ( ifeng.com ) disclosed a joint letter signed by “ an international community of scholars , translators , editors , historians and cultural critics ” in support of Wang Hui .
backup from international academic community
the open letter , signed by many prominent western scholars such as Tani Barlow , Arif Dirlik , Gayatri C. Spivak and Frederic Jameson , frames the plagiarism charge as an “ attack from the popular media in China ” and defends Wang Hui &apos;s academic integrity :
the charges have been contested and discredited in the careful analyses given by Zhong Biao , Shu Wei , Wei Xing and others .
among the signatories to this letter are also translators and they are without doubt closest to the work of Wang Hui .
each translator has checked and double checked all the footnotes in the vast bibliographies of Professor Wang &apos;s publications over the last thirty years .
none has found any indication of plagiarism no matter how loosely this word is defined .
second , among us are many Asia specialists in Chinese studies and we attest to Professor Wang &apos;s scholarly integrity and his importance in international Asian studies .
Interestingly , the two accounts of Zhong Biao and Wei Xing , quoted in the letter , were set up for the purpose of this debate but quoted as if the two individuals were well-known public intellectuals .
in addition , their “ careful analyses ” have yet to clear Wang Hui of his technical mistakes .
in Zhong Biao &apos;s article , he explains the background of Wang Hui &apos;s book and criticizes Wang Binbin &apos;s unreasonable charge :
the publication of “ Resistance to Despair ” was between 1988-1991 .
all of us know that it is a sensitive period .
the academic standard was very different then .
in the new edition , Wang Hui explains in a footnote of his bibliography that “ in the first edition , the publisher demanded all references be deleted .
this is a newly edited reference list . ”
missing footnotes is the writer &apos;s mistake and he can improve that in the future edition .
however , reading from the text and footnotes , the writer does not try to hide the fact that the passages are closely connected with the few books he quoted in the previous pages .
Moreover , what has been quoted is mainly the historical and theoretical background rather than the writer &apos;s main argument .
Unthoughtful mistakes and plagiarism are issues of different nature .
media Attack ?
Wei Xing is the first to frame the issue as a media attack and his viewpoint has obviously been taken up by the international community of scholars ’ joint letter :
it is clear that in Wang Binbin &apos;s article , there are “ very few ” “ copied ” passages and it is “ difficult to define their nature ” .
however , the Southern Weekend decided to publish the article against its usual practice on March 25 .
such kind of coverage is an illegal “ absent trial ” without substantial evidence but built upon the assumption of a “ presumed guilty ” .
quoting from a number of debates across web-platforms such as Douban &apos;s Duping （ 讀品 ） and zhongguosixiang.com , Wei Xing believes that media and internet violence have destroyed academic integrity :
the conspiracy between the printed media and online media have promoted an unrestrained violence , destroying the integrity of academia .
should the Chinese Academia be submerged in such kind of violence ?
how can we defend our independence and freedom ?
this is a serious issue .
a transparent and accountable investigation
many scholars and intellectuals will laugh at the above quote as the Chinese Academia has hardly enjoyed any freedom and independence since 1949 and political liberals believe that the only way to strike for academic freedom is to develop accountability to the public .
in this sense , the joint letter signed by more than 60 local university professors and public intellectuals calling for immediate investigation by the Tsinghua University and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on Wang Hui &apos;s plagiarism charge is probably a most effective attempt to defend the academic independence and freedom :
the debate has been carrying on for three months , many scholars have urged the Chinese Academy of Social Science and Tsinghua University to organize an investigative committee .
up till now there isnt ’ any response from the two institution .
Wang Hui has remained silent regarding the charge but he once mentioned that he hope the issue would be solved within the academic community .
in order to clarify the confusion and end the controversy , we support the suggestion raised by Xiong Bingji and Lin Yusheng in this joint letter and look forward for the two institutions ’ positive reply in fulfilling the duty .
we also agree with Yi Chongtin that the committee should be composed of overseas scholars and publicize the investigation result and keep the process , including the opinions and attitudes of individual committee member , transparent to the public .
local political liberals VS. international new left
the two letters is now viewed as a confrontation between two clans of intellectuals : the local political liberal VS. the international new left .
the former calls for a transparent investigation and public accountability , the latter frames the debate as attack from popular media and open criticisms as violence against academic freedom .
Wu Lian , a literary critics is outraged by the international joint letter :
you said that “ the media attack a scholar without any reason ” , if so , it is defamation !
you should have sued the media outlet in a Chinese court , not by writing this letter to press an university authority .
you are wrong , the principal is no judge here !
you said that you have to “ support professor Wang ” .
you are wrong again !
is this a political suppression ?
how come we have never heard any support from you when political dissidents are repression in serious political incidents ?
do you think academic fame is more important than other value and deserve your urgent support more ?
you have cut and pasted the reality in the bright day light .
every Chinese person who concerns about this incident knows that the article written by Wang Binbin that charges Professor Wang &apos;s Resistance to Despair is first published in “ Literature and Arts Studies ” and then republished in Southern Weekend .
you ignore such fact and like what you have always said , “ history is constructed ” , now you have directly engaged in the “ construction ” of reality !
under such “ construction ” , the local academic publication , Literature and Arts Studies has vaporized , vanished , disappeared !
this is an insult to an important Chinese academic publication !
what is the intention of this rhetorical open letter to the Tsinghua authority ?
to prove that Professor Wang Hui is innocent ?
but there hasn &apos;t been an investigation yet !
to prove that Professor Wang Hui is honored in your constructed “ world ” ?
but Wang Binbin &apos;s article has never addressed this issue !
to prove that “ media ” is “ crazy ” and that the university need not respond to that ?
however , so many scholars have discussed about the issue and it is the duty of the media to report on that .
the public has the right to know !
or do you think that whenever scholars talk or publish through the media outlets , their discussion would turn into media talk ?
immediate responses
it seems that the international turn of the scandal is doomed to add oil to the boiling water in China .Below are some immediate responses from Twitter :
mozhixu
isn &apos;t Wang Hui against globalization and global capitalism ?
how come he embraces the global cultural hegemony when it comes to personal interest , this is disgusting !
WuyouLan
Wang Hui is a leftist in China and in the West .
in mainland China , the left embraces the CCP ; in the West , the left challenges the establishment .
lingcangzhou
the opinion of the 80 scholar joint letter supporting plagiarism is purely bullshit .
firstly it did not refer to the problematic passages raised by Wang Binbin and others ; Secondly , who will trust those who try to prove the integrity of a plagiarist ?
thirdly , by attacking the media , the letter shift the focus of the issue from “ Wang Hui &apos;s plagarism problem ” to “ university &apos;s legitimacy ” .
the open letter is shameless !
missing Colonial Map , Charged Border Dispute
debate has flared up about maps allegedly taken by the British after Sudan became independent in 1956 .
while some believe the historic documents could ease ongoing border disputes , researchers doubt they exist at all . Joseph Edward discusses the issue of missing colonial-era maps of the South Sudan border .
Sudan : netizens Verify Internet Blackout Rumours
netizens are watching Sudan closely , following rumours that the Sudanese authorities intend to cut off the Internet – a chilling reminder of Egypt &apos;s attempt to silence activists and contain the January 25 revolution when it pulled the plug off the www on January 27 .
on Twitter , Jordanian Ali Alhasani reports :
@ _ AHA : breaking : reports that Internet has been CUT in # Sudan .
if true then god be with them because we won &apos;t know anything !
four hours ago , Egyptian journalist Salma Elwardany , who is reporting from Khartoum , tweeted :
@ S _ Elwardany : news that sudan govt might cut off internet # Sudanrevolts
in preparation for the anticipated blackout , a Speak to Tweet service has been set up .
Rodrigo Davies tweets about it :
netizens quickly compare notes on who is available online , in Sudan .
Sara Elhassan writes :
and Israeli Elizabeth Tsurkov adds :
@ Elizrael : @ JustAmira @ SudaneseThinker seeing way too many people tweeting from Sudan for it to be true … See @ elizrael / sudanpeeps
protests broke out at Khartoum University on June 17 , when hundreds of students denounced the government ’ s planned austerity measures .
the protests were met with police brutality and arrests , fueling more anger and protests the following days .
CNN &apos;s Ben Wedeman comments :
@ bencnn : if # Egypt weren &apos;t such a 24 / 7 news tsunami # Sudan might be getting more attention .
Sudan has a rich history of rebellion and revolution .
Arab Revolution adds :
@ ArabRevolution : watching # SudanRevolts videos reminds me of how # Yemen started .
tens in the street , but very passionate .
all out revolution within weeks .
and the lack of news in mainstream media of what is happening in Sudan is annoying activists .
Egyptian blogger Wael Abbas asks :
‬ @ waelabbas : why isn &apos;t Al Jazeera covering the incidents in Sudan at all ?
Al Jazeera , which provided blanket live coverage of the Egyptian revolution from its epi-centre in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo , has been credited with ‘ exporting ’ the revolution spark to the living rooms of homes across the Arab world .
China : illegitimate Girl Deprived of the Right to Education
an illegitimate girl of primary-school age in Zhuhai , South China , was turned away by the local schools , because her mother is not able to afford the hefty fine for illegitimacy , according to sohu blogger Han Tao ’ s report .
&quot; I am a local child .
I want to receive compulsory education , too !
Xiao Qing carrying a placard stands at the gate of Gongbei Xiawan Primary School and she is so anxious to go to school like other little boys and girls .
7 years ago , her parents gave birth to her without registering for marriage .
then her father walked out on the family .
since Xiao Qing was born out of wedlock , the mother has to pay a 9000 yuan ( about 1321 US dollars ) fine to the family planning department so as to apply hukou ( a kind of residency permit in China ) in Zhuhai for her daughter .
however , the single mother cannot afford it , even though Xiao Qing has reached school age .
desperately , the mother could only take her daughter to the relevant departments to ask for help .
during two months , they visited the family planning department , the education department , the sub-district office and the local government , but none progress was made .
as the new term was coming up and the children of the same age nearby all went to school with new bags , Xiao Qing and her mother were deeply depressed .
failing to intercede with the authorities , the mother came up with her last idea that she wrote down on a piece of paper “ I am a local child .
I want to receive compulsory education , too ” , and let Xiao Qing stand at the school gate with the slogan , hoping such extreme measure would attract the attention of the news media and relevant departments .
&quot; the mistake I made has nothing to do with my child .
she is a human being .
why can ’ t she apply hukou ?
why can ’ t she receive education ? ” Xiao Qing &apos;s mother said to me .
hope the net friends who have read this post may reprint the article and pictures and put them on more websites .
I appreciate your concern for Xiao Qing .
our journalists are trying their best to mediate the problems .
I will immediately update the post as soon as there is any new information .
if you need to contact with Xiao Qing , please call me .
several comments quoted from Han Tao ’ s blog :
family planning is a basic state policy of China and illegitimate birth violates it .
if we change it only for one specific case , the policy will never be implemented .
and consequently , people will face more pressure of life amid population explosion .
we must look at this problem from an overall point of view , but not a particular one !
illegitimate children are also human beings , having the basic human rights , especially the right to education .
if without the rights , does that mean the girl was born to be surplus ?
can we deprive of her basic human rights at will , even including the right to subsistence ?
obviously not .
but why was her education right taken away ?
what a social system !
what a human-centered development !
what a country under the rule of law !
indignation !
if you guarantee the girl ’ s rights today , who will guarantee other children ’ s rights tomorrow , including your child ?
when the population of China soars , there will be more innocent people lose their social rights !
! although the child didn ’ t make any mistake , can the mother cover up her fault for the past years ?
why didn ’ t the mother scare up money to pay the fine ?
why did she let her innocent kid bear all the things ?
she just took advantage of the public controversy to solve her own problems .
and have she ever thought if her arrangements will bring her child psychological problems ?
it won ’ t be difficult to raise so much money as long as she desperately works , right ?
is she qualified for a mother to use her child in this way ?
no one is willing to have a baby without marriage , especially to a mother .
there must have been an unutterably predicament that forced her to do so .
a single mother has to bear so many hardships and difficulties to raise her child , so what she needs is help .
Moreover , Illegitimacy is not against the one-child policy .
it ’ s so ruthless to make their life more miserable .
giving birth is every normal woman ’ s birthright .
it ’ s originally wrong for the current system to repress it .
however , the girl has come into this world , under the social system of China , so she is certainly a mistake in law .
but I want to ask those who gave irresponsible words if human love is wrong .
in this mammonism society , the nobility and gentry are allowed to have children as many as they want , because they are rich .
so does that mean the law is something to restrict the poor and clean the road for the rich ?
what a woe !
if the law varies from person to person , it means there is no law !
the children are innocent .
the people are the center and roots of the country and the will of the people give the right direction .
any system should have the human rights first .
the hukou system is wrong since the very beginning .
once the baby was born , he or she has the right to existence , which is one of the basic human rights .
will the person vanish because he is not issued with hukou ?
it will only make the people unfairly treated be hostile to the society .
consequently , the society may end up paying a heavier price .
can we expect a harmonious society in this way ?
why can ’ t our government treat her people better and more tolerably ?
confusion over Agreement with OIC to Establish Office in Myanmar
this post is part of our special coverage Myanmar &apos;s Rohingya .
the June 2012 riots in western Myanmar involving Rohingyas and Rakhine prompted several international Islamic organizations and countries to extend their offer of assistance to resolve the conflict and deliver aid to victims .
the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) , for instance , has proposed the establishment of a permanent office in Myanmar .
this initiative sparked phenomenal opposition across the country , especially in Yangon , Mandalay , Pakkoku , Sittwe and Phyar Pone .
online comments are also almost unanimous in opposing an OIC presence in the country .
many people in Myanmar believe that an OIC office is not necessary to help the Muslim minority in Myanmar .
Dr. Aye Maung , a member of parliament and the president of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party has argued &#91; my &#93; that aid and donation can be delivered without setting up an OIC office in the country :
OIC is mainly for religion purposes , an organisation with 57 countries which are cooperating with Islamic countries .
it &apos;s unlike ASEAN which is a regional and multi-religious association nor European Union . &#91; ...
&#93; and therefore we can and should receive the donations through the government without opening an OIC office .
Myo Set advised the OIC to communicate directly with other UN bodies and NGOs if they found the government machinery unreliable :
Burma has full cooperation with NGOs and UN which is why no more political coalition is needed if OIC &apos;s pure intention is to provide only food , shelter , health care service and security for Muslims .
whatever they wish to supply can go through the UN if Burmese authorities are not reliable .
ko Htike wrote with the view that the riot was not a religious clash , thereby asserting that the OIC should not shape the situation to be one .
the Rohingya issue is neither a religious clash nor ethnic clash .
it &apos;s just a problem between illegal immigrants and locals .
it is such an ordinary problem which usually occur in many countries across the world .
nothing more .
I think OIC should not shape the situation to be a religious issue .
I respect the kindness to provide humanitarian aid .
if the intent is for humanitarian reason , other states and regions in Myanmar should be given assistance as well just like what other countries ( e.g.
Japan , US ) are doing .
ko Htike echoed the popular domestic opinion in Myanmar , opposing the Rohingya &apos;s struggle for recognition as an ethnic minority in the country .
opinion on the Rohingyas is divided ; the global community consider them as among the most persecuted minorities in Asia .
for several weeks , there has been talk of a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the OIC and Myanmar &apos;s Ministry of Border Affairs , though there is little information about whether the agreement actually exists , and if so , what it comprises .
when people started posting comments opposing the agreement , Hmuu Zaw from the president &apos;s office clarified &#91; my &#93; that the OIC office would only be a temporary liaison office rather than an official representative office .
this explanation didn &apos;t convince many .
Tyfone Athene questioned the possible duration of the temporary office :
temporary liaison office ?
how long will it take ?
60 or unlimited years ?
Poe Pwint Phyu thinks that if the government regarded the original incident a non-sectarian clash , then the agreement with the OIC should not have been signed :
photo – CJ Myanmar Facebook Page
my last question to Mr. President &apos;s advisers : do you see this recent conflict as merely a religious riot ( thus you allowed a temporary office for OIC ) or urgent issue of neglect and violence which victimized Rakhine natives ?
the answer will explain the present government &apos;s direction and its commitment to Rakhine and the survival of democratic Union — where every girl can freely get education and equal rights from the institution .
others criticized the lack of transparency on procedures of government ministries .
Ah Moe made this request &#91; my &#93; :
be it a temporary liaison office or permanent branch office , what we are asking for now is to show a copy of that MOU to public , that &apos;s what we want mainly .
the government attempted to dissuade people from joining the protests against the setting up of an OIC office ; despite this , they were held October 15 in several cities across the country .
Bowing to public pressure , the president &apos;s office announced on the same day that the government would not permit the setting up of an OIC liaison office in Myanmar .
however , it didn &apos;t mention the content of the controversial MOU .
it was not clear if the government had informed the OIC of this decision .
the government has assured &#91; my &#93; the public that it would continue to accept humanitarian aid by coordinating closely with OIC and other international groups .
meanwhile , the OIC said they have yet to receive a formal notification from Myanmar government regarding a decision to disallow a liaison office .
in related news , the Myanmar Red Cross Society issued a press release denying rumors that it is sponsoring a hidden OIC office inside its building .

China and Iran : # CN4Iran
yesterday , thousands of Iranians took to the street to protest against dictatorship .
the protest reminded Chinese people of the Tiananmen democracy movement back in 1989 and Chinese twitterers are using hashtag # cn4iran to show solidarity with Iranian fellows .
Mali : silence of the Local Blogosphere
as the people of Mali were preparing for elections , they were caught unawares by a military coup on March 21 , 2012 , and the threat of partition of north Mali .
at the time of the coup the principal candidates were readying their Twitter and Google + accounts along with their Facebook pages , while citizens were updating their blogs and honing their tweets .
while news from the north , cut off and deprived of electricity , comes through sparingly , in the South , the internet allows mobilisation .
Parabolic Dish in Mali via @ Mbokoniko on twitter
the ‘ Collectif des Ressortissants du Nord ’ ( The Northern Citizens ’ Collective ) or COREN has 303 members of its Facebook group at the time of writing .
for the last few weeks , COREN have mobilised the people of Mali throughout the entire territory , with the page notably being used to announce upcoming events as well as to demonstrate solidarity as shown in the following status update from group member Oumar Maigar :
use the Mali flag as your profile picture to support unity
while the internet is inundated with blogs , tweets and videos from other countries , Malian internet users remain silent .
the capital , Bamako , is still affected by serious power cuts as the fuel required for power stations runs out .
under these circumstances , the priority is not sending messages , but finding information about the new leaders of the north .
the website of the Tuareg run National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad , known as the MNLA , has been offline for a week .
nevertheless the movement continues to post videos on its youtube account , Azawad17janv2012 .
the MNLA chose to make its declaration of independence on French TV channel France 24 .
the declaration shocked Malians who spread anger and mocking remarks on the internet , like the following on Twitter :
MNLA propaganda , the media should in that case invite all the separatists of the world to their TV channels .
there would be a traffic jam .
but what stole the show were images from the Islamist movement Ansar Dine which has taken the city of Timbuktu .
the images taken by AFP-Télé have so far reached 7,200 views and have been widely discussed in the streets of Bamako .
while chaos reigns over the situation in North Mali , some people have nevertheless managed to find a way to profit from it , as shown by this tweet from user @ flagsonline :

Assad Airforce Kills Syrians Waiting in Breadline
this post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011 / 12 .
the Syrian government conducted a deadly airstrike against Syrians – standing in line waiting for bread in a bakery in Halfaya , in Hama .
estimates put the number of those killed between 90 to 300 people in the attack on the town , which rebels say they have recently liberated from Assad forces .
online , activists are livid that the world continues to watch as innocents are being massacred .
graphic photographs of mutilated bodies , as well as videos of the aftermath of the attack , are being circulated online , showing the devastation .
&#91; journalist Erin Cunningham tweets links to the videos here .
Leila Nachawati Rego writes :
@ leila _ na : the Syrian regime ´ s new strategy is to bomb bakeries .
200 people killed today in Hama .
a civilian massacre .
# Syria
Syrian Rafif Jouejati tweets her exasperation :
@ RafifJ : waiting for world leaders to find something to top “ We condemn in the strongest possible terms .. ” # Halfaya _ Massacre # Syria
and adds :
@ RafifJ : let history books show that # Assad committed genocide while world watched , paralyzed , and did little more than use strong language .
# Syria
and an angry Razan Ghazzawi blogs :
look into Halfaya martyrs ’ eyes and dare to tell me you ’ re worried about “ Islamists ” in Syria .
dare to tell me , you piece of shit , that you ’ re worried about “ FSA human rights violations , ” worried about “ civil war , ” about Qatar and KSA , and that ’ s why you won ’ t support people ’ s revolution .
so you ’ re worried .
I see .
that explains a lot .
of course .
Newsflash : the minute you have forsaken the people of Syria , the Syrian people have also forsaken you and what you worry about habibi : you and your civilization doesn ’ t exist in our time and space .
it ’ s over , you and I aren ’ t fellow human being anymore .
also , peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in Syria today as part of his mission to “ broker a solution ” in the country .
Hassan Hassan notes :
@ hhassan140 : Halfaya massacre , celebrating Brahimi &apos;s arrival to Damascus , shames all those who still hope Assad understands anything other than force .
and he adds :
@ hhassan140 : history : on this day , Lakhdar Brahimi visits Damascus to talk to Assad who spoke loudly in Halfaya by killing 300 ppl lining up for bread .

Malawi : online Reaction to Mutharika &apos;s Death
media reports within Malawi and all over the world state that Malawi ’ s President Bingu wa Mutharika is dead .
while there is no official government communication at the time of publishing this , the delay in the announcement has created more belief for the worst &#91; * See updates below &#93; .
state Radio Malawi Broadcasting Corporation announced on Thursday evening that Mutharika ( reported to have been 78 ) was taken to South Africa following a cardiac arrest on Thursday morning .
Mutharika has been under heavy local and international pressure to improve political and socio-economic situation for Malawi .
while business went on as usual in Malawi &apos;s towns , bloggers and other netizens in social media sites have received the news with mixed feelings .
on Malawi Fuel Watch Facebook group , one netizen wrote :
lol the president is gone and now petrol is being found !
Malawians have been queuing up for hours for fuel since 2010 .
while another wrote :
Peter Mutharika &#91; President &apos;s brother &#93; , let Joyce &#91; Vice President &#93; take over if status quo remains , we need fuel now …
Bingu wa Mutharika at the Metropolitan Museum in New York .
official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson released in the Public Domain .
Malawian journalist and blogger Rebekka Chimjeka reported that Bingu ’ s remains were to return to Malawi soon .
she said that Malawi expects Vice President Joyce Banda to address members of the press .
she has been updating her blog with news related to Mutharika &apos;s death .
another journalist Kondwani Munthali refuted reports that Mutharika was admitted at Milpark Hospital in South Africa :
Malawi is at crossroads .
President Bingu wa Mutharika was never admitted at Milpark Hospital as suggested by Government as it has been found .
all indications , medical , DPP , family and others sources indicate the President sadly passed away yesterday and he is at a funeral home in South Africa .
medical records from Milpark Hospital indicate 16 people were at the Intensive Care Unit this morning at the Hospital and none of the President .
he prayed for Malawi hoping that the constitution will prevail :
there are reports of some people in the ruling party trying to force Parliament to convene and change the constitution not to allow the Vice President to assume office .
it is the prayer of this blog , that constitutional order will prevail and that the Legacy , Honour and Dignity of the President will be honoured by allowing peace and constitutional order to prevail .
the prophecy by Nigerian TB Joshua in February about death of an African president created fears for Malawi and many believers seemed to have intensified that God intervenes in the situation .
* Update 1 : Malawi &apos;s Vice-President Joyce Banda has confirmed that President Bingu wa Mutharika has died and declared 10 days of mourning .
under the constitution , Vice-President Joyce Banda takes over .
however , government spokesperson says that she cannot succeed Mutharika because she is not a member of the ruling party .
she was expelled from the ruling party in 2010 after a dispute with Mutharika &apos;s attempt to position his brother as his successor .
Malawi Voices reported that army chiefs have agreed to follow the constitution by supporting Joyce Banda :
the Malawi Defence Played a crucial role , General Odillo chaired a meeting with military chiefs and unanimously agreed follow the constitution .
the General Informed Joyce banda , Peter Mutharika and Goodall Gondwe that the army will uphold the constitution anything other than that will not be entertained .
team of soldiers was on stand-by at Kamuzu Barracks and a few others went to guard the Veep &apos;s residence .
this plus US govt direct pressure on Peter Mutharika deflated “ Peter and Goodall &apos;s plans ”
a group of Cabinet ministers appeared at a news conference on Friday night to declare that Vice-President Joyce Banda cannot succeed President Bingu wa Mutharika .

Ghana : do You Have a Spare Room For Ex-President Rawlings ?
image via Wikipedia
I was a bit sad when I saw the bold headline at Modern Ghana website yesterday ; “ Rawlings Homeless ” .
Jerry Rawlings is the former president of Ghana .
I became totally shocked after reading just part of the story . in February , 2010 an intense fire described as “ rapid and fast ” razed to ashes the residence of former President Jerry Rawlings with nothing to salvage from the debris .
the fire was said to have started at about 0420GMT during a heavy rain characterized by intermittent power cuts .
while no life was lost , the disaster left behind “ the depressing spectacle ” of the ruins of a house which firemen had tried in vain to salvage in three hours .
the fire burnt nearly every valuable item and by the time the fire service personnel were done putting out the inferno ; everything was down to ashes except the concrete walls and pillars .
according to the Modern Ghana website Ghana &apos;s former president and his wife are homeless and urgently looking for an accomodation to rent in Accra .
it is also reported that the former president had to travel from a “ small village house ” at Tefle in the Volta Region to Ghana ’ s capital ; Accra for meetings when the needs arise whiles his wife is currently putting up with her mother at the Nyaniba Estate residency ; a situation which is affecting their marriage .
according to the former first lady , Nana Konadu ; when their Ridge residence got burnt on February 14 , 2010 ; government promised to find an alternative residential facility for them but 5 months later , that promise from government is far from being fulfilled .
she also complained that the Ridge residence might have been saved from the fire if the house had a constant flow of water because when the fire fighters arrived , they had little water in their tanks and thought they could get some more water from the house .
let &apos;s look at the opinions of Ghanaian bloggers and their readers on this issue .
Obed Nanayaw Sarpong does not understand why the former first family wants a new house from government :
earlier last week , the former first lady , Nana Konadu Agyemang Rawlings granted an interview to Joy fm in Accra in which she spoke widely about how her family life has been affected after they lost the ridge residence .
I couldn &apos;t help laughing .
I hated that my almost 5-month old prophecy that the former first family would demand a new residence from government , and the people of this country , was coming to pass .
the rest , we all live to see .
as a country , we should wipe off the letters in the constitution that give those 3 or more houses plus cars etc to people who have served this country .
my opinion is that if they love this country well enough like I do , they would allow those monies to be used in ensuring the people of this country get good and safe drinking water , a place to ‘ ease ’ themselves ( if they get to eat at all ) , schools etc .
things they couldn &apos;t provide while they had access to the resources to do so !
Mike reacts to Obed ’ s post saying :
so they lost their Ridge residence ?
why not live at their Adjiringanor house ?
what about the one off the Volta River near the Sogakope Bridge ?
they don &apos;t own those anymore ? this is why I &apos;m excited about Ghanaians blogging .
those that are full of crap will be noted .
if Rawlings had a blog in 1978 , 1979 , we would have evidence of what drove him to power and what he stood for .
the hypocrisy in some ranks has hurt the country and apparently is still crippling us .
Obed Nanayaw Sarpong responds to Mike &apos;s comment :
@ Mike , they say the house is not completed – there is a 10m high wall around that residence .
the wife says Mr. Rawlings lives at the Tefle residence and it &apos;s a challenge for them .
I get disappointed when these men and women shamelessly want to feed on us
Ghana ’ s Most Irreverent ; Ato Kwamena Dadzie says , “ Get a mortgage , Mr. Rawlings ” :
almost everything Mrs. Rawlings said in that interview seemed calculated to deceive Ghanaians into thinking that her family was in a very dire situation and to force the hand of government to do her bidding , knowing very well that she had rejected government offers of alternative accommodation .
I foolishly fell for her trickery .
I sat on radio and said government had no excuse for its failure to provide the Rawlings ’ s with alternative accommodation – five months after something ( or someone ) set their house on fire .
I wasn ’ t alone .
others were also incensed and government had no choice than to come out to quickly rebut her claim that nothing had been done yet to provide her family with a home . ”
with that , one question was foremost on many Ghanaian minds .
“ Ah , Rawlings paa , ” one man asked .
“ After 19 years in power as a dictator , is he saying that he hasn ’ t built a house for himself ? ”
Ato advises Rawlings to go to Ghana Home Loans to get a mortgage :
that ’ s just about as far as we should go .
it ’ s a good salary Rawlings gets .
if his East Legon mansion is not fit for his royal revolutionary habitation , he should go to Ghana Home Loans and get a mortgage .
last time I checked , his son , Kimathi works with Fidelity Bank .
they also offer mortgages .
he should go and take one .
George Bush ’ s retirement home was not provided by the American government .
Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are living in their own homes .
so is Kufuor .
it ’ s not beyond Rawlings to move into his own place .
he ’ s even lucky that his so called “ village house ” in Tefle is on the banks of a river .
Gordon Brown would kill for that .
if you become president of this nation , take a monthly salary and several other perks that make it virtually unnecessary for you to use your own money and you can ’ t build a house of your own and you turn around expecting the state to provide you with accommodation upon retirement , then you are nothing but a big fool .
there were 40 readers who have left comments at the time of writing this post .
following are some of comments readers have left :
Banske considers Rawlings the most deceitful and laziest Ghanaian :
Kwaku Baako says Rawlings is the luckiest Ghanaian and it &apos;s true and in addition I say he is the most deceitful and laziest Ghanaian .
for those of you who continue to be fooled ( if is real or pretense ) by the rawlingses , now that their hypocritical acts are exposed , don &apos;t you agree that he is the worst personality to have surfaced on the Ghanaian political scene ?
what is he doing with the money sitting his swiss account ? shameful imbecile .
he who burns a house will be consumed by fire ! ! !
Anna G says :
to me , it doesn &apos;t make sense at all for the little taxpayer ’ s money to be used to provide accommodation for ex- presidents .
in the first place , where were they sleeping before they became presidents ?
look at the ridiculous things that Kuffuor proposed that should be given to him when he became e- president .
to me , they are all the same : selfish , because they know very well that the tax that is collected in this country is not enough .
if our politicians and leaders continue to be this selfish , then I ’ m afraid Ghana &apos;s bad economy will never recover and we will continue to be a third world poor country .
frank Anderson supports Ato &apos;s position :
Ato I couldn &apos;t help but absolutely agree with you .
I find no sense in using tax payer &apos;s money in building houses for ex presidents simply because they have once been heads of state .
it sucks and pathetic .
and this issue has dominated public discussion for weeks ?
it is the cliche of African leaders .
even young guys at the ages of 23yrs begin thinking or taking steps to build their own homes how much more a former president .
the Rawlings ’ should save themselves this embarrassement and complete their own home .
Kweku Diyifo says says this is self-deception :
when I first heard Mrs. Rawlings say on radio that they are looking for a place to rent , I asked myself , “ What kind of self deception is this ? ” After staying in power for 20 years ?
after paying GHC90,000 import duty on two cars , instantly ?
after getting friends to pay for their children &apos;s education aboroad ?
the list goes endless .
many Ghanaians would even believe , and rightly so , that the Rawlings have more than the two mansions they have struggled to admit they have .
I know from my little experience in business that , with their kind of influence both home and abroad , it would take just a phone call for the Rawlingses to acquire a respectable and appropriate freehold residential accomodation anywhere in Ghana .
if you have and say that you do not have , that &apos;s your own problem .
but I , and many like me wont be fooled .

India Elections 09 : India votes decisively , decides to strengthen the hand of stability
this post is part of the Global Voices special coverage on the Indian Elections 2009
election results are pouring in from all across the country and it is now clear that India has voted decisively for a stable government at the center , under the leadership of the Congress-led UPA .
Dr. Manmohan Singh is going to be the Prime Minister for a second consecutive term .
even before all the results are in , just going by the trends , the BJP-led NDA alliance has publicly conceded defeat .
the UPA Chairperson , Mrs. Sonia Gandhi congratulated the electorate on this mandate .
at a press conference at her residence at 4.00pm IST , she said , “ The people of India know what is good for them and they have made the right choice . ”
as of now ( 5.40pm IST ) the national tally ( results ) is as follows :
of seats needed to stake claim to power ( majority ) = 272
UPA alliance – leads + wins = 258
NDA alliance – leads + wins = 162
others ( including the 4th Front ) – leads + wins = 55
Indian elections ( # indiavotes09 ) is a top trending topic on twitter today .
a few reactions from tweeters :
@ jraghu – Indian citizens give verdict .
Congress led UPA wins safe , free elections in largest free democracy .
thank you , all # India # Indiavotes09
@ dina – this mandate seems to be for good governance – stability &amp; progress &amp; optimism as opposed to fear .
governance not politicians .
@ calamur – # indiavotes09 – Singh is King – Advani v / s PM .
whining v / s strength .
bitterness v / s vision.powerlust v / s duty .
India chose well
while there is jubilation in many quarters , there is gloom among the supporters of the BJP .
blogger Chakresh Mishra writes on his blog :
&#91; ... &#93; my biggest sympathy is with BJP , which is the party I voted for .
a nationalist party .
it is a loss of face for BJP .
but friends , There are times in history of a nation when all seem lost and looks like wrong forces have won the final battle .
but dear friends , it is just a process , which goes on and on .
5 years may be significant time period in life of a man , but in life of a nation ( that too a nation like India ) is just a flickr of eye .
the time after defeat is not for grief and blame-game .
it is the time to introspect and start preparing to come out as winner in next battle .
though hopes are shattered and nightmares are prevailing , the dawn will surely come .
it is not the first black day of Indian history , we survived and fought back .
let us do that again .
update :
of seats needed to stake claim to power ( majority ) = 272
UPA alliance – leads + wins = 262
NDA alliance – leads + wins = 157
others ( including the 4th Front ) – leads + wins = 57
the UPA alliance now needs to garner support for only about 10 seats .
whom will they invite to be a part of their coalition ?

here &apos;s a video from the protest in Sofia , filmed by the author of this post :
the protest in Sofia coincided with the enthronement ceremony for Neofit , the newly-elected Patriarch of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church ; the city was paralyzed , no public transport , except for the metro , was running .
minutes after he was officially enthroned , Patriarch Neofit vowed to pray for peace and unity of the Bulgarian people .
this gesture of support for the protesters was well-received by them , while President Rosen Pleveliev , who addressed the crowd in Sofia , was booed .
the protesters called political parties not to manipulate or get involved in the protests .
at the rally in Veliko Tarnovo , they even chased some political representatives away &#91; bg ; video &#93; .

Malawi elections : Upending the pundits ’ predictions
with the elections over and the incumbent president Bingu wa Mutharika sworn in for his second and last term , Malawian bloggers ( Mabloga ) are awed by two developments that went against the predictions of many , especially the punditry .
first was the suggestion that the presidential contest would be very close .
it wasn &apos;t .
second was the perception that Malawians would once again vote on regional and ethnic lines .
they did not .
other fascinating aspects of the elections being discussed by the “ Mabloga ” include the role that Internet radio played in informing Diaspora Malawians on events as they unfolded , and what the new parliament might look like , what with a good number of the newly-elected members of parliament boasting university professorial and international civil service careers , long term PhDs , and other post-graduate qualifications .
the blog Chingwe &apos;s Hole reacts to both disproved predictions , then goes through a list of six aspects that make the May 2009 elections historic .
according to Chingwe &apos;s Hole , key structures of Malawi &apos;s institutions performed well .
and in marking the probable end of the political career of the 77 year-old leader of the Malawi Congress Party ( MCP ) , John Tembo , these elections also ended the era of the nationalist generation that has ruled Malawi since 1964 , a point also made by Paul Tiyambe Zeleza .
Tembo is reported to have already been put forward as the MCP &apos;s candidate in the next elections in 2014 , according to Chris Banda on the Internet forum Malawitalk .
Chingwe &apos;s Hole &apos;s third aspect is that the voting pattern was driven by substantive matters of development , over personalities , and more poignantly for many bloggers as well , over ethnicity , Chingwe &apos;s Hole &apos;s fourth and fifth historical aspects of these elections .
the last aspect deals with how the punditry overestimated the strength of the main challenger , John Tembo , in his party &apos;s alliance with the United Democratic Front ( UDF ) .
on this point Chingwe &apos;s Hole unleashes pointed criticism :
and finally the elections have exposed the vacuity of some of the political punditry in Malawi .
our most cited political pundits simply do not know what they are talking about … They kept analsising politics along the same old lines and seemed to base their views based only on whim srather than research and reflection .
listening to our oft cited “ political analysts ” the coalition was supposed to be a formidable force ; the elections would be a a ” close call ” ; Bingu had made a fatal mistake chosing a Southern as running mate ; the economy growth had not benefitted the majority etc .
as one of the pundits who predicted a strong showing for the MCP / UDF alliance and its candidate John Tembo , Boniface Dulani makes a confession mid-way through the vote counting when it is becoming apparent that Bingu wa Mutharika is defying expectations :
I must confess I did not expect the margin of victory that appears to be emerging from the election results as currently being announced .
for all intents and purposes , Mutharika appears to be headed for a strong landslide performance .
while Bingu is performing strongly in the northern region as predicted , he has also performed just as strongly in the central region and the southern region .
for Greenwell Matchaya , the incumbent &apos;s victory across the entire nation might be the beginning of the end of politics of ethnicity :
in the first place , the size of Bingu ’ s victory in the presence of a seemingly powerful opposition alliance is the first I have ever heard of in Africa .
furthermore , the fact that there were no any reported cases of rigging , makes his win even more credible and even more and more wonderful .
Bingu ’ s party , the DPP , won the presidential election with roughly 2,730,630 votes while the MCP / UDF alliance scooped circa 1,270,057 , almost 200,000 votes below half of Bingu ’ s votes &#91; .
&#93; the strong message arising from these figures is that Bingu was voted into power by the entire nation , raising postulates about whether good leadership styles could obliterate the tribal cancer that many of us thought was out to consume our political and everyday lives .
Clement Nyirenda also remarks on how the punditry got it wrong , and finds the voting pattern for the incumbent president &apos;s win epochal :
the pundits thought that John Tembo would garner more votes from the Southern region while beating Mutharika comprehensively in the Central Region , MCP ’ s stronghold .
Mutharika was expected to carry the day in the less populous Northern Region .
at the end of everything , the pundits have been proved wrong because Dr. Mutharika was proclaimed the winner with more than 6o % of the vote .
since the advent of multiparty democracy , I have never seen a presidential candidate getting votes from all the corners of the country like this .
and words of awe continue with Cryton Chikoko , who writes in the third person with the alias “ Rambler ” :
Rambler has to confess he was not expecting Malawians to vote on merit .
Admittedly Rambler wrongly thought that just like in the previous elections regionalism will rule the day .
the 2009 elections have come to him as a pleasant surprise .
a fresh breath in our politics .
Victor Kaonga pays tribute to the role that radio stations played in informing listeners of the results during the long breaks waiting for the Malawi Electoral Commission .
on Malawian Internet listserv forums , appreciation for the role of radio stations has especially focused on Zodiak Broadcasting Station , which broadcasts across Malawi , and recently started streaming live on the Internet .
listserv discussions have also widely debated what parliament might look like , given the large number of highly educated Malawians who have been elected to parliament , a topic also discussed by Chingwe &apos;s Hole .
on the Internet forum Nyasanet , the question of who will be chosen to fill cabinet posts is being debated on the basis of the intelligentsia voted into the legislature , which is being likened to an academic symposium .
blogger Kondwani Munthali has already provided his dream cabinet list .
Africa : Africans Share Childhood Memories Online
that African Girl is a blog with a series of posts written by Africans around the world about their childhood .
it is a blog about growing up in an African family and learning to live in two worlds .
the bloggers sharing their memories have lived both in Africa and the West .
the blog was started by Makafui Fiavi and Adey Teshome .
Makafui was born in Togo and grew up in the United States and Adey is young Ethiopian-American .
this is Makafui &apos;s introduction :
during the college years , many people take the time to better understand themselves and their place in the world .
most people do it by trying out different identities , or exploring different social circles and ideologies .
for me , the 4 years brought an exploration of my various sub-identities and a strong desire to learn how to live between 2 worlds .
born and raised in Togo and growing up in the United States has given me the desire to explore and understand various cultures , to listen to stories and to learn about what brings people together .
that African Girl ( TAG ) is the culmination of ideas , conversations and a desire to continue learning and sharing .
here ’ s where I share about things , people , places , stories , dreams and passions that inspire me .
Adey Teshome considers the blog as “ a place for the cultural hybrid , multi-interest , eclectic children such as ourselves to air our thoughts ” :
when I first agreed to contribute to this blog , I was super-inspired by Mak ’ s idea – a place for the cultural hybrid , multi-interest , eclectic children such as ourselves to air our thoughts .
and as I like to say , this is why we ’ re friends .
she has such an eye for self-expression and such cool views to share .
and I loved the thought of being part of that .
so that ’ s who I ’ ll try to be for this blog – a young Ethiopian-American , recent ( well , in the works ) college grad , trying to figure out my place and get my grounding in life , who can put in her two cents every now and then .
Liz A. is a contributor from Uganda / Kenya living in the United States . these are her childhood memories :
1 ) Being beaten as punishment .
I always found it interesting when my White or Asian friends would talk about being told to sit in a corner , or were sent to their room as a form of punishment .
for us , we were beaten .
my mum would usually get very thin branches that had fallen off the trees in our compound and my dad would get the thick ones , sometimes we would be sent to get them ourselves , and we would be given a few lashes on the calves of our legs .
in America , it seems that such a thing can result in social services being called in to review the situation or children here feel some sort of resentment towards their parents for it .
but I have
Gabon : opposition Continues to Fight Election Result
the death of Omar Bongo , one of Africa &apos;s longest-serving dictators , in June inspired hope that Gabon might embark on a new kind of politics .
yet when Bongo &apos;s son , Ali Ben Bongo , the ruling party &apos;s candidate , was declared the victor of the August 31st election , few were surprised .
as one francophone blogger , Le petit Quimonte illustre , explains :
in Gabon , the Crown is hereditary , passed from male to male by order of primogeniture , democratically elected by direct succession via universal suffrage , under the protection of the military .
and yet members of the opposition are refusing to go home quietly .
last week , Gabon &apos;s opposition parties called for a 3-day national strike , in protest of last month &apos;s election , and to express solidarity with victims of the post-election violence in Port Gentil ( although by most international news accounts , few if any in Libreville took up the call ) .
Gabon Libre Expression ( via Afrik.com ) reports that some opposition candidates are offering their own , alternative vote count which places UPG candidate Pierre Mamboundou ahead of Bongo , with more than 68 % of the vote .
on Thursday , opposition candidates issued a joint statement and least nine have filed claims in the Gabonese Constitutional Court calling for the nullification of the August 31st vote , which ex-candidate Bruno Ben Moubamba calls “ an electoral coup d &apos;etat , ” on account of alleged voter fraud and other irregularities .
the court has one month to rule on the allegations , but as a recent article on Afrik.com points out , with the court &apos;s close ties to the Bongo family , the opposition entertains little hope of a favorable outcome .
long Live la Françafrique !
France , long cozy with the Bongo family , was deemed at least partly to blame .
protesters in Port-Gentil targeted facilities owned by Total , the French oil company , in post-election violence that left at least three dead .
a protest against the election in Paris is planned for this Wednesday and , at least on one Gabonese news website , there are calls to boycott French products .
pour Un Gabon Meilleur !
explains the history of French companies in Gabon , and their close connectino to the Bongo family :
Elf , today named Total , is the most well-known of all the French companies that exploit Gabon &apos;s riches because of the controversy that from 1994 until 2004 put a spotlight on the links between the leadership of the oil company , the Bongo family , the mafia , and the heights of France &apos;s state apparatus .
but in fact , the whole of the country &apos;s economy is under the thumb of French companies , and it is difficult to name them all .
the Bongo clan has served as the , flaunting a provocative luxury in a place of extreme poverty .
but most of the riches produced by the &#91; Gabonese &#93; oil , mining , timber , transport and port workers benefit the owners and shareholders of companies whose head offices are , for example , in places like Odet ( Bolloré ) , the Tour Montparnasse in Paris ( Eramet ) , La Defense ( Areva ) or Niort ( Rougier , for the exploitation and trade of tropical wood ) .
alliance Nationale de la Resistance du Tchad , presents a time line of France &apos;s supposed involvement in the election , which culminates in a now-infamous quote Robert Bourgi gave to Le Monde on the even of the election : “ In Gabon , France is not a candidate , but the candidate of Robert Bourgit is Ali Bongo .
now , I am a friend Nicholas Sarkozy listens to .
Subliminally , the voter will understand ” .
readers of La Voix Du Peuple Gabonais discuss the feasibility of a boycott of French products .
Ondonza writes :
I completely agree with this boycott : it &apos;s an effective pressure device that can make the French reconsider their position … businessmen , students , tourists and others should no longer fly Air France or Gabon Airlines , but take Lufthansa , Ethiopia or other company as an alternative .
drivers shouldn &apos;t consume Total oil , nor Lybian oil .
thinking of buying Gabonese now will raise the purchasing power of small Gabonese traders .
may God bless Gabon
Aligatoire wonders how a boycott could possibly work , given Gabon &apos;s extreme dependence on its former colonizer :
boycott French products ?
our economy produces nothing .
that would mean boycotting CFAO , CECADIS , TOTAL , SMAG , BNP ( bicig ) , bgfi , crédit lyonnais ( ugb ) , SEEG , LIBERTIS ( les bongo ) , all the companies … … let &apos;s start by creating a Gabonese bank and Gabonese enterprises .
we have to start by getting over our hang-ups , because Africans suffer from an inferiority complex vis-a-vis the Western man .
this fight must be , in the first instance , psychological and cultural .
our leaders are at the mercy of the West , to the detriment of their people .
we are in the same place as we were during the slave trade , the customary chief and the slave trader .
Alphonse Obiang , in a comment on Alliance Nationale de la Resistance du Tchad , turns the responsibility back on Gabonese politicians :
this article is full of it … I can &apos;t see what Paris has done , unless you claim that it was Paris that forced those against Bongo to divide their voices by 22 .
the result is clear : taken together , the opposition got far more than 50 % .
divided , Ali Bongo won easily .
everything else are simple explanations and BS .
Nigeria : after two leaderless months , a new Acting President
on November 23rd , 2009 , Nigeria &apos;s President , Umaru Musa Yar &apos;Adua left the country without publicly stating when he would return .
in the following weeks , the news was released that he was receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia , yet speculation continued , culminating in rumors that the Pesident had suffered brain damage or had even died .
on January 12th , Yar &apos;Adua gave an interview confirming that he was alive and receiving treatment , though he gave no indication when he would return to Nigeria .
Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s absence created a leadership vacuum which frustrated many Nigerians , particularly in the wake of crises such as Umar Abdulmutallab &apos;s attempted terror attract and the religious conflict in the central Nigerian city of Jos .
many Nigerians called for Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan to step into Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s shoes , but the situation was complex : as a southerner , Jonathan &apos;s assumption of the Presidency would threaten to destabilize the delicate power-sharing arrangement between Northern and Southern Nigeria .
further , without written instructions from the President himself , the legal extent of Jonathan &apos;s position were unclear .
for more than two months Nigerian bloggers lamented the leadership void .
Chinedu Vincent Akuta at Briefs from Akuta wrote :
enough of power vacuum , near constitutional crisis , and over heating of the polity all due to the fact that the ruling party ( PDP ) does not trust the Vice President ( Jonathan Goodluck ) to formally act as President until President Yar ’ Adua recovers from his illness .
there is no choice other than to respect the wishes of the Nigerian people , power belongs to the people .
and indeed , many Nigerians shared his sentiments .
during the month of January frustrated Nigerians marched in Lagos , Abuja , and London .
Adeolu Akinyemi wrote on why he marched :
we are not happy with a Plane load of 300 people dying in the streets of Jos in Religious wars because of inaction from a missing leader .
enough is Enough !
we will not accept the label of terrorism bestowed on us by the 58 days inactivity of our president ’ s mobile phone .
enough is Enough !
leadership Vacuum is dangerous and is responsible for killings in the north , kidnapping in the east , Militants gang raping in the South South and intellectual indifference in the west .
enough is Enough !
Yusef , a commenter on Akinyemi &apos;s blog , was more skeptical ( edited from the original English version ) :
how many times will I read this celebrated line “ Enough is Enough ” ? ? ? ?
it &apos;s very strange how we display so much hypocrisy when faced with some adversity and yet are able to make very sharp u-turns once the weather is stormed .
there is no such thing as “ Enough is Enough ” Deolu .
we do not know what a nation is yet , not to even talk of kinsmanship .
it &apos;s not enough to brandish posters of Ernesto Che on our walls to pretend to imagine or understand what it takes to lay down ABSOLUTELY everything for a better day .
or we are too selfish hoping that “ one day e go better for our side ” !
our so-called leaders did not drop from Hell , but are actually just a reflection of our society .
replace &#91; any of them &#93; with even yourself and you will be surprised at what you will do or become .
popular broadcast journalist Funmi Ayanda also wrote about her frustration with the prevalence passive hand-wringing :
I have sat in the company of bank MDs who stole billions of money , ruling party leaders who manipulate the electoral process and steal billions on naira , pastors of un taxed mega churches where all the above pay staggering sums in tithes and contribution and listened in disbelief as they all moan about bad leadership and the Nigerian situation .
I have often mentally checked my teeth for visible spinach ; perhaps the joke is on me ?
so make l for no crase finish l ask simple questions like , “ so what do you think we should do ” what is within our own control immediately and how do we build on that ?
“ What will my role be in that ” ? usually , the conversation goes no further because l sometimes think both Nigerians and foreigners have a morbid fascination with Nigeria ’ s undeniable failures .
on February 9th , after weeks of political wrangling , the Senate confirmed Jonathan as acting President .
many in the blogosphere saw the event as cause for celebration .
Solomonsydelle of Nigerian Curiosity provided an excellent analysis of the situation as it unfolded ( See here for her coverage ) .
she wrote :
February 9th could possibly go down in history as a day when democratic political measures where used to take Nigeria one step further down the path to becoming a true democratic nation .
Akin , too , was guardedly hopeful :
maybe and just maybe , we might just have a good President and the good luck in his name brings good fortune to Nigeria , maybe , we can hope , maybe , we can dream , maybe , we can expect , maybe , we can realise – A New Nigeria .
but others saw reason for concern , pointing out that although Jonathan &apos;s assumption of power might be a political necessity , it was not explicitly permitted by the Nigerian Constitution .
Max Siollun summed up the predicament as follows :
Jonathan ’ s confirmation as VP will hopefully put an end to the controversy ( at least temporarily ) , and will give the leadership some semblance of order and due process .
while we have arrived at a PRACTICAL solution , I am not sure that the manner and circumstances in which Jonathan was appointed acting VP was LEGAL .
Jide Salu acknowledged the constitutional ambiguity , but was primarily thankful that the country finally has a leader .
I just want some peace and direction .
if you were residing in the country , you would understand better .
Nigeria was not only headless , it was directionless with all the looting that has gone on and still going .
which for now is under wraps .
ANA Nimmos was optimistic , but also saw cause for concern :
&#91; the political resolution &#93; may not be the actual end of this logjam as it presents its own challenges .
for instance , by this resolution – if we accept it for arguments sake – Nigeria now has two Presidents -though one is acting .
Yar &apos;adua never left power and Goodluck should be very careful what actions he takes .
Loomnie also highlighted unanswered questions for the future :
one also has to think about the machine that was ruling the country all the while Yar ’ Adua was not available .
is the new President Goodluck Jonathan going to be able to take charge of the machine ?
is he going to be deferring to it / them ?
those are going to be crucial questions in the next few months .
Zimbabwe : outrage as Octogenarian Mugabe Eyes 2012 Election
Zimbabwe &apos;s long-time ruler , Robert Mugabe , 87 , was endorsed last weekend by his party , the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front ( ZANU-PF ) , as their candidate for the presidential elections expected next year .
Mugabe has been in power since 1980 .
he has rejected local and international calls for him to quit .
many Zimbabweans hoped that his ill health and age would force him to leave power .
the ZANU-PF congress quashed all those hopes .
if elections are held next year , Mugabe will be 88 years old and Africa ’ s second oldest person to stand in a presidential election after the late Kamuzu Hastings Banda of Malawi who was 98 years old when he stood in Malawi ’ s 1994 elections .
Twitter and Facebook , the two online alternative public spheres that have become the favored platform for Zimbabweans , became the sites of expression of outrage and disbelief .
Robert Mugabe will be Africa ’ s second oldest person to stand in a presidential election .
photo released to the public domain by the U.S. federal government .
the President Cde Robert Mugabe will not retire anytime soon as he was anonimasly &#91; sic &#93; endorsed by all provinces as their next year candidate .
this was announced at the close of the 12th ZANU PF People ’ s Congress in Bulawayo yesterday .
Masamha Tulisticated posted on his wall :
no retirement plans for the Zimbabwean president .
more white farms to be designated for rural resettlement .
# Zanu PF congress .
on Twitter , @ BrendahNyakudya tweeted a Mugabe quote :
I am lucky that God has given me longer years than others to be with you ( Zimbabweans ) .
I will not let you down , ” he ( Mugabe ) added .
@ BrendahNyakudya quipped :
Mugabe says it would be wrong to step down ” * Brendah pours ashes on head , dons sack-cloth and spends night wailing at city gates *
@ masamhat : Robert Mugabe says no plans to retire .
he thanks God for living long because he can now rule longer # # Zanu PF congress in Byo &#91; Bulawayo &#93;
@ mashanubian : “ No surprise !
Zanu PF congress endorses # Mugabe as presidential candidate for elections to be held in 2012 or early 2013 # zimbabwe
@ clivembayimbayi posted an angry tweet :
guys tel me , whn is the bastard goind 2 step dwn , I mean Mugabe from Zimbabwe , gyz lets do somthng
@ nqabamatshazi added a bit of humour noting something different in a country where citizens have learnt to curse the dark because of the perennial power cuts :
Bulawayo city centre dwellers are having the time of their lives .
since the Zanu PF conference began &#91; December &#93; , they have not experienced a power cut .
later , a day after the Zanu PF conference ended , @ nqabamatshazi followed up with :
after an uncharacteristic break , power cuts are back with a vengeance in Bulawayo I bet some people wish the Zanu PF conference was still on .
meanwhile , @ IamClaro made reference to the controversial Nando ’ s advert that the whole world &apos;s laughing at :
: ’ -To Protect Mugabe assassination ”
international Eye on the US Elections
as the US Elections loom closer , international attention to US foreign policy and the candidates has increased .
projects like Current TV &apos;s Collective Journalism and Global Voices ’ Voices Without Votes have taken the task to gather this information and bring a global perspective on a local issue .
current TV &apos;s Collective Journalism program has started a series of video reports on how the rest of the world views the US .
in The View from Over There , people from many different countries state their views on foreign policy , the war in Iraq , the situation with Iran and mention who they would want as the future president of the USA .
the video interviews are sometimes in different languages , but all of it is subtitled in English .
this video also uses footage from other shows on the US Elections 2008 , but this time concentrating on the foreign perspective .
this is something Global Voices and Reuters have been doing for a while now at Voices Without Votes : gathering opinions from all over the planet on the US elections .
if you have any posts you would like to submit to the site , you can do it here .
current TV &apos;s next Collective Journalism assignment will be a worldwide view on the US immigration policies .
Senegal : “ Enough is Enough ” Movement : first the Web , Now the Presidential Palace
as uprisings continue across the Arab World , several incidences of angry young people have sprung up on Senegalese websites .
since early March , this activism has left the web behind and a group calling itself “ Y &apos;en a marre ” ( Enough is Enough ) has now become the main symbol of the protests .
founded in January 2011 , Enough is Enough arose from frustration built up during power cuts that brought Senegal to a standstill .
the group hails from the Dakar suburbs and is led by several local rappers , including Fou Malad , Thiat ( from the group Keur Gui ) and Matador .
an article on Afrik.com explains the story behind the movement &#91; this and all subsequent links in French &#93; .
the group does not hold anything back on its Facebook page :
the time has passed for moaning in your living room or futile complaining about power cuts .
we refuse to accept the systematic rationing imposed in our homes to supply electricity .
we &apos;re sick and tired of it .
enough IS ENOUGH .
﻿ ﻿ The group has now transformed its discontent at power cuts into a mobilisation movement for young people .
it attacks mass unemployment , police brutality and corruption .
but above all , it tries to make people take part .
on 19 March , Enough is Enough held a protest in Dakar &apos;s Place de l &apos;Obélisque ( Obelisk Square ) , using its website to summon young Dakarois there .
the organisers certainly knew how to get their message across : black t-shirts with “ y &apos;en a marre ” in white letters were distributed around the crowd .
there were also rhythmic , rap-style slogans , and both youth speak and the local Wolof language were heard .
the outcome : several hundred young enthusiasts , but most notably , the police – who were on the lookout under the shadow of the obelisk – did not use any tear gas . ( video ) :
to keep its momentum , the group has given itself a new objective : mobilise young people and give them a voice in anticipation of the 2012 presidential election . the organisers have redefined their message and come up with a new slogan : “ ma carte d &apos;electeur , mon vote ” ( “ my polling card , my vote ” ) .
on 15 April they launched a national campaign called Daas Fanaanal ( a Wolof verb meaning “ to protect oneself ” ) , which aims to encourage young people to vote without pledging allegiance to any particular party .
many young Senegalese have shown their support for the campaign on Facebook and Twitter , such as this post by Mamadou Dieye :
enough is also enough because the majority of the 1.4 million young people of voting age will not register on the electoral roll .
they &apos;re always quick to complain but never do anything about it .
y &apos;en a marre will only succeed in the challenge it has set itself if it helps to wreck the Interior Minister &apos;s plan to leave all young people who don &apos;t support the Government off the electoral roll !
enough is Enough does not hesitate to slam President Abdoulaye Wade &apos;s government , and the government is not sitting idly by .
the group claims to have been put under a lot of pressure , and says it has received threats from the authorities .
one press conference was cancelled when the landlord of Janeer , the bar in which it was supposed to take place , was pressurised by police .
the police also seized loudspeakers seized at a rally on 19 March , 2011 , in the city of Rufisque , close to Dakar , despite the fact that the group had been granted official permission to hold the event .
Thiat , one of the leaders of the group , explains that it is first and foremost a movement of citizens , not an anti-Wade movement :
we are on the side of neither the President nor the opposition , we are on the side of the people and we are creating a movement which guards and upholds the respect of democracy and the institutions of Senegal .
if the “ enough is enough ” movement is closer to the opposition right now , its founders have said that &apos;s because we &apos;re taking on the concerns of the citizens .
the group wants change .
period .
its growing popularity has made it April &apos;s catch of the month .
the group instantly responded :
small fish in a big pond , or mini revolution ?
the real extent of its impact on the 2012 presidential campaign will be known soon .
the fact remains , only the rappers of the Dakar suburbs are speaking out .
during Senegal &apos;s last presidential election campaign in 2007 , the only passing mention of youth issues arose from the “ Concrete Generation ” movement .
its figurehead was Karim Wade , the then 39 year-old son of President Wade .
to say that young people are missing from Senegalese politics is an understatement .
enough is Enough is not a call for the overthrow of the government , and it talks the line of democracy and non-violence .
its revolution will affect every ballot box in Senegal .
these events confirm that the Senegalese people believe in the power of their ballot papers , but above all that the next presidential election campaign has long since begun , and this time , Senegal &apos;s youth will not settle for a role as mere spectators .
Iran : President Ahamdinejad &apos;s trip to Lebanon
Iran &apos;s president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has just concluded a two-day visit to Lebanon .
it was his first official since 2005 when he first took office .
he held talks with Lebanese officials and visited strongholds of Iran &apos;s ally Hezbollah in the capital &apos;s southern suburbs and south Lebanon , and received a hero &apos;s welcome .
several Iranian bloggers reacted to this trip .
Meybodema has published several photos of Ahmadinejad &apos;s visit in Lebanon and quoted Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah , the leader of Hezbollah , who praised the Islamic Republic and welcomed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
the blogger quotes Nasrallah saying that contrary to all propaganda , “ Iran is helping the oppressed ” .
Sayeh Azadi has republished ( see above ) a cartoon by leading Iranian cartoonist Nikahang from in Roozonline with the headline “ Ahmadinejad &apos;s dreams for Lebanon ” .
Z8unak counts some reasons of why Lebanese people welcomed Ahmadinejad .
the blogger writes :
why you were surprised that Ahmadinejad was greeted so warmly in Lebanon ?
after 20 years of the Iran-Iraq war , border cities did not get constructed but houses in Lebanon were constructed by our money .
many Iranians can not afford going to a doctor or hospitals and die every day as a result , meanwhile Iran constructs hospitals in Lebanon .
Mollah writes with irony :
Lebanese did not see any bad things from the Iranian government .
if we were Lebanese and got the money we would become Islamic Republic &apos;s supporters … They say , we don &apos;t care that they are in power after a ‘ coup ’ or that they torture people … just pass the dollars .
Caribbean : Rethinking Online Publishing
a selection of books from and about the Caribbean .

the anglophone Caribbean &apos;s small but energetic literary blogosphere has taken notice of a new arrival to its conversation .
Williams &apos;s posts have provoked thought and discussion both in the blog &apos;s comments fields and elsewhere .
Caribbean Book Blog began with an essay titled “ Breaking the Shackles ” , analysing the state of Caribbean publishing and the market for Caribbean books .
… if you speak to many booklovers in and outside of the Caribbean , or check out some online message boards where the topic of discussion is Caribbean literature , you ’ ll find people bewailing how difficult it is to find good books by Caribbean writers , whether it ’ s in the region itself or in the metropolitan markets .
… there ’ s need for change — massive change .
otherwise we may well be faced with a situation where our literary griots end up being relegated to a state of obscurity and irrelevance .
to avoid this they must find new mediums to draw attention to themselves and their work .
in his second essay , “ Now Is the Time ” , Williams proposes that “ a group of intellectual , editorial and IT visionaries with … pioneering spirit and the entrepreneurial drive ” ought to “ take up the challenge of creating an online home for our struggling writers and poets to help them stand on their feet so they in turn can help usher in a new dawn of knowledge and enlightenment . ”
several writers based in the Caribbean have joined the discussion by leaving comments .
Antiguan novelist Joanne C. Hillhouse writes :
it does take away from the time and energy I have to give to my writing , and I ’ m still working on finding that balance , but I ’ ve come to terms with the fact that self-promotion ( ugly word ) is part of the process and the Internet is in many ways leveling the playing field .
Jamaican poet Tanya Shirley echoes these sentiments :
I think as Caribbean writers we are now living in an age where we have to be more proactive in the process of marketing our work and using all the resources at our disposal to do so .
the Miami-based Jamaican writer Geoffrey Philp — also one of the Caribbean &apos;s most prolific literary bloggers — responds on his own blog , with a proposal :
what is needed is a web site that is devoted full-time to Caribbean writing .
the site as I envision it would be a clearing house for books published by Caribbean writers .
publishers would submit their catalogues , writers could upload their photos and reading dates , and readers could subscribe via RSS , newsletters , or email .
Philp also lists well over a dozen Caribbean literary and scholarly journals online , some of them traditional printed journals that also maintain a web presence , and some entirely web-based .
together with a few dedicated litbloggers and writers-who-blog , these sites , Philp suggests , could evolve into the nucleus of a future web-based Caribbean publishing community .
in the three and a half years since Global Voices last comprehensively surveyed the Caribbean literary blogosphere , a handful of new journals has emerged , based online and in many cases using blogging software to publish quickly and inexpensively .
tongues of the ocean , based in the Bahamas and running on WordPress , was launched in early 2009 as a poetry journal , but by its third issue it also included short fiction .
editor Nicolette Bethel ( who also writes at her personal blog ) in an interview with Antilles , the blog of the Caribbean Review of Books , described being inspired by online journals based in other parts of the world :
I was impressed by these journals ’ integration of media into their offerings , which made them a substantially different , more alive , animal from the printed page .
what was missing among them ?
an online Caribbean journal for Caribbean writers with the kind of turn-around and quick publishing record that these other online journals had .
in mid-2009 another blog-based magazine project went live : Zafra Lit , which translates short fiction by contemporary Cuban writers into English .
edited by David Iaconangelo , a student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , and running on Blogger , Zafra Lit draws on the efforts of student translators who volunteer their time and skills .
an even more recent arrival is Town , launched in October 2009 .
based in Trinidad , it publishes short poems and fiction both online and via broadsides — posters — which readers can download as PDFs and print at home .
other bloggers have responded to the shortage — or absence — of serious literary and cultural coverage in the Caribbean press by turning their blogs into virtual magazines .
the most energetic recent arrival in the Caribbean online literary scene may be Repeating Islands , an arts and culture blog run by two literary scholars with roots in Puerto Rico , Ivette Romero-Cesareo and Lisa Paravisini-Gebert .
covering literature , visual arts , music , performance , cultural studies , and more , Repeating Islands posts up to six or seven new items daily : links to articles and interviews , information about new books and exhibitions , and fascinating oddments .
covering all the Caribbean &apos;s language areas — English , Spanish , French , Dutch — the blog plays an increasingly important role in spreading information and ideas .
an online writing and publishing network like the one Caribbean Book Blog and Geoffrey Philp imagine will need this kind of breadth and enthusiasm .
Iraq : it &apos;s Election Day on Twitter !
exclusive # iraq10 picture from polling station in # Baghdad : www.mict-international.org / 1a.jpg

updates by observers on the ground are typical of many elections around the world , except that Iraq is a special case .
bombs went off throughout the day and clashes were reported between various factions .
on @ iraqelections , the reporters who toyed with Twitter did a fantastic job keeping us updated using social networking tools .
in one update , Laith reports :
Laith : Baghdad : tens of families from the AlKaradah region denied voting because their names are not on the voters register

Pakistan : child Abuse On The Rise
there is a disturbing rise in child abuse cases in Pakistan .
according to UNICEF Local Officer Shamshad Qureshi the reason is lack of proper law enforcement , negligence of parents and lack of awareness among the children and the society .
he also said that the major factor for pedophilia in Pakistan was the easy access of people to children due to the negligence of parents .
faheem Haider at Bangladesh Foreign Policy Blog discusses about the abuse of children and child workers in Pakistan and Bangladesh .
he doesn ’ t mince as he shows us another very common side of child abuse :
“ Unable to feed a growing family , desperate parents farm out their children to affluent homes to serve as servants , maids or nannies ( child-keepers is the more proper sense in which these children are employed in those house-holds ) .
these children then become , effectively , the wards of their employers and are often treated like personal property .
the birth parents remain out of sight , perhaps hundreds of miles away , unaware that their babies are just so much flesh and burdened bone for the caprice and rubbed temper of their unbecomingly unkind lords .
justice has been put aside for these children .
they are the flotsam of unsettled poverty and the repackaged gifts of unhinged circumstances .
opportunity does not avail them ; outcomes remain unmarked and the appropriate ends to which they might be working are unknown to them .
justice is for these children an inattentive teacher . ”
Fatima Bhutto is not only a influential political heir but also a humanitarian .
in a blog post in The Daily Beast she doesn ’ t leave much to be said by painting a grim picture of child abuse :
“ The brutal murder of a 12-year-old maid , believed to have been killed by her powerful employer , has stunned the country .
but from the corrupt government to the honor killing of a wealthy woman , the country &apos;s rich always get away with it .
Shazia Masih , a tiny 12-year-old who looked years younger than her age , was laid to rest last week after a Christian funeral at Lahore &apos;s Cathedral Church .
she had been employed by the wealthy and influential former president of Lahore &apos;s Bar Association , and for a generous $ 8 a month she cleaned her employer &apos;s toilets , the cars that filled their suburban garage , and the filth that collected on the floors of their home . ”
this YouTube video shows that a teacher of a government school abused a student as punishment but nobody did anything .
the term ‘ child abuse ’ covers a wide array of very diverse kinds of crimes subjected towards the minors .
it signifies physical as well as mental pain .
when an adult tries to use a child as a sex toy it is child abuse .
when an adult tries to appease his labour needs at a lower cost it is also child abuse .
when a child is exploited as a commodity and traded for monetary or non monetary produce it is child abuse .
when an adult forces the child to push himself beyond his strength overlooking all health guidelines for children it is child abuse .
Pakistan is a country that does little in protecting its young worlds from the many horrors of child abuse that they are exposed to in and around the green pastures .
Angola : the high cost of living in Luanda
the capital of Angola , Luanda , is a very expensive city .
both for Angolans as well as for foreigners .
if you are here , you are well aware .
basic services , like food , education and housing are priced on par with some European countries .
the main difference is that the salaries in Angola are simply laughable when compared to their European counterparts , which leads to daily battles to secure basic needs .
obviously this battle is not fought by those with money who , for reasons obscure or not , are protected with bank accounts that would make mere mortals envious .
according to a survey conducted in February by an English company , ECA International – Luanda ranks first among the most expensive cities in the world .
in his blog Mundo da Verdade , Miguel Caxias writes :
“ Just to give you an idea , the cost of one night in the hotel where I am staying is $ 170 USD ( single room with bathroom , plus a rather paltry breakfast ) .
we are talking about a hotel that is rated two stars , at best .
for a European , not only because of meal / food customs , but also because of safety concerns , we do not risk eating at the corner diner , obviously .
in the restaurant we frequent , the average cost of a meal is $ 30 USD ( add beverage , dessert and appetizers and the price quickly jumps to $ 40 / 45 USD per person ) .
Luanda is undergoing massive construction .
near the Marginal &#91; bay front area &#93; , some apartments are listed at one million dollars .
and they have all been sold ! !
the high cost of living in the country is paradoxical , since it does not correlate to a high quality of life , at least not for those faring worse economically .
Angola registers high development indicators that , unfortunately , are not reflected in the finances of the majority of Angola &apos;s citizens .
excessive demand coupled with scarce supply make things rather difficult .
the Brazilian author of the blog Diário de África provides a quick analysis of what happens in Angola .
“ It &apos;s not just the rent ( housing ) that is costly .
everything is so expensive .
a kilo of tomatoes can go for $ 20 USD .
a tray of grapes can cost $ 30 USD per kilo .
a slice of beef with French fries can easily costs $ 50 USD .
a punctured pipe can set you back $ 1000.00 USD .
Soldering a small puncture in the air-conditioning pipe in the car and gassing up to handle the heat of Luanda can cost $ 200 USD .
need an electrician ?
he won &apos;t leave his house without getting at least $ 100.00 from you .
even if it &apos;s just to change a light bulb .
why is everything so expensive ? ”
according to this blogger , the answer is simple and , once again , harks back to the war that robbed the country of more than 30 years of development .
“ The arduous fight for independence followed by the war did away with everything .
first , independence . in 1975 , at least 300,000 Portuguese citizens abandoned Angola .
doctors , dentists , lawyers , businessmen , plumbers , mechanics , civil servants , professors .
in a question of months , Angola was left without qualified personnel . there was nobody who knew how to manage the country &apos;s finances .
second , the war .
the war effort sucked all the money that should have been invested in health , education and infrastructure in the country .
now multiply this situation by 30 years , and you get Luanda .
with the high price of gas in recent years , transport costs have also risen and , concurrently , so have all products .
the situation has become such that even items produced in Angola can cost more than imports .
economists please correct me , but it seems to have something to do with the law of supply and demand .
if you want it now , you have to pay more . ”
the country has no industries .
everything is imported .
it is shipped in , and there is no space at the port .
the ships are anchored two to three months in the high seas , waiting for authorization to unload their goods .
only now has agriculture begun to take its first steps , but only in areas where there are no land mines .
the latest statistics I heard were that half of Angola &apos;s arable land is rife with mines .
as long as the land is not cleaned , nothing is done .
therefore , even food needs to be imported .

Brazil : call for a boycott of the country &apos;s biggest newspaper
at the end of November , two separate but somehow connected protest movements arose on the Brazilian blogosphere and twittersphere .
one of them called on all bloggers to support a campaign of mass un-subscription to the largest Brazilian newspaper , Folha de São Paulo , and its website UOL .
the second was a demonstration in front of the headquarters of the same media group , organized by the “ Medialess Movement ” headed by Cidadania blog , against a perceived bias and news manipulation of the Folha group .
nevertheless , both movements converged as a larger protest organized through the blogosphere against what many call “ PIG ” , an acronym for the Coupist Press Party &#91; in Portuguese Partido da Imprensa Golpista &#93; a term coined to describe the biased Brazilian media that serves political interests .
Twitter users @ Dolphindiluna and @ Aritana designed badges initially posted on the Arlesophia , Blog do Tsavkko and Maria Frô blogs , inviting readers to un-subscribe to the media group .
these banners were spreading quickly on the blogosphere , when Folha sent a warning to cyberactivist and blogger Antonio Arles , claiming inappropriate use of the group &apos;s trade marks :
Arles briefly explains the situation and says he believes he has been intimidated by the largest Brazilian newspaper :
censored
I have just been notified out of court by the law firm representing Folha &#91; de São Paulo &#93; to withdraw the # CancelandoFOLHA # CancelandoUOL ( # unsubscribeFolha , # unsubscribeUOL ) campaign badges , otherwise I may suffer legal action for alleged misuse of trade marks .
thus , I have immediately withdrawn those badges .
at the moment , I cannot write a post explaining the case further , but I protest here about one more act of censorship against blogs .
was it really an act of censorship ?
Flávia Penido explains that by using registered trade marks , bloggers left room for the newspaper &apos;s lawyers to contest the campaign .
Chapter III – CRIMES AGAINST TRADE MARKS
article 189 – A crime against trademark registration is committed by those who :
I – reproduce without the holder &apos;s permission , in whole or in part , trademark or imitates it in a way that may lead to confusion , or
II – change someone else &apos;s trademark of a product already on the market .
penalty – detention of 3 ( three ) months to 1 ( one ) year or fine .
so , there is no reason to sulk , right ?
Flávia Penido continues , pointing out :
my point here is to make everyone think about the ways to exercise freedom of speech – and more than that , to make people appreciate things in a correct way : what is more important ?
to help the protest take shape , grow , or carry on hitting the wall ?
is the Folha logo really so important for the campaign to take off ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Antônio Arles , in photo by Aritanã Dantas .

Antônio Mello , who has just unsubscribed to the group &apos;s online portal UOL , has started a new campaign .
he believes that if a large part of the blogosphere republishes the banned badges , Folha will not be able to notify every blogger and this will force the broadsheet into giving up :
I have published &#91; the badges &#93; here , and invite everyone to download them onto their computers and then upload them onto their blogs or social networks .
they will have to notify the whole blogosphere .
thus , they will learn that times have changed and information no longer flows in a single direction .
Marco Aurélio Weissheimer has joined the campaign and canceled his subscription to the group &apos;s product :
the reason : misuse of the intelligence of the subscriber .
&quot; Folha publishes fake documents .
un-subscribe to it !
Folha &apos;s decision to notify Arles fueled an even bigger reaction , and no sooner were the original logos banned than many alternative badges quickly appeared on the web .
Rodrigo Vianna , from Escrevinhamentos , publishes a banner on the left , that refers to a derogatory news piece published by Folha earlier this year against possible presidential candidate Dilma Roussef , using a spam email as its main source .
the blogger says his campaign is not for the boycott of Folha , but to stop feeding their attitude :
“ Folha ” doesn &apos;t like “ banners ” on the Internet asking people to cancel subscriptions .
the daily paper of the Frias family has tried to intimidate a blogger who posted these banners .
but “ Folha ” likes publishing fake &#91; police &#93; records on its front page .
Ah , fake records are allowed !
so people have decided to come up with a new Internet banner , taking advantage of the fake record .
this second wave of online protest helped to encourage people to attend the demonstration on Saturday , 5th December , when dozens took to the streets of São Paulo and assembled in front of the Folha headquarters to protest against the newspaper &apos;s stance .
this was the second time in less than a year that the blogosphere had mobilised to demonstrate there .
with the motto “ Folha rapes journalism ” , I recall many reasons for the demonstration on my own blog :
&quot; Folha de São Paulo : headquarters of PIG – Coupist Press &quot; .

the organizer of the demonstration last Saturday , Eduardo Guimarães , described it as a success , with people coming from the states of São Paulo , Santa Catarina , Rio , Minas Gerais :
the mission has been accomplished and my soul is relieved .
those who did not show up missed it .
it was a democratic party .
hurting the pockets
Claudinei Vieira wonders if the campaign may cause a real change of attitude at the paper , as the boycott seems to have been effective so far , for Folha to pay attention to it :
this immediately means , therefore , two things : that the Internet campaign is really bothering Folha , which has decided to fight back .
Oops .
and it is attacking the entire blogosphere and , to boot , attacking freedom of expression .
another Oops .
I just wonder if they really believe that this campaign depends solely on two badges …
some bloggers , such as Rodrigo Vianna , believe that hurting the media in the pocket is a more effective way to discredit them than attending demonstrations :
I think the best way to attack this lot is in their pockets .
I know some people who have un-subscribed to the paper in recent weeks .
there must be many others out there .
so , I suggest a sober demonstration in a public place for a collective act of canceling subscriptions .
&#91; ... &#93; There is no need to burn newspapers ( I don &apos;t like it , it reminds me of the fascist rituals of the &apos; 30s ) , or to scream .
just say : I will no longer give my money to you .
they understand this language .
&quot; don &apos;t read or subscribe to Falha de São Paulo &quot; .
Falha is a wordplay with Folha , meaning &quot; fail &quot;
Maurício Caleiro follows the same line of thought , agreeing that bloggers should concentrate on the online boycott campaign :
stop buying and stop commenting on any piece of the paper : this seems the best way to bequeath the newspaper the irrelevance that , by its own actions , it deserves .
Maria Frô thinks that un-subscribing to the media group is not enough .
she has published a list of companies that advertise in the paper and invited readers to boycott them too :
in addition to un-subscribing to FOLHA / UOL , I propose that we boycott products and companies that advertise in this business group .
those who want to have their brand associated with a newspaper that practices anti-journalism do not deserve law-abiding citizens to continue consuming their services / products .
&quot; Folha helped the dictatorship .
un-subscribe to it !
Lauro Mesquita , from Guaciara blog , says the group seem to be pursuing their own bankruptcy :
we do not subscribe here to UOL or Folha and this is not just because of the threat against the blogger &#91; Arles &#93; .
if a newspaper deals with disagreementsis in a stupid manner like that , imagine how much worse their opinion about &#91; other &#93; things in the world must be .
the way it is going , by 2015 the media group will reach its goal of going out of print and their owners will only manage two fanzines and half a blog . I will not miss them at all .

Cuba : details of the Sánchez detention emerge
the detention , beating and subsequent release of bloggers Yoaní Sánchez , Claudia Cadelo and Orlando Luis Pardo by Cuban state security on November 6 , is receiving widespread coverage in both the mainstream media and the blogosphere and twittersphere .
Yoaní has written ( es ) about the incident on Generación Y , her blog , and English-language blogs like Babalú Blog , Repeating Islands and Uncommon Sense are following the story .
an audio interview ( es ) with Sánchez about the incident has been posted to YouTube .
Morocco : are Christians at Risk ?
in early March , observers watched as around 20 long-time Christian orphanage workers were expelled from the country they called home .
the incident , and others which followed it , have brought to light the debate surrounding Christianity in the Kingdom .
while the official Moroccan line is that 98.7-99 per cent of the population is Muslim ( the remainder being approximately 1 % Christian and 0.2 % Jewish ) , that statistic includes ethnic Europeans residing in Morocco .
proselytizing is illegal , as is conversion away from Islam .
still , foreign Christians are allowed to practice freely , and a number of churches , mostly from the era of French colonization , remain .
in contrast , the country &apos;s tiny Jewish population is almost entirely native , and is also allowed free practice of their faith .
despite guarantees of freedom , it would appear that the government is taking a stronger approach of late to proselytism , both real and perceived .
the Moroccan Dispatches shares a recent incident in which an Egyptian Catholic priest was expelled from the country :
Evangelicals have operated for years in Morocco , with their main purpose being the conversion of Muslims .
Catholics have operated for longer , but purposefully have not engaged in proselytizing .
so it came as a surprise that a Catholic priest was also detained and then exported during last week &apos;s crackdown .
the blogger shares a message he received from a Catholic priest working in Morocco :
on Sunday the 7th of March , five minutes before mass began ; the police in the city of Larache entered our friary and arrested one of our confrères , Rami Zaki , a young Egyptian friar still in initial formation who was spending a year with us .
he was ordered to go with the police , had no possibility to collect anything , and was given no explanation for his arrest …
… When Rami was put on the plane , his passport was taken from him and given to the pilot who later surrendered it with Rami to the police in Cairo .
he was detained by the police in Cairo for another seven hours for interrogation before he was permitted to telephone his community of friars .
from Sunday , the morning of his arrest , to Tuesday afternoon , when he was released – a total of more than 50 hours – Rami was deprived by the police in Morocco and Egypt of any of his human rights .
in another post , the blogger demonstrates that the public has joined in the crackdowns , citing a recent incident in which a cross was removed from its site of many years :
where a cross once hung in Meknés
this is the place where a cross used to hang in Meknes ’ medina .
the Catholics who teach Moroccans languages and career skills in this building do not engage in proselytism but have caught up in the anti-Christian sentiment following the recent expulsions of Christians .
last week , the cross was knocked down and beaten into pieces .
on a positive note , Moroccans who have benefited from their services have volunteered to reconstruct the cross .
in a more recent post , the same blogger assesses a TelQuel article on the situation , and says of it :
in the main article , it points out that most Moroccans convert to Christianity more as a result of Arabic media and not from foreign missionaries .
this jives with my experience : a number of Moroccans I know have had long conversations with Christian missionaries about religion and none have converted .
some defended Islam while smoking hashish just to piss off the Christians , it that gives you an idea of how many Moroccans understand their Islamic identity .
this observation about foreign missionaries , of course , undermines the rationale behind the recent expulsions of many foreigners .
to conclude , the blogger notes the recent media crackdowns and laments :
other media critical of the government have been shut down recently .
and the same could happen to Tel Quel .
but as long as they are still around , there will be at least some debate and critical thinking about current events .
South Africa : a New Era In The Fight Against AIDS ?
in late September Barbara Hogan was appointed as South Africa &apos;s new health minister by interim President Kgalema Motlanthe , ousting her controversial predecessor Manto Tshabalala-Msimang .
AIDS activists and many South Africans are hopeful that this move will signal a shift in the government &apos;s HIV / AIDS policies .
Hogan , a veteran anti-apartheid activist and a long-term ANC ( African National Congress ) member , was previously the chair of the finance portfolio committee .
since becoming health minister , she has broken from the former government &apos;s stance on HIV / AIDS and has
vowed to make AIDS a top priority .
this has caused excitement for many South Africans , who are hopeful that Hogan can strengthen the country &apos;s fight against HIV / AIDS by taking a more science-based approach to policymaking .
in this video AIDS activists celebrate Hogan &apos;s appointment .
in the past Hogan publicly criticized former President Thabo Mbeki &apos;s stance and policies on HIV / AIDS .
roughly 5.7 million people in South Africa are living with HIV and 350,000 people died of the disease last year ( almost 1,000 deaths a day ) .
Tshabalala-Msimang has also been blamed for inadequately responding to South Africa &apos;s HIV / AIDS problem .
the former health minister promoted beetroot , garlic , and other foods as treatment for HIV / AIDS , resulting in the nickname “ Dr. Beetroot , ” and has been accused of creating confusion about anti-retroviral drugs .
Stephen , posting on irreverence , calls Tshabalala-Msimang a national embarrassment and Hogan a glimmer of hope .
Ciaran Parker , blogging on Ciaran ’ s Peculier &#91; sic &#93; Blog , elaborates on Tshabalala-Msimang &apos;s unorthodox views :
“ Kgalema Motlanthe , while stating a desire to pursue continuity , has got rid of some of Mbeki ’ s more controversial ministers .
chief among these is Health Minister Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , the chief theoretician behind Mbeki ’ s AIDS denialist policies .
Mbeki ’ s government refused to accept the role the HIV virus has in the spread of AIDS , and his health minister stated that anti-retroviral drugs , which have been shown to have some effect in fighting the disease , were too expensive … Medical professionals working in the South African health service who publicly disagreed with the minister ’ s bizarre theories have been victimised . ”
earlier this week , at the opening of the International AIDS Vaccine 2008 conference in Cape Town , Hogan publicly declared that HIV does cause AIDS and should be treated with conventional medicine .
she also said the government was committed to scale-up mother-to-child prevention programs , therapies that prevent HIV-positive pregnant moms from passing on the disease , and that an effective HIV vaccine was desperately needed .
scientists , activists , and many bloggers have expressed relief and excitement following Hogan &apos;s address .
Haley , blogging on adventures as an ambassadorial scholar , says :
“ So most people I talk to find it – surprising – that democratically elected government officials , in today &apos;s world , would deny such ideas as … say … that HIV causes AIDS .
however , sadly in South Africa , that has been the case … . but no longer my friends , no longer . ”
Ray Hartley , posting on The Times , South Africa , blog adds :
“ ‘ We know that HIV causes AIDS . ’
with these words , the Health Minister , Barbara Hogan , ended an ignominious decade of Aids denial that has cost South Africa countless lives and has forced those with the virus to live in the shadows . ”
it &apos;s difficult to determine how many lives were impacted by previous HIV / AIDS policies , but the Treatment Action Campaign ( TAC ) says that over two million South Africans died of AIDS during Mbeki &apos;s presidency and at least 300,000 deaths could have been avoided if he had met basic constitutional requirements .
some bloggers say that both Mbeki and Tshabalala-Msimang have blood on their hands .
Soneka Kamuhuza , blogging on Things That Make You Go Mmmh ! , blames mostly Mbeki .
“ Their &#91; Mbeki and Tshabalala-Msimang &#93; intellectual apathy , targeted myopia and general dis-ingenuousness played dangerously to help continue the pandemic .
pushing holistic approaches , which when used singularly , cannot be an effective treatment for the virus , they battered their nation with their fortified and unified ignorance .
it is now estimated that South Africa has the world &apos;s highest numbers of people infected with HIV .
somehow , I see Mbeki &apos;s hand all over this … In a country rich with natural resources , he has cheated its most important resource , the people of an opportunity to make a critical head start in the fight against AIDS . ”
many hope that Hogan will reverse some of this damage .
a post on peripheries points out that many people expect that the period of politically-supported AIDS denialism in South Africa is over .
however , others remain cautious .
BillyC , commenting on a blog post on The Times , South Africa , says :
“ Barbara Hogan has a mountain to climb to reverse the almost terminal damage to health care on Manto ’ s watch .
staff competency , morale and levels as well as a slew of health policies and legislation all have to be addressed .
in addition the promotion of voodoo medicine and demonisation of western science is now deeply embedded in the national psyche .
it will take years of hard , courageous and diligent work to get us back to a health system that ’ s respected and effective .
we can only wish Barbara Hogan god speed .
she ’ s gonna need it . ”

Myanmar : Suu Kyi is free at last
she has been in prison for 15 years in the past 21 years , but now she is free at last .
Burmese pro-democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released from detention by the military-backed government of Myanmar Saturday afternoon , a week after the holding of a nationwide election which was dominated by pro-administration candidates .
the Democratic Voice of Burma was able to document the first few minutes of her release .
this video shows Suu Kyi waving to supporters in front of her lakeside house .
Aung SAN SUU KYI RELEASED from DVBTV English on Vimeo .
news spread out last Thursday that Suu Kyi will be freed this weekend on the date of expiration of her house arrest sentence .
it was reported that she has signed the paper for her release around 12pm on that day . even members of the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) , Suu Kyi &apos;s party , started cleaning the headquarter &apos;s secretariat office in anticipation of her release .
on Friday , there was a crowd of 500 or more people gathering in front of the NLD office in Yangon , all waiting for “ Aunty Su &apos;s ” release .
a banner in front of the headquarters reads “ Today &apos;s the Day of Her Release “ .
more than 100 NLD members and supporters also donated blood at a local hospital to draw attention to her release .
Suu Kyi &apos;s impending freedom was later doubted when the Burmese top court rejected her final appeal against her house arrest this Friday , making the people anxious whether she will be released or not .
meanwhile , Kim Aris , Aung San Su Kyi &apos;s son reportedly has gotten his visa approved to visit Myanmar .
now that Suu Kyi is free at last , independent media site The Irrawaddy urges its readers to submit suggestions and other ideas to Suu Kyi
the world rejoiced when Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize winner , was freed from house arrest .
Twitter users used the hashtag # aungsansuukyi as they joined the global conversation in celebrating Suu Kyi &apos;s freedom .
Pakistan : what Did ISI Know About Laden ?
faheem Haider at Pakistan Foreign Policy Blog questions what the Pakistani Military and Intelligence Service knew about the top terror Osama Bin Laden , who was intercepted and killed in Abbottabad , near the Pakistan capital .
Sudan : is ICT all it &apos;s cracked up to be ?
according to Laurence Clarke , who heads the World Bank &apos;s program in the country and was interviewed for the article , the failure was not due to a lack of equipment or support .
instead , the problem is a lack of will :
Laurence Clarke , head of the bank &apos;s south Sudan programme , explains that fund money was used to buy computers , software and equipment for satellite links in Juba , the south &apos;s threadbare capital .
but then “ all kinds of problems came up , ” he says … .
“ Some of the ministers apparently decided they were too old to learn to use a computer , and so they showed no enthusiasm . ” In some cases even their younger assistants did not know how to log on .
“ So the system is lying there … moribund , ” Mr Clarke says .
the recent surge in availability of mobile phones and Internet access in Africa has prompted considerable enthusiasm regarding the use of these technologies for everything from marketing and e-commerce to tracking crop diseases and reminding HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis patients to take their medicine .
but the news from Southern Sudan forces the question : is the hype surrounding information and communication technology ( ICT ) justified ?
and how can those of us who work in this field make sure that our efforts don &apos;t result in moribundity ?
as a researcher for the Technology for Transparency Network , I &apos;m particularly interested in the way that ICT can help engage citizens in the governance of their country and encourage governments to be both transparent and accountable .
many projects are successfully using technology for transparency ; David Sasaki &apos;s recent review of the network &apos;s first eight case studies shows as much .
but , as the situation in Juba shows , technology does not magically lead toward better governance .
Sudanese blogger and Global Voices author Drima believes that Internet and mobile phones are not enough .
“ ICT is merely that , a technology .
its real usefulness is ultimately something that can only be realized if the users utilize such technology skillfully towards a good goal , ” he writes in an e-mail .
if technology is to have an impact , Drima says , support must come not only from donors , but from within :
“ When it comes to attitudes and goals , this is something the Southern Sudanese need to fix .
and before we can even get into this whole idea of ICT as some kind of ‘ silver bullet ’ we really need to address many underlying concerns , beginning with corrupt leadership and destructive tribalism . ”
as Sudan moves towards elections in April , technology has the potential to play a major role in both engaging citizens and in monitoring the political process .
Sudan Votes
Sudan Vote Monitor , led by the Sudan Institute for Research and Policy , plans to use Ushahidi to enable citizens to monitor and report on the elections .
Sudan Vote Monitor
in an election where “ many citizens are unfamiliar with basic election processes , are opposed to multi-party competition and have doubts about whether the vote will be fair , ” these projects may play critical roles in educating people and documenting possible problems with the voting process .
in order to be successful , however , they must first find a way to convince citizens of their usefulness .
both Sudan Votes and Sudan Vote Monitor appear to have substantial Sudanese involvement at the ground level , which may help them succeed where the World Bank program has failed .
as the elections loom nearer , I &apos;ll be watching closely to see how these organizations unfold .
will they fall flat , ignored and unused by Sudanese citizens ?
or will they manage to translate technology into true civic engagement ?
Brazil : do banks have metal or melanin detector doors ?
on the eve of Brazil &apos;s Black Pride Day – celebrated on November 20th , when the country renews its ongoing fight against discrimination – the Circo Voador Audiovisual Collective did an experiment .
they filmed two members of their group , of apparently the same age and dressed similarly , trying to enter the same bank at two different moments , carrying the very same bag filled with metal – keys , coins , mobile phone .
one of them took a few seconds to get in with no issues at all ; the other one could not get in , barred at the revolving door , a regular feature in many Brazilian banks .
the first guy was white , the second , black .
see the result :
according to the filmmakers , the experiment showed that the metal detector doors are in fact activated by the banks ’ security guards .
in other words , the security method currently employed by banks is based on their personnel &apos;s pre-judgment , often plagued with preconceptions , stereotypes and discrimination against certain types of people .
on their blog , Circo Voador &#91; Flying Circus , pt &#93; invites readers to join forces , sending their own videos of as many different banks as possible .
they explain the experiment :
there are several people around the bag in the first scene .
they all took the test carrying the same bag , some of them were barred others were not .
nobody ever changed the bag &apos;s contents .
we have chose to include the scene we shot with MC Shackal not because he &apos;s black but because we used a hidden camera and when we shot him , there were no external interferences , such as cars or people standing in front of the camera .
many people reacted on the Circo Voador blog &apos;s comment box .
some of the readers shared similar experiences , such as Dona Biologia , a teacher :
I put keys , mobile phone , coin purse at the indicated place and the door set the alarm off and locked .
finally , the guy called a pseudo manager who went through the door and , inside the bank &apos;s ATM , he made me open my bag of &#91; students &#93; essays and when he found nothing to justify &#91; his attitude &#93; , he had the audacity to say it was my pencil case .
I still regret not having sued the bank for the constraint .
Christiano J. Jabur , who was once barred at a metal detector door in São Paulo because of a digital camera , claims that discrimination against people in the same revolving doors happens in banks regardless of the colour of the skin :
I had to put &#91; the camera &#93; in a box in order to go inside the bank .
but an elderly woman , also white , tried to enter a Nossa Caixa branch in the same city and was barred and could not get in at all , even after calling the police .
the bank insinuated she could have been a criminal , because there are many people over 50 to 60 years committing crimes nowadays ( which is actually true ) .
I will not say that bank security guards and attendants have no prejudice against black and brown people .
but to say that black people are the only ones to be barred by revolving doors is a lie .
on the other hand , a security guard called Leandro explains in the same comment box how the system works , and criticizes the way the video has been interpreted by some :
I know that it was not your intention , I have read what you are proposing and I fully support it , but it is not being circulating this way , other websites and media have published bits and pieces of half information … I have myself received an email with the subject line : “ Racist security guards ? ”
the video has gone viral on the blogosphere too .
Rafael Cesar says that whether the doors shut on white or black people is besides the point :
the point is that we know that a metal detector , more than anything else , is just an excuse for the security guards in charge to use their own judgment the way they see fit .
the doors are locked , in fact , by the litlle remote control they carry .
for me it &apos;s a habit , with no exaggeration , to go through that shit without any metal in my backpack ( I have even left a case in the box next to it because of a pencil sharpener ) and I get stuck .
in other words : what they detect in me every now and then is a potential thief , because several times there was no metal to be detected .
if I was carrying no metal , why did ‘ the door ’ locked ?
and if I am carrying metal , why is it that soon after ‘ the door ’ unlocks ?
as the security measure is filtered through the eyes of security guards , of course the black guy is worse off .
the same way he is worse off with the police , in employment , etc …
Helio Ventura takes the opportunity to republish a text written in March 2007 asking if revolving doors detected metal or melanin after a black customer was killed inside the bank in Rio de Janeiro :
black micro-entrepreneur Jonas Eduardo Santos de Souza , 34 years old , was queuing up at branch of an Itaú bank in Rio Branco , of which he had been a customer for 10 years , for routine transactions .
but he was the victim of the racism that continues to exist in our country , despite the denial it exists which comes from many sections of the elite and intelligentsia .
he was killed with a shot to the chest by Natalício Marins de Souza , 29 , a security guard at the branch .
when trying to enter the branch , Jonas was stopped by the well known and embarrassing revolving door .
he was approached by Natalício and forced to put all his objects in a tray .
as the door was still locked , Jonas was forced to take even his belt off .
Natalicio called the manager , who only authorized the young micro-business owner to get in after requiring that Jonas proved he was a branch &apos;s client , showing his bank card .
after the embarrassment , inside the bank , Jonas and Natalício continued to argue until the security guard , showing total unpreparedness for the job , took out his gun and killed Jonas , who had no chance to defend himself .
we could just be siding with Natalicio , also black , a family father who had had no opportunity to find a profession that could provide better conditions for his 5 year old daughter , being forced to apply only for jobs that required lesser qualifications , such as security guard .
he too was hit by the structural racism that plagues this country .
this does not change the fact that he acted wrongly : he is a murderer and should receive the penalties provided by law .
and also being black does not mitigate the crime .
but it does make us wonder : what system is this that puts two likes on opposite sides , causing one to claim the life of the other ?
how much longer will events like this happen ?
we realize how wicked this “ Brazilian racism ” is , a quiet policy of extermination , disguised as a social risk and fatality .
Andréia Freitas , who once managed to get undisturbed inside a bank with a kitchen knife she had bought earlier on in the day , says that the sad conclusion is that people only see each others ’ surfaces :
why is it that bank robberies are increasingly being carried out by men wearing suits and ties ?
why is it that nowadays there are cars being stolen inside parking lots and the robbers arrive there driving imported car ?
scam in luxury hotels , designer shops , five stars restaurants …
the answer is obvious : the world is moved by “ appearances ” !
yes … if you are considered a “ handsome ” person , life is easier for you in all aspects .
now … if you &apos;re not as “ well dressed ” , or have had a bad hair day , or your shoes are a little worn out , you can bet that life will not be a piece of cake for you .
human beings see appearances !
if the doors of the banks were actually controlled by a machine , an electronic security device , the two guys of the YouTube video would had been barred !
and nothing more fair than barring the TWO OF THEM , as they were both carrying metal objects .
an online petiton launched with the experiment demanding that Brazilian banks stop using revolving doors and invest in x-ray systems or safety equipment that shows customers ’ real belongings has been signed by over 2,000 people so far .
over all , the plea is that everyone is treated with respect by the banks .
Yoaní Sanchez &amp; other Cuban bloggers detained , beaten
on the evening of November 6 , Babalú blog linked to a post by Penultimos Dias ( es ) reporting that a number of prominent Cuban bloggers , including Yoaní Sánchez and Global Voices contributor Claudia Cadelo , were detained by state security forces .
an update from Penultimos Días reported that Sanchez and Orlando Luis Pardo were “ verbally abused and severely beaten ” .
Thailand : Texting Troubles for the Prime Minister
on December 18 , 2008 , millions of Thai mobile phone subscribers got this text message from the newly installed Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva :
“ I , the new Prime Minister , invites you to bring Thailand out of the crisis .
interested to get contact from me , please send your 5-digits postcode to the number 9191 ( 3 Baht ) ”
if a subscriber replies , a sound clip of PM Abhisit will be delivered to subscriber &apos;s phone , saying :
“ I , Abhisit Vejjajiva , the Prime Minister , realized that you fellow citizens are suffering , and are under stress .
therefore , I &apos;ll concentrate in exerting all my knowledge and ability to help the country .
but I can &apos;t succeed if Thai people are not together in harmony .
so I beg you all a chance . ”
SMS from the PM
according to Democrat Party officer , the text messaging was an idea of Abhisit himself , and was coordinated by Korn Chatikavanij , the country &apos;s Finance Minister .
Korn allegedly called Thailand &apos;s three major mobile phone operators , AIS , DTAC , and True , for a cooperation to send out the message to their subscribers .
the meeting for cooperation was held in December 16 , one day before Abhisit Vejjajiva got officially appointed to be the Prime Minister .
and the reason for requesting for 5-digits postcode is to evaluate the demographic of those who replied .
the subscribers will then be listed in a database .
sending a text message to a person without the person &apos;s consent is considered a violation of a consumer &apos;s privacy rights , said consumer rights advocate Saree Ongsomwang .
she said Abhisit should opt to keep contacts with the people via television and other public communication outlets in order to avoid infringing on the consumer &apos;s rights .
Saree , who is also part of the committee of the Telecommunication Consumer Protection Institute , added that under Thai telecommunication law , mobile phone operators are not allowed to release the list of subscribers without their consent .
when the three mobile operators sent the controversial text message to their subscribers , free of charge , in behalf of the Prime Minister or the Democrat Party , it brought some legal and political complications .
under the 1999 Anti-Corruption Law ( amended 2007 ) , state officers , including cabinet members , cannot receive any gift or benefit that is worth more than 3,000 Baht .
it is estimated that the sending of the Prime Minister &apos;s text message cost more than 10 million Baht .
Abhisit could be charged in the courts , as argued by Pheu Thai Party spokesman Prompong Nopparit , urging the National Anti-Corruption Commission ( NACC ) to investigate the case .
if Abhisit and Korn are found guilty , they will be impeached and suspended from holding any political position in accordance with the Constitution .
comments in the Internet were quite mixed at that time .
in general , many agreed that this may be a violation of privacy and personal data , and the Prime Minister doing too much PR on media .
but at the same time they feel that if it &apos;s a good intention , it should be ok , and he should have a chance to work for the country .
some comments from Yahoo !
answers :
non noN : “ I think it &apos;s a popular survey , as it requested a post code .
so they can know which districts , which provinces , that reply back and can evaluate the situation .
I personally think it &apos;s good and want to see harmony in every area of Thailand . ”
Nicky : “ Who get that 3 baht ?
can I opt-out ?
my memory is nearly full .
old model . ”
‘ A-Mei &apos; : “ I think it &apos;s too much marketing . ”
Tanapon : “ Yes , it &apos;s too much .
but we should give him a chance , to prove himself by his work .
it &apos;s better than we fighting each other . ”
NH : “ I think if it &apos;s a good thinking , the result will be good . ”
on July 16 , 2010 , NACC has again postponed its ruling on the case , and did not yet set a date for the handing down of the final decision .
as Liberia stabilizes , youth begin to talk about sex
“ I want all other children born in Liberia- and the world- to lead full lives free of pain and filled with the blossoms of love , like mine , ” writes Mahmud Johnson at the blog for the youth-oriented HIV / AIDS group Global 40 Forum .
he is an 18-year old former co-host of the Liberian youth radio show , “ Let ’ s Talk About Sex ” , which deals with issues relating to the spread of HIV / AIDS and pregnancy prevention .
Liberia is gradually transitioning from the nearly 15 years of intermittent civil war that ended in 2003 and moving towards mainstream development .
the barriers that remain are great .
nearly 250,000 people were killed during the war , and several hundred thousand were exiled in neighboring countries or in Europe or the United States .
the effects of war on youth
the effects of the war on children are well documented .
when the fighting began , different military groups searched for soldiers in the ranks of children .
perhaps as many as 20,000 children , some as young as 6-years-old , were recruited , often forcibly .
“ They were forced to kill friends and family members including their parents , rape and be raped , serve as sexual slaves and prostitutes , labor , take drugs , engage in cannibalism , torture and pillage communities , ” says the report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia .
women and girls also suffered greatly .
Liberia ’ s TRC received nearly 7,000 reported cases of sexual violence .
girls and women aged 15 – 19 make a majority of those reported cases .
despite seven years of peace , bad news can still cascade out of Liberia like a waterfall .
three out of four Liberians live on less than one dollar a day ; only half the country &apos;s children attend school ; Fifty percent of households in the capital Monrovia are classified as food secure .
the economic prognosis remains bleak and repatriating young people – some of them former child soldiers – into the economy continues to cause the government problems .
this can be especially troubling because half of Liberia ’ s population is under 20 .
on the Ceasefire Liberia blog , a Rising Voices project , Stephen R. Johnson writes :
Liberia ’ s youth face many challenges in gaining an education that delivers them the right set of skills and knowledge to become productive in today ’ s labor market .
as a result , the transition from school to work is more often than not unsuccessful and youth end up either unemployed or underemployed in the rural , suburban and urban informal sectors .
yet , the country and its people are determined to put the past behind them .
the country ’ s economy has been growing and the government is modernizing its infrastructure .
groups like the YMCA have been training ex-combatants for employment or to start their own businesses .
poverty and tough decisions
however , the continuing economic problems have created a ripple effect in other areas .
poverty has forced many women into making difficult and dangerous decisions regarding their sex life , says Jerry B. Tarbolo Jr , from the Federation of Liberian Youth .
he said this combination has helped intensify the HIV / AIDS transmission rate in Liberia ’ s urban areas .
if this continues , the disease will mainly affect the younger generation , he says , which is one of Liberia ’ s great resources .
the connection between economic survival and sexual violence has a legacy in Liberia .
a 2008 UNFPA study of women in Liberia ’ s Lofa County found that during the war , nine out of ten women had lost their livelihoods , 96 percent had lost shelter and nearly 75 percent had lost a relative .
more than half of the women were victims of sexual violence , and of those women , half of them reported providing sex for some form of favors .
misconceptions of HIV / AIDS
Pauline Wleh , a nurse counselor at a Monrovia-based YMCA Youth Centre , says one thing young Liberians today need is education regarding sexual health .
she spoke to a writer for Merlin , an international NGO that builds health services in fragile states .
“ Years of conflict here disrupted our formal schooling system and broke up health services so that youths today know very little about HIV and AIDS .
because of the lack of knowledge , there is a lot of stigma and misconceptions surrounding AIDS now .
youths are too scared to talk to their parents and there is a lack of accessible information .
but they can discretely drop in on me between basketball games or after a trip to the computer lab to ask questions , access services and get advice . ”
she says some changes in attitudes have become apparent .
“ In the two years since the centre opened , I have seen thousands of young people but only given 291 HIV tests .
although people are keen to talk to me , they are rarely convinced to take an HIV test because they are scared . ”
the majority who opt out of the testing , claim they will ‘ come back later , ’ or more honestly ‘ don ’ t want to know my status , because I don ’ t want to worry . ’
the fight for awareness
this social avoidance is what programs like “ Let ’ s Talk About Sex ” are designed to educate against .
the weekly 30-minute show , funded in part by UNFPA , provides listeners with 30 minutes of information and conversation about sex and reproductive health issues , all tailored toward young people .
each program is researched and written by the four young hosts , who control all the programming , including research , writing and performing each episode .
“ My work as co-host of the LTAS show gave me a working knowledge on the actual realities faced by my fellow Liberian youth in the fight against HIV , ” Mahmud Johnson writes .
he says you can ’ t separate Liberia ’ s economic problems from issues regarding sexual health .
as the show ’ s outreach team usually traveled to leeward communities and villages to teach the youth there about HIV , I became aware , first hand , of the economic and traditional issues many people are faced with , and how those issues contribute to the spread of HIV in Liberia .
I also became aware of some bizarre myths young people harbor on HIV spread and treatment .
a very huge percentage of the youth population in Liberia has practically no knowledge about the transmission and prevention of HIV , and this phenomenon is due in no small part to the country ’ s spiralling illiteracy rate .
even the youth who go to school have minimal information about HIV , as such reproductive health issues are not taught in Liberian schools .
hence , many myths abound amongst Liberian youth about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections , prominent amongst which is the myth that smoking pot prevents HIV infection .
because of these potentially dangerous myths , the radio show ’ s team developed a ‘ Myths vs. Reality ’ segment , in which ( in colloquial Liberian language ) we addressed several of those myths on a weekly basis .
the show offers a useful medium for young people to learn about the virus .
and , of course , talk about sex .
today , the LTAS radio show is aired all over Liberia , and uses other reinforcement channels such as brochures , dramas , road shows , focus groups discussions , and peer training to spread the message about HIV transmission and pregnancy prevention .
the show is so popular that the Liberian populace have even used the show to coin a joke in response to the recent shortage of chicken eggs on the Liberian market : chickens in Liberia now listen to ‘ Let ’ s Talk About Sex ! ’ and practice safe sex !
I am aware of the reality that not every single youth in Liberia will heed the health messages disseminated on the show .
but even if one person ’ s life is changed in the process , that would a phenomenal success for me as a pioneer host on the LTAS show .
Congo Brazzaville : disappointment at Presidential election
on Sunday July 12th , people in the Republic of the Congo voted in an election which opposition leaders boycotted over allegations it would be neither free nor fair .
Denis Sassou N ’ Guesso , who has ruled the Congo for about 25 years as head of state , is seeking another seven year term in power .
despite protests from the opposition , election observers said the voting was peaceful , and that voter turnout was low .
according to the main opposition , “ 90 per cent ” of the country ’ s electorate did not go to the polls .
outgoing President Denis Sassou N ’ Guesso and his Rassemblement de la majorité présidentielle ( RMP ) is widely tipped to win the elections as the country ’ s electoral commission prepares to announce the results anytime from Monday evening .
a BBC correspondent reportedly witnessed “ money being handed out at a polling station in the south of the capital , to people who later said they had been asked to vote for Mr Sassou-Nguesso . ”
one election observer , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Agence France Presse , “ There are more observers than voters . ”
at the French news site France 24 , a few commenters from Congo have expressed their opinions on the election .
below is a selection of a few of them :
Maloumbi on voter intimidation :
in certain villages and districts people voted for Sassou Nguesso because of intimidation .
my brother Jean Ibinga in the Nyanga district received 1 000 000 cfa &#91; $ USD1 800 &#93; from a member of the RMP to convince elderly people to go vote by giving them average amounts of 2500 cfa &#91; $ USD4.5 &#93; .
the elections didn &apos;t take place in an acceptable manner , and certain prefects and deputies intimidated the population to vote for their ruler Sassou .
for me this was an election with results that were known ahead of time .
I &apos;m asking the international community to declare the July 12th elections invalid and to force Sassou to form a national government capable of debating the country affairs , otherwise there &apos;s going to be a war in the future .
the current opposition is preparing for a possible war .
Yoka from Pointe Noire on the low turnout :
I &apos;m Congolese and I reside in Pointe Noire ( the economic capital of Congo and the second city of the country ) .
I can tell you that the polling stations remained empty from morning to evening .
the inhabitants of Pointe Noire are tired of the promises of Mr Sassou while this city that extracts the oil that is the first richness in the country .
more than 95 % of Congolese haven &apos;t voted .
it &apos;s a reality tha the brutal and absurd regime in Brazzaville has to recognize .
because of that his regime is illegitimate .
the Congolese from the North , the South , the East and the West have said NO to Sassou .
an anonymous commenter from Kinshasa , in the other Congo , wondered :
can one cheat with only a 15 % of voter turnout who , if we follow the reports , were only supporters of the candidate Sassou , with the others opting for boycotting the election ?
l &apos;Africaniste :
yes everything is perfect !
yes Sassou stays in power !
yes he didn &apos;t make the Congo into paradise ?
but what did the opposition do ?
what project proposal did the Congolese opposition offer to the people ?
nothing besides the boycott !
which is nothing but a cue for Sassou to win .
so thank you gentlemen in the opposition for helping Sassou to win without any difficulty .
stop the noise about nothing but to distract the people !
brazza-brazza on the peaceful election :
phoney election , but we have peace .
the peace of the poverty-stricken .
like Bongo , Sassou will be in power for more than two generations .
it &apos;s normal ; we have peace .
the peace of the submissive .
Sassou plunders the Congo .
but we have peace .
the peace of the famished .
we live in the shit .
but we have peace .
peace is more valuable than dignity .
all of you abroad have no idea how much peace is worth it .
I agree with you that peace allows Sassou to plunder .
so what ?
it &apos;s normal to be plundered .
he &apos;s African and he &apos;s a dictator who has phoney elections to stay a dictator .
at the Libération website Yanice 18 brought up Obama &apos;s recent speech in Ghana :
only yesterday Obama held a very good speech about good governance and democracy , today another African autocrat is preparing to renew his bail on power for yet another 7 years in spite of his judicial setbacks about his real estate in France .
seeing this president &apos;s longevity in power , 25 years , it looks like Obama preached in the desert .
and Saboun added :
reelection of Sassou Nguesso , no surprise .
I don &apos;t know if you noticed , Obama didn &apos;t mention any Francophone country in Africa in his speech .
is this purely a coincidence ?
I doubt it .
Iran : where Is My Classmate ?
several empty chairs in Iran &apos;s universities were formerly occupied by students who have now vanished .
some are deprived of education for religious reasons , such as members of the persecuted Baha &apos;i religious minority , others have been jailed for political activities , killed in the street , or forced to leave Iran .
in the best of circumstances , students have merely been expelled .
this year Tahkim Vahdat , a leading student protest group , called for an “ Empty Seat Campaign ” , all over the world , on December 7 , Iran &apos;s student day , to remember the victims of lost hope for the wish to be educated .
a Facebook page was launched , and several films were shared on YouTube to display solidarity with departed and repressed students in Iran .
here are three of them .

Fouad Shihab , 10 friends on board : “ I was meant to be on that plane and look what happened .
all my friends are dead . ”
in an earlier tweet , he writes :
just returned from Rafiq Hariri airport , scenes there are terrible .
no information , spoke with people who have lost entire family
Hichame Assi ( @ hiconomics ) writes :
very sad to hear about # ET409 … I hope it &apos;s as painless as possible to all family and friends .
Allah Yer7am ( May God have mercy on them )
Georges Azzi , who has been following the coverage on television , wasn &apos;t impressed and tweeted :
Lebanon : too many TV Stations = too much airtime # et409 # coverage switching into sensational and fictional mode # fail
Samer , who tweets @ meetsamer , also expressed outrage at Lebanese media saying :
Lebanese media has no decency or any sense of ethics , they &apos;re already referring to the missing ppl as “ dead ” # ET409 # Lebanon
Amer Tabsh ( @ arzleb ) shares similar sentiments and writes :
LBC ( Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation ) analysis of the # ET409 is very stupid and wrongful # fail
he also shares the hotline number for information and inquires on the crash :
hotline 71207326 for info &amp; inquiries by the Victims families / Hotline 1701 to inform of any wreckage of bodies sighting # ET409 # Lebanon
meanwhile , Tala is shaken by the news and tweets :
25 bodies have been taken out of the water , 2 of them were children .
and they hardly identify any of them .
CNN &apos;s Cal Perry was also tweeting and in one message says :
such a sad day # et409 – tomorrow we &apos;ll try to get down to the beach .
tonight &apos;s piece from the airport .
PM Hariri trying his best to console
Nathan Redd is in agony and writes :
I seriously cannot concentrate on anything today .
# ET409 is the only thing on my mind today .
my heart is broken .
and @ nightS sums up the day saying :
Palestine : Gaza Under Attack – Again
throughout the night of March 9 and into the morning of March 10 , 2012 , Israeli warplanes attacked targets across the Gaza Strip , with a death toll of at least 12 , and 20 injured .
on the afternoon of March 9 , Zuheir al-Qaysi , secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees ( PRC ) , was assassinated during an Israeli raid on Gaza City , along with his assistant Abu Ahmad Hanani .
Hanani was originally from Nablus and was deported to Gaza as one of the prisoners freed in the prisoner swap deal a few months ago .
in retaliation , Palestinian resistance groups in the Gaza Strip fired rockets into Israel , with no casualties .
Israel came back with severe airstrikes that shook Gaza and left 12 martyrs altogether , identified by Ma &apos;an News Agency as Muhammad al-Ghamry , Fayiq Saad , Muatasim Hajjaj , Ubeid Gharabli , Muhammad Hararah , Hazim Qureiqi , Shadi Sayqali , Zuheir al-Qaysi , Mahmoud Hanani , Muhammad Maghari , Mahmoud Najim , and Ahmad Hajjaj .
some reports are now saying that 15 people have died .

Gaza &apos;s netizens have responded to the attacks on Twitter :
@ MaathMusleh : 15 were murdered in Gaza till now , No WORRIES they &apos;re just Palestinians ! !
# GazaUnderAttack
@ ectomorfo : pray for the people of Gaza .
no lights , little medicine , no gas .
and now they &apos;re being bombarded from all sides by # Israel .
# GazaUnderAttack
@ Omar _ Gaza : 18 minutes with no explosions !
cautious silence ?
is it over ?
or should I keep holding my breath ?
# GazaMassacre # GazaUnderAttack
@ najlashawa : I dont know how i am still typing that was LOUD !
# GAzaUnderAttack
@ imNadZ : welcome to # Gaza .
where sunshine is explosions .
where birds are F16s .
this attack comes at a time of shifting regional and political alliances .
last week , in light of increasing prospects of an American-Israeli war on Iran , two top Hamas officials announced that Hamas would not get involved and support Iran in case of an Israeli attack .
Hamas has also declared its support of the Syrian people in their struggle against Assad .
Greece : outcry over arms shipment to Israel
with the war raging in Gaza , news reports earlier this month about the routing of an extraordinarily large shipment of arms from the United States to Israel through the private Greek port of Astakos caused an uproar among Greek bloggers .
they used Twitter to investigate the matter and put pressure on the government to halt the transfer .
delivery of the munitions was suspended , just as the Greek government was coming under fire from opposition parties , and Amnesty International was calling for an arms embargo .
at first , official sources contested the story from the international news agency Reuters on January 9 .
but it was picked up by Twitter users and investigated after Indy.gr – an offshoot of the Indymedia Athens group – provided a translation of the article in Greek .
the idea to organize an embargo of the port was proposed and widely “ re-tweeted ” :
itsomp : http : / / is.gd / f8Wa Can we organise an embargo of the port of Astakos ?
only the US and Israeli ships …
some tweeted direct queries to the Greek foreign minister , whose web team is operating a Twitter account :
Dora Bakoyannis , what &apos;s going on with the Astakos shipment ?
we don &apos;t want Greece to become embroiled in the Gaza massacre
breaking with earlier practice not to converse through Twitter , the minister &apos;s team responded directly :
the link led to an official ministry statement stating that shipping of arms through Astakos or other Greek ports is a “ non-issue ” and vaguely denying press reports to the opposite .
however , blogger Odysseas had by then located the solicitation for the shipment on a US federal website :
in the following link you &apos;ll find the US Navy note about the shipment of munitions from the port of Astakos to Ashdod , Israel .
the cargo exists and is awaiting a transport contractor
and Twitter users kept up the pressure , despite the official denial :
Dora Bakoyannis , what &apos;s with the &#91; solicitation &#93; webpage , then ?
the next day , news media reported that the shipment transfer had been canceled .
the transfer of munitions via Astakos was canceled because of the Gaza conflict !
blogger magicasland.com summarized the outcome :
an APE &#91; Greek news agency &#93; bulletin today mentions that the transfer of the 325 containers of munitions shipment from Astakos to the port of Ashdod was cancelled .
&#91; .. &#93; It &apos;s certain that the shipment will be transferred at some point ; just as long as it isn &apos;t now and from here .
blogger coolplatanos investigated further , discovering an additional arms shipment solicitation , and verifying that the original solicitation was cancelled :
… there was also a previous solicitation with a contract award date of December 6 , 2008 ( first published December , 4 ) , again by the US Navy .
this is another munitions solicitation , for a bigger load this time , since a vessel with a minimum carrying capacity of 989 TEUs was requested .
in any case , today January 13 &#91; 09 : 00 EST &#93; , the solicitation page for the 325 TEU vessel was updated as “ cancelled for the time being ” .
I looked up the above solicitations by improvising on Google search
Sudan : “ Police Denies Use of Bullets ; All Injuries are Imaginary ”
Sudanese officials are repeating the all too familiar ‘ lies ’ Arab officials have been telling us since the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring in December 2010 .
protests are contained , they say , in citizens attacking policemen , who retaliate in self-defense , goes the story .
Sudan is the latest country to join the massive protest movement that saw the toppling of Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali of Tunisia in January 2011 and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt the following month .
Libya &apos;s Muammar Gaddafi was also captured and later on killed by an angry mob in October 2011 .
Arab governments are keen in limiting their loss to those three dictators by conducting a massive crackdown on political dissent and an unprecedented killing spree against their revolting people .
Sudanese officials are now repeating the same lines we heard from all Arab officials , whose reigns are troubled by angry people they have continued to rule with an iron fist and oppress for decades .
protests broke out at Khartoum University on June 17 , when hundreds of students denounced the government ’ s planned austerity measures .
the protests were met with police brutality and arrests , fueling more anger and protests the following days .
Mimz reacts to how the official Sudanese News Agency ( SUNA ) covered the news .
she tweets :
@ MimzicalMimz : SUNA says protests yesterday were ‘ limited &apos; .
just the fact that protests were acknowledged conveys the magnitude of # SudanRevolts
Egyptian journalist Salma Elwardany , who is in Khartoum , sums up the coverage .
@ S _ Elwardany : a summary of SUNA &apos;s official coverage of the news yesterday : citizens attacked the police , who were forced to use tear gas
she quotes the coverage saying :
@ S _ Elwardany : the Police call upon citizens not to pay attention to rumours aimed at destabilizing security and the destruction of property .
it also calls on citizens to cooperate with the police in carrying out their duties
and she adds :
@ S _ Elwardany : the police denies in its statement last night the use of rubber or live bullets .
right !
the injuries last night were a figment of our imagination
Yousif Elmahdi confirms :
@ Usiful _ ME : then , i must have imagined being close by guy being shot in leg by rubber bullet &amp; another thrown off moving pick-up
netizens are now watching Sudan closely , following rumours that the Sudanese authorities intend to cut off the Internet – a chilling reminder of Egypt &apos;s attempt to silence activists and contain the January 25 revolution when it pulled the plug off the www on January 27 .
the US Embassy in Khartoum Twitter account stated today :
@ USembassykrt : Internet access and possibly cell phones may be disrupted or limited in Sudan due to the protests and demonstrations in the capital city .
the internet and the rise of social media , and not dictatorship , injustice and lack of human rights , are blamed for fueling the Arab Spring .
meanwhile , Arab regimes seem to be immune to learning from experience .
Pakistan : 11-Year-Old Christian Girl Detained for Blasphemy
an 11-year old Christian girl , Rimsha Masih has been accused of blasphemy and has been remanded for 14 days to a juvenile prison in the twin city of the Pakistan capital , Rawalpindi .
there are conflicting reports on whether she has Downs Syndrome or not .
Rimsha is accused of burning pages of Noorani Qaida , an Arabic learning lesson for beginners , and putting them in a plastic bag .
the incident happened on August 16 , 2012 in the slum Meherabadi in G-12 , Islamabad where she lives with her family .
a local police station filed a First Information Report ( FIR ) after a neighbor made a formal complaint against her .
the blasphemy offence comes under Article 295-B of the Pakistan Penal Code and the offender can get life imprisonment or a death sentence .
the news was taken up by a website ‘ Christians in Pakistan ’ on August 18 .
the report became big news on Pakistan &apos;s mainstream media five days later on August 22 .
prior to her arrest some locals of the area blocked a main highway in the capital .
the mob apparently wanted to do the justice themselves .
last month a mob burnt a mentally unstable man in Bahwalpur ; the man was also accused of blasphemy .
Pakistan &apos;s Minister for National Harmony , Dr. Paul Bhatti , said in an interview to BBC world service that 600 Christians have fled their homes in Islamabad after the 11-year old was arrested for blasphemy .
the Christians are afraid and are hiding ; the memories of 2009 Gojra attack are still fresh in their minds when a Muslim mob burnt houses of Christians and police didn ’ t come to help them .
according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , the Gojra riots were pre-planned and the local administration was involved .
Anthony Permal a Pakistani Christian based in the UAE brought tweeter users attention to this story :
‏ @ anthonypermal : Confirmed- Police in # Pakistan have arrested an 11 year old Christian girl suffering from Downs Syndrome for blasphemy .
soon an online petition was circulated for asylum of Rimsha :
@ MohsinSayeed ( Mohsin Sayeed ) : raise your voice to save lives of Rifta &amp; her family .
escape to a secular country is the only option .
they will kill her : http : / / www.change.org / petitions / high-commissions-and-diplomats-of-secular-western-nations-asylum-to-the-family-of-11-year-old-christian-girl-accused-of-blasphemy # …
the online petition requests the secular western countries to provide asylum of Rimsha ’ s family :
Pakistanis of good conscious are signing this petition because the State of Pakistan even failed to protect their own Governor who spoke out against the draconian blasphemy law , where mere accusation of blasphemy will ensure Jail and perhaps worse for the accused .
there is another petition that is calling on Pakistan ’ s Minister of Human Rights and the government to protect and release Rimsha Masih .
meanwhile , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari called on officials to explain the situation to him .
the Pakistani Ambassador to the USA tweets :
‏ @ sherryrehman : Pres Zardari has taken serious note of reports of the arrest of a minor Christian girl on the charges of blasphemy &amp; called for a report .
Amnesty International urges Pakistan to reform Blasphemy laws :
‏ @ amnesty ( Amnesty International ) : # Pakistan must ensure safety of Christian girl arrested for ‘ blasphemy ’ whose life is at risk http : / / owl.li / d9aPc
France ’ s foreign ministry has called the Pakistani authorities to free the young girl .
Irshad Manji , Muslim Feminist and author of ‘ Allah , Liberty and Love ’ condemned Pakistan ’ s blasphemy law .
‏ @ IrshadManji : my @ RFI _ English interview about # Pakistan &apos;s blasphemy law , which has led 2 jailing of # Christian girl named # Rimsha :
the situation is condemned by Pakistani Human Rights campaigners and activists and few politicians on twitter .
‏ @ Ali _ Abbas _ Zaidi ( Syed Ali Abbas Zaidi ) : the most tragic short story to have been written about misuse of # blasphemy law in Pakistan : “ She was just 11 years old . ”
‏ @ MaheenAkhtar ( Maheen Akhtar ) : where the hell is suo motto of Cheif Justice Pakistan , is he sleeping … .. Oh wait is this “ Blasphemy ”
‏ @ beenasarwar ( Beena Sarwar ) : the important issue in accusations of ‘ blasphemy ’ is that of intent , niyat , of the accused .
that &apos;s something the accusers ignore . # Pakistan
ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Tehreek Insaaf condemned the incident .
leader of PTI Imran Khan tweets .
@ ImranKhanPTI : shameful !
sending an 11yr old girl to prison is against the very spirit of Islam which is all about being Just and Compassionate.1 / 2
‏ @ SundasHoorain : @ CMShehbaz Still waiting for action &amp; condemnation from PML-N on an 11yr old getting accused of blasphemy , beaten &amp; arrested # FreeRimsha
all other political parties are afraid of talking about this issue .
it is considered sensitive .
however no one from Pakistan demands to repeal this law .
@ anthonypermal : we can &apos;t repeal blasphemy law .
a ) mobs would go on vigilante sprees with no qualms &amp; b ) cops couldn &apos;t stop open shia killing , how this ?
in 2010 , Ambassador Sherry Rehman filed the ‘ Amendments to the Blasphemy Laws Act 2010 ′ in the National Assembly as a member of the parliament .
on December 20 , 2010 , the Council of Islamic Ideology also announced proposed amendments to the law to prevent its misuse .
but religious parties in the house -Jamat-i- Islami , Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Pakistan , and Sunni Tehreek and others threatened a mass protest .
Sherry Rehman later received death threats and was confined to her house .
in January 2011 , the Governor of Punjab , Salman Taseer a vocal critic of Pakistan &apos;s blasphemy laws , was publicly gunned down by his own guard , Mumtaz Qadri for his beliefs .
Incidentally Qadri is also in Adiala jail where Rimsha has been sent .
when Qadri was on his way to trial , his supporters showered him with rose petals .
the Sunni Tehreek party rally in favor of Mumtaz Qadri , the killer of Salman Taseer , and they demand his release in Hyderabad , Pakistan .

Malik Siraj Akbar in his blog for Huffington Post says that discriminatory laws deepens religious intolerance in Pakistani society :
despite such frequent unpleasant events , Pakistan has made almost no progress in reforming its deeply flawed and discriminatory law involving blasphemy .
such laws , on the one hand , discriminate against religious minorities and , on the other hand , further deepen religious intolerance and fanaticism in Pakistani society . they provide the murderers a license to kill people and easily get away with such heinous crimes in the name of religion .
Mehdi Hasan in his blog writes :
personally , I &apos;ve never quite understood why so many of my co-religionists are so keen to kill or maim those who ‘ insult ’ Islam , Prophet Muhammad or the Quran .
what is behind such rage and , dare I add , insecurity ?
is their God so weak , so sensitive , so precious , that He cannot withstand any rejection ?
Côte d &apos;Ivoire : who is in Control of RTI State Television ?
this post is part of our special coverage Côte d &apos;Ivoire Unrest 2011 .
confusion surrounds the question of who is currently in control of the Radio Télévision Ivoirienne ( RTI ) , the Ivorian national television station .
on March 31 , the Republican Forces ( FRCI ) rebels loyal to Internationally recognised president Alassane Ouattara entered Abidjan , the main city of Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
when they reached the RTI &apos;s headquarters they were faced with resistance from Gagbo &apos;s Defense and Security Forces ( FDS ) .
the national television station is mockingly referred to as “ Propaganda TV ” or “ LMP TV ” because of the preconception that it favors President Laurent Gbagbo , who denies he lost an election in December 2010 and refuses to step down .
RTI has become the stage for a war of control .
the signal was first cut for 24 hours , and on April 1 , 2011 Directscoop , a citizen information blog focused on Africa , announced that the signal of the channel was back :
RTI started broadcasting again on Friday shortly past 7pm
Wanyu , a reader , commented :
a feature film with Matt Damon : “ The Bourne Ultimatum ” is currently showing on RTI .
Infodabidjan.net , a news website , posted on its YouTube profile this citizen video shot on April 1 , 2011 :
the caption under the video explains :
first images of the RTI after its liberation
they also said the situation at the RTI – as well as in Abidjan – is now under control , and that people should go about their lives as usual .
on Twitter , citizens reacted to this intervention immediately :
@ Gare _ au _ gorille was outraged :
RTI wants to build a human shield by not passing the word on the curfew # civ2010 .
stay HOME and spread the word ! !
@ JusticeJFK also :
FDS speaker on the RTI : “ We call the population to go about their business as usually ” This is Irresponsible ! ! !
“ The committee for the struggle against French interference in Côte d &apos;Ivoire ” shared another video , shot the morning of April 2 in the RTI &apos;s offices , and as a proof that the state television was now controlled by the pro-Gbagbo FDS .
it was re-posted on Youtube by AfricaWeWish :
Stéphane Kassi , an RTI employee explains what happened on Thursday March 31 , 2011 :
after the alert on the attack by the rebellion was given , we tried to withdraw to the nearest area .
we are not agents of the people in charge of the production , but we tried our best .
( … ) Fighting took place , and we managed to hide somewhere until we were ex-filtrated .
this morning we are here , as the country demands ; we are here to defend our patrimony .

Global Pulse 2010 : an invitation to talk to decision makers online
from March 29 to 31 , Global Pulse 2010 aims to gather over 20.000 individuals and representatives of organisations in an online conversation dealing with topics ranging from human development to science and technologies .
the event is sponsored by US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , and the goal is to give world citizens an opportunity to voice opinions and share ideas for innovative solutions to social issues .
according to USAID , the inspiration for the online event is a speech President Barack Obama gave in Cairo in June 2009 in which he said he would promote partnership with the rest of the world .
ten topics of discussion
the event will start at 0 am ( GMT ) and will last 72 hours non-stop , and participants will be able to follow and comment in several live discussions simultaneously .
all discussions will be led by featured opinion leaders , decision makers and NGO members , including Youssou N &apos;Dour , famous Senegalese singer , deeply engaged in the fight against malaria , Iqbal Z. Quadir , founder of Grameenphone in Bangladesh , and even Ethan Zuckerman , co-founder of Global Voices Online .
participants from at least 128 countries will share and discuss on ten broad topics , listed here :
inspiring a new generation
empowering Women and Girls
enabling the Essential Education
building Stronger Partnerships
exercising Political and Civil Rights
promoting Global Health
Advancing Entrepreneurship , Trade &amp; Economic Opportunity
fostering Science , Technology &amp; Innovation
supporting a Sustainable Planet
pursuing Grand Challenges
innovative technology
gathering thousands of people online at the same time could be tricky .
fortunately , the forum technology that will be used , IBM Jam , has been already been tested in previous events .
bill Tipton took part in Habitat Jam – a three-day online event in 2005 to solicit ideas on urban sustainability .
in a blog at the Global Dialogue Center he shares his experience :
I know this can work from participating in such an event in 2005 &#91; ... &#93; Tens of thousands of individuals – including government and business leaders , NGOs and specialists — came together to discuss real issues and concerns facing the world ’ s urban communities .
I still meet and work with people I met in that truly remarkable Jam and expect to meet other extraordinary individuals in Global Pulse in 2010 .
participating
to join the Global Pulse event , you only need a computer and internet access – and you also have to register in advance ( for free ) .
before March 29 , you can follow @ globalpulse2010 on Twitter as well as the hashtag # gp2010 .
there is also a Facebook page with almost 700 fans , where suggestions have already been posted .
one idea by Oliver Mupila goes :
query : can Global Pulse suggest effective indicators for tracking the progress of grand corruption cases from referral to the investigating agencies , through to the Director of Prosecutions , onward to the courts and progress while they are in court without compromising the individuals right to a fair trial / hearing or reputation before they are convicted ?
what is considered good practice in this area and are there any countries that do this particularly well ?
and why are news writers in Africa not in good books &#91; of &#93; the government ?
according to Dr. Rajiv Shah , Adminsitrator of USAID , the online summit will gather “ individuals who are not normally seated at the table with key decision makers ” .
could this be a move towards the future of democracy ?
it should at least be interesting to find out .

Uganda : the Anti-Gay Bill That Won &apos;t Go Away
the same bill that was presented in 2009 is showing up again for voting in Uganda :
Uganda has again re-tabled the controversial anti-gay bill .
Ugandan member of parliament , David Bahati , who proposed the bill back in 2009 has again considered tabling the draconian bill but with changes .
he claims to have dropped the death penalty and jailing of family members who fail to report homosexuals to the authorities .
however , under further scrutiny it has been noted that no changes have been made in the bill , and it is still exactly the same one presented back in 2009 .
the following video explains the impact this bill will have on the LGBT community as well as their families and friends :
Hong Kong : videos Against Homophobic Bullying in Schools
in Hong Kong , students in schools admit that homosexual students are bullied and discriminated , so an organization has spearheaded a campaign to raise awareness on this issue , focusing on producing online videos of interviews with sexually diverse students and experts on the topic .

Spain : police Violence Against Students in Valencia
Spain : crackdown Against Students Continues in Valencia
in Valencia , school children decided to protest budget cuts that affected their schools , forcing them to carry blankets with them due to lack of heating , in what has been a particularly cold winter in Europe .
police reacted to the protests violently with students injured and detained ; many videos have been made showing the abuses against minors , females and the elderly .
just a few days after the brutal police crackdown at the Luis Vives Institute of Secondary Education in Valencia , students have again been the target of beatings , pushing and violence from the police at a pacific protest in which they were , precisely , demonstrating against police violence .
this time , the crackdown started on the afternoon with unexpected force .

Brazil : Quilombo Community in Bahia About to Be Evicted
one of the oldest slave descendent communities in Brazil , Quilombo Rio dos Macacos , where around 50 families live , has a date for eviction : March 4 , 2012 .
the claim for the land comes from the Navy of Brazil , that intends to broaden a condo for its officers in that territory , in the border area between Salvador and Simões Filho , state of Bahia …
descendants of original peoples from Africa who , during colonialism , were taken from their land to become slaves in Brazil , the Quilombolas now see themselves under threat of losing their homes again , despite their right to the land they inhabit enshrined in the constitution .
this short documentary &#91; pt &#93; shows the situation the Quilombolas are facing : afraid to leave their houses , unable to move freely and fearing for their well-being , their families and their homes .

a video &#91; es &#93; made of the violent response the government had to peaceful protesters standing up against the rerouting of a river in their community for a dam construction has caused the citizen journalist to receive death threats .
Brazil : the Deficient Prison Systems of the Americas
recent events in Latin American prisons that cost the life of hundreds of inmates have people looking into the living situation and overcrowding faced in many penitentiary centers , and analyzing if they are tragedies waiting to happen .
people who are being deprived of their liberty as punishment for their crimes should be guaranteed minimum living conditions , and sometimes these aren &apos;t met , as shown in the documentary of life in Brazilian prisons , which also provides possible solutions for this difficult situation .
a Global Look at Anti-Corruption Day
on January 18 Global Voices will launch the Technology for Transparency Network , a collaborative research mapping of internet projects that promote greater transparency , government accountability , and civic engagement .
this is the first in a series of posts that will explore related issues through the eyes of bloggers worldwide .
to kick things off we look at how bloggers responded to International Anti-Corruption Day , which was signed into law in 2003 at the United Nations Convention against Corruption and takes place every year on December 9th .
on Space for Transparency , the official blog of Transparency International , Georg Neumann looks back at the state of anti-corruption activism for 2009 :
increasingly , anti-corruption activists have been in the line of attack .
journalists writing on corruption in politics and society such as Sri Lanka ’ s Lasantha Wickramatunga earlier this year have given their lives .
activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina , Burundi , Guatemala or Zimbabwe have faced threats or were being silenced .
Anti-Corruption Day stands for a day to remember , recognise and honour these brave and fearless people , who went to prison or lost their lives believing that through fighting corruption they will make the world a better place .
Neumann also notes that 2009 saw the passing of a flawed review mechanism which doesn &apos;t require member states to seek input from independent NGO &apos;s based in their countries .
in a five-minute YouTube video Peter Eigen , the founder of Transparency International , describes the important role of civil society in fighting corruption and improving governance :
but it wasn &apos;t all bad news in 2009 , writes Neumann .
there are now 40 Advocacy and Legal Advice Centers worldwide providing legal advice to victims of corruption .
also , online social media has proven itself a powerful tool in promoting transparency and fighting against corruption .
in India , for example , J. N. Jayashree started a wiki to protect her husband whose safety was threatened as a result of his whistle-blowing activities .
in Morocco an anonymous anti-corruption activist has begun posting videos to YouTube of police officers accepting bribes .
on Global Voices a number of posts commemorated Anti-Corruption Day last month .
Bhumika Ghimire notes that Nepal was ranked by Transparency International as one of the world &apos;s most corrupt countries .
linking to other Nepalese bloggers , Bhumika &apos;s article shows how corruption in Nepal affects the economy , governance , public works , and even marriage .
Twitpic by Cleudson Fernandes , Twitter user @ cleudsonf , published with permission
in Brazil violence broke out on Anti-Corruption Day between police and protesters :
protesters have been demanding the impeachment of the Governor of the Federal District , Jose Roberto Arruda , and his deputy , Paulo Octavio , in addition to a thorough investigation into all parties cited in the bribery scandal that led to a police operation codenamed Pandora Box .
according to the investigation , Governor Arruda is the possible head of a R $ 600,000 ( approximately $ 340,000 ) per month bribery scheme that has benefited allies among district members of parliament , businessmen and government officials .

but there is also reason for optimism in Brazil when it comes to transparency and open governance , as Paula Goés explained a week before Anti-Corruption Day :
the first Transparência &#91; Transparency &#93; Hackday , “ two days for hacking into Brazilian politics ” , was launched in São Paulo at the beginning of October , and the last camp took place this week , on December 1st and 2nd , in the capital Brasília .
organized by journalists Daniela Silva and Pedro Markun &#91; both pt &#93; , the event has free entry and is an opportunity for software developers , journalists and researchers to gather together to find ways to “ scrape ” data from official websites and create applications that bring transparency and participation to the political processes .
Global Voices editors also point readers to a number of posts around the blogosphere related to transparency , corruption , and government accountability .
Peter Marton looks at the harmful role of corruption in rebuilding Afghanistan .
in Ukraine , meanwhile , Petro congratulates the residents of Kabul for sentencing their mayor to four years of prison for corruption and imagines how quickly Kyiv &apos;s prisons would fill up if the same laws were enforced in his country .
writing in Registan.net , Alexander Visotzky looks at the corruption charges against Mukhtar Dzhakishev for the illegal sale of Uranium and concludes , “ The fight against corruption in Kazakhstan is apparently much more of a political game than an attempt to root out corruption . ” Writing from Japan , Scilla Alecci points to Transparency International &apos;s Ten Worst Corruption Cases of 2009 in Japan .
finally , writing from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico , “ Gil the Jenius ” asks for tougher punishments against public officials convicted of corruption .
looking back on anti-corruption activism in 2009 we see that an entrenched culture of corruption is still pervasive worldwide .
but we also see a growing online discussion about what can be done to curb corruption , promote transparency , and increase civic engagement .
in future posts we &apos;ll look more specifically at online discussions and internet-based projects to promote transparency and fight against corruption in Nigeria and China .
Global : vigils in Solidarity with Tibetans
since early February 2012 , a series of global vigils have taken place in all over the world to express solidarity with Tibetans , following a call from Kalong Tripa Dr. Lobsang Sangay .
as February 22 is the Tibetan New Year , activists are calling for another round of solidarity action .
Lobsang Sangay &apos;s statement can be found in YouTube and below is part of the transcript of the English version :
a map on global vigils in solidarity with Tibetans on February 8 , 2012 .
ever since the invasion of Tibet , the Chinese government has claimed that it seeks to create a socialist paradise .
however , basic human rights are being denied to Tibetans , the fragile environment is being destroyed , Tibetan language and culture is being assimilated , portraits of His Holiness the Dalai Lama are banned , and Tibetans are being economically marginalized .
Tibet is in virtual lockdown .
foreigners have been barred from travelling to Tibet now and the entire region is essentially under undeclared martial law .
I urge the Chinese leadership to heed the cries of the Tibetan protestors and those who have committed self-immolation .
you will never address the genuine grievances of Tibetans and restore stability in Tibet through violence and killing .
the only way to resolve the Tibet issue and bring about lasting peace is by respecting the rights of the Tibetan people and through dialogue .
as someone deeply committed to peaceful dialogue , the use of violence against Tibetans is unacceptable and must be strongly condemned by all people in China and around the world .
I call on the international community to show solidarity and to raise your voices in support of the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people at this critical time .
I request that the international community and the United Nations send a fact-finding delegation to Tibet and that the world media be given access to the region as well .
the leaders in Beijing must know that killing its own “ family members ” is in clear violation of international and Chinese laws , and such actions will cast further doubts on China &apos;s moral legitimacy and their standing in world affairs .
during Chinese Vice President Xi Jingping &apos;s visit to the United States last week , Tibetan activists greeted Xi and the group of organized supporters with stories about human rights conditions in China .
below is a YouTube video taken on February 15 in Muscatine , Iowa :
as the Tibetan New Year is approaching , a number of Hong Kong activists have organized a candle night vigil outside the China Government Liaison Office to mourn for those Tibetans who have self-immolated to call for a free Tibet .
in addition , more than 240 have signed up for a Butter Lamp Pray event * to express their solidarity with Tibetans :
in Tibet , from 27 Feb 2009 to 19 Feb 2012 , 23 Tibetans have self-immolated to protest for a free Tibet and the return of The Dalai Lama .
15 of them had lost their lives .
under the repressive circumstance in Tibet , self-immolation is an ultimate act of nonviolence demonstration .
Tibet question seems so far away from us , but as a human being , it doesn ’ t mean that we can do nothing .
at least , we should pray for the death .
one of the spiritual practices among Tibetan Buddhists is to offer a lighted butter lamp that represents the illumination of wisdom and to purify bad Karma .
following their belief , we shall also light for the Tibetans who have self-immolated and pray for Tibet .

Ada Lovelace Day : celebrating Women in Technology and Transparency Worldwide
inspired by Ellen Miller &apos;s post on the Sunlight Foundation blog , which profiles the work of women who use technology to promote transparency in the United States , we decided to add to the list by profiling several women from around the world involved in the use of technology to make government more transparent and accountable .
the following profiles were written and researched by Renata Avila , the lead of Creative Commons Guatemala , the Director of Primer Palabra , and our researcher for Spanish-language Latin America on the Technology for Transparency Network .
in Mexico , Irma Eréndida Sandoval heads up a laboratory to document corruption and research the best transparency policies .
“ Laboratorio de Documentación y Análisis de la Corrupción y la Transparencia ” at UNAM , the Autonomous National Mexican University , is one of the most prestigious institutions in Latin America .
in Iceland , parliamentarian Birgitta Jónsdóttir is promoting the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative , a proposal to create a global safe haven for investigative journalism in Iceland that would improve freedom of expression and transparency worldwide by protecting watchdog groups and whistleblowers from libel censorship .
it is important not only approve good laws to promote transparency and openness but also protect a free country from becoming less transparent .
an activist from Germany , Franziska Heine , initiated the most successful e-petition in German history , aimed to prevent a law which would give the German police the right to create and maintain censorship lists with websites to be blocked by German ISPs .
Franziska is part of the anti-censorship movement and is engaged in several activities and organizations which fight against surveillance , data mining , censorship and other threats to civil rights .
but good laws and proactive citizens are not enough ; tools are also important to enable women around the world to take action and promote transparency .
Margarita Padilla , an IT engineer and the former director of the magazine Mundo Linux is making a difference .
she creates and maintains systems with a social approach and also promotes openness with her website Sin Dominio .
Mercedes de Freitas from Venezuela is the Executive Director of Transparencia Venezuela , the local chapter of Transparency International and is former Ashoka Changemaker Fellow for her work in promoting civic participation to increase government accountability .
these are surely just a few examples of women around the world who are using technology to challenge corruption , improve the performance of institutions , and create better policy to engage citizens and hold public officials accountable .
as a recent article by Alexandra Starr notes , both the fields of technology and government have long excluded women from participation despite their impressive track record for approaching both policy and technology with more realism and tact than their male counterparts .
software companies and parliamentary buildings around the world are still mostly dominated by men , but this is changing quickly thanks to a new generation of women technologists , activists , and politicians .
I would be remiss to not highlight the work of our female researchers and research reviewers who , it must be said , have proven themselves to be the hardest working members of our team on the Technology for Transparency Network .
Renata Avila , who wrote the profiles of all of the women above , is a lawyer , human rights activist , the country lead of Creative Commons Guatemala , and the director of Primer Palabra .
she has worked with the Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation , Harvard University , the Public Voice , and Women in International Security .

China : threatened by American Internet censorship
just days after American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ‘ s speech on Internet freedom , open source source code repository SourceForge.net blocked access to IP addresses originating in Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Sudan and Syria .
SourceForge justifies the move saying they are only following American law .
which is more or less the same argument Chinese government spokespeople make when questioned about their country &apos;s Internet censorship .
SourceForge has been blocked by China before .
hearing word of this new Great Firewall of America left some Chinese coders wondering if they might now start getting blocked from the other end and what can be done about it .

at CNBeta on the day the news broke , ugmbbc wrote :
open source culture got trampled today .
having been required to blocked these rogue nations , will SourceForge go protest to the American Congress ?
it &apos;s a tricky situation , but does an entire country have to be punished just because of the extreme actions of a tiny minority of the people in these countries ?
open source software provides important infrastructure to these oppressed and developing nations .
I hope the American government can see what a blow this is to the infrastructure and fledgling industries in these countries .
over at geek community Solidot , free-as-in-freedom notes that this move by SourceForge follows earlier restrictions on users from these five countries , allowing them to browse the site and download source code , but barring them from contributing any .
comments there include :
SourceForge has to abide by American laws !
why should SourceForge stay true to open source culture ?
software is just code , which makes it both free and neutral ; but websites can &apos;t escape the servers which host them , and you have to obey the laws of whichever country your server is situated in , that &apos;s just how it goes .
it is their freedom
erlv at his technical blog LingCC looks at the implications of politics encroaching upon the open source movement :
nobody who &apos;s a fan of technology or supports open source wants to see open source become a political tool , but then this is a world ruled by politics ; you can say all you want about principles , freedom or open source , but when you &apos;re on the government &apos;s turf , the government calls the shots , so you better listen : those are just tools .
I &apos;m not saying the GFW is good for the country or the people , rather that we need to take some steps to ensure that at the same time we &apos;re able to freely communicate with those overseas , we can stop having to rely on them .
here now in the mainland , for instance , all open source fans are happy to contribute their code with the rest of the open source community .
but when that becomes a political tool , how are we supposed to obtain those rights that belong to us ?
I don &apos;t think SourceForge has any mirror servers in China .
if those in charge really wanted to scheme on behalf of our country &apos;s information industries and were willing to do what it takes , it wouldn &apos;t hurt for them to take 1 % of the money they spend on the GFW , as sincere support from the government , and set up a few mirror servers inside the country .
at least this way , we &apos;d still have all our own code .
at least we &apos;d still have our own independence !
Iran : cartoonists Rage Against Khatami for Voting in Election
how you can be the “ biggest loser ” in an election just for voting ?
probably Mohammad Khatami , the former reformist president of Iran can answer this .
Khatami voted in the parliamentary election on Friday , March 2 , 2012 ignoring preconditions he himself had formulated for his participation : “ Freedom of &#91; political &#93; prisoners and creation of a free atmosphere for everyone and all groups , the authorities respecting the Constitution and creation of the logistics for conducting a healthy and free election . ”
given the popular calls for boycotting the elections , many reformists were disappointed to see Khatami go back on his word .
he later justified his actions by expressing hope that his vote did not disrupt “ reformist solidarity . ” He has reportedly stressed the “ complexity ” of the internal as well as the international affairs and called for , “ understanding of these complexities by everyone . ”
several satirical cartoons published on the internet display anger and disappointment with the once popular Khatami .
Nikahang , a leading cartoonist and blogger , considers that Khatami ignored the blood shed during the 2009 protest against regime .
Mana Neyestani , another leading cartoonist , shows one of a character breaking a window on the head of Khatami .
an unnamed guest cartoonist on Khodnevis.org took part in a “ cartoons against Khatami ” campaign with this entry :
will ‘ National Conversation ’ Work in Singapore ?
in an effort to include ordinary Singaporeans in the planning of the nation &apos;s future , the government has launched a “ national conversation ” that will last for about a year to gather people &apos;s views .
led by the Our Singapore committee , the national conversation will take place online as well as in various dialogues and meetings .
our Singapore Conversation has both a website and a Facebook page , and urges people to share their views on Twitter using the # oursgconv hashtag .
the exercise has been met with positivity from some Singaporeans .
Petunia Lee writes about her experience of attending a dialogue session :
from the Facebook page of Our SG Conversation
I must say that my experience of the SG Conversation opened my eyes to other Singaporeans .
for one , I didn &apos;t realize that the elderly in Singapore felt such a sense of dispossession and rejection until one elderly gentleman from my group said his piece .
for another , I had had the wrong assumption that harmonious race relations are so much a part of us that we don &apos;t need to work at it .
it was a Malay lady doctor who in her impassioned speech convinced me that race relations can cause today , as much rawness as in the 1960s .
so yes … I think if , as explained by Mr Tan , the aim of the SG Conversation is to teach each of us some truths about our own country , then it did achieve that aim with me .
however , many others are wary of the exercise , seeing it as nothing more than a public relations endeavour .
Molly Meek believes that the whole national conversation is simply a ploy to change the ruling party &apos;s image :
the PAP ’ s &#91; ruling party &#93; strategy is intelligent — one even wonders if they have consulted professionals on the matter before proceeding with their efforts — and one cannot helped but be impressed by their measurable success .
the strategy employed is perhaps fairly simple — target a few citizens , including prominent ones and lesser-known ones , that are moderately against the PAP , give them a different impression , and let them spread the news that the PAP really is not what its detractors have made it out to be .
in fact , these do not even need to say anything — a mere talk with the PAP that leaves them with nothing to criticize will be effective enough for others who can still be convinced to support the PAP .
an editorial at publichouse.sg points out that the conversation may not lead to real change :
even if it is assumed that the ministers leading the current initiative are of a keenly liberal bent , the older guards in the Cabinet remain likely to have a veto over the final product .
it is instructive that a majority of the more liberal suggestions made by the Remaking Singapore Committee – such as for the government to define the out-of-bounds markers for political debate , creating an Economic Relief Scheme for the structurally unemployed and subsidising the MediShield premiums of low-income groups – went unheeded .
‘ Join the Singapore Conversation ’ website
Howard Lee , writing for The Online Citizen , commented on the perceived partisan bias in the conversation :
we simply do not want to see a Conversation that is dominated by people who might be sympathetic of the ruling party &apos;s position on national issues , and are hence more likely to be part of the ancient echo chamber .
how would we look forward , if so ?
in other words , Wong and others like him need to realise that the ball is in the PAP &apos;s court to prove that they can be non-partisan , rather than lambast those who are raising the red flag on partisanship as ‘ politicised &apos; .
proof is in actions , not words .
we want diverse voices , even oppositional ones that sit at the far ends of the fence of logic and possibility , to get to the bottom of matters and stimulate a hearty , if not heart-felt , discussion , rather than another consensus building show-and-tell .
and Singaporeans have the right to expect the National Conversations to be like that .
while the conversation continues in dialogue sessions and on Facebook , the Twitter hashtag # oursgconv appears to have been hijacked by anti-opposition spam : @ SGSilentMaj : freedom of expression is bad for # Singapore # sgpolitics # sgelections http : / / bit.ly / REUBsd http : / / bit.ly / TJjDZX

Bahrain : the pleasures and perils of studying abroad
although Bahrain has a number of universities , both government and private , many Bahrainis have the opportunity to go abroad to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies , often by means of scholarships .
one of the first problems they face is that few people know where Bahrain is .
in this post we hear about the experiences of three bloggers who have just gone abroad for higher studies , to Japan , Britain and the United States , and a fourth blogger who has been studying in India for some time .
Cradle of Humanity has just gone to study in Cleveland , Ohio , and she is feeling a little frustrated :
I sometimes dread it when people ask where I come from .
not more than 10 % of people who hear “ Bahrain ” as answer have some sort of idea where that country might be , but that ’ s not my cause of annoyance .
for those who know that Bahrain is indeed in the Persian Gulf , there is one thing that comes to mind – wealth .
some people might ask , but it ’ s those who assume who annoy me the most .
for the past two months I made a lot of friends , mainly Indians given the demographics of the student body in my program .
despite the fact that most of these are actually Indian elites , owners of chains of businesses and are wealthy themselves – they love to point out that I must be wealthy .
when at some occasions I said just that , it appeared that some have the notion that we ’ re unnecessarily wealthy , that is , it ’ s undeserved wealth ; while theirs is hard worked for .
oh , and they use Bahrain and Dubai interchangeably .
- Public transport here is not very good , but getting a car is very expensive . I would ’ ve got one
- Used or new ?
- Used , I ’ m only here for a short period of time .
- Get a new one it ’ s better
- It ’ ll be much more expensive
- But you come from Bahrain , you can buy a car !
- You mean you ’ re not rich ?
- Actually , no .
- Everyone in Dubai was rich .
- I don ’ t know about that , but not everyone in Bahrain is rich .
Yagoob , who has just arrived in Nagoya , has to deal with something even more basic – language :
to be honest , the culture shock has hit me very hard !
hardly anyone I ’ ve met so far had the slightest knowledge of the English language .
I feel like a 21st century caveman , trying to communicate with the most primitive of ways , hand waving and speaking English in a very slow and loud way .
&#91; … &#93; My dorm room is quite Japanese , extremely tiny and everything is earthquake proof so it ’ s like living in an aluminium sardine can .
many of the things I have around the room seem to have instructions on it , but all in Japanese so I have no idea how they work so far !
&#91; … &#93; The subway is quite reminiscent to the London Tube except that it ’ s much cleaner and a person like me sticks out like a sore thumb ( as if a tall fat sweaty hairy Arab wouldn ’ t stick out anywhere ) .
MuJtAbA AlMoAmEn studies in India , and tells us what he likes about being there :
perhaps being away from home has its negative aspects , but there is no doubt that there are positive aspects to it too .
I have previously discussed the pros and cons of being away from home ; I have no intention of repeating myself , and will write about something different today .
I want to write about contemplation , calm , the ability to read , and the free time which I can spend usefully .
in Bahrain , among family and friends , I don &apos;t have much time to read newspapers , whether local , Arab or international .
I also don &apos;t have time to read books such as biographies , novels , or those on intellectual topics .
here in India , there is a lot of time for reflection .
I feel mentally calm and I can think a lot – I find solutions for any problems or obstacles I face and what is even sweeter is that I find more than one solution .
I don &apos;t depend on one only , and weigh my options , and if this proves anything , it is a testimony to the mental and spiritual calmness I live in .
bride Zone has just arrived in the UK to study , and she is missing home :
I cannot deny how difficult it is to be away from home .
the Earth is the Earth , the third planet in the solar system .
we all studied that and know it scientifically .
but the truth is that our Earth isn &apos;t the same when you move from one place to the other .
that land where I lived all my life , with its share of good and bad , and which holds my family and friends is more dear to me than all the world &apos;s lands .
despite the beauty of the land I live on now – it isn &apos;t worth a speck of sand from my beloved country .
here , in the UK , the weather is lovely .
I have seen an autumn like nothing I have seen in my life before .
at school we used to study that there was an autumn in which leaves fall from the trees but I have never seen that with my very own eyes except here .
and while we suffer from the lack of rain in my country , it regularly rains here and makes me eager for life , a life that is rejuvenated by the rains , which make it the oasis it is now .
am I hallucinating ?
I don &apos;t see any connection in what I have written on these pages except that they are words that have congested my mind and which I have translated in this small space and this window I look into the world from .
please forgive me my dear ones .
there is nothing I want to talk about today except for my love and longing for my land and nation .
Nigeria : bloggers debate Nigeria &apos;s negative image
it &apos;s well known that Nigeria has an image problem – 419 Internet scams , corruption , oil piracy in the Delta region – for many people , these are the associations that come to mind when Africa &apos;s most populous country is mentioned .
however , the last year has been especially hard on Nigeria &apos;s reputation abroad : over the past few months , a series of events depicting Nigeria in a questionable light have triggered discussions throughout the blogosphere .
in September , Sony released an ad for Playstation 3 which included the line , “ You can &apos;t believe everything you read on the Internet – otherwise , I &apos;d be a Nigerian millionaire by now . ” The ad was met with consternation from many Nigerians , and the Federal Government requested that Sony make a formal apology ( Sony did apologize and later withdrew the ad ) .
around the same time came the release of District 9 – a sci-fi blockbuster which was critically well-received but irksome to many Nigerians .
the Nigerian government took offense at the film &apos;s depiction of Nigerians as criminals and cannibals , banning the film within Nigeria and asking the Censor &apos;s Board to confiscate it from theaters .
online , the movie provoked varied reactions , with some taking the view that the film presents a racist view of Nigerians , while others defended it as a fictional representation with little bearing on reality .
Adamu Waziri at EVCL points out that often Nigerian depictions of Nigerians are equally unflattering :
Nollywood , our indigenous movie industry , has portrayed us in a much harsher light to both national and international audiences .
there was a time where you couldn ’ t get Nollywood movie that didn ’ t include one of the following or a combination of them ; fraud , juju / witchcraft , armed robbery , incest , adultery , cannibalism and of course our favourite , corruption .
Nollywood has been pumping out thousands of movies with these themes for years with no real opposition from the general public or any Ministry .
… Banning films sets the wrong precedent ; in fact it can be dangerous .
let us the public debate the issue .
we are mature enough to do so .
in fact our Minister has succeeded in giving the movie more publicity which I ’ m sure she didn ’ t intend to do .
Nicole Stamp comments on race in District 9 :
the thing that really upsets me is that most people who see this movie won ’ t question , or even notice , this incredibly racist portrayal … .
why can ’ t the Nigerians just be people with logical motives like money and weapons ?
why do they have to go out of their way to be ooga-booga savages ? … .it is impossible to disregard the charged portrayal of Nigerians which when viewed in a larger context , is beyond damaging or defamatory but is dangerous .
read more on the debate at Nigerianstalk.org or google “ district 9 race ” .
more recently , Time magazine published a slide show by the South African photographer Pieter Hugo which featured scenes from Nigeria &apos;s “ Nollywood ” movie industry .
though not so controversial as District 9 or the Playstation commercial , the photographs nonetheless prompted debate in the blogosphere , with discussions over whether such depictions of Nigeria fall under the category of artistic freedom or cultural bias .
Solomon Sydelle at Nigerian Curiosity writes :
I definitely understand the need to push the envelope , after all that desire has led to some of the most creative masterpieces and accomplishments of all time .
however , with these pictures , I struggle to develop an appreciation of them and / or what they represent and believe that they unnecessarily relied on biases that will only confirm certain stereotypes for Hugo &apos;s mainly Western audience .
these events are especially ill-timed as they correspond to a new initiative launched earlier this year to “ Re-brand Nigeria . ” The initiative is sponsored by Dr. Dora Akunyili , Nigerian Minister of Information and Communication , and has been met with both praise and criticism ( see here for the discussion at Global Voices ) .
Bunmi Oloruntoba at A Bombastic Element discusses the re-branding campaign in the context of a recent BBC discussion on the subject :
the minister has a good case when she argues that Nigeria is overlooking a lot of positives , has not been telling her stories and is making the mistake of letting the world define her image based on its notoriety alone .
and she has some good examples of the positives .
but the BBC sought out a few PR and branding experts who counter by saying , if the country wants to rebrand itself , it needs to give any PR team a lot more to build on .
those interviewed said , consistent power supply and an end to a diesel generator economy will make rebranding Nigeria “ effortless . ” And to prove their point , 13 : 40 mins into the program … well , you don &apos;t need to be a Nigerian to figure out what happened .
a bright spot in the discussion of Nigeria &apos;s image was a widely circulated video of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaking on “ The danger of a single story . ” Adichie comments on the pitfalls of a monolithic image of Africa as a site of catastrophe ; she cautions that limiting ourselves to a “ single story ” flattens experience and creates stereotypes .
for many bloggers , Adichie &apos;s remarks resonated with their frustration at the depictions of Nigeria prevalent outside the country .
shade NonConformist writes of the connection between Adichie &apos;s speech and Nigeria &apos;s image :
I believe this is what Chimamada Adichie meant about The Danger of a Single Story lecture she gave at TED .
it becomes a problem when the only portrayal of Africa that we see is one involving dead animals , poverty , disaster , death , corruption , celebrity adoptions … you know the whole nine yards .
now I &apos;m not saying Africa does not have these issues .
we can all agree that we do .
I &apos;m arguing that these issues are not specific to African countries .
… I / We will never stop criticizing depictions of Africa that are unbalanced and prejudiced .
presenting a balance depiction of Africa is crucial .
as Africans we also need to act as vessels who are willing to be instrumental in the change we want to see ( and will see ) in our beloved continent .
Egypt : the Capital of Hell on Earth
many Egyptian bloggers and activists have been detained by State Security on various occasions and for various reasons – real or fake – Wa7da Masreya interviewed several bloggers and posted a detailed post on torture techniques and psychological tricks those bloggers have been subjected to in State Security headquarters in the district of Nasr City .
in her post , Wa7da Masreya wrote describing the headquarters :
this scary fortress of a building in Nasr City district , with its high guarded fences , has witnessed the death , the violation , and the demise of human rights !
she goes on saying :
on their two feet and with eyes wide open state security officers and informers walk into this tomb every morning , unlike the detainees who are blindfolded , handcuffed , covered by blankets , and shoved under seats so that no one sees them enter the capital of hell .
most detainees are , or are connected to , Islamists , terrorists , or anyone who has anything to do with Gaza and Hamas .
the first interview was with Abdel Moneim Mahmoud – a Muslim Brotherhood Blogger :
he was arrested in 2003 and was detained in this cemetery for 13 days ; along with others , he felt that the bus went down a steep road as though they were going under the ground .
he was blindfolded , told that this is where Al Qaeda members were interrogated , was severely beaten up , tortured , electrocuted , stood facing the wall with hands tied behind his back , and they were given numbers instead of names – to erase the last bit of their humanity !
Abdel Moneim was number 25 .
the second was with blogger Mohamed Adel - who was detained earlier this year :
for 17 days , Mohamed Adel was number 15 .
he spent most of his detention time in an L-shaped hall with about 22 investigation offices and it branched out into shorter halls for the detention cells .
blindfolded , he walked that hall everyday and he was given orders to walk in a straight line lest he stumbled upon other detainees or their “ bodies ” .
no one was allowed to talk and he who dared open his mouth was brutalized .
after he was deported , Mohamed Adel managed to identify some of his mates who were injured members from Hamas who were arrested in Cairo after the Israeli attacks on Gaza in early 2009 .
he happens to believe that the headquarters is a group of buildings with two levels of basements on a spacious premises where he heard excruciating screams through the windows in that hall .
then she talked about Abou Omar Al Masry :
Osama Nasr , aka Omar Al Masry , wrote a detailed memoir of how he was tortured in that headquarters .
he sat blindfolded for months in a tiny underground 2m x 1.25m cell with no natural ventilation .
there was a device to circulate air that worked day and night and the sound of its engine is more deafening than that of an army tank .
the forms of torture that he was subjected to were :
a ) Being hung upside down to a rope then the electrocution starts all over his body with special attention to his genitals .
his body was wired and exposed to an electric current .
he was beaten with a baton and electric wires .
b ) His testicles and nipples were subjected to hand torture .
C ) He was subjected to all positions of crucification on a wooden crucifix , tied to metal poles , or on a metal door then he was beaten up or electrocuted .
d ) He was also ordered to lie on the floor face down with his hands behind his back , legs tied , and beaten up or electrocuted all over .
e ) In the same vulnerable position above , he would lay down on a wired wet blanket .
a man would sit on a chair between his shoulders and another would sit between his legs to hold him down when his body jumps when the electric current passes through it .
f ) Face slapping and punching were also a routine .
Abou Omar is an Egyptian cleric who used to live in Italy until the CIA and the Italian Intelligence kidnapped him and deported him to Egypt to snatch confessions out of him .
Diaa El Din Gad is another blogger who was detained :
Diaa is another blogger who was detained by state security as an activist who worked towards lifting the siege on Gaza .
his testimony coincided with the testimonies of others who have been to the capital of hell .
as for the investigating officers :
the investigators are state security officers who go by the common names of Roshdy , Gaafar , Moussa , or Nour .
those were the names the torture victims heard when state security demons terrorized them out of their wits and broke down their defenses until they collapsed into submission .
they were interrogated for long hours and were denied the right to sleep or eat or drink for long periods of time .
at the end of her post she wondered in awe :
this is how tens or maybe hundreds were detained in this place that is unmatched in its cruelty by Abu Gharib or Guantanamo .
some survived and came out alive and others lost their lives to pain .
many await a savior from this purgatory and few came out and shared their horror stories .
where is justice ?
or is she still blind to those torture artists ?

reports surfaced today that Facebook was blocked in Egypt .
the Balkans : similarities Between Facebook and Communist Party of Yugoslavia
in his customary funny style , Sead Dzigal provided a list &#91; MKD &#93; of similarities between Facebook and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia ( CPY ) :
Facebook – social networking
CPY – socialist networking
if you are not a Facebook member – you are a nobody
if you are not a CPY member – you are a nobody
everybody on Facebook are your friends , even though you don &apos;t know half of them .
in the CPY everybody are your comrades , * even though you don &apos;t know half of them .
on Facebook you support various actions and causes without lifting a finger .
in CPY you are a member of a zillion committees , boards , assemblies , without lifting a finger .
on Facebook you &apos;ve got FarmVille ,
in CPY you &apos;ve got zadrugas &#91; a form of kolkhoz &#93; and land reform .
on Facebook you &apos;ve got “ Like , ”
in CPY you &apos;ve got “ Long live comrade … ! !
Facebook – often invading your privacy ,
CPY – often invading your privacy .
.aNTI reacted through a comment &#91; MKD &#93; , using a phrase often attributed to Vaclav Havel :
this post is filled with cliches and anti-communist propaganda .
the only thing worse than the communists are the anti-communists .
Recenzent agreed , and trying to prove wrong the current anti-communist prejudices about how things changed , he noted &#91; MKD &#93; :
the media used to be run by the political party .
today they can be pro-government or anti-government , but are still run by political parties .
you can get a job much easier if you are a political party member . regardless if it was CPY , SDSM or VMRO-DPMNE .
he also noted that passive “ support ” for various actions remains a staple of current political parties too , as well is fighting dissenters using conspiracy theories .
* The words friend and comrade are synonyms in most South Slavic languages , such as Macedonian , Serbian , Croatian , Bosnian …
new GV e-book : African Voices of Hope and Change
here is a perfect gift to salute the new year : our new e-book dedicated to Africa &apos;s Sub-Saharan region .
“ African Voices of Hope and Change , ” gives you an intimate perspective into the stories and people of Sub-Saharan Africa through our best English-language posts from 2012 .
from a total of about 800 posts produced over the year from the region , we hand-picked 13 posts to feature from Senegal , Uganda , Mozambique , Guinea-Bissau , Ghana , Ethiopia , Nigeria , Mauritania , Kenya , Angola and other countries .
you are welcome to download it here .
you can even send a copy ( in PDF , ePub or Mobipocket format ) to your relatives or friends across the world , maybe as a present for their donation to GV .
most important , please spread the word in your global circles , social networks and anywhere you deem fit !
African Voices of Hope and Change is more evidence of the power of we ‘ , a collective effort focusing on places and people too often ‘ forgotten ’ by mainstream media worldwide , despite Africa ’ s diverse but promising growth in the upcoming years .
as stated in the ebook introduction , “ At the start of the new millennium , it felt as though the African continent was essentially written off by the international community … &#91; but &#93; recent statistics suggest that nine of the fastest-growing economies in the world are in Sub-Saharan Africa . ”
and while many experts actually believe that new technology &apos;s most lasting influence will be on a broadening field of education , “ also important is the potential for leveraging technology towards a more general transparency and accountability , as shown by initiatives based on social and citizen media for monitoring local elections or making government data available on the Internet . ”
aimed at providing a larger context and fostering the Global Voices mission , this collection of 2012 posts will try to parse out such complex framework and open up the horizon for the upcoming year .
these voices tell us about moving forward in hope and change , their accounts reveal a path infused with struggle and collaboration .

Nigeria : what Are Nigerian Bloggers Saying About the 2011 Elections ?
as the 2011 Elections in Nigeria draws near , the blogosphere is fervent with loud screams .
Nigerian bloggers are busy talking but creating a national conversation about the future of their country .
Nze Sylva Ifedigbo starts the New Year with a post disparaging the bomb blasts that sent some Nigerians to an early embrace with their ancestors .
it is pathetic that violence continually reoccurs in Nigeria ’ s political equation :
it ’ s the first day of the year that promises to be very exciting .
top on the list no doubt for most Nigerians is the general elections scheduled for April .
kick starting the process for this election is the voters ’ registration which will commence this month .
how ready are we to make this opportunity count ?
sadly though , our celebration was hijacked once more by some faceless cowards who detonated a bomb in the usually crowded mammy market of the Mogadishu Cantonment ( Sani Abacha barracks ) Abuja on New Year Eve .
Felix Okoli lays the bulk at the table of the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) and particularly on its boss Attahiru Jega :
the mantle has fallen on Jega to ensure that the 2011 Presidential and general elections sail smoothly and the results be an honest reflection of the wishes of the great people of Nigeria .
the Voters Registration was a litmus test on INEC unpreparedness to conduct a credible election .
Nigerian Curiosity asserts that :
these first days also raise questions about the preparedness of the Independent National Election Commission ( INEC ) and its ability to not only register voters within the time allotted but also conduct free and fair elections in April .
elections are about numbers .
the wave of social media backed revolutions in North Africa has raised the consciousness of many .
it is therefore not surprising that the party primaries were followed with much more than a passing interest .
Nnenna writes that :
in Nigeria , I followed the # PDPprimaries . … All this time , I was waiting … typing , tweeting … with thousands of other Nigerians all over the world ?
because the one that wins # PDPprimaries is almost certain to win the Presidency .
# PDPprimaries lasted 15 hours .
the final results were announced at around 7 am the next morning .
we kept awake !
every single count was on web radio , on Twitter , on Facebook .
feathers Project thinks that the 2011 elections will be different because of the numerous independent election observers in the country .
… the 2011 elections seem to be too important to be left for politicians alone .
familiar names like Vote or Quench , RSVP ( Register , Select , Vote and Protect ) , If Naija Votes , have assumed buzz status .
ReVoDa , a mobile app that provides untrained citizens with a tool to share their election experiences .

Gbenga Sessan confirms the strength of social media in this election with the development of a new app – ReVoDa which :
Eurukanaija has some advice for the First Lady , whose English expletives have morphed into a national lure :
the thing concerns the campaign that you are helping our President , Uncle Jo &#91; Goodluck Jonathan &#93; and all his umbrella friends to do .
Auntie , you have tried .
even though you don &apos;t know English , you are making some effort …
it seems not only the bloggers are talking but the musicians are also singing .
the civic awareness campaign for this election that has already gone viral online has been given a voice .
trading Places expresses it thus :
through Twitter , Eldeethedon , one of several musicians , urged people to “ be the change ” and Register Select Vote Protect .
Philippines : worst Flooding in 40 Years
more than 50 people were killed after tropical storm “ Ondoy ” ( International Name : Ketsana ) battered Metro Manila and nearby provinces .
the storm triggered the worst flooding in the country in the past 40 years displacing 280,000 people in Manila and five other provinces , with more than 41,000 people in 92 evacuation centers .
as of this writing , 1.2 million residents are still without power supply in the urban capital of the Philippines .
social media sites were maximized not just to share information about the storm but also to report rescue efforts and emergency cases in disaster-struck areas .
Joey Alarilla observes how the internet was used by Filipino netizens as the storm hits Metro Manila
I ’ m blogging this using a prepaid HSDPA USB modem as our condominium still has no electricity after several hours , yet I ’ m luckier than many of my countrymen , some of whom are still stranded on the road or even on the rooftops of their houses
Twitter and social networking sites such as Facebook have been the main means Filipino Internet users have kept pace with developments and shared information , such as the text numbers for disaster relief agencies and volunteer organizations now that voice networks are clogged .
the Rescue Info Hub Central features a spreadsheet document that has a list of addresses of flood victims who need to be rescued .
a google map page was also created to monitor the flooded areas in Metro Manila and to direct authorities to villages where flood victims need assistance .
view Ondoy situation map for Metro Manila in a larger map
Filipinos also used Twitter and Plurk to monitor updates about the storm , In fact , “ Ondoy ” and “ NDCC ” ( the government ’ s National Disaster Coordinating Council ) became top-trending topics on Twitter last Saturday .
a sample of Twitter posts :

Mauritanian Teachers Break into Education Minister &apos;s Office
&#91; note : all links are in Arabic &#93;
a group of secondary school teachers broke into and entered the office of the Minister of Education in protest against the arbitrary transfer of 120 teachers to other schools .
the transfers were made to punish teachers who participated in last year &apos;s strikes demanding the improvement of the conditions of employees in the education sector .
the teachers considered this act a punishment for a strike they held to demand of their rights and also a violation of civil service law in Mauritania .
for his part , Mohamed Ould Rabani , Secretary General of the independent syndicate of secondary education teachers , slammed the transfer as a dangerous precedent in the history of Mauritania and asked his colleagues not to conform to the ministry &apos;s orders .
in the same context , another group of arbitrary transferred teachers , held a demonstration in front of the Education Minister Ahmed Ould Bah &apos;s office , denouncing the decision and demanding its immediate retreat .
some of them also protested in front of the presidential palace in Nouakchott and threatened to resign from their posts in case the decision is not retracted .
it is worth mentioning that the ministry had suspended the salaries of hundreds of teachers after their participation in the strikes organized by the syndicate .
photograph of the protesting teachers posted on Twitter by
@ mejdmr
the National Syndicate for Secondary Education issued a statement condemning the arbitrary transfer :
the Mauritanian Ministry of Education arbitrarily transferred dozens of secondary education teachers because of their participation in legitimate strikes which is considered a dangerous violation of the rights of syndicate members , especially the right to demonstrate , which is guaranteed by article 14 in the constitution and by the international agreements signed by our country , such as the the International Labor Convention number 87 , which is related to syndicate freedoms .
Tiguend blog posts a testimony of one the teachers effected by the transfers , entitled “ This is why I deserve the sanction ” where he speaks of the injustice of that decision :
I have been teaching for 10 years in Trarza region and never during those years have I got less then 17 points &#91; out of a total of 20 &#93; on my evaluation .
I have worked with various directors and my salary has never been suspended except this time because of my participation in the strike .
I have no record of absence or slackening in my duties and everything is fine , thanks God , until the director Mohamed Ould el Talib came and sent a report to the Rousou School director to whom he reports , asking him to give me a 6 / 20 grade and to accuse me of snitching and gossip , which he has been bragging about since his illegal nomination as head of administration .
all this was a reason to transfer me arbitrarily along with 16 other teachers in Trarza whose only fault is to have taken part in the strike knowing that the law guarantees this right and the constitution protects it for a noble life and a more dignified education .
Mauritan.net says that the transfer is a result of a complaint , accusing the teachers of “ inciting strikes and exercising politics ” :
the transfer of the teachers was based on directors reports via the governors and the letters of the governors ’ letters stated that they are inciting strikes and practicing politics .
Dedda Cheikh Brahim criticizes the way the Mauritanian regime is dealing with teacher &apos;s protests :
in the military democracy , protests are punishable and the teachers are now paying for it in a legal way
he adds :
the teachers were transferred after they decided to demand their rights .
there is God oh Mauritanian
Mauritanian journalist Mohamed Ould Salem also slammed the Minister of Education for creating a crisis in the education sector :
Ould Bah doesn &apos;t breathe ordinary Oxygen but lives from making crises and injustice .
this is why he decided to punish 108 of the best teachers because they participated in legal strikes .
he adds :
a new date with a year marked with a crisis in the education sector with 108 teachers refusing punitive transfer and education syndicates promising to make the decision fall and a minister who is very creative in making up crises and accumulating failure
Nasser Al Hachemi tweets :
it is humiliation and tyranny .
my heart with you oh you holders of the light
activist Mejdi Ahmed also had his word about the matter :
the teachers protested yesterday in the Education Minister premises asking to renounce the decision of transferring them – a decision they judged unfair .
Al Cheikh Ould Horma also tweeted :
in Mauritania the teachers insist to ideologize the conflict with minister who in turn insists of ideologizing the teachers demand
he concluded :
the academic year is about to start in Mauritania and the battle starts again between the Minister and the syndicates .

Italy Condemned for Violations of African Refugee Rights
this post is part of our special coverage on Refugees .
on February 23 , 2012 , the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has come to a historic judgment , that Italy violated the European Convention on Human Rights by intercepting and sending back Eritrean and Somali migrants to Libya .
African Refugees by Vito Manzari on Flickr ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
Unione Diritti Umani Blog explains &#91; it &#93; the events :
the Hirsi case and others versus Italy pertains to the first push back operation carried out on May 6 , 2009 , in international waters , 35 miles south of Lampedusa .
Italian authorities intercepted a boat carrying some 200 Somalis and Eritreans , including children and pregnant women .
the migrants were then taken on board an Italian ship , sent back to Tripoli , and handed over against their will to Libyan authorities .
they were not identified , no one listened to them or informed beforehand of their actual destination .
in fact , the migrants were convinced that were heading toward the Italian coast .
after this operation , 11 Somali citizens and 13 Eritrean citizens , who were found and helped in Libya by the Italian Council for Refugees , brought action against Italy before the European Court of Justice .
assistance was provided by Anton Giulio Lana and Andrea Saccucci , from the Union of Lawyers for Protection of Human Rights .
GiulioL &#91; it &#93; described the operation upon their arrival in Tripoli &#91; it &#93; on the blog ilmalpaese :
the Libyan police were awaiting them on the dock with container trucks ready to pick them up , like livestock onto cattle cars , and then send them to various prisons around the country .
a photojournalist , Enrico Dagnino , who was on board the patrol boat , described in detail the violence in this operation .
after that , the proceedings were censored .
this action led to the non-implementation of the principles governing the treatment of people fleeing from danger , Henry Oliver explains on the UK Human Rights blog :
the return involved a violation of Article 3 ( anti-torture and inhumane treatment ) , Article 4 of Protocol 4 ( collective expulsion of aliens ) , and Article 13 ( right to an effective remedy ) .
the patrols that returned migrants to Libya were in breach of the non-refoulement principle .

the old Italian government , formed by Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s party , Popolo della libertà ( People of Freedom ) , and Umberto Bossi &apos;s extreme right party , the Northern League , created a legal arsenal and took steps against immigration in Italy , which have been denounced on several occasions by civil society and the Catholic Church .
Italy has also been condemned on various instances for its anti-immigration policy , which is inconsistent with European treaties .
Gabriele Del Grande &apos;s blog fortresseurope.blogspot.com &#91; it &#93; publishes information about Fortess Europe &apos;s activities for the defense of immigrant rights .
the association has produced a great number of reports , first hand accounts and films on refugee treatment in Italy as well as in other European countries .
here he describes prison life &#91; it &#93; in Libya during the rule of the old regime :
we are in Misratah , 210 km east of Tripoli , in Libya .
all the prisoners here are Eritrean asylum seekers , arrested offshore of Lampedusa or in immigrant neighborhoods in Tripoli .
Collateral victims of Italy &apos;s and Libya &apos;s cooperation against immigration .
more than 600 people , of whom 58 are women , there are also several children and babies in the group .
they have been in prison for over two years , but none of them has been tried .
up to 20 people sleep laid out on mats or foam mattresses in windowless rooms measuring 4 meters by 5 .
during the day , they are placed under the police &apos;s vigilant eye into a courtyard , measuring 20 meters by 20 , onto which the rooms open .
they are all between 20 and 30 years old .
and what did they do wrong ?
attempt to reach Europe in search of asylum .
the blog observatoirecitoyen.over-blog.org discloses that :
the principle of non-refoulement , enshrined in the 1951 in the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , prohibits sending a person back to a country where his life or freedom may be threatened .
from May to July 2009 , some 602 migrants were intercepted at sea and immediately turned away .
they were chiefly sent back to Libya , a country where “ every person arrested risks being subjected to serious mistreatment , ” or of being sent back to a country where such risks do exist , the CPT remarked ( Committee for the Prevention of Torture ) .
of course , the CPT admits , “ States have the sovereign right to protect their borders and control immigration , ” but Italy should review its procedures to ensure that all intercepted migrants first receive care and can apply for asylum .
unfortunately in Europe , Italy is not the only country to carry out forced mass repatriations .
this association reports &#91; it &#93; that :
this data was updated on December 7 , 2011 , and was based on the census data from the international press archives over the past 23 years .
the real figure could be much higher .
no one knows how many ships have wrecked since we have never heard .
only the families of the missing persons know .
these families , from Morocco to Sri Lanka , have been questioning for years what has happened to their children who left one day for Europe and never came back .
Paolo Lambruschi , for his part , wrote &#91; it &#93; on website of the Italian Episcopal Conference &apos;s newspaper :
and , something which concerns all EU countries , the operations of Frontex patrols in the Mediterranean will be revised , because for the first time the pushing back of groups at borders and on the high seas is tantamount to mass deportations .
Italy will have to pay 15,000 euros plus legal costs to 22 of 24 plaintiffs , 11 Somalis and 13 Eritreans .
the other two are dead .
Gabriele Del Grande &apos;s blog fortresseurope.blogspot.com concludes &#91; it &#93; :
one day , at Lampedusa and at Zouara , at Samos at Evros , at Las Palmas and at Motril , shrines will be erected with the victims ’ names from these years of repression of freedom of movement .
and we won &apos;t be able to tell our grandchildren that we didn &apos;t know .

India : conflict Over Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Continues
the Atomic Power Project in Koodankulam in the Tirunelveli district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu has started operations last month amidst protests ( see Global Voices report ) .
the plant has started generating electricity but the situation is becoming worse as arrests are still being carried out and protesters remain in jail .
this week also marks a call for a fortnight of protests across India in solidarity with people ’ s struggle against the Nuclear Plant .
on Sunday , 14th of October , the revolutionary Democratic Front issued a statement condemning the illegal detention and , arrest on the members of an all-Indian fact finding team to Koodankulam nuclear plant in Tamil Nadu .
the team was detained at Nanguneri on the 12th of October , 20 km away from Koodankulam on charges of “ illegal assembly ” .
after a daylong detention , the police charged them under different sections of Criminal Law Amendment Act .
the team members have been taken to Palayamkottai prison .
according to Sanhati :
“ The people of Koodankulam have been bravely fighting against the nuclear power plant which has come up in their homes and hearths for months now .
the government instead of responding to their just demands and concerns for the immense security risk and the environmental hazard that this plant can cause on the surrounding area , has responded with the most cruel repression on the protesting masses .
their attempt to restrict and repress this fact-finding team also clearly shows how they do not want the people to speak out or even knows about the conditions in Koodankulam or about the valiant movement the people are fighting there .
the government is simply trying to intimidate and throttle all voices of solidarity and support to the people fighting against Koodankulam nuclear plant .
protesters across the nation send in their signatures to kudankulam , India , in solidarity with the anti nuclear campaign .
image by Dipti Desai .
also on Sunday , the Socialist Janata ( Democratic ) Party in Kerala voiced support to people agitating against the proposed nuclear project at Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu .
women from the protests are still in prison .
Anitha S. writes about them in a post titled ‘ Koodankulam women from prison : tell everyone we are still here !
Xavieramma said , “ We are here so that the world will not see any more nuclear power plants that are dangerous and uneconomic … I saw that there are so many people in various parts of the country who are raising their protest .
it is not just about losing their land and sea , but it is about the creation of spaces where life itself is in danger .
who would want to live in such places ? ”
as another woman Selvi said , “ It is only after being part of the struggle that we realized that trying to establish one ’ s right to live as one wishes , pursuing traditional livelihoods and also questioning activities that are being implemented without consulting the people is equivalent to crime and sedition . ”
as Sundari said , “ We are here for a common cause- we are here for the world .
they wanted to tell the world that they are here , inside , locked up only physically within concrete and iron .
“ Tell everyone we are still here ” .
they are still in the Women ’ s Prison of Trichy , holding on to their vision of a world that is “ free from one of the most toxic of human inventions ” .
Kenya : devastating Drought Worsens Human-Wildlife Conflict
no grass in sight
Kenya is experiencing the worst drought in more than a decade according to the country &apos;s meteorological department .
this drought has been felt throughout the country , but it is more visible among the Maasai community who &apos;s primary source of livelihood is cattle .
faced by the danger of loosing their valued livestock , the Maasai , a traditional nomadic community resident in southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania , are driving their cattle into wildlife areas – and even cities – in search of pasture .
this has worsened human-wildlife conflict as the weakened cows fall prey to lions and other predators .
the Lion Guardians blog reports that there has not been any good rain in two years .
the drought is worsening day by day .
it has not rained properly for two consecutive years , and the pastoralist Maasai community who inhabit the &#91; Mbirikani &#93; group ranch have moved their livestock in three directions in search of greener pastures .
the cows are all becoming very thin , and many are dying .
Predator Aware , a group that works towards conservation of predators , is also reporting some dire situations in Masai Mara wildlands and Siana ranches in the southern part of Kenya .
in the Predetor Aware blog they say :
the Masai Mara and Siana in particular is running out of grazing &#91; pasture &#93; as the need for rain continues .
last night there appeared to be a storm over the Reserve some where .
we are hoping this is an indicator and more rain will come .
this dry weather really increases the human-wildlife conflict as the search for water and grazing goes on .
although wildlife are better able to cope with drought , cattle are very badly hit .
the Maasai , being traditionally nomadic pastoralists , will do what they have done for generations , they will move their cattle to seek pasture .
it happens that the only places with open pasture are protected areas such as national parks and reserves .
ironically , most of the world famous parks in Kenya were carved out of traditional Maasai reserve pastures .
the Lion Guardians blog describes the movement of the Maasai groups living adjacent to Amboseli National Park :
the first group moved their livestock all the way to Manyara in Tanzania .
others decided to take their cattle to Tsavo West National Park , but they have been experiencing serious clashes with the park authorities , who are trying to prevent the pastures of the national park from being overgrazed by cattle , leaving the ground bare .
some of the these herders have traveled with their cattle for more than 400 km in search of pasture and water .
some have moved northwards towards Nairobi City after a little rain was reported some weeks ago , while others have moved south into Tanzania .
the severity of the drought can be heard in the words of ole Lentura , the key blogger at Predator Aware .
‘ The days bring hot sun and a lot of wind &apos; , says ole Lentura who reports that wildlife that are traditionally grazers ( feed on grass ) are being forced to browse on trees and bushes as they adapt to the absence of grass .
“ Elders in the group ranch are describing this drought as the worst ever , and with price of consumer goods sky-rocketing while the price of selling livestock and other domestic products are falling , the situation is triggering a catastrophic food crisis ” say the Lion Guardians .
of the human wildlife conflict ole Lentura of Predator Aware says “ No predator incidents to report but another Maasai man sadly was killed by a buffalo over the weekend .
this human-wildlife conflict will not lessen until we get some good rain . ”
Iran : Tehran &apos;s Non-Declared Curfew Amid NAM Summit
the 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement started amid heavy security presence in Tehran , August 26 , 2012 .
the 120-nation strong Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) , a holdover from the Cold War &apos;s pull between East and West , is also seen by Iran and others as an alternative forum for current world discussions .
Iran says it has planned talks on a peace plan to end Syria &apos;s civil war , but no rebel factions will attend because of Tehran &apos;s close bonds with Bashar Assad &apos;s regime .
Tehran &apos;s ‘ non-declared curfew ’
the Summit is being held from 26-31 August in Tehran .
the Iranian State has shut down Iran &apos;s capital for five days and has mobilized 110,000 policemen to “ guarantee NAM security . ”

Bonbast Akhtar writes :
according to several reports there are several security check points in Tehran and a heavy security presence in Tehran .
it is like a non-declared curfew .
security forces also check inside a lot of cars on their way for holidays &#91; Iranian State declared five days holidays during NAM summit &#93; on Chalous Road … Protesters in 2009 &#91; after controversial presidential election &#93; humiliated security forces and now they want to prove their authority and their importance .
blogger Sayeh Azadi published a couple of photos from security forces and writes if ‘ EU and USA had listed Basijs &#91; a paramilitary volunteer militia &#93; on the terrorist list , this regime &apos;s beasts would not dare to intimidate people . ’
protesting against the regime ?
security is not the only topic Iranian bloggers talk about , some see the NAM summit as an opportunity to protest against the regime .
Sabzarman writes &#91; fa &#93; the presence of thousands of reporters and foreign guests is a rare opportunity for the Green Movement to make its voice heard in the world .
among other things the blogger invites Iranians to write slogans in English with green spray on posters and walls close to the place where the summit is being held .
a group of students and political activists launched a Facebook campaign inviting Ban-Ki Moon , the United Nations General Secretary who is attending the NAM Summit , to visit detained opposition leaders , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi .
they published this open latter on the page :
Mr. Secretary General ,
I am an Iranian citizen , and as a concerned Iranian I would like to invite you to visit Mr.Mir Hussein Mousavi during your stay in Tehran for the 16th Non-aligned Movement ( NAM ) summit .
Mr Mousavi , the opposition leader , was recently hospitalized due to heart complications after 15 months of house arrest … The democratic aspirations and the just demands of the Iranian people deserve the support of the international community , including the United Nations and the Secretary General .
your position as the international authority entrusted with the responsibility for the protection and promotion of universal human rights accords you a special role .
we wish you success in discharging of this historical mission .
Azadi Esteghlal Edalat calls &#91; fa &#93; Iranians to become united with one voice and turn the NAM summit into a nightmare for the regime .
the blogger says :
NAM Summit created a golden opportunity to protest against the regime &apos;s crimes and support the Green Movement .
hoping people flood the streets .
we should try our best for any protest action .
Estade Mordan says &#91; fa &#93; :
I do not understand why noone does anything .
this summit is a great opportunity to protest against the regime .
how long should we wait for somebody to do something for us .
Mousavi ?
Karrubi ? Reza Pahlavi &#91; Iran &apos;s last Shah &apos;s son &#93; ?
or Morsi now … I as a member of the Green Movement call for a demonstration on Thursday , Agust 30,2012 from Imam Hossein to Azadi Square , as Mousavi called us to demonstrate three years ago .
let &apos;s inform people via social media and all other means .

in December 2008 , 20 Somali students overcame huge odds and graduated from medical school in Mogadishu — the first batch to do so for almost two decades in the failed Horn of Africa state .
Dr. Hafsa Abdurrahman Mohamed , 26 , was one of those receiving a diploma from the capital ’ s Benadir University .
upon completing her studies , she decided to work for the Doctors Without Borders / Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) , using her skills to help provide free medical care in Somalia .
the East African Philosopher comments on Somali President Sharif Ahmed &apos;s visit to US and the US government &apos;s policy shift in dealing with Sharif :
in December of 2006 Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , currently only-in-name president of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia , was on the run from the Ethiopian army , the CIA , and the U.S. Rangers .
East African Philisophers continues :
this week Sheikh Sharif is in Minneapolis , MN ( and the home of this crazy congresswoman ) meeting with Congressmen , Governor , and city councilmen / mayor .
couple of months ago he had a meeting with Secretary Clinton in Nairobi during her Africa trip .
from terrorist to president for Sheikh Sharif in just two years .
that , friends , must be a first .
to me this says a lot about the U.S. ’ s awful foreign policy than anything else .
the Kenya Somali Blog says Somali government is recruiting Somali youth from Kenya :
Somalia &apos;s U.N.-backed government has recruited more than 170 young Kenyans and former servicemen to help it fight rebels in the failed Horn of Africa state , local leaders in eastern Kenya said .
Mohamed Gabow , the mayor of Garissa , told Reuters the enrolment of ethnic Somali Kenyans was being conducted at a home in Bulla Iftin village , on the outskirts of his town .
the recruitment is not a secret .
those involved are not worried .
they are going around all the villages to announce the exercise , ” Gabow said in an interview late on Thursday .
fuel Price Protests in Several Indonesian Cities
several Indonesian cities were rocked by protests against petrol price hikes in the past few weeks .
according to local media reports , violence marred some of the protests which resulted in injuries .
initially , the Indonesian government was planning to raise the petrol price on April 1 .
there was no official statement about the adjusted petrol price .
currently the subsidized petrol known locally as Premium is sold at IDR 4,500 ( USD 0.50 ) per liter .
without the state subsidy , Premium could cost around IDR 8,400 ( USD 0.92 ) per liter .

Gianrigo Marletta , a Jakarta-based video journalist posted the following video on YouTube .
the protests last month and the active military presence in the cities to secure the protests somehow refreshed memories of the nation &apos;s past experience with fuel riots .
back in 1998 , the country descended into chaos following the government &apos;s plan to increase the fuel price .
Chinese-Indonesian shop houses were torched by furious mobs , somewomen were raped , student protesters were kidnapped and gunned down , and in the end , Indonesia &apos;s longest running president Suharto was forced to resign .
on his timeline , Twitter user @ cuapolitik said that it &apos;s about time to increase the fuel price .
he reasons :
if we don &apos;t raise fuel ( prices ) , the subsidy for the diesel fuel and premium in 2012 will jump from IDR 123.6T to IDR 191.1T.
in fact , it would be better to allocate the subsidy ( budget ) for infrastructure , education , and health ( improvements ) .
the people would benefit more from them .
the least fortunate people will benefit more from the fuel price hike , because they &apos;re not the biggest fuel consumers .
the price of subsidized fuel is way too low compared to prices abroad , this triggers smuggling and misuse .
smugglers are the ones who benefit more from this .
since they &apos;re being subsidized , the fuel prices in this country are far cheaper compared to the similar items in neighboring countries .
therefore , smugglers are enjoying the price differences , they hurt our economy and all of us .
all these times people said that the government created a policy to raise fuel prices .
that &apos;s wrong , it &apos;s a policy to control deficit .
the fuel subsidy is a policy from a by-gone era .
at that time , we can have subsidy because we &apos;re an ( oil ) exporting country .
now we &apos;re an ( oil ) importing country , and we &apos;re no longer an OPEC member .
Furtheremore , back then our fuel consumptions were low , way different to what we are experiencing today .
hence , the subsidy policy has to change gradually .
blogger Sony Haryo Prabowo wrote a post on his blog , saying that demonstrators in Makassar , Sulawesi , have wrongly targeted fuel resellers :
from numerous petrol stations in Indonesia ( baring its name ) , Pertamina owns only 74 among them ( source : Pertamina Retail ) .
thousands others are owned and managed by private owners .
therefore what the protesters have done by destroying petrol stations are forcing business owners to lose their daily bread , and terminate jobs for the employees if the stations stop to operate altogether .
Sony concluded :
the protesters also blocked the streets , trashed private cars , even hijacked a known softdrink truck .
I invite my readers to discuss and reflect .
in democracy , demonstration may take place .
however , we should start the protest with good base and reasoning .
the protest in Makassar proves that some of the students in Indonesia don &apos;t use common sense .
they only do what they want to do without reflecting on the loss they could cause .
more ridiculously , they seemed to protest without understanding the real issue .
Twitter users have maximized the microblogging site to report clashes between the police and students in Jakarta .
they also debated if the price increase is appropriate .
@ ikovoz : the rumor about one died during the Salemba clash was a hoax .
now 3 students and 1 security guard are being treated in RSCM ( Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital ) .
@ LBH _ Jakarta : police was doing a security sweeping at the Legal Aid Foundation ( LBH ) , 47 students arrested by force .
6 arrested near LBH .
total of 52 students taken to the district police .
@ komar _ hidayat : aside from the rising petrol price , is there any sign that says the people &apos;s life is improving ?
new jobs are available ?
@ BankDunia : 40 % of those who benefit from the subsidy scheme are households , 10 % of them are the well off households
Haiti : getting the Word Out
the Livesay &#91; Haiti &#93; Weblog has been really committed to updating its posts , with Troy , the head of the family , tweeting regularly and posting images to his flickr photostream .
Troy , an American doing missionary work in Haiti , does not hide his admiration for the tenacity of the Haitian people :
the amount of the current suffering caused by the earthquake cannot possibly be known right now … the numbers cannot be estimated .
but , if the way they deal with day to day hardship is any indication – the people of Haiti will rise .
his wife , Tara , also offers handy information :
diesel is going to go fast and will be needed for any sort of communication .
coming down if you are not willing to risk and get in and clean out horrific wounds would just tax an already taxed place .
medical professionals should contact organizations with the ability to coordinate efforts and try to get here .
it won &apos;t help to have more non-medical people to feed and house .
hope that does not sound harsh – but it is truth .
heart wrenching testimonies and photographs were also coming from how can they hear :
on my way out , I saw our dresser moving , the kitchen cabinets shake and spit out all sorts of cans , and the house moving as if it was made out of jello .
I had never seen anything like that .
but I only realized it was an earthquake when I finally got outside and saw people running in all directions .
some crying .
some rushing .
others wailing .
wailing as if life was pulled from within them .
the blog also offers information on how best to help in the midst of an untenable situation , which , judging by the blog &apos;s most recent post , is worsening :
things are starting to get a little scary .
we realize that the destruction in Jacmel is more than we first thought .
I just found out that there are still hundreds of people here in Jacmel trapped under the rubble .
you can smell the dead people in the downtown area where much damage occurred .
the other question is the issue of water .
will it run out soon ?
will we be able to have access anywhere to clean safe water ?
I don ’ t know .
Pwoje Espwa – Hope in Haiti also blogs about their experiences :
the local general hospital is already filled with people who were hurt in the capitol .
there are doctors and nurses but nothing else .
no medicine , no sheets , no bandages , no food for them .
some are languishing on the floor .
keep them and us in your prayers .
the blog &apos;s most recent update talks about the fact that “ EdH ( Electricite d &apos;Haiti ) will start rolling out rations of electricity as the fuel supply is dwindling ” :
the plan is to provide electricity at night for security and a few hours during the day .
only one gas station is open at this time and folks are predicting super high prices .
met a man on the street this morning who comes from Jacmel which was hit hard by the earthquake .
he was talking to himself in Kreyole , French , Spanish with a sprinkling of English .
he spoke to me but I could not make out what he was saying .
he abruptly turned away and walked into the darkness .
witnessing the massive destruction and loss of life can make anyone lose it .
Blesh Family in Haiti Weblog also posts information :
the situation is quite bad .
most of the major markets for food are crumbled .
the banking system is down .
there is only partial internet and cell phone service .
to make it clear from someone on the ground here … I have not kept up with the news and who is doing what but I ’ ll tell you that Haiti is a mess .
the infrastructure is in shambles .
still , partial Internet access in the context of such widespread devastation is nothing short of a small miracle – and Multilink Haiti , one of the country &apos;s Internet Service Providers , has taken the initiative and started tweeting , providing much-needed information and re-tweeting pleas to help find missing loved ones .
one of the most dedicated users of Twitter is hotelier Richard Morse , whose coverage of the situation has been stellar .
changing Perspectives , while located in neighbouring DR , posts a report from a missionary located near Jeremie in Haiti :
our phones are still out and not working and there is no way for people to get to Port to check on their families even if they wanted to .
we have no boats coming to Jeremie and we hear that the road to Cayes across the mountains is ruined in several places and no vehicles can pass .
this means that families can not get to Port to find out where their families are .
this is very , very hard on everyone .
in a later post , she gives news about an apparently under-utilised hospital in the north of the island :
Hopital Sacre Coeur ( Sacred Heart Hospital ) is full-service hospital , fully staffed , volunteer teams both on site and standing by , ready to go .
we can take up to * 200 injured patients * immediately !
we have operating rooms and beds .
we have discharged other patients whose condition is less serious .
we have cleared a soccer field for helicopter landing .
real Hope For Haiti Rescue Center , meanwhile , is also trying to help with medical aid and writes :
I do not pretend to understand the suffering that is happening right now in this country .
I know we all feel like we had had enough over the years .
the staff has come in to work .
they are praying for their loves ones in town .
they are hoping for news and believing that they will soon here from them .
mothers and father are weeping for their lost children .
children are crying for their lost parents .
the reality is even when the outside world begins &#91; to arrive &#93; , what can be done ?
still , the outside world wants to know .

Arab World : swine Flu Fever Continues
swine flu or H1N1 is still making headlines across the Arab world as new cases continue to be discovered by health authorities and announced in the Press on a daily basis .
in Bahrain , Silly Bahraini Girl ( which is me ) is back home and surprised at what she saw at her country &apos;s airport :
reality of how mad this place has become smacks you in the face the second you land at the Bahrain International Airport and see all the ground staff wearing surgical masks , from the ground handling staff to the immigration and customs officers .
“ What &apos;s wrong with you ? ” I ask them .
“ Is there a plague in Bahrain ? ” I continue questioning &#91; ... &#93; the situation seemed tense and and the level of swine madness was certainly the highest I have come across everywhere I have travelled through since pig mania gripped Planet Earth .
why wasn &apos;t there a single person wearing a mask at the airports of San Francisco , Chicago , Toronto and Heathrow which I have travelled
through over the past few weeks ?
still in Bahrain , Sohail Al Gosaibi smells a conspiracy in the air , noting that exaggerating the effect of swine flu benefits the media , advertising and pharmaceutical industries .
the Saudi blogger writes :
the media almost always exaggerate the situation , remember that fears sells .
and newspapers and news channels have to sell advertising space and airtime to make money , and the more shocking and scary their stories , the more viewers and readers they have , which leads to more advertisers , and more profits .
Al Gosaibi also quotes an article he has read and concludes :
according to the article , the US and UK governments have billions of dollars worth of Tamifluiflu stock that they must use within the next few months , or they ’ ll expire .
interesting , huh ?
and speaking of theories , Jordan Reform Watch also has something up his sleeve and writes :
Ahhh .. The swine-flu with all the accompanying conspiracy theories .. A Jordanian “ Scientist ” specializing in diseases claims that Mecca And Medina are somehow isolated from disease , thus there is no need for the talk about the possible outbreaks that might result from the millions of pilgrims being in extreme proximity while performing Hajj ..
kill them Pigs .. Go To hajj .. You will be disease free ..
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia , who blogs at Egyptian Chronicles , is also concerned about how the disease will spread during the Hajj &#91; annual Muslim pilgrimage season to Mecca &#93; , where millions of pilgrims from around the world converge to Mecca to perform the ritual .
she notes :
the discussion about the future of Pilgrimage “ Hij ” and Omra &#91; smaller pilgrimage &#93; this year is still debatable .
the minister of health wants to cancel Omra where as the minister of tourism is against the cancellation , I do not need to speak about Pilgrimage .
of course the debate is much hotter among the clerics themselves .
Saudi Arabia understands the challenge it is facing already and decided to deal with the situation as much as it can in the Omra and pilgrimage , it recommends that pregenant women , elderly and kids to avoid pilgrimage this year , I really respect this move .
I also have a better suggestion .
in such circumstances why not to limit Omra and pilgrimage for the first time pilgrims only from men and women
our final stop is in Syria , where blogger Yaser Arwani links to a news story which says that Syria &apos;s first swine flu case was recently reported in a Syrian doctor , who works in Australia and was on a visit to her country .
the female doctor travelled to Syria through Dubai International Airport and the disease was not detected until a few days after her arrival .
Angola : MPLA wins over 80 % of votes and secures 191 seats
the final results of the Parliamentary Elections disclosed late last night by Angola &apos;s National Electoral Commission confirmed the ruling party the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ‘ s victory with 81,64 % ( 5,266,216 votes ) .
the runner up , the main opposition party National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , had 10.39 % ( 670,363 votes ) .
this means that the MPLA makes 191 of the 220 elected Members of Parliament , while UNITA will have 16 , PRS 8 and the ND and FNLA both will have 2 seats ( click here for a full list of those elected , by region ) .
Jorge Santos from Leste de Angola was among the first bloggers announcing the following results :
Camara de Comuns publishes an analysis from reader Rui Miguel Menezes Vaz , who lives in Bié , one of the most battered provinces during the war .
he explains why he believes the results were for the better :
there is no need to go very far to realize that the MPLA , even if a manipulative and dominating party , was the only way to stability .
UNITA had not once presented a framework at the level of government , capable of moving forces .
Moreover , the only ones able to lead were excluded from these elections and people did not forget the past .
during the election period it was easily observed that the MPLA had more rights to air time and more prominence .
but wasn &apos;t it this party that led the country to evolve and Angola to attract all this investment ?
Carlos Lopes commented on what this result means to the opposing party UNITA , which lost more than 50 of its seats , saying that “ worse than losing the war was losing the elections ” .
he said the results in Luanda at least were surprising :
the problem was not even the message of ‘ change &apos; , which was well accepted and ‘ stuck ’ in the voters ’ ears , but rather a serious problem of assessing the potential of the electorate in terms of outcome , that &apos;s to say the amount of votes that the party would gather in that province , municipality and commune .
the leaders have invested and bet in places where voters did not match the expectations created , because those who directed the UNITA campaign , based on unreliable and some non-existent data , failed to bridge the gaps that appeared , often out of ignorance
Luciano Canhanga analyses the situation for smaller parties which didn &apos;t get much confidence from the polls and now are at risk :
out of the competing parties that failed to get seats , only the PDP _ ANA is free of compulsory extinction , as it tangentially managed to get the 0.5 % of the general votes required by law .
those who did not run this time must compete in 2012 , under threat of extinction .
( … ) And what about parties such as the PRD , PPE and FOCAC which claim to have achieved the 15 thousand signatures that enabled them to compete in the race , but that after the ballot ended with less than 15 thousand votes ?
Koluki publishes a link to the Human Rights Watch report ‘ Angola : irregularities Marred Historic Elections &apos; , published last September 15 highlighting that there was ‘ no independent oversight , media bias &apos; .
she provides her own observations on the document , and concludes :
in short , I believe that the election results are not determined only during the election campaigning or on the election day , they are determined over years by voters who gather life experience that ultimately dictate their voting decisions , although , unfortunately , the electoral process does not happen in so transparent a way as we wished , for the sake of the voters themselves , who is to say the people and nation .
the September 5 election was the first since 2002 , when the 27-year civil war fought between then rival factions MPLA and UNITA came to an end .
Angolans will choose a president next year .
Mauritania : anger over US Ambassador Statement
photograph of the protest facing the US Embassy in Nouakchott – Posted on the Facebook page of the Youth of Democratic Forces Gathering
on January 23 , the opposition group “ Youth of Democratic Forces Gathering ” ( Jeunesse RFD ) , staged a protest facing the US Embassy in Nouakchott .
earlier , in October 2012 , Jo Ellen Powell , US Ambassador in Mauritania had wished in a conference the failure of the opposition , comparing its members to “ cats . ” The American Diplomat also indicated that RFD chief Ahmed Ould Daddah thinks he is the true born or the legitimate heir of his brother &apos;s rule , former president Moktar Ould Daddah .
the discourse had been made public on the February 25 Movement YouTube Page and had stirred a controversy in Mauritanian media .
on its Facebook Page , RFD slammed the US Ambassador &apos;s remarks :
we at RFD Youth , heard a statement by US Ambassador in Mauritania , made public by February 25 Movement in which she backs the Military Regime which is oppressing our people and mocks the opposition and slams its leader Ahmed Ould Dadah directly .
is Ghana Ready For e-Voting ?
a two-day event which began yesterday ; is being organized by the Danquah Institute ( DI ) , a policy think tank , research and analysis centre , to create a national platform for stakeholders to lead the discussion on the possibility of facilitating the adoption of biometric voter registration , and subsequently the e-voting system in Ghana .
the Danquah Institute has hailed the successful conclusion of electronic voting in the world &apos;s largest democracy and called on Ghana &apos;s Electoral Commission to consider the numerous benefits of electronic voting as demonstrated in this latest poll .
according to Honorable Haruna Iddrisu , Minister of Communication ,
even though the implementation of both the biometric voter registration which is been handled by the National Identification Authority and e-Voting were practicable in the long term , they could not be introduced anytime soon ” .
he also added :
“ All political parties have endorsed biometric registration , which is prelude to e-voting and what we are doing here today will help to shape our electoral process in the future , but we do not have the requisite infrastructure for a speedy implementation of the all important projects in the short term ” .
therefore , government should still research more into its implementation by 2016 and not 2012 .
Musah Yahaya Jafaru from Graphic Ghana also reported on this event and had this to say ;
the Chairman of the Electoral Commission ( EC ) ; Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan stated ; “ If the government wouldn &apos;t educate the masses including his aged mother in the village about the benefits of e-Voting and how to use it , he wouldn &apos;t go in for it ” .
he also stressed ;
until we make the people comfortable with the use of the computer , we cannot go e-voting ” .
Dr Afari-Gyan said even developed countries such as Britain , Canada and Australia had not subscribed to e-voting and wondered why Nigeria and Kenya wanted to go e-voting .
he cited the increasing use of money by politicians to seek public office , the exaggerated importance of political parties , the involvement of the youth in election violence , strange campaign promises and the use of the media to fuel violence as some of the worrying trends in the country ’ s elections .
he said increasingly people were seeking public office not as a means to serve their people but primarily as a short-cut to fame , influence and wealth .
in a Press Statement by the Danquah Institute titled : Ghana ’ s Democracy Is Not There Yet , E-Voting May Get Us There .
Hayford from Sydney , Australia commented :
“ I feel proud as a Ghanaian that the country has people with such a great level of understanding .
I perfectly agree with the above suggestions .
if indeed our Electoral Commission really wants a more reliable and credible system of voting in Ghana , then I think the commission should have spearheaded the ideas highlighted above .
I want to beg the electoral commission not to down play on the E-voting system but should throw all its weight behind this system .
our women , children and the poor deserve to be spared the fear , anxiety and brutalities associated with the current system the gives room for Kenyan-like situations . ”
in my candid opinion and experience working with the National Identification Authority currently registering masses for the creating of a database of all Ghanaians , I support the advice of the current Electoral Commissioner on this subject .
my question is ; Is Ghana really ready for e-Voting ?

elections
electoral unrest has also motivated thousands out into the streets .
in Russia the result reporting more than 140 % of voters has already become a meme .
and although the Congolese diaspora was unable to vote , they made sure to get their voices heard by the world .
eastern and Central Europe
with the elections in Russia , online video has proven a useful tool in documenting electoral violations such as disappearing ink pens , paid voters and inflated turnouts as well as the later post electoral protests .
posts like Russia : no Violation of Election Violations and Russia : second Day of Post-Election Protests explain the motives behind the protests such as election results , blogger arrests and also the clashes with anti-activists groups recruited and shipped into Moscow from other regions to demonstrate support for Vladimir Putin .
an example of the electoral violations is the use of erasable pens left in voting booths :

international governments have already approached the Congolese government to intercede and stop the violence in their capitals .
culture
is culture found in the traditions handed down through generations or is it found in the behaviors and activities which get adopted and followed by the population ?

Zambia : President &apos;s Son New Luxury Cars Cause Uproar
it appears that there is no shortage of political revelations for Zambians these days .
in the midst of former President Banda &apos;s sons being scrutinized for questionable purchases before the elections , the new President &apos;s son Mulenga Sata , is now at the center of controversy following revelations by Committee of Citizens executive director Gregory Chifire that he recently acquired two expensive vehicles worth 1.8 billion Zambian Kwacha ( about US $ 200,000 ) .
Zambians weigh in on the revelation at Zambian Watchdog website :
Mpimpa says :
true to the PF political slogan of more money in your pockets , We have not seen this money , we still go to bed having only eaten one meal , and yet our neighbours are buying luxury cars at 1 billion .
what an example Mr. President .
please walk the talk this is inclusive of your immediate family .
President Michael Sata &apos;s son ( holding a camera ) .

Mukanwa mukikopo , then why are we questioning RB ’ s sons if we know that they have that privelledge of acquiring property as children of the sitting President ?
or just because it ’ s done by the son to the man you love so it ’ s normal ?
right now , people are demonising Liato over K2.1 billion and Liato has been a Minister for a long time.Mulenga , whose father has not even clocked 90 days in Office has so far spent K 1.8 billion .
you can imagine how much he will spend by the time his father has ruled this country for 5 years .
the article notes that Mulenga &apos;s primary occupation was as an importer of dogs for the Zambian market and so Sipho humorously weighs in :
on a more serious note , Kabanshi laments :
black Doyo defends Sata &apos;s son :
Poeple get your facts right !
MULENGA is a higly qualified civil engineer .
this guy is learned .
netizens have also been reacting to an unprecedented move in Zambian politics after the the president implored law enforcement agencies in the country to investigate his son and encouraged Mr Chifire to report any suspected unlawful activity linked to the first family to the relevant law enforcement agencies .
discussing this on Tumfweko.com , Tumbo Tumbo says :
he Sata has done what RB and other Presidents can never do .
Subjecting his own son to DEC and Police is commendable .
Chifire must be very careful , just like some blogs which judge others in newspapers without those accused having an opportunity to respond or defend themselves .
MULENGA Sata is a gentleman .
I hope Chifire has evidence .
he Sata must also tell and reveal to the nation what has happened to the report he asked about from Cabinet , and investigating wings about DR MITI whose appointment was revoked within 24 hours of being appointed as Ambassador to WHO , Geneva .
a Public feedback to Zambians is crucial just like his own Son , MULENGA .
we have a reliable , fearless President in HE Sata .
let Miti and MULENGA be cleared from the investigating wings of GRZ ! ! !
MULENGA , through his lawyers , has given Gregory Chifire 48 hours to apologise or take him to court .
Chifire says that he is not intimidated and is just waiting for the police to call him so that he can go and tell them what he knows .
Lebanon : runaway Maids
“ When a maid runs away from her employer &apos;s house , the police station is unable to act because there &apos;s no law criminalizing runaway maids .
so the police station officer tells the Lebanese employee to say that she stole money , ” writes Ethiopian Suicides .
Lebanon : the Rule of Dinosaurs
shortly after the recent harassments incidents in Lebanon , the term “ The Rule of Dinosaurs ” started to be used by cyber-activists in their campaign against this invasion of their cyberspace .
Lebanese blogger Tony explains what it means in his post entitled “ How to Tame Dinosaurs “ :
“ The Dinosaurs ” is the name given by some of the Lebanese e-activists to the politicians in Lebanon recently .
this came after they left the country &apos;s real problems to focus on suppressing freedoms , silencing people , banning books , plays and movies , arresting activists and being racist against foreigners .
the name is a joke of course , but our determination to bring them down is definitely not a joke , it is inevitable .
“ Dinosaurs of a feather flock together ” is the title of our battle .
Azerbaijan : more reaction to video blogger trial verdict
days after the sentencing of two video blogging youth activists in Azerbaijan , other bloggers are starting to speak out about the imprisonment of Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli .
the two online activists will spend 2 and 2.5 years in jail after a trial which most consider to be politically motivated and an attempt to silence dissent in the country .
they join others such as the Presidency of the European Union , the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International , and Reporters Without Borders as well as many others in condemning the verdict .
Amnesty International has also declared the two men to be prisoners of conscience .
interesting Times , an “ online initiative monitoring attempts throughout the world to censor and restrict free access to the Internet , ” puts the trial in context .
the latest show of repression by state forces in Azerbaijan leaves no doubt that both journalists and bloggers exercise their right to express themselves freely at their own risk .
thanks to international pressure such as the WPFC letter and several others , the Azeri government has been compelled to release journalists from prison .
but this latest act of repression against two bloggers leaves no doubt that , if left alone , public officials in Azerbaijan will continue their abusive ways .
notes from Abroad is also not surprised by the verdict .
on Tuesday , two young bloggers were sentenced to prison — one for two-and-a-half years , the other for two years — on the ridiculous charge of hooliganism .
the whole thing is a sham — driven by political motives , but it is not surprising .
since Azerbaijan is an oil-rich fiefdom , the West has treaded carefully in responding to this very undemocratic behavior by the Azeri government .
the Azeri government must be strongly condemned by the democracies of the world that this kind of behavior is unacceptable .
the Blogar , however , is nearly speechless .
so the verdict is in .
Emin and Adnan are officially hooligans .
at a loss here on what to say .
supposedly social media had a role in putting them behind bars , a role in getting the word out on the street about the injustice but was unable to change the minds of the corrupt Azerbaijan legal system .
dont mess with Ilham .
&#91; ... &#93; My thoughts are with their families and them .
however , with an appeal due to be lodged and possible action in the European Court of Human Rights , L4L , a new English-language Azeri blog , says that this is just the beginning .
what to do next ?
first of all we should not stop .
we should continue working towards liberty of our friends and towards freedom of all Azerbaijan . &#91; ... &#93; Adnan and Emin showed no fear and we should not be anything less than courageous and inspiring .
this is hardly end .
it all begins now .

Zambia Fixes Maize Price Again , Flustering World Bank
this post is part of our International Relations &amp; Security coverage .
a giant Nshima pot , Zambia 2008 .

Nshima , the stodgy porridge-like substance cooked out of maize-meal , has divided families and triggered food riots in Zambia at one time or other .
this is why subsequent governments have kept a keen eye on the growing , harvesting , buying and selling of maize-meal to consumers .
the production of maize — or corn as it is known in other parts of the world — is an even bigger issue in the mining region of the Copperbelt and metropolitan areas like the capital , Lusaka , where large working populations rely on the commercial supply of the product .
accordingly , maize determines the political direction of the nation .
in May , the World Bank urged the Zambian government not to interfere in determining the floor prices of maize sold by farmers to the Food Reserve Agency and other interested parties in the agri-business chain .
despite such calls , the Ministry of Agriculture announced this year ’ s floor price of maize at K65,000 ( about $ 13 USD ) per 50 kilo bag .
world Bank country director for Zambia , Malawi and Zimbabwe , Kundhavi Kadiresan criticized the decision and claimed that poor Zambian farmers were being exploited as some traders were buying maize from them in anticipation of re-selling it at a higher price to the state-run Food Reserve Agency .
Kadiresan also indicated that the World Bank is deeply concerned that not only does the government ’ s policy fail to ensure the long term sustainable growth of the agriculture sector , it also does very little to create jobs and reduce poverty .
Kadiseran could be excused .
Zambia ’ s agriculture sector revolves around maize , never mind the growing of other crops and livestock .
the bulk of the maize is grown by peasant farmers who are faced with regular droughts during the rainy season , an unreliable and expensive supply of fertilizer , and difficulties transporting the commodity to markets .
in 1986 , Zambians in the Copperbelt and Lusaka regions rioted because the price of maize increased several fold when incomes were stagnant .
four years later , unrest over price increases even sparked a coup attempt .
announcing the new maize floor price , agriculture and livestock minister Emmanuel Chenda said :
Chenda also revealed that the Government was putting in place programs to build additional storage facilities as a long-term measure to avoid wastage under the Food Reserve Agency ( FRA ) .
a few days before the minister ’ s statement , the FRA had destroyed huge stocks of rotten maize in various districts of the country .
said Chenda :
I wish to inform the nation that most of the waste under the FRA we have been experiencing is due to inadequate and unsuitable storage facilities … In order to address this challenge , Government has begun to put in place programs to build additional storage facilities as a long-term measure .

Saudi Arabia : will Swine Flu Threaten Hajj ?
every year millions of Muslims converge to Mecca to perform Hajj ( pilgrimage ) , one of the five pillars of Islam .
is this year &apos;s Hajj season being threatened by the A / H1N1 or Swine Flu virus ?
bloggers commenting on the region weigh in .
at CrossRoads Arabia , John Burgess explains :
a Saudi researcher in Shariah law find that there is precedent to ban Umrah pilgrims ( those who undertake the non-obligatory , ‘ lesser ’ pilgrimage ) who come from areas beset with the A / H1N1 or swine flu virus .
I suspect that this opinion is being floated now in anticipation of the Haj , which will take place in late November .
the Haj is obligatory , in that every Muslim is required to perform the pilgrimage at least once in his / her life , if feasible .
similar concerns were raised a few years ago , when bird flu ( H5N1 ) was threatening .
one Saudi scholar called for Haj to be canceled if there were a severe outbreak , but that proposal was shot down by others .
the argument was that Haj had never been canceled on public health grounds and that to do so would be counter to Islam .
rather , those who are ill are morally obliged to not perform Haj .
communicable diseases and Haj are historical companions .
there are many records of outbreaks of disease , from plague to cholera , killing thousands in Mecca , Madinah , and Jeddah over the years .
only toward the end of the 19th C. did strictly enforced quarantines &#91; 210-page PDF &#93; work to stop the spread of diseases out of the region , back to the homes of the pilgrims .
quarantines and strict enforcement of medical screening can protect pilgrims and that might be enough .
only time will tell .
swine flu , as bird flu before it , may turn out to be a non-issue .
if it does not , however , it good that people are starting to think about it now .
the Middle East Institute &apos;s Editor &apos;s Blog adds :
this is getting stranger and stranger .
the Grand Mufti of Egypt is suggesting Muslim scholars issue a collective fatwa &#91; religious edict &#93; to postpone the hajj due to swine flu .
Arabic version is here .
keep in mind — I know I keep repeating it — there have been no cases in Egypt .
in fact , according to WHO &apos;s rundown as of yesterday , the only cases confirmed in the entire Middle East are in Israel ( seven cases ) .
and WHO says , “ WHO is not recommending travel restrictions related to the outbreak of the influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus . ” Oh , yes , and another thing : the hajj isn &apos;t until November .
am I missing something here ?
has the hajj ever been postponed for health reasons , in all of Islamic history ?
I don &apos;t know , but I expect you &apos;d need at least one infected person to justify it .
( not only are there no cases in the Middle East , except Israel , but none in Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan — well , anywhere Muslim .
Nigeria : will Technology Impact 2011 Elections ?
Nigerians will go to the polls on 16 April 2011 to elect their new president .
the election was postponed from 9 April 2011 because of organizational difficulties .
in this post we are looking at how Nigerians are using technology to enhance electoral transparency , political participation and good governance .
take a Stand , Publicly !
Nigerians on social networking sites can take a public stand using Take a Stand website :
TakeAStand allows people to identify publicly with their positions on certain issues .
take a stand was built to fight apathy , double speak and non commitment by our friends and colleagues on the forthcoming Nigerian elections .
take a Stand is the ‘ option A4 * ’ of online voting * Option A4 also known as open ballot is the voting system that was used in the 1992 Presidential elections .
voters were required to line up behind the candidates they supported .
the 1992 elections is aclaimed to be the freest and fairest election held in Nigeria .
FAQ about Take a Stand :
what is the diffience &#91; sic &#93; between this and online voting Online voting is anonymous .
with TakeAStand , you stand by your vote publicly .
besides , you can stand for only one candidate unlike in online voting where you can use multiple email adderesses to vote for multiple people .
why are there only 4 candidates when there are about 18 contesting ?
exactly the same reason the 20 premier league clubs do not go to the Champion &apos;s League .
however , if enough people email info @ takeastand.com.ng requesting for a particular candidate , we will consider .
I am in a position of neutrality therefore I cannot state my position publicly ( e.g.
military , INEC official ) Fair pont .
journalists are not exempted though , they should balanced , not neutral .
I do not have a Facebook or Twitter account .
I am sorry , that is the only universal public identity tool .

reclaimnaija uses Ushahidi platform to monitor the Nigeria Elections 2011 .
reclaimnaija : my Vote , My Power !
the objectives of ReclaimNaija are :
writing at Ushahidi blog , Linda had this to say about ReclaimNaija :
the reclaimnaija platform , which is driven by the Ushahidi web engine , is a reporting platform set up as a mechanism for grassroots people to get their voices heard on issues of electoral transparency and governance .
the platform makes it possible for citizens to monitor the electoral process and report incidents of electoral fraud and other malpractices simply by sending text messages or calling dedicated numbers in four major languages ( Hausa , Igbo , Yoruba and Pidgin ) .
for the text messages , FrontlineSMS is what has been used as the SMS gateway .
citizens can also report to the platform via email , direct reporting on the site and twitter .
community Life Project successfully deployed the platform for promoting electoral transparency in the pre-election phase of the 2011 elections .
reclaim Naija is redefining election monitoring in Nigeria :
in addition , the reclaimnaija.net website serves as a one-stop online resource for information on the 2011 elections .
it features all the polling units , senatorial districts and wards , the Nigerian Constitution , information on candidates , the 2010 electoral act , the election timetable , electoral guidelines , certified voters ’ registration figures , political parties as well as civic and voter education modules .
for the first time in our history , citizens of this country have a formidable platform for promoting electoral transparency and popular participation .
citizens were able to positively influence the electoral process .
for instance , a lot of reports came from communities with limited access to registration centres and a couple of such communities had the deadline for voter registration extended by two days .
reclaimnaija.net has already succeeded in redefining the paradigm of election monitoring in Nigeria .

Attahiru Jega : Nigeria &apos;s Electoral Captain or Captor ?
with the 2011 General Elections barely hours away , one man holds the key to the eternal propagation or termination of the social revolution through the ballot box in Nigeria .
parliamentary election is to be held in on 2 April and presidential election will take place on 9 April 2011 .
update 04 / 03 : the nation &apos;s election commission just announced that all elections would be pushed back a week , due the late arrival of voting materials .
Attahiru Jega , a professor of Political Science and head of the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) will determine to a large extent the credibility of the polls within these three weeks .
Attahiru Jega , a professor of Political Science and head of the Independent National Electoral Commission .
INEC had a credibility crisis during the tenure of Maurice Iwu , Jega ’ s predecessor .
in the words of Patrick Utomi ( until recently , a presidential candidate of Social Democratic Mega Party ) :
as is now widely documented and accepted the 2007 election was a farce .
but it was not that it was a farce alone that troubled me .
it was the level of evil in the process and the widespread view that to have a place in politics you had to sell your soul , conscience and dignity .
I was convinced there could be a better way , a different way .
it is therefore not surprising that :
… The person who heads the electoral agency must be seen to be guileless , with an integrity that is transparent and also unbiased .
it is not just enough to allude to the qualities listed above , it is absolutely essential that the perception matches reality .
living up to expectations , Jega maintained that he will not morph from an umpire to a biased player in the elections .
Get2Central writes that :
Forty-eight hours to the general elections in the country beginning with the National Assembly polls , Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission , INEC , Prof. Attahiru Jega , declared yesterday that he was not under pressure to manipulate the electoral process in order to give undue advantage to anybody and that even if such pressure comes from any quarters , he would not oblige them .
the electoral boss insists that :
… With the security features , if a ballot box is snatched and swapped , the commission would know .
also , if ballot papers are swapped or taken to areas they are not meant , the INEC would know .
in the same vein , if result sheets are snatched and fraudulently exchanged , the commission would know .
as such Jega has passed the bulk to politicians and lawyers .
for the INEC , I can say categorically and convincingly that we are ready for the election , the question should rather be , are the lawyers and politicians ready ?
we have put all the necessary machinery in place to not only ensure that the election is free , fair and credible , but to also ensure that a level playing ground is accorded all the contestants .
I am doing my best to ensure that all the mistakes of the past are not repeated . … Consequently , the question is not whether INEC is ready , but whether the other stakeholders are ready .
our major concerns at this moment are politicians and lawyers .
these are no mere words , coming from one with such intimidating rich background :
… as former ASUU ( Academic Staff Union of Universities ) President , a respectable civil society activist and a human rights practitioner .
this post on twitter sums up the expectations of most Nigerians as regards INEC chief and the 2011 elections in Nigeria :
I won &apos;t lie .
INEC chairman Attahiru Jega impresses me .
hope he delivers on his promises .
entrepreneurship , Culture and Solidarity in Africa
since the early 2000s , entrepreneurship in Africa has reported strong organic growth .
however this development has not spread in all market sectors and too often seems to be limited to service industries and trade .
Africa has 65 million Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) , nevertheless it is still struggling to develop a class of local entrepreneurs to manage strategic industries , specifically the export of agricultural raw materials , mining , transport and industry public works where the market too often turns to foreign managers .
yet investors ’ enthusiasm for Africa , that many see as the latest Gold Rush for those seeking an alternative to Asian markets , has an impact on local government policies which are concerned with developing their private sectors .
the final report of the World Bank indicates that the reforms undertaken by most African governments have improved the business environment in the administrative , fiscal and regulatory domains .

numerous academics and researchers have examined the influence of cultural practices in order to understand the entrepreneurial adventure in Africa .
their researches led them to consider the weight of cultural values and principles strongly anchored into the collective psyche of African businessmen to evaluate the factors for success for African entrepreneurs .
the irrationality of economic choices of African business executives facing the social pressure of ethnicity , or their extended family has been extensively studied .
success stories in Africa- sucessful and entrepreneurial leaders in Africa from news21TV with M. Dogui president of Africagora club
traditional African values facing the liberal economy
Kabeya Tshikuku , professor at the Institute of Economic and Social Research ( IRES ) at the University of Kinshasa , has argued that business logic is forcing African policymakers to make a difficult choice between the core values of their civilization ( family solidarity , peers well being and other support platforms ) and business administration , linked to a search for profit devoid of human consideration .
the roots of capitalism , utility and individualism , encountered more resistance in the African psyche .
Africa and Africans are not liable guilty of any offence in the form of irrationality .
the « cultural issue ” lies elsewhere , as far development is concerned .
it lies entirely in the distinction made by each culture between « cardinal values of civilization ” and the “ instrumental values ” .
from the strict cultural point of view , two systems are competing for the allegiance of people and the allocation of resources .
&#91; … &#93; To put it clearly , Africa is navigating between two competing systems of culture , the retrograde system of management of people and the ( revolutionary ?
) administration of things .
the reasons for existence and action have not yet completely lost their roots in the pre-capitalist system ; they have not yet taken root in the capitalist system .
the old framework of lifelong solidarity has not totally disintegrated ; the new framework of capitalist individualism has not finished moving in .
Combining solidarity and growth
the growth that fueled the continent &apos;s GDP over the past decade indicates that this rational , individualistic capitalism is installed progressively albeit unevenly across the continent .
it penetrates the public consciousness at the discretion of the efficiency or the aggressiveness of reforms undertaken by the government to boost the private sector .
corporate governance has become a central theme for the business community especially after the shocking wave of the Enron scandal in United States .
will African entrepreneurs know how to integrate the principles of corporate governance with the ubuntu philosophy in which the group comes before the individual ?
the former Minister of Investment , Industry and Trade of Mali , Amadou Abdoulaye Diallo , pointed out that Africa is an excellent example of the paradox .
he explains to Célia d &apos;ALMEIDA in the Journal of Mali :
a decade ago , the African socio-economic environment was considered unfavourable to the creation and development of business ventures .
in some countries , the legal framework for business leaves room for few incentives due to weaknesses such as lack of credit access , scarcity of information on business opportunities , absence of support for young entrepreneurs ( no business incubators ) and insufficient skilled workforce for company management .
to all this is added a shortage of political strategy .
however , more recently , African countries like ours , undertake major reforms to facilitate business creation and provide a favourable climate for business development .
in Cameroon , Richard Ewelle &apos;s post in Kamer Blog concludes on culture and entrepreneurship in Africa :
the development of entrepreneurship in Africa will require the creation of the concept of African entrepreneurship and not necessarily an exact copy of what is abroad .
we need to combine best practices in creating Western corporate context along African concepts .
the concept of African entrepreneurship will be based on the value of African culture but also on developing solidarity that promotes the socio-economic environment .
Global Voices Most Read Posts in 2011
this post is part of our special coverage Global Voices in 2011 .
our top 20 list of most read posts on Global Voices for 2011 includes four from Japan , three from Egypt , and two from the Philippines .
but only one story is about a giant crocodile !
it &apos;s been an incredible year for the reach and recognition of citizen media around the world , and that means Global Voices is no longer as lonely a media voice when it comes to reporting tweets and blog posts .
still , where mainstream media interest wanes , we &apos;re the ones who strive to continue documenting what local bloggers everywhere need the world to know .
self Defence Forces arrive at the scene of the tsunami in Japan .
some of our proudest moments of 2011 will never be reflected on a top 20 list like the one below .
this year we exceeded 500 active volunteer authors and translators of countless languages and countries , and we &apos;ve published more than 2,600 long posts and 6,300 short ones in English alone .
inevitably , many of the stories that don &apos;t get as wide a readership as they deserve are from countries that tend to be overlooked in international media .
unique coverage from across Africa , the Caucasus , Macedonia , the Russian language Internet , Latin America and indigenous rights are among some of the highlights .
see the 2011 regional reviews by our editors and authors for a glance of what you may have missed .
our Middle East and North Africa team deserves special mention this year .
throughout protests , blackouts , threats , they have managed to pull though and keep writing .
the bloody images still proliferate , but our authors seek out constructive voices and angles for dialogue .
so often , they &apos;ve shared local humor and context that is difficult to appreciate from abroad without a guide .
perhaps for the first time ever , China doesn &apos;t figure on our top 20 list of the year .
these are particularly chilling times to blog about controversial subjects – something Global Voices authors in many other countries unfortunately also experience .
this makes the stories that do come from anywhere free speech is frowned on even more precious .

China : strong country , poor people
the state broadcaster CCTV revealed in June 28 that China is expected to receive 8 trillion yuan ( $ 1.18 trillion ) in financial revenue by the end of 2010 .
such figure will turn China into the second-largest country in terms of revenue income after the United States .
it seems that China has realized its dream of being a strong country , however , netizens have been rather skeptical about the news because of the uneven distribution of wealth .
“ Great Leap Forward ” in financial revenue
online current affair commentator , Hou Jinliang , says that such kind of “ Great Leap Forward ” is unbearable .
the great leap forward of financial revenue is like a person taking androgen , its outlook is so strong , however , in reality , it is very weak from within .
the Gini coefficient reflects the widening of income disparity and social injustice …
… now that our finance revenue is riding on a rocket and becomes the second in the world .
on the other hand , people &apos;s income is riding on a snail .
the IMF &apos;s data on April 21 , 2010 showed that Chinese people &apos;s average income in 2009 ranks 109 in the world .
it reflects that we should not boast about the “ Great Leap Forward ” of finance revenue .
on the contrary , we should reflect upon the current situation .
blogger , 1741596507 , elaborates further on the relative deprivation feeling among ordinary people :
there is a sharp contrast between the country &apos;s financial revenue and the people &apos;s livelihood : low income , lack of social protection and benefit , lack of health care and the decrease in education subsidy .
on the other side of the coin , the price of property and consumer products keeps increasing and people have to pay huge amount of tax .
strong country , poor people
Bai Yen concludes that China is a strong country , but its people remain poor :
in this country , the rich gets richer while the poor gets poorer .
government officials are richer while ordinary people are poorer .
now that the nation &apos;s financial revenue has increased , we can have more super Olympic and World Expo to brighten our government &apos;s face .
if the income distribution structure do not change , no matter how rich the country is , it is meaningless to ordinary people .
local governments in debt
swlonging points out that the local governments are also poor :
local governments are like poor people and many are in debt .
the tax reform in 1994 has increased the central government &apos;s financial income but weakened the local government &apos;s financial strength … On the other hand , the local governments have to shoulder public service and do not have extra income to build infrastructure .
as a result , they have to borrow money .
the economic policy at the end of 2008 encouraged local governments to create financing platform and get loan .
even county level governments join the financing schemes in getting loan for development project .
in June 23 , the National Audit Office announced that local debt has increased risk in the society .
in some areas , the local debt is 100 % higher than the government &apos;s capacity …
Yeh Kai has a number of constructive suggestions for improving the situation :
reduce the proportion of financial revenue to the GDP , keep the wealth among people …
build a transparent monitoring system on the state finance .
information about the state budget and expense should be transparent and make accessibly to the public …
reduce administrative expenses and spend more to improve people &apos;s livelihood .
people are very skeptical of the State &apos;s revenue and spending .
people will welcome spending that improves their livelihood , but at the moment , a large proportion of our revenue is spent on local governments ’ administrative expenses .
we can see that from the expansion of the civil servant structure , luxurious government buildings and vehicles .
on the other hand , government &apos;s investment on social security , health and education is highly inadequate .
people don &apos;t have money to go to the hospital , school and enjoy their retirement life … The central government should introduce policy that regulates the proportion of public spending within government revenue and increase the proportion gradually in order to build a harmonious and healthy society .
Indonesia : Sony versus Sony
last month , Sony Arianto Kurniawan or Sony AK from Mega Kuningan , Jakarta in Indonesia was threatened with a trademark infringement lawsuit by Japan ’ s Sony Corporation if he does not close his personal website whose domain name is www.sony-ak.com.
Thankfully , Sony the person was supported by the online community and Sony the corporation finally realized the folly of pursuing the case .
Sony Corp. has since then dropped the charge and has already apologized to the blogger .
the personal website of Sony AK was established in 2003 and it was awarded the best website in educational category for 2003 , 2004 and 2006 by PC Magazine Indonesia .
Multibrand reminds Sony Corp. that the website of Sony AK provides only free information to the public and does not sell anything
in my humble opinion , Sony Corp. have been over confident in making the said demand , because protection given by trademark registration is limited to certain types / kinds of products covered by said trademark .
in this case , Sony Corp. is a manufacturer of electronics products , whereas the website : www.sony-ak.com is only a personal website of its owner that provides free information .
talking points affirms the popularity of Sony AK ’ s website in the past six years
this suit has upset many Indonesian onliners , especially those who have been blogging and are into IT for several years .
Sony AK ’ s site has been known for being the knowledge sharing center for IT enthusiasts in Indonesia , and has been up for approximately 6 years .
this issue has generated an intense discussion in the Indonesian blogosphere and a facebook support group for Sony AK – ‘ Sony — don &apos;t take away my friend &apos;s name ’ – quickly attracted thousands of members .
website of Sony AK
Whispurr &apos;s Blog points out that there are many Indonesians named Sony
and mind you again , there are thousands of people here in Indonesia with the name Sony .
I have some friends with the name Sony , one of Indonesian Badminton star is SONY DWI KUNCORO , one of the most famous actor in Indonesia is SONY TULUNG .
well then SONY CORPORATION , why don ’ t you sue those guys and thousands of Mothers who named their child with SONY .
finally woken wonders whteher Apple Inc. would sue actress Gwyneth Paltrow for naming her daughter Apple
maybe Apple Inc. should sue Gwyneth Paltrow for naming her daughter Apple as she might have a blog called apple too in the future …
seriously this is beyond ridiculous .
Colson describes the issue as a battle between David and Goliath
the sympathy naturally is with David ( AK ) in his fight against Goliath ( Corp ) .
actually it is bizarre if an innocent citizen uses a name which remotely is the same as the one of a multinational , in a strictly personal context , is being sued for that reason only .
yet I &apos;m afraid Goliath has a point here – because the legal system is to a large extent the product of the interests of the Goliaths .
and because the legal power Goliath is able to organizie is n-th time as huge as the limited funds a David has at his disposal .
before the withdrawal of the case , bloggers were planning to launch a boycott campaign against Sony Corp. Yari NK is happy with the decision of the firm to drop the case
it is wise for Sony Corp. to drop the claim since it does not make sense in almost any way that one has to stop using his own name for his personal non-commercial site .
by dropping the claim , Sony wouldn &apos;t hit the negative consequences in public opinion that , at worst , could lead to boycotting its products by the Indonesian public that backed Sony AK becuase they know that Sony AK had nothing but good intentions when he initially set up his blog or site and he is not eating into Sony Corp &apos;s profits … .
Egypt : German Justice for Marwa El Sherbini
finally , justice has been served in the case of Marwa El-Sherbini , the Egyptian woman who was stabbed to death inside a German courthouse by a Russian-German immigrant .
after nearly four and a half months , Alex Wiens has been sentenced to life imprisonment , without a possibility for early release .
Bikya Misr , wrote about the case :
after nearly four and a half months , the Marwa el-Sherbini saga has come to a conclusion of sorts after a German court sentenced the man who stabbed the “ veiled martyr ” 17 times inside the court in July to life in prison without possibility of early release .
Egyptians , Arabs and Germans alike have welcomed the verdict and hope Europe and the Middle East can begin to heal the wounds of the killing and move “ toward a better future . ”
Hicham Maged wrote about how glad he is for the ruling , and that he has real trust in the German justice system :
the judge was aware about various tricks from the killer &apos;s defence team and here I quote the words according to this article : “ He killed … not out of fear but out of revenge .
he consciously exploited her innocence and defencelessness .
” I agree with this and do not forget that he also tried to kill her husband .
I am glad that the courtroom where betrayal took place has been washed up physically and morally by applying justice .
consequently , my trust in the German justice system was needless to mention because this crime was shocking for all of us not only Germans .
for that matter , only today Marwa and her unborn baby can rest in peace after compensating from the killer .
Zeinobia was happy with the verdict , and she also wrote in response to those who believed that it is a political verdict , and that the German court ruled in favour of Marwa in order to please the Egyptians , and Arabs :
now I want to say something , some racists “ and they are not few in the world now ” , will say that this is a political verdict ; the court had to take to win the hearts and minds of Muslims around the world and to save the German interests is the Islamic world .
well with my all respect I said it before and will say it again ; do not think of Marwa as a Muslim woman ; think of her as a Pregnant woman and a mother who was brutally stabbed 18 times in front of her little boy .
he killed two souls , innocent souls because of blind hate and racism .
he deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his life for taking the life of innocent souls and take the life of a mother from her child
Aam Mina on the other hand wrote a post , making fun of those who believe in conspiracy theories and were expecting the Germans to rule in favour of the murderer :
I don &apos;t know why , since the announcement of the verdict , I haven &apos;t heard any of those who kept on talking about the Germans and how racist they are , and that they hate Arabs and Muslims .
they also claimed that the court will rule in favour of the murderer and he will be imprisoned for a year or two only , and that our only hope is to declare sacred war against the secular , rotten , Zionist , and infidel West .
he then wrote about many the lessons we are supposed to learn from this incident :
here you are some lessons we have to learn form the infidel West :
serving justice soon : the murder took place in July 2009 , i.e. about 4 months ago , and it didn &apos;t take them 20 years to study the case , like what happens here .
justice itself : the murderer received a maximum penalty – execution is not available in the German law – without any discrimination between a Muslim , or Christian , an Arab or German .
they are all equal in front of law .
finally , Hicham Maged wrote :
what happened to Marwa should be a ‘ wake-up ’ call that make people work for achieving this both by criticising extreme actions taken against people because of their faith or race and understanding our differences and this simply means to quite stereotyping from whoever against whoever .

Brazil : a view from slum dwellers on Rio &apos;s drugs war
last week , images of a war between drug traffickers and dealers in Rio de Janeiro spread across the world .
clashes between gangs from the hills Morro São João and Morro dos Macacos on October 17th frightened the population .
hundreds of state police deployed in an effort to subdue rival gangs did not help : the conflict between drug dealers and police resulted in a downed police helicopter killing three police officers , and claimed the lives of over 30 other people , among them suspected gang members and bystanders .
the moment the helicopter exploded .
photo by Taiane Oliveira On Twitpic .
the Censurado blog criticizes the governors ’ attitude toward this crisis , after hearing news suggesting that the police didn &apos;t know anything about the invasion :
did you see the footage on the TV this weekend ?
the helicopter falling , the police officers burning , innocent people shot on the streets and dealers invading other dealers ’ slums in broad daylight ; a true scene from a war movie .
in Rio , people say that even the Israeli secret service knew that dealers from one slum would attack the others , but still the governor Sérgio Cabral said the carioca police didn &apos;t know a thing ?
I think he is spending too much time with &#91; Brazilian president &#93; Lula .
this is the only excuse for his “ ignorance ” on this topic .
blogger Ana Maria points out that shooting a helicopter down is not an easy task highlighting that this might be just the beginning .
not only drug barons , but owners of the carioca slums , have guns able to do such things in their hands , and they also have people trained to handle them and cause a disaster like the one last Saturday .
this will be forever marked in the memories of the Police and ordinary citizens , residents of the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if they can do this to a police helicopter manned by trained men , that give their lives to provide public safety , what can they do to the ordinary citizen ?
I will not “ hide the sun with a sieve ” .
things may get worse .
dwellers ’ accounts of the drug war
a woman carrying a child walks unconcerned past police officers patrolling Morro dos Macacos .
the citizen media project Viva Favela gives some dwellers ’ eyewitness accounts of this conflict .
their citizen journalists – all of whom live at the frontier of the cross fire – have gathered comments from residents of the slums and photos of the day on which the drug war began in Rio de Janeiro .
the first person heard by Viva Favela was Hugo Mattos , who lives on the street that gives access to the slum in which all the events took place ( Morro dos Macacos ) .
he said that the dealers used high-caliber weapons and added that there is a kind of collective fear that if the police retake territory occupied by the traffickers , there will be a violent reaction from the faction that controls Morro dos Macacos :
shooting started around 2 am and only finished at 8 o &apos;clock when the police arrived .
many people had to sleep outside their homes that night .
people say that no one is supposed to leave their homes after 10 pm , because something might happen .
according to Viva Favela , information like this comes all the time from the neighborhood dwellers , unable to react .
on the evening of Tuesday October 20th , residents of Morro São João took to the streets afraid of a possible retaliation invasion , a fear which was classified as unfounded by the General-Chief of the police corporation , Colonel Mário Sérgio Duarte .
nevertheless , fear had already struck the population .
another resident of Morro dos Macacos , Karen Carolina Nascimento says that the shooting between dealers and the police has actually been happening for two months .
she fears a new conflict :
&#91; the gang war &#93; has been practically a routine , but this Saturday it was different .
the conflict happened because of an attempted invasion of Morro dos Macacos by the dealers from Morro São João , and this was not the first attempt .
the word in the slum is that the rival faction has given an order to take over Morro dos Macacos by December and that those dealers had police officers backing this invasion .
police patrols have not been reinforced and the residents are very apprehensive , fearing a new invasion .
I work at the foot of Morro São João and I walk back home .
yesterday , there was only one car with two police officers inside parked on a corner .
there are no police patrols up in the slum .
once in a blue moon a shielded car comes up here and patrols the area .
we are in so much fear because we are sure the rival faction will try to reclaim the area .
Viva Favela also offers the opinion of Wagner da Silva de Barros , a 29-year-old resident of Vila Pinheiro from Complexo da Maré , saying that the repercussions of the conflict in Morro dos Macacos have only reached this far because of the downed helicopter and adds that this war will spread to many other communities :
those shootings reinforce the fact that in the favelas there are only bandits and violence , but what many people are not aware of is that workers die during these conflicts and are quickly identified as dealers by the police .
according to Viva Favela , in the case of Morro dos Macacos , three innocent shot down young men were included on the list of deceased bandits .
the secretary of Security José Mariano Beltrame stepped back and apologized to the families of Marcelo Costa Gomes , 26 , Leonardo Fernandes Paulino , 27 , and Francisco Haílton Vieira Silva , 24 .
the men were going back home from a party at the time of the invasion .
a fourth man , waiter Francisco Alaílton Vieira da Silva , 22 , was saved by residents but is now hospitalized in intensive care .
his girlfriend is 3-months pregnant .
Walter Mesquista from Viva Favela also provides photos of the conflict taken by the photographer Guillermo Planel during the day to which people are referring as “ Drugs War ” .
there are around 6,000 homicides a year in the whole state of Rio , which has a population of 14 million .
a police ‘ pacification ’ operation with permanent patrols has been underway for a year in five slums .
with their increased presence in the slums , the police force gangs to fight over other areas .
Viva Favela is a citizen media project that works with special bloggers and photographers who live in the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro .
the project is under the guidance of Content Editor Rodrigo Nogueira .

Pakistan : Musharraf has Left the Building
eight years , three hundred and five days ago a peaceful coup masterminded by a Pakistani Army General overtook the reigns of power from the then ruling corrupt leader Nawaz Sharif .
it was then the promise of a new tomorrow ; it was then a romantic walk towards the faint vision labeled as the ‘ enlightened moderation ’ and definitely a step towards the ridding society of a plague called corruption .
Pakistanis celebrated then , but very soon people realized that this blessing had slowly grown into an unwanted plague and the stay had become an unwelcome dictatorship .
after many moons of tyranny , yesterday marked the end of a reign of power barely 60 days shy of nine years , Pakistan turns over a new leaf .
it seemed to be a normal day for Pakistan but it turned into a roller coaster of adrenaline pumping and rumor mongering session for its citizens as news started to flow .
for the people it was one rumor after another flooding from TV newscasters to SMS &apos;s and even emails ; it was as if the fate of Pakistan were to be decided by each other .
Pervez Musharraf – Image credit : world Economic Forum Photostream in Flickr and used under a creative commons license
the tearful good bye on the 18th of August by Musharraf came barely four days after the celebrations of the 61st Independence Day .
Pakistan gingerly marks the end of a long nine year dynasty .
his concluding remarks were mostly a walk back into history as penned down by The Pakistani Spectator , which was just to highlight his services for the people and for the country .
Pakistani bloggers reacted with mixed feelings , on one hand some celebrated Musharraf by chiming in with the ‘ For he is a Jolly Good Fellow ’ tune , while some faithfuls were quick to lend him a standing ovation but most cautiously celebrated the end of a dictatorship .
sarcastically Yeah That too had a few words to share , Ammar wrote about how the new ‘ Cat Fight ’ is now about to begin , Chowrangi talks about Pakistan &apos;s future after Musharraf , Psychotic Discourses sheds light on the new form of Demon-cracy , MB confuses us with the talk about circle of circuses .
the immediate question that remains lurking is whether Musharraf is allowed to seek asylum outside of Pakistan or will he be put to trial for the charges alleged against him .
its definitely a tough juncture for Pakistan with a lot at stake .
one does wonder what next , wherein lies a huge mixture of political wannabes eying for the top slot , though the onus of pulling the country out of the mess lies squarely on the shoulder of Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif , both unelected politicians entrusted with the faith of a nation to hopefully pull this country out of the mess it now finds itself in .
Madagascar : devastating tropical storm makes way for a political one
a few days after passing Madagascar , the official toll from the damages caused by Cyclone Fanele have finally come in .
President Ravalomanana president flew to one of the affected areas to assess the extent of the devastation .
cyclone citizen media initiative
while the BGNRC ( department of risk and disaster management ) is still without an official website , reports pertaining to the damages are being aggregated on an open-source Google map by two bloggers , Marie Sophie Digne and Tomavana ( fr ) .
here is a summary of the damages , according to IRIN , via ReliefWeb :
new figures from Madagascar &apos;s National Office for Natural Disasters Preparedness ( BNGRC ) indicate that cyclone Fanele claimed eight lives and affected some 40,400 people &#91; .. &#93; The BNGRC said a further 63,000 people were at risk in Menabe if heavy rain continued to fall .
relief teams are still assessing the damage caused by the two storms , and figures are expected to rise as more information on the full extent of the damage is gathered .
political turmoil
the Malagasy blogosphere was also buzzing with political news and commentary about a new massive political gathering today ( Jan 24th ) and a call for a national strike to demand the resignation of the entire administration .
many bloggers have provided live blogging and images of the event ( additional images on facebook ) .
blogger Ariniaina provides a brief factsheet on the background of the turmoil :
Andry Rajoelina ( or Andry TGV ) had a TV Station named VIVA and still have a radio station with the same name .
the minister of the communication has decided to close the TV station VIVA due to a documentary movie that this station had broadcasted .
it was a message from the former President of Madagascar , Didier Ratsiraka &#91; .. &#93; Since then , the Mayor ( of Antanarivo , Andry Rajoelina ) gave an ultimatum to the government to re-open VIVA TV station before January 13 &#91; .. &#93; As Andry didn ’ t get what he wanted , he invited the people of Tana to go on a strike AGAIN today , January 24 .
( demonstration photo via ariniana )
blogger Jentilisa provides in-depth analysis of the discourse on both sides of the political spectrum and cautions against the spreading of unverified rumors ( mg ) :
a tree fell on the square for democracy ( where the meeting took place ) because of the evident affluence ( message heard on the radio ) ; still some claim “ say that it was a sabotage ” .
so here we are , talking about insignificant events instead .
we are still so prone to believe anything we hear and I would like to caution against that .
blogger Avylavitra reminds us that the government is also trying to terminate VIVA radio and that the reason it advances for it does not hold up .
there is a law against private radio broadcasting all over the country .
yet , one pro-government radio MBS has been broadcasting nationally for 5 years without any threat of censorship ( mg ) :
I am not trying to single out MBS .
I am just asking : ” Is the law only applicable for a few ? ”
( Malagasy activist yes we can shirt by avylavitra )
history repeating itself
Mialisoa Randriamampianina , a journalist and blogger , is dissapointed to see a replay of the events in 2002 , with the same errors , same bellicose rhetoric and a democracy that is still far from mature ( fr ) :
without a true political culture , the crowd is resorting to the old whines of eternal victims , the noise ever louder and prudence thrown out the window &#91; .. &#93; So we did in 2002 , so we will in 2009 &#91; .. &#93; the street has become the only way , the leverage , the absolute recourse .
eventually , an implosion that may not be very useful .
there has got to be a way to convey your message , without the easy intimidations and the awkward condescension .
while we wait for a bit of perspective from cooler heads , we are here , trying to find our way out .
and we called this ” a quest for democracy ”
Randy also a blogger / journalist , agrees that Madagascar may still may not be ready for a true democratic process ( fr ) :
and that is what scares some .
as was the case in most countries of the continent that tried the ( democratic ) game , suspiciously spontaneous public protests set the stage .
the irony of the current president threatened by a public tour-de-force reminiscent of his own ascendancy to power is not lost on blogger Rajiosy ( fr ) :
the irony of the story is that the same person who back then overrode the rule of law now has the task to restore the authority of the state and stabilize its institutions .
he is now faced with trying to consolidate his position .
a difficult task considering the volatility of public opinion .
Maturing twittosphere
an intriguing development during this political process was the emergence of an active Malagasy twittosphere who posted political development in a real time manner .

Jordan : Queen Rania &apos;s Video Blogging
Queen Rania of Jordan has been named the most famous Arab video blogger on YouTube by Blogger Times , a blogging magazine run by Arab bloggers , following the success of a series of YouTube videos she launched to shake off stereotypes against Arabs .
according to the article :
Queen Rania Al Abdullah sits inside large office in Amman , Jordon , with three cameras focused on her .
the first and second cameras were for BBC , while the third camera was for her office staff .
the three cameras were recording the latest episode of her program that is broadcasted on a special channel on YouTube , better known as a Vlog .
this is her 7th episode / video since she began broadcasting on Youtube , last March , where she speaks in English asking viewers to discuss the stereotypes they have heard about the Arab world , so she can “ debunk them one after the other . ”
perhaps the wife of Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah the Second , is not the only public figure who uses YouTube , that ’ s being watched by millions of people .
there are other politicians and kings in different regions of the world who have created personal websites on the internet .
but what is unique about Queen Rania is that she is the only Arab figure who uses the internet to engage in a dialogue with the West to promote a moderate Islamic speech .
Queen Rania says jokingly : “ My adolescent son is a quiet person who doesn ’ t speak a lot by nature , but his impression towards the speeches I gave was ‘ good ’ , and thus the viewers ’ impression should be good as well . ”
it seems that YouTube visitors agreed with him on what he said , as around 2 million viewers watched the video episodes broadcasted on YouTube ; which include along with her recording , contributions from different Jordanian musicians , comedians and citizens .
the article continues :
Queen ’ s Rania appearing on her channel on the internet , gave her the chance to receive criticism from millions of people .
as she has said to me : “ When the idea came to my head , some people looked at me as if I have totally lost my mind . ” She continued : “ I feel that our world is in a crisis at the present time , violence has replaced dialogue and anger replaced compassion . ”
“ I hope that this channel becomes a channel for communication and a bridge between the East and West , because I firmly believe our world is in dire need for this ” .

Spain : supporting the Miners : “ Yes , Yes , They Do Represent Us ! ”
this post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis .
thousands of people took to the streets to show their support for the Spanish miners , and joined them when they arrived in Madrid after walking 400 kilometres from the north of Spain .
the protest began at 10pm on Tuesday 10 June , 2012 , in La Moncloa , the seat of the government , and finished in Madrid &apos;s puerta del Sol plaza around 2am .
the coal miners are protesting against the austerity measures and subsidy cuts imposed by Mariano Rajoy &apos;s government .
the gathering to welcome the so-called “ Black March ” took place in an emotional atmosphere charged with solidarity .
the citizens gathered there welcomed the miners with applause , words of admiration , sympathetic slogans and with their own anthem , which was sung during the whole march through the centre of the capital .
the miners showed their surprise at the scale of the mobilisation , which added to the intensity of what is known in social networks as the # nocheminera ( mining night ) .
the Black March passes through the centre of Madrid .

among the most common slogans were “ Yes we can ! ” , “ Yes , yes they do represent us ! ” and “ This is our lineup ! ” , in reference to Spain &apos;s recent victory in the UEFA European Football Championship .
this much was clear : those supporting the workers feel prouder and identify more with the working class than with politicians or football players .
the coal miners not only lit up the streets with their headlamps : they also represented a light for the protesters in a broader sense .
many other sectors identified with their cause , including anarchists , indignados from the 15-M movement , and people of all ages and from various regions throughout Spain .
because it is a strongly rebellious protest , more so than other protests carried out in Spain , the miners ’ struggle has become the heart of the workers ’ protest movement and the most radical rejection of the government &apos;s cutbacks .
the video below shows protesters expressing their solidarity with the striking miners ( video by Juan Luis Sánchez ) :
through social networks , many people encouraged the miners to continue fighting against the cutbacks that could lead to the disappearance of their sector .
a large number of tweeters stated that they felt proud of the Spanish miners through their messages and the hashtag # yosoyminero ( I am a miner ) .
as was the case with previous protests , it was the social networks that spread most information , confronted with what users denounced as # silenciomediático ( media silence ) .
the historic miners ’ protest started up again on the morning of Wednesday 11th of July .
however , it turned out to be a much more terrible day than the previous one , due to violent confrontations between riot police and protesters .
more than 76 people were injured in the conflicts and about ten were arrested .
Bahrain : who Heard the Bomb Blasts and Who are the Victims ?
this post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011 / 12 .
Bahrain officials announced today that two foreign workers have been killed and a third was seriously injured in five separate bomb blasts in the areas Gudaibiya and Adliya , in the capital Manama .
on Twitter , the news was received with doubt , skepticism and a call for a political solution to end the unrest in the country , following widespread anti-government protests which started on February 14 , 2011 .
journalist Adel Marzooq tweets from exile :
@ ALSHAF3EE : is there news about the Asians who were run over by police patrols a few days ago ?
there is a bad stench suffocating us these days
hussain Yousif , a political dissident in exile , adds :
@ hussain _ info : people have the right to know what happened to the investigation of the Interior Ministry vehicle which ran over Asians between Eker and Maameer as the murderer in known
and Sayed Ahmed Al Alawi casts more doubt :
@ SAalalawi : the person who was shown as the one killed in the explosion died because he kicked a locally-made bomb .
how come the explosion effected his neck but not his legs , stomach and chest .
this is one extraordinary bomb
Sabeeka Al Shamlan hits back , tongue in cheek :
@ Sabeeka _ A : back to square zero .
oh wait , who said we even moved from there ?
and then she asks :
@ Sabeeka _ A : has anyone heard the explosions ?
with their own ears ?
don &apos;t respond to this question if you have not heard the explosions , with your own ears
Noor Bahman takes a step further :
@ noorbahman : a bomb does kill a victim on the spot but also destroys quite a proportion of the surrounding area the victim was in .
and Salma asks :
@ salmasays : eh .. Where is free and independent media when you need it ..
this exasperation has deeper roots .
Eyad Ebrahim notes :
Murad Alhayki pleas for a political solution .
he says :
@ muradalhaiki : the more a political solution is delayed , the more complicated matters get and more difficult it is to solve them .

opposition Mounts over Tanzania and Zambia Ivory Proposals to CITES
broken elephant tusk found in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe , by Terry Feuerborn
opposition is mounting against Zambia &apos;s and Tanzania &apos;s proposals to be allowed by CITES , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , to sell their government held ivory stockpiles .
with Kenya being the perennial opposition for any trade in ivory , it is no surprise that most opposition is coming from conservation groups in this country .
Additionally , Kenya has renewed their push to have a 20 year moratorium on the sale of ivory after this same proposal resulted in pushing the moratorium for only 9 years after the 2008 one-off ivory auction by four southern Africa states .
Kenya &apos;s media has picked up the story .
NTV Kenya has a video on YouTube titled , Wildlife Worries .
the Baraza blog published the content of the proposals that Zambia and Tanzania have put forward and Kenya &apos;s opposing proposal .
Maina explains on Baraza
on the one hand is the anti-trade range states consisting of Congo , Ghana , Kenya , Liberia , Mali and Sierra Leone .
on the other hand , each with it ’ s own proposal is Zambia and Tanzania , who want to be allowed to sell their ivory stockpiles come the March 13-25 Doha meeting – the 15th CITES Conference of Parties ( CoP15 ) .
both sides have sent their proposals to the CITES secretariat and the secretariat has generously posted the proposals on their website .
in a different blog post on Baraza , Paula writes about the UK &apos;s resolve to vote against the two proposals :
the UK has said no to ivory sales .
environment Secretary Hilary Benn said last night : “ At the CITES meeting in March , the UK will vote against the proposals from Tanzania and Zambia to sell ivory stocks , and we would urge other countries to vote against such a sale .
Paula writes on Ban Ivory – a new blog at WildlifeDirect dedicated to the campaign against ivory – asking “ Are elephants worth more than their teeth “ .
she asks : ” Are elephants just a source of a valuable commodity , ivory ?
or do elephants deserve special treatment ? ”
Paula points out that inspite of all the support that Africans can expect from outside , the battle for the elephant will have to start with Africans .
she says :
at the end of the day the protest against the trade in ivory will have to be led by Africans if the rest of the world is to take any notice which makes Kenya ’ s campaign so powerful .
but as long as the Chinese and other Asians markets continue to provide markets for ivory trinkets and refuse to implement domestic enforcement , a renewed ban on trade in ivory will fail and we will continue to lose elephants .
a group known as the Kenya Elephant Forum is leading the Kenyan civil society in the protest against ivory trade resumption and have produced fact sheets on the issue .
Harvey Croze , blogging on the Amboseli Trust for Elephants pages says
ate is against the trade .
we have been working with like-minded NGOs and individuals under the aegis of the Kenya Elephant Forum ( KEF ) to provide strategic information to a body of sympathetic African elephant range states called the African Elephant Coalition ( AEC ) .
in this blog post , Harvey has included links to the KEF Fact Sheets that you may want to read in order to understand the ivory problem and the likely implication of the Tanzania / Zambia proposals .
Cameroon : bloggers Discuss Obama &apos;s Ghana Speech
U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech in Ghana which could be considered as his Africa policy speech .
Cameroonians at home and in the diaspora have been reacting to the words pronounced by the American leader with African roots via the blogosphere .
the speech was published in its entirety on Up Station Mount Club which is fledgling one-stop-shop of Anglophone Cameroonian blogging .
the comments give the impressions of a people appreciative of the bright speech but wary of rhetoric .
Augustine S , a Cameroonian based in Canada seems pleased with the speech &apos;s direct attack on corruption and bad governance but wants more :
speech well delivered .
it was above expectations .
he struck on corruption and good governance , what i wanted to hear .
African leaders are stifling the progress of their own nations .
I wish his administration goes a long way to exposing corrupt African leaders , punish them by freezing their assets and issuing traveling bans on them and their families .
Obama is the kind of leader we need in this world .
still on the issue of tackling corruption and embezzlement by African leaders Oyez has some advice to western leaders like Obama :
just two more things are required , and it will go a long way :
1 ) Deny African rulers , their families and their lieutenants the right to foreign bank accounts and foreign property of any kind .
2 ) Deny African rulers any kind of medical care outside of Africa .
those are the only two things we ask the West to do , and we will take care of the rest .
a comment left by Nnokko Johnson brings the Obama speech to Cameroon &apos;s door-steps by reminding the country &apos;s President , Paul Biya , who has been in power since 1982 and in 2008 oversaw the amendment of the constitution to cancel limitation of presidential terms :
Africa doesn &apos;t need strongmen , it needs strong institutions .
Mr Biya please take note of this phrase and learn , we dont want u out , but we need strong institutions , please please …
however , reading from many of the comments posted one may come out with the view that Cameroonians see Obama &apos;s speech as “ good talking ” that cannot solve their problems .
Emmanuel says :
home run .
talk , talk , talk , all of it old crap , and ghoulish , to boot .
it does take two to tango . and , Africans are silly to listen to lectures on corruption from the leader of the hegemon of financial , moral and political corruption ; it took two to tango with the slave trade , colonialism , and now the era of “ partnership . ” Look , this talk of “ partnership ” is a lie .
only subststantive , not notional equals , can enter into partnerships .
Reex adds :
the same rhetoric … I wonder when people stop believing and start acting … We don &apos;t need speeches on hope and pledges -they serve to anesthetize the population , that their problems shall be solved -they should hope for the solutions .
when the financial crisis hit the US , the President said something similar about the responsibility of Americans to take the charge … Well contri pipo , most Americans are not even in control of their financial lives , lest responsible for the financial collapse , which were created by a greedy clique of bankers … .
well , Obama &apos;s speeches are well-written by an impressive staff to do a formidable job .
what else do we expect from him ?
speeches from his heart about the realities of our current world ?
the trend of thought seems to be that , it is for Africans to solve their own problems .
as Reex says ,
… let us Africans work out our solutions .
we may afterward invite Obama to share roasted corn and groundnuts at the fire side and discuss the politics on the ground – neither Ivy League stuff nor the usual double-talk demonstrated by the Western World , those speeches could be reserved to later occasions , when every hungry stomach in Africa has been filled !
a comment from a visitor called Isat is less diplomatic :
what we should really keep as a reminder are these words : ” Africa &apos;s future is up to Africans . ”
and take note : Obama is not African .
his grand-father who cooked for the Brits and his father were Africans .
he is American and his country &apos;s interests rule supreme – no matter how many songs we sing in his praise .
man wey yi get ear make yi hear .
&#91; in Cameroonian pidgin this means : a word to a wise is sufficient &#93;
the Up Station Mountain Club , collective blog also carries a post – Barack Obama in Africa : “ Beyond Yes We Can ” , yes we must , from Cameroonian blogger Aloysius Agendia in which he exhorts Africans to make a change :
yes , Africa can revolt against current misleading leadership and their shady deals that have impoverished the continent .
beyond the yes , we can , yes , we must implement the said changes to move forward
this blog also gives a rythmic flavour to this visit as the video of a Cameroonian musician hailing Barack Obama on his election is posted there .
the song was released by Tata Kingue just before Obama &apos;s inauguration in January 2009 and Gef &apos;s Outlook had done a small translation at the time .

Morocco : against Torture Somewhere ; Against Torture Anywhere
Moroccan officials have been up in arms this week , queuing in front of cameras to express their utmost outrage after the arrest and alleged torture of Mustapha Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud by the Polisario Front , the Algerian-backed separatist movement that disputes sovereignty over Western Sahara with Morocco .
Mustapha Salma , a former Polisario Front police chief and high ranking official was accused of treason by the separatist movement after he publicly praised the autonomy plan &#91; Ar &#93; , proposed by Moroccans to solve the over three-decade old conflict .
the story of Mustapha Salma can hardly pass unnoticed as it is all over the media in Morocco ; his pictures splashed across the front pages of local newspapers .
the official media has been condemning the Polisario and their Algerian backers on the ground that they have violated Mustapha Salma &apos;s right to free expression and for fear that he may be facing torture .
( Mustapha Salma has , reportedly , since been released .
whilst this story raises legitimate concerns over the violation of human rights by the Polisario Front and the Algerian regime , some bloggers expressed outrage over the indifference of local mainstream media and the Moroccan government over the fate of a young Moroccan , Fodeil Aberkane .
it is a more local , but way more horrifying story of a young man , whose most basic human right , the right to life , has been denied .
Fodeil is arrested on September 11th , 2010 , and charged with consuming cannabis .
after 48 hours spent in jail a judge decides to release him .
a few days later Fodeil goes back to the police station , to ask for the return of his belongings : a motorcycle and a cellphone .
an altercation follows and Fodeil ends up again in prison , accused of “ insulting officers during the exercise of their function . ” Two days after that he is transferred to the main hospital in Rabat where he is pronounced dead .
there is no doubt in the minds of Fodeil &apos;s family and friends as to what led to this tragic end : police brutality and torture .
an investigation is launched but no charges brought as of yet against any of the persons believed to be involved in the death of Fodeil Aberkane .
the story has grabbed the attention of bloggers and online activists as it comes amidst a climate of decline in freedom of the press in the country and , since , as writer and blogger Laila Lalami reminds us , it isn &apos;t an isolated incident :
Fodail Aberkane is not an exception .
over the last few years , allegations of torture have been made against the police in Morocco on many occasions .
two years ago , Zahra Boudkour , a 21-year-old university student from Marrakech , was arrested for taking part in a student demonstration .
she was stripped naked and beaten , but no one was brought to account for the violence that was visited upon her .
in his encounter with the Marrakech police , another university student , Abdelkebir El Bahi , found himself thrown from the 3rd floor window of a dorm .
he is now in a wheelchair for the rest of his life .
Boudkour and El Bahi were abused and tortured because of their ideas and their ideals .
Fodail Aberkane was trying to get his moped back .
bill Day writing on the a la menthe agrees :
because the victims are not celebrities , they suffer and die unnoticed by the Western media — out of sight , out of mind .
while the Kingdom has broken very publicly with the “ Years of Lead , ” during which there was widespread torture of political dissidents under King Hassan II , incidents such as those reported by Lalami are a chilling counterpoint to the current regime &apos;s bright face of prosperity , particularly when coupled with ongoing suppression of any kind of free press .
blogger and activist Najib Chaouki &#91; Ar &#93; created a Facebook group called “ We Are All Victims of Torture , ” in which preamble he calls for the “ perpetrators of this crime to be prosecuted diligently . ”
blogger Larbi denounces the double standards of the Moroccan government .
he writes :
if this government had an ounce of dignity , it should defer Fodail Aberkane &apos;s killers to justice as soon as possible , if only to avoid dying of ridicule .
as for torture , we dare not think that it will ever cease to exist , as it appears to be eternal in Morocco .
an online petition to “ End Torture and Police Violence in Morocco , ” has gathered over 300 signatures so far .
some bloggers and Twitterers have been sharing and displaying banners like the following picture that reads : “ Makhzen : police kills .
if you wish it to continue , keep quiet . ”
the Makhzen is the generic word that designates the Moroccan ruling establishment .
blogger and lawyer Ibn Kafka offers his reading of the reasons behind the persistence of torture in Morocco :
torture is an instrument of power which the Moroccan regime is not willing to abandon , but whose adverse effects on its national and international reputation , it wants to limit .
in the absence of serious internal political and institutional counterweights , it is mainly the media and diplomatic fallouts that may constrain the security-related choices of the Makhzen .
as for Western media , the blogger explains …
they see Morocco only through the lens of orientalism / Islamism / terrorism – and in this respect , Fodail Aberkane does not fulfill any useful function .
excessive , unchecked prerogatives delegated to the police often lead to an arbitrary abuse of power , as Riad Essebai writes on Robin des Blogs :
Aberkane is neither the first nor the last to be the victim of a system in which a police officer may be judge and arbiter .
this “ absolute ” power is the real criminal in this case , and this is what we should be fighting .
aboulahab , writing on the C.J.D.M.
blog ( Circle of Young Moroccan Idiots ) urges people to speak up :
history will remember all but people who keep a low profile .
enough meanness .
Morocco needs big men .
let them come forward .
are we a civilization of subjugated civil servants and quiet citizens ?
Cambodia : decline of Monk Morality ?
since Buddhism is a state religion guaranteed by the Constitution and the fact that nearly all Cambodians are Buddhists , the recent reported decline of monk morality in the country is a cause of concern .
on several occasions , monks have been found of engaging in violent behavior or misconduct including having sex or watching pornography .
there was a case where a provincial chief monk reportedly got drunk and beat a clergymen who didn &apos;t file a complaint for security reason since the bully monk is recognized as the king monk in the province .
recently , a monk was caught making a video of naked ladies who went to his monastery for religious watering , a belief that the water provided by the monk will release all bad incidents or bring luck to people .
the investigation which led to an arrest was followed by an enormous sharing of that nude video via bluetooth from phone to phone .
this apparently raised a question over the emerging development of technology infrastructure in Cambodia where people can widely access porn materials more easily .
however , as suggested by Chan Nim , the issue is left to the conscience of the people on the proper use of technologies .
on the other hand , there are many well-behaved monks who understand the role of technology in promoting religious teachings .
while it is now common to see many blogs initiated by young people who discuss social , technological or personal issues , there are now Buddhism-themed blogs such as Bodhikaram , Saloeurm , Khmerbuddhism .
an extensive teaching of Buddhist philosophy is now accessible online in the form of short commentaries , dictionaries , podcasts , or textbooks in both English and Khmer .
Moreover , there are a number of monks who are effectively maximizing the internet in order to reach a wider audience .
Venerable Saloeurm Savath , for example , has been rigorously sharing many Buddhist teachings via face-book which acts as a natural linkage with his laypeople who can easily reach him for more explanation on certain Buddhist Principle or issues .
Pagodas and monks are part of Cambodia &apos;s cultural and educational heritage .
they continue to contribute a lot in society .

Morocco : celebrating Eid in the Bled
this past weekend , Moroccans celebrated Eid Al-Adha , or the Festival of the Sacrifice , often referred to in Morocco as Eid Al-Kabir , or “ the big festival , ” as opposed to Eid al-Fitr , known colloquially as Eid al-Sghir , or “ the little festival . ” While the holiday shares the same meaning and traditions across the Muslim world , the celebrations are often uniquely local .
Erin says of her family &apos;s sheep : &quot; he had no idea what was coming .
bloggers in rural Morocco ( referred to locally as the bled ) are sharing their stories about this year &apos;s Eid .
as Internet access is sparse and often prohibitively expensive outside of cities , many of the people blogging from rural areas are Peace Corps Volunteers ( PCVs ) and are therefore positioned to give an outsiders ’ perspective … from the inside .
Erin , a PCV who blogs at Reflections and Experiences in Al Maghreb Al Aqsa , explains her host family &apos;s Eid traditions , saying :
Saturday morning , my host family slaughtered a sheep and 2 goats for the Eid celebration .
this is done in honor of Abraham , who was willing to sacrifice his son for God , before God told him to sacrifice a sheep instead .
although Muslim families all over the world practice this tradition , people celebrate in very different ways .
some families give all the meat to those in need , while some ( like my host family ) eat every last organ , and have enough meat to last them for 2 or more months .
joy in Morocco , who is also a PCV , writes of something she &apos;s grateful for in Morocco , also sharing a picture of a woman
joy in Morocco posted this photo on her blog from her village cooking on Eid :
Moroccan &apos;s close connection with food .
sheep meat doesn &apos;t arrive in frozen packages .
they slaughter it .
they prepare all the meat- start to grill .
similarly is their relationship with fruit and vegetables , particularly in my region .
everything comes from their backyard , literally .
PCV oclynn in morocco was less of a fan of the holiday .
the blogger explains :
smoke off the grills rising from all the rooftop decks as the heads and hooves of the sheep are first to go on the fire .
listening to the thrashing of my neighbor ’ s sheep on our roof as it is dying ( and why does it seem to be taking so long ? ) .
sheep were slaughtered on rooftops , the lot next door and on the sidewalk in front of homes .
everywhere .
blood running down the gutter .
it must be L ’ eid Kbir .
not my favorite holiday , but the holiest of them all in the Muslim world .
blowing up the lungs of the Eid sheep
yet another PCV whose blog is called From the Cold Land with the Hot Sun shares an interesting experience from the holiday , complete with photo :
though I &apos;d like to divert the focus away from the gruesome and entertaining aspects of the celebration in favor of the more wholesome and boring ones , I did witness a jaw-dropping moment during the disemboweling of the animal that I cannot resist writing about here .
upon removing the lungs from the inverted and dangling sheep &apos;s chest cavity , the friendly man spattered in blood held them up by the still-attached esophagus for all to see .
he then blew forcefully into the esophageal opening , causing the lungs to inflate fully – pink , glistening , and strange in the morning sun .
it was so cool .
Cynthia , the blogger behind The Couscous Chronicles , is another PCV writing about the holiday .
she explains why it &apos;s best to have “ family ” in Morocco :
this year was worlds better than last year simply because I chose to celebrate it with my neighbors ( who have really become my family here ) and their entire extended family , which is a hilarious and wonderful group of people .
last year I felt like I just got shuffled around from house to house , drinking tea and eating meat and feeling awkward the whole time , but this year I felt like part of the celebration .
feeling like a real part of a family makes holidays a lot more fun .
last but not least , Reading Morocco shares a slideshow of photos from a Berber village in Southern Morocco , attributed to Leila Alaoui :

Ghana : obstacles to the Advancement of Women
Betty Mould Iddrisu , jurist and Minister of Justice of Ghana , writes on pambazuka.org :
to reach the upper level is rare , and once you have arrived there , you still have to face hostility and doubts about your abilities , because you are a woman .
a woman at the top works harder than a man to prove her skills , and yet she still must face entrenched prejudices and hostility , in her role as manager and leader , in a work environment largely dominated by males .
Singapore : bloggers Criticize PAP Manifesto
Singapore ’ s ruling party , People ’ s Action Party ( PAP ) , released its election manifesto on April 17 , 2011 , which was immediately criticized by many bloggers for being “ too vague . ” PAP has been in power for five decades already .
the country &apos;s General Election will take place on May 7 .
the PAP manifesto promises a better future for all Singaporeans
you can count on the PAP to do the best for Singaporeans from all walks of life , and to keep us united through good times and bad .
together , we will make Singapore a vibrant and inclusive society , with opportunities for a better life for each and every citizen .
we will be a city for the young and old .
to achieve this vision , we seek your mandate to :
• Create opportunities for higher incomes for all
• Improve the lives of lower-income Singaporeans
• Bring out the best in every child
• Develop a vibrant city and an endearing home
• Help our seniors stay active , healthy and engaged
* Involve all Singaporeans in shaping our future
below is the video of the manifesto prepared by PAP :
the manifesto mentioned about the commitment of PAP to respect diverse views in society .
but Mr. Brown complained that commenting is disallowed on the PAP video site .
jadenster uploaded this video which contrasted the PAP manifesto with the current situation in Singapore :
cloudywind also has a short video which slams the legacy of PAP :
lucky Tan is not impressed with the manifesto and warns that the proposed solutions have been done before :
in fact , where solutions are cited in the manifesto , they are what the PAP has been doing in the past decades e.g. retraining of low income workers from one low income job to another etc .
when the same solutions are used , we will only get the same results – widening income gap , rising cost of living and a deteriorating quality of life .
through the Wordle site , alvinology compares the PAP manifesto with the manifesto issued earlier by the opposition Workers ’ Party ’ s ( WP ) .
the PAP document consists of 25 pages compared to the 63 pages in the WP manifesto .
bloggers also noticed that the WP manifesto has detailed recommendations in 15 different policy areas .
Yawning Bread criticizes the leadership brand of PAP :
it ’ s getting very tired .
and what the PAP does not realise is that this constant harping about the risk of failure has actually damaged Singapore .
far from making us a confident , innovative society willing to try new things and benefitting from experimentation , it has made us risk-averse and slightly paranoid .
it ’ s hardly any wonder stress levels in Singapore are so high
blogging for Myself accuses PAP of being ‘ clueless ’ to the current realities in the world :
in one word , the PAP is CLUELESS .
I am not expecting some grand theory that is good enough to help illuminate mankind into the future , but they do not have a sufficient grasp of the driving forces today beyond being bewildered by it all and can only say this : the future is highly uncertain .
the PAP has been short changing themselves because they are apt to choose people they trust rather than the ablest .
you know the dynamics of human relationships , it is impossible to have a large company of people that you can develop deep trust .
Molly Meek publishes an annotated document of the PAP manifesto .
she also described the manifesto as a defense of the status quo :
the PAP Manifesto is ultimately about maintaining the status quo , making it cosmetically and statistically better but substantially worse .
expect minor tweaks but do not expect them to translate to any palpable benefit for Singaporeans ; do not expect anything near a paradigm shift in thinking .
( and no , of course there ’ s no groupthink in the PAP .
Nigel Tan is disappointed that the manifesto contains only vague promises :
the document seems to contain a series of vague promises , with neither details of specific policies nor information on how the various stated aims were going to be implemented .
as elections get nearer , netizens are encouraged to post photos of the elections in the GE2011 Media website .
India : terror Strikes Pune
image courtesy http : / / twitpic.com / photos / abhi _ bol
at around 7 : 30 pm on Saturday ( February 13 , 2010 ) a bomb blast at a restaurant popular with tourists in India &apos;s western city of Pune killed 9 people and left 57 people injured .
the bomb was in a backpack and it exploded when an waiter tried to inspect the left luggage .
Shashi Bellamkonda at My Digital Thoughts reports :
a few hours ago ( Feb 13th 2010 ) a bomb went off popular cafe ‘ German Bakery ” in Pune India .
at the time of posting this the press were reporting that 8 people had died and about 40 injured in this blast which left the bodies charred beyond recognition .
the bakery is a popular spot with foreign tourists .
Shashi has also these observations :
this comes a day after both India and Pakistan agreed to resume talks that had been halted since the Mumbai attacks in 2008 .
David Headley currently in a Chicago jail had visited Pune to surveyed the Osho Ashram near the blast site
the blast site is near the Pune Chabad house and the Mumbai Chabad House was a target in the 26 / 11 attacks in 2008 .
the blast area is near the Osho Ashram frequented by tourists another similarity to the Mumbai 2008 blasts .
Pragmatic Euphony warns :
the jehadis have struck again on the Indian mainland ; this time in Pune , albeit more than a year after the horrendous terror attacks on Mumbai in November 2008 .
the initial response , while going with the most plausible and popular assumption that the blast was the handiwork of Pakistan based jehadi groups , is one of indignation .
perhaps understandably so as tempers are bound to run high .
and this emotion is likely to be further amplified as the Indian mainstream media hyperventilates and virtually runs amok with its over the top coverage of the incident .
people are already finding links to Pakistan .
Offstumped informs that the Pune blast followed a Laskar-e-Taiba threat .
a top leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba named Pune as a target city at a permitted public rally in Pakistan .
the Acorn says :
despite the Lashkar-e-Taiba threat , it is too early to definitively attribute the attack to the Pakistani military-jihadi complex .
but it is clear that the Pakistani military-jihadi complex has every reason to escalate tensions with India through the use of terrorism .
without the excuse of “ tensions to the east ” , Pakistan would have nothing left to explain to Washington its double-dealing on the taliban .
Dilip D &apos;Souza at Death Ends Fun reminds that India should also do something about the homegrown terror :
until we recognize homegrown terror for what it is — no less than anything from abroad — and until we stand against every kind of terror , we will never defeat terrorism .
the Twittersphere was abuzz with tweets and retweets spreading the news .
here are some of the reactions :
IndiaHappening : nine killed , 32 hurt in Pune terror blast http : / / bit.ly / arLssZ # India
r _ shekhawat : terror strikes at my home – ‘ Pune ’ : once again , innocent people killed by some mindless terrorists .
Pune , a great city , hurt and bruised .
pragmatic _ rebel : must be a sad start to Valentine &apos;s day in # Pune !
still aghast at the blasts , I wish # India does something really different this time .
bhuvan _ chelsea : we need a vigilante like Batman here in # India .
tweetSAMRAT : is praying for the victims of the recent Pune bomb blast .
nehasasi : RT @ deepitganjoo : please RT This Jahangir Hospital Pune Needs Blood AB + ve and B + ve Contact : 1066 Those who are in Pune … .
_ india _ : Pune blast casts shadow on talks with Pak
no doubt the blast in Pune will impact the recent goodwill talks between India and Pakistan .
but it seems that the terrorists are being given the upper hand as emotions are running high everywhere .
Taiwan : a Family &apos;s Forced Eviction Casts Shadow on Urban Renewal Act
the outrageous eviction of the Wang family executed by Taipei City government showed the public how fragile citizens ’ private rights is in front of the urban renewal projects .
more and more , public opinion has urged the Premier , Chong Chen , to revise the current Urban Renewal Act .
manipulation of resident opinions
Hsieh-Li Wang pointed out that the current Act allows construction companies to put forward an urban renewal plan even when the majority of the residents refuse to join this project :
Wang &apos;s house before demolition .
here is the trap of the Act : according to Article 10 second clause ‘ When 10 % of the homeowners who together occupy more than 10 % of the land agree to join the project , they can apply for urban renewal . ’ What does it mean ?
based on Article 25 of the Urban Renewal Act , the government is allowed to approve an urban renewal project when 80 % of the involved residents agree to join the project .
for those who refuse to join the project , they will be punished with forced eviction executed by the government .
Yo-Yu Hsih , a law student criticized the tyranny of the majority which violates the rights of a minority .
the original goal of majority decision is to use the limited land resources efficiently .
it also prevents cases when the will of the majority is kidnapped by a minority of people who want to obstruct the proceeding of urban renewal and development of a city .
( however ) Majority decision may result in tyranny that sacrifices the minority &apos;s interest … Currently Article 22 , clause 1 of the Urban Renewal Act endorses majority decision without any protection for the minority .
this will put the minority in a vulnerable situation and jeopardize their rights .
I am afraid this Act has violated the legal principle of minimum encroachment .
a poster outside Wang &apos;s houses .
it says ‘ my house was bought when I was 40 , and it was torn down when I was 70 . ’ Photo by Flickr User munch999 ( CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 ) .
government involvement
Hsieh-Li Wang questioned why the Act allows the government to use police force to serve the interest of developers :
article 36 of the Act is most controversial : the construction company can appeal to the government to demolish the houses by force when the residents refuse to be evicted .
many experts believe that the Act , which justifies use of the majority decision mechanism and government &apos;s involvement in supporting the developers , has violated the Constitutional protection of citizens ’ property rights .
the Taiwan Association for Human Rights demanded a thorough revision of the Urban Renewal Act in accordance with the Constitution .
in the Yuan Legislature , legislator Mei-Nyu You urged the Minister of Interior to revise the current Urban Renewal Act :
today if you have an apartment leased to a renter who refuses to move out , can you appeal to the public authority to evict the renter ? v … You need to sue this renter .
if the court rules in your favor , you can apply for a court order .
usually , the court will give this renter a grace period to relocate , and this is how our Constitution protects citizens ’ right of residence .
today my house is in good condition and does not obstruct my neighbors , traffic nor public security .
however , once a developer fancies my land and its floor space index , it can force me out of my house ( giving me no choice ) .
it can even get around the judiciary and appeal to the public authority to tear down my house .
is there any procedural justice here ?
defending constitutional rights
Torrent criticized the political party &apos;s election politics and retreated to citizen action for defending their constitutional rights :

Chapter two of our Constitution defines the rights and responsibilities of citizens , which have been turned into empty slogans through different political campaigns … Our society has connived with these politicians ’ lies for too long .
they told us we can eventually enjoy all the rights described in Chapter two of our Constitution after they &#91; win the election and &#93; become the president based on Chapter four of our Constitution and after they control the majority seats in the Legislature based on Chapter six in our Constitution .
nevertheless , they always have excuses to defer their promise .
this is why we ask to revise the unjust Urban Renewal Act , to protect every citizen ’ s right of residence .
we should take control of our Constitution away from all the lies and write the history of Taiwanese people .
Iran : the New Year Starts With a Message From Obama
this year , the Iranian new year started with a surprising message from the US President Barak Obama , directed to the Iranian people and , for the first time , to the Islamic Republic leaders , in which he called for a new start between the two countries .
several bloggers have reacted to this message , and some see a new era beyond the 30 years of hassles and haggles between the two States .
Mohammad Ali Abtahi , former Iranian vice president , considers Obama &apos;s message very important and says :
using the title of Islamic republic of Iran , also congratulation to the Iran &apos;s nation and leaders .
undoubtedly it is a historical opportunity .
we can not ignore the importance of USA for Iran &apos;s current situation .
undoubtedly we can not ignore trace of US leaders in all of Iran &apos;s dossiers also at least in economical aspect by embargos which have imposed to Iran &apos;s nation .
sending message for congratulation can be the most important political , economical and historical opportunity , today and after changing American government .
also ignoring that can make a situation for us more dangerous than Bush &apos;s term because Obama can mobilize political leaders and public opinion against Iran .
blogger and journalist Masih Alinejad writes about why Iranian National TV did not broadcast Obama ’ s message .
she adds :
if Obama had talked as Bush and considered Iran a threat , Iranian National TV would broadcast several times .
the blogger reminds that Bush ’ s famous speech when he called Iran a member of axis of evil was broadcasted several times in National TV .
Zandegieh Sagi calls Obama ’ s message very positive and something that the Iranian people deserve .
the blogger says that the first thing the Iranian government can do is to use appropriate political language .
in View from Iran , we read :
there are a lot of measures that the US government can take to build trust .
not all of those have to do with the Iranian government ’ s willingness to start dialogue with the US .
I see Obama ’ s New Year message as positive , but we need more than that .
Mmoeeni writes that while the Iranian TV did not broadcast the news about Obama &apos;s message , the Iranian president was able to insult the American leaders in the USA .
the blogger adds , with a pinch of irony , that Ahmadinejad then says there is absolute freedom in Iran .
new Year Holidays
Iranians celebrated Norouz ( Nowruz ) on the first day of spring as the traditional Iranian new year holidays .
on this occasion , some Iranians throw flowers on the tomb of Cyrus the Great , the founder of the first Persian Empire in Pasargad ( photo above ) .
the Save Pasargad website says that the Islamic Republic authorities did not provide any comfort for visitors in this historic place , but in recent years more people have come to celebrate the new year in Pasargad .

Niger : the Silent Famine
the largely under-reported food crisis in Sahel has taken worrisome proportions as about 2.5 millions of people in Niger are currently affected by food shortage .
the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ) has decided to scale up emergency operations to protect the population at risk . bloggers in Niger reflect on yet another food crisis after the one in 2005 , a food crisis this year that is the result of shortage of rainfall last year .
men Facing Sahel Desert by Nawal _ Under CC license on Flickr
D. Evariste Ouédraogo wrote the following about they way politicians always try to spin food crises in Niger in a way that would put them in a more favorable light :
in 2005 , the authority tried to convince the opinion that the threat of famine was only a shameful rumor &#91; .. &#93; A few days later , the prime minister , in no less fallacious terms , still asked for help the international community because of … famine .
in 2010 , the truth comes out again : 10 days after the change of regime in Niger , we learn from the chief of the military junta on television that famine threatens millions of Nigeriens from all over the regions .
the shortage of food was estimated at 400 000 tons .
total opposite of the statement by Mamadou Tandja who was allergic to the idea of food crisis .
Grioo.com asks out loud the tough but conspicuous question that many Nigeriens wonder about : “ where did the cash influx from the Uranium trade go ? ” :
let &apos;s remember the tension between former heads of state in Niger and the leaders of Areva about the renewal of uranium exploitation contracts &#91; .. &#93; We will never denounce sufficiently all these slaloms that allow white collar delinquents to embezzle public funds that should contribute to helping citizens who lack food , water and basic health care .
the amount of money from mining resources never benefit the silent majority .
an African paradox that does not surprise anymore .
however , this scandal must end now at the beginning of the millennium .
it &apos;s almost as if mining riches only brings misery to African population .
it will always be the case until the resources are not used to develop grain fields .
Kathryn Richards at Care shares a few thoughts and testimonies on the “ hungry season ” as the rural population finds itself in dire needs of animals to herd :
Niger is a country of contrasts .
rich in newly found uranium and oil but its people crushingly poor .
&#91; .. &#93; Food is readily available in the market – but at an inflated price few can afford .
families are selling off their livestock at reduced prices to buy food .
Mohammed Gusnam was one of these people : “ It is difficult .
as herders we were like princes , proud .
now the pasture land is disappearing and we are stuck in the village .
the village is like a prison to me . ”
the current response to the food crisis , however , seems to be speedier than in 2005 .
Cyprien Fabre , head of the regional bureau of the European Commission Humanitarian Aid ( ECHO ) offers the following assessment :
many alert and intervention systems are in place for most affected countries and funds were allocated accordingly .
operations are well underway in Niger , Burkina-Faso and Mali .
Chad needs more agents for an efficient intervention .
still many organisations believe that the resources are still too slow to arrive .
they identify two reasons for the delay : 1 ) making sure that donors are coming through with funding and 2 ) the challenges of reaching the population in the most remote areas .
many think that cash disbursement might be faster and more effective for the short run than sending food :
during conversations with the members of the communities , more people said that they &apos;d rather have cash than seeds .
the communities that had lost the most crops or those who live the farthest from markets tend to choose seeds ; those who have access to markets have not lost as much or those who have limited farming lands tend to favor having cash .
Tunisia : anonymous vs Ammar – Who Wins the Battle of Censorship ?
anonymous &apos; poster calling activists to join the attack on Tunisian government sites
the Tunisian censor , commonly known as Ammar , continues to wreak havoc on activists ’ accounts , in a country that has been witnessing a wave of protests since the middle of December .
just today , activists claimed that the government has hacked into their email accounts , accessing their blogs and social networking sites , and disabling them .
the move seems to have come in retaliation to an attack by Anonymous , which has targeted vital Tunisian government sites and gateways .
the attack on activists ’ accounts is not something new to Tunisia and its cyber activists .
the country is described as both a police state and an Enemy of the Internet and an oppressor of mainstream media as the World Press Freedom Index gave it a score of -10 in 2010 , where it fell from 154th place to 164th worldwide .
“ The country is continuing to drop into the Index &apos;s lower rankings because of its policy of systematic repression enforced by government leaders in Tunis against any person who expresses an idea contrary to that of the regime , ” states the report .
on AnonNews.org , an online forum for the ‘ hacktivists , ’ the following announcement in what is now know as Operation : Tunisia , was made :
a time for truth has come .
a time for people to express themselves
freely and to be heard from anywhere in the world .
the Tunisian
government wants to control the present with falsehoods and
misinformation in order to impose the future by keeping the truth hidden
from its citizens .
we will not remain silent while this happens .
anonymous has heard the claim for freedom of the Tunisian people .
anonymous is willing to help the Tunisian people in this fight against
oppression .
it will be done .
it will be done .
this is a warning to the Tunisian
government : attacks at the freedom of speech and information of its
citizens will not be tolerated .
any organization involved in censorship
will be targeted and will not be released until the Tunisian government
hears the claim for freedom to its people .
it &apos;s on the hands of the
Tunisian government to stop this situation .
free the net , and attacks
will cease , keep on that attitude and this will just be the beginning .
a list of the attacked government sites can be found here .
and according to activists on the ground , the government retaliated by ‘ hijacking ’ the email accounts of activists , including lawyers and journalists , and accessing their blogs and social networking sites , such as on Facebook , and deactivating them .
Tunisian blogger Astrubal , co-editor of Nawaat.org , says many indications point at a coordinated attack launched by the Tunisian government in an attempt to break into activists ’ private accounts .
he writes :
this campaign is likely aimed at stealing passwords and logins of users to browse through their private messages .
the police is seeking to break into the accounts of users to know who communicates with whom and on what subject .
with the end objective of dismantling these networks of citizen journalism that formed spontaneously following the protests in Sidi Bouzid .
the events of Sidi Bouzid , have confirmed the importance of social networks in allowing a continuous flow of information .
but ever since the events started , recurrent disruptions of the network were noticed .
in the case of Facebook , connections , including the use of HTTPS ( secured connection ) to log in , were often impossible to establish .
the Tunisian regime has not dared , this time around , to block the whole Facebook service , the most popular social network in Tunisia .
this time , the government seems to target more specifically those who use it to circulate information .
in any case , we remind all users of Facebook , especially if they are connecting from Tunisia : do NOT CONNECT from an unsecure page .
even if you have nothing to hide , never forget that you were entrusted by the people who send you private messages .
even if the idea that someone can break into your private email account doesn &apos;t bother you , you must respect the confidentiality of the private messages you receive .
news of the attack on the activists ’ accounts soon found its way to social media .
@ SBZ _ news reports :
bloggers are under fire of the Tunisian cyber police , they are trying to hack every one who supported # sidibouzid or # OperationTunisia
Mauritanian activist Naser Weddady tweets :
based on feedback from ppl in # Tunisia a pattern emerges : hacked Facebook Accts were connected to Yahoo mail accounts # sidibouzid # Ammar404

Japan Government : on the Fall of the Employment System
a think tank for Japan &apos;s Cabinet , the Economic and Social Research Institute ( 内閣府 経済社会総合研究所 ) ( ESRI ) published a study that quantified the present status of lifetime employment and seniority-based wage ( i.e. the Japanese employment system ) .
they used the data ( 1989-2008 ) from Basic Survey on Wage Structure ( 賃金構造基本統計調査 ) ( BSWS ) of the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare .
the empirical results and commentary indicate a rare rebuke of the traditional employment system by the Government .
the study is published here .
one of the results that they quantified was the “ wage curve . ” This is basically standardized median wages of workers according to the their age .
ESRI showed that the wage curve “ flattens out ” gradually with time .
this indicates that when young workers sacrifice some pay for a stable lifestyle in the future , they do not get as much value in the current state of affairs .
the following is the graph : ( please click to enlarge !
now the second result comes from data of the share of lifetime workers for a company .
the data shows a significant declining trend in young lifetime workers .
this indicates lower retention rates of young workers and older workers staying in their old jobs since it is too risky to find another job .
in particular , we see a large dip at year 2004 for the large firms , as that was the year the Government made it possible to use temp. workers in the manufacturing industry .
this indicates that the continuance of the status quo may be unsustainable .
the following is the graph : ( please click to enlarge !
blogger , author and business consultant Jo Shigeyuki thinks it is significant that the Government finally admitted to the “ collapse ” ( 崩壊 ) of Japan &apos;s employment system .
but he is also disgusted with the apathy and the patchwork solutions ( like a cap on temp. workers ) shown in an attempt to fix the system .
below he warns against a possible misunderstanding of ESRI &apos;s results :
by looking at the wage curve , I sometimes hear labor union folks say , “ middle-to-old age employee wages are being cut , ” but it &apos;s more accurate to describe them by saying that they got away in time .
in the 90 ′ s , the former young workers worked hard only to arrive at a 30 % cut relative to their seniors , 20 years later .
&#91; meaning , at least it was only a wage cut , instead of no jobs available &#93;
after the bubble burst , if the former young workers were able to adapt to a system that is based more on performance , their lifetime wages may have been better .
but it is only the responsibility of those who didn &apos;t take the initiative to build a better system for themselves .
now that there is a whole generation &#91; s &#93; of workers who experienced the degeneration of Japan &apos;s employment system , the current 20-somethings need to be careful not to fall into the same trap .
so I recommend people to change or get ready to change jobs with an organization that value work .
blogger , economist Ikeda Nobuo hypothesizes about the reason the Japanese people in general have a tendency to avert risk instead of hedging .
the Japanese employment system was just a product of corporations that value stability :
my hypothesis &#91; for Japan &apos;s risk-averse tendencies &#93; is that post-17th Century , Japan didn &apos;t have a system of limited responsibility like the joint-stock corporations .
I believe the biggest factor that brought modern capitalism success were the joint-stock corporations .
in the West , shares of a stock were criticized as methods of speculation , and a cause for bubbles and financial panics .
but when Karl Marx criticized capitalism , stock corporations were highly praised as a system for socializing the production process .
therefore , the risk was spread all over society as a key for unprecedented growth in the West .
however in Japan , joint-stock corporations were seen as brands and the commodity prices were looked at as tools for speculation ; before the war , 90 % of commodities were futures and the risk was very high .
the shares of corporations weren &apos;t seen as tools for risk diversification and the companies held an infinite responsibility as they would kill themselves if something went wrong .
for households , the only option was to hold extremely high risk stocks or no risk savings , so most of them chose the latter .
blogger and MIT MBA student , Lilac reminds us of America a couple decades ago also faced similar problems of lowered competitiveness of certain firms ( Kodak , Motorola , RCA ) .
she ponders if it is better for large firms to reform itself or to collapse and start from scratch :
&#91; on the collapse of Kodak , etc .
&#93; it &apos;s not that the management did not understand technology or that the engineers were impotent .
a mistake in steering the firm in the wrong direction results in a huge loss in the efforts of the engineers and researchers .
Altering and reforming large firms and then adapting to new technologies is exceedingly difficult .
it &apos;s not necessarily the case that better ideas and technology wins .
the American firms have painfully learned a lesson from striving Japanese and European firms .
for Japanese firms to follow the path of Kodak et al. or the companies that successfully adapted to the conditions ( GE , IBM ) , it all depends on a few decisions from the top that make or break a firm .
blogger , IT worker elm200 proposes ( facetiously ) a solution that won &apos;t disrupt the vested interests that keep the status quo in Japan — to create an independent city that is the antithesis of the job conditions in Japan :
in essence , this country has tons of people who prefer the status quo .
if they &apos;re the majority , why would it be necessary to reform the system ?
even if a section of the youth tries to disturb the process , the majority ( middle , old workers ) is satisfied with the current state , so the best option is to leave them be .
because we &apos;re letting them be , it shouldn &apos;t be too bothersome of us to have just one selfish request .
it won &apos;t touch upon the vested interests so the cynical old timers shouldn &apos;t have anything to say .
let &apos;s build a Singapore in Japan .
Japan is in a gridlock .
to reform the employment process , many people propose higher job mobility , which feeds entrepreneurism .
Conversely , entrepreneurism is a decent indicator of job mobility .
I wrote an article recently on entrepreneurship rates in Japan and found that it is very low relative to other countries .
two interesting series that discuss the perils of employment currently in the media :
Nikkei Business : “ Cancelled job offers – This is why I was tricked ” ( 「 内定取消 」 -だから私は騙された )
J-cast : “ To you , who is 29 years old and working .

Malawi : of Election Fever and Going Digital
the week gone has been a politically hot one for many Malawians as they have seen their presidential and parliamentary candidates present their nominations papers to the Malawi Electoral Commission ahead of the May 19 polls .
by the end of the exercise , about 8 presidential and over 500 parliamentary candidates presented their nomination papers to compete for the 193 seats in parliament .
journalist Kondwani Munthali earlier on shared his views on the political developments which are expected to lead to the most contested at both presidential and parliamentary levels .
he writes Viva My Country &apos;s Democracy :
yes , I said DPP has no structures to manage itself through primaries , I am glad two Ministers recalled my discussions with them and called me .
for UDF how they can managed the situation of Muluzi will be entirely to them .
for MCP it seems they have changed indeed , the guys look serious enough to upset tables .
for today thats where it ends
another blogger under Ndagha agrees with Munthali that Malawi &apos;s politics this year is getting hotter .
he hope that its players have a genuine heart for the Malawians and not necessarily to serve their own interests .
he says that for him this year offers hope .
how and why ?
for me , the parliamentary race will the most exciting as it will showcase lots of new entrants-most of whom in my view can make important contributions to the country &apos;s development .
I wish we had popular new faces on the presidential race .
another journalist Mzati Nkolokosa terms this political time in Malawi as a Season of Rumors .
he writes a long post focusing on Brown Mpinganjira who has dumped the party he helped to form and paired himself with John Tembo of the Malawi Congress Party as a running mate .
it is right to call this period a season of rumours .
but Brown Mpinganjira must go on to accept that crucial political truths in Malawi start as rumours .
Brown Mpinganjira , the cleverest politician in Malawi according to Jack Mapanje , is good at communication .
he knows words that are loaded with meaning , he speaks poetry , and he can confuse people , even journalists , who don ’ t follow him critically .
most Malawi &apos;s public offices are not fully computerised .
while there are some efforts to improve this , it remains a challenge to most government departments and agencies .
one of the offices that serves lots of Malawians is the office of the Administrator General where among others , clients are helped with services regarding their deceased estate .
having attended a short course on data entry , journalist Pauline Kalumikiza writes on the importance of such offices going digital :
the reason is that , it takes so long for them to help the benefiaries due to their manual storage .
I think it is laborious and time consuming , because they handle multiple of files so them to take out one , it takes ages .
most of the times , they will tell you that ‘ Sorry come next month , give us time to look for it ’ . now Imagine a person is coming from Nsanje to the AG ’ s office in Blantyre ; he comes again as per the arrangement and is told that he should wait for another week , very frustrating isn ’ t it ?
yes technology has its own disadvantages but I think , the AG ’ s office would save time and energy by going digital .
we cannot be talking of making ICT accessible to everyone , if our important offices that hold crucial information are still using manual storage system .
Zisinthe !

Syria : weapons and Combat Tutorials Online
this post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011 / 12 .
Syrian rebels are turning to the world wide web for combat training .
this is the latest role being credited to social media , which has already won a standing ovation worldwide for the role it has played in spreading news and mobilizing citizens throughout this Arab Spring .
a YouTube channel under the name FSAHelp ( Free Syrian Army Help ) has posted over 80 videos aimed at helping the Syrian opposition to learn different skills – from hand-to-hand combat to making flame-throwers to the basics of assault rifles to creeping up on an enemy from a hidden position .
on his blog , the author of Gary &apos;s Reflections wrote :
I guess it was an inevitable .
a “ sign of the times ” we live in . the Free Syria Army ( FSA ) has turned to YouTube and Facebook to train it ; s recruits .
the rebels are outgunned , out-manned and , for the most part , aren ’ t professional soldiers .
so they ’ ve found a new , innovative way to turn citizens into warriors by turning to social media for tutorials in how to use their weapons .
here &apos;s one of the videos which shows viewers how to assemble and clean a Belgian type of rifle :
comments posted on the videos are mainly in support for the FSA , and their fight against the dictatorship in Syria , like this commenter :
salooooooo7y : God be with you , and help you beat your rotten enemies .
others gave them tips , correcting some of the information in the videos :
sa3ood16 : the prone position is very risky , especially in street fights .
if someone throws a grenade at you , you won &apos;t be able to run away quickly
it also seems that many viewers from Libya and Yemen have some experience to add here .
the same goes for those who play video games like Metal Gear .
while people are re-enacting wars in video games , Syrian children are directly impacted with what is going around them , and in the streets of Taftanaz , they play “ FSA vs. Assad ” , with wooden sticks as rifles , as shown in this video :
is posting such videos legal ?
many are raising questions about the legality of such videos .
according to an article in Wired , those videos are probably filmed in the United States ( or Canada ) , and then dubbed into Arabic .
in his blog , dedicated to firearms , Steve Johnson wondered about the legality of those videos according to the laws of the United States :
is it legal for a US citizen to provide assistance to a foreign army or rebel group ?
I am unsure .
free speech , in practice , frequently ends at the border .
it is perfectly legal to produce a firearm instructional video and upload it to Youtube for consumption inside the USA , but professional training video producers such as Magpul claim that their training videos are regulated by ITAR and require State Department permission to export outside the USA
evakatrina compared such videos to the case of Bradley Manning , who is a US Army soldier , and he was arrested in May 2010 in Iraq on suspicion of having passed classified material to the whistleblower website WikiLeaks .
@ evakatrina : so # Manning “ aided the enemy ” but they can &apos;t prove he did harm .
but guerrilla training for general public is ok ?
and what about YouTube Safety Conduct ?
in their “ Harmful and Dangerous Conduct “ , YouTube has stated under the United States section there ( Same message is put in the Canadian section of the page too ) :
&#91; w &#93; e draw the line at content that ’ s intended to incite violence , encourages or shows dangerous or illegal activities that have an inherent risk of serious physical harm or death .
this means not posting videos on things like instructional bomb making , instructional drug use , sniper attacks , or tips on illegal street racing .
FSAHelp also has presence on both Facebook and Twitter ; however their original Facebook page has been deleted , but another one was created later on &#91; Ar &#93; .
the people behind the new page are suspecting that the new page , and may be even the YouTube channel , might get deleted any time .
they note :
after the Russian TV channel mentioned our page , it has been deleted , and we think the YouTube channel might get deleted anytime , so we urge you all to download the videos just in case .
finally , the question remains should rules be bent for the sake of supporting the Syrian rebels in their fight against an oppressive regime ?
or should rules remain in place , given that there are worries the videos can still be used by any terrorist group anywhere in the world ?
also , should German Intelligence reports about the presence of Al-Qaida in Syria increase those worries ?

Kazakhstan : bloggers discuss religion
because Kazakhstan does not have a clear religious policy , it has become the norm that everyone is entitled to his or her own perspective on faith .
as it was twenty years ago , no one is really bothered by this multitude of views , which is evidenced by the debate on religion and traditions , which recently spilled over into the blogosphere .
the discussion was sparked by the Kara Zhorga dance , which has become popular in the country in the last few years .
Urimtal writes &#91; kaz &#93; : “ I think Kara Zhorga is not just a dance , but a whole phenomenon that has united the nation .
even Kazakhs who live abroad are taking part .
when our government describes the expatriates in not-so-flattering terms , Kara Zhorga is a kind of response to such criticism . ”
Orken wrote a post on the subject &#91; kaz &#93; :
“ Let ’ s say the dance has roots in Mongolian or Kalmykian culture , but we ’ re the ones who made it into a national brand .
the Mongols , the Chinese and the Kalmyks didn ’ t object in any way .
this is why I think it ’ s a sign of ignorance that many of us have a short memory when it comes to tradition or even bring up Islam as an opposing force . ”
in 2011 , Kazakhstan will chair the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
yet there was a discussion &#91; kaz &#93; not too long ago about a “ potential law that would ban the wearing of headscarves . ” Malimetter.org confirms the reports , and points to the causes , or rather , deputy Minister of Education and Science Mahmetkali Sarbyev does &#91; kaz &#93; :
“ Kazakhstan is a multi-confessional state .
if we permit people to wear the hijab , then tomorrow thirty students in a single class will show up wearing something different – and that won ’ t lead to anything good , ” he explains .
Timurr writes that the law will be unconstitutional , since the constitution guarantees freedom of religious expression &#91; kaz &#93; :
“ Given everything that is happening right now , I don ’ t think our officials and ministers are unaware they are going against the law .
but , if this is the case , why are they doing it ? ”

Palestine / Gaza : in Preparation for the Gaza Freedom March
on the 31 December , the Gaza Freedom March is taking place to mark a year passing since Operation Cast Lead , the Israeli attack on Gaza .
the International Coalition to End the Illegal Siege of Gaza is mobilising an international contingent to march alongside the people of Gaza , in a non-violent show of solidarity and with the hope of ending the Gaza blockade .
many of the participants have already arrived in Cairo in preparation .
the Freedom March has the participation of many noteworthy people , including author Alice Walker , Syrian actor and director Duraid Lahham , Roger Waters of Pink Floyd , and French rap group MAP , amongst others .
amongst the participants is 84-year old Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstien .
Hedy Epstein has been actively raising awareness about the march .
on 01 Dec 2009 , along with J ’ Ann Allen , the wife of a retired military officer and Sandra Mansour , a Palestinian refugee , she issued a public invitation to political activist , Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to go to Gaza with them .
Hedy Epsteins participation in the March has been met with much appreciaton :
Desertpeace applauds her participation :
seeing a survivor of those horrors &#91; The Holocaust &#93; struggle against today ’ s evils is truly an inspiration .
I am speaking of Hedy Epstein , who as I write this , is on her way to Gaza to take part in the Gaza Freedom March .
this is what the Holocaust should have ‘ produced ’ as an ‘ industry ’ , an industry that does not allow a repetition of the past … .
never AGAIN !
the organisation of the march has not , however , been without its hurdles , and organisers the International Coalition to End the Illegal Siege of Gaza , have not been beyond criticism .
Norman Finkelstein , author of The Holocaust Industry and ‘ dreamer ’ of the march , was initially an active member of the coalition , but has since resigned .
his frustration came from a much-debated change in the statement of the coalition .
the original statement of the coalition was to march to break the siege in accordance with the principle of non-violence and anchored in international law .
the statement was later amended to include the ‘ political context , ’ which Finkelstein deemed divisive as it brought in potentially contentious issues unnecessary to the original appeal .
while he does not specify the exact amendments with which he objects , he comments in his address Why I resigned from the Gaza Freedom March coalition :
it should perhaps be stressed that the point of dispute was not whether one personally supported a particular Palestinian right or strategy to end the occupation .
it was whether inclusion in the coalition ’ s statement of a particular right or strategy was necessary if it was both unrelated to the immediate objective of breaking the siege and dimmed the prospect of a truly mass demonstration .
his high-profile departure was accompanied by the withdrawal of a number of other active members .
Max at Jewbonics noted his departure from the movement with regret .
as an organiser of the march he responded to fears that others would leave the movement , reporting :
I think it is safe to say that number lost will be dwarfed by the number gained , if what I &apos;ve seen in-person and on-line has been any indication
despite concerns over the numbers endorsing the march , this is indeed a mass demonstration , and is the first time that Palestinians will be coming together in such large numbers along with international support : there are an estimated 1,300 international participants participating , who will meet in Cairo and march alongside a predicated 50,000 local residents once they have crossed into Gaza through Rafah .
at the Electronic Intifada , Rami Almeghari reports that :
in recent months , people in Gaza believe the international community began to direct its attention elsewhere , neglecting the siege of Gaza .
few international media outlets pay attention to the situation here .
the march hopes to change this .
Mustafa al-Kayali , coordinator of the steering committee for the Gaza Freedom March , reports :
we call on the internationals who come here not to consider their visits as tourism .
rather , they should convey a real message from the ground to their peoples , organizations or governments …
most of local youth with whom I talked over the Gaza Freedom March expressed excitement and enthusiasm for participation .
they are keen to send a message to the outside world that the Palestinian people are there and that humans should be united for the sake of freedom .
more information about the Gaza Freedom March , its participants , mission , and on-going preparation , can be found here .
video Plea for Public Toilet Facilities in Jharkhand , India
Amit Topno , a ‘ Video Volunteers ’ community correspondent reports that the residents of Nichitpur village in the Indian State of Jharkhand do not have any working public toilet .
the villagers plea to the local authorities via this video to ensure that proper toilets are installed .
Brazil : blogosphere in support of anti-corruption bill
at the exact moment of this post &apos;s publication , over 1,735,000 people had already signed a petition supporting the Ficha Limpa ( No Criminal Record ) bill , which seeks to prevent politicians who have committed serious crimes , such as misuse of public funds , corruption , murder and drug trafficking , from running in elections .
it may be hard for the international reader to understand why a law is needed to regulate something like this , but in Brazil , there are a good number of politicians in office with a criminal record .
for example , the Congressional Deputy Paulo Maluf , whose name recently made it to the wanted list of Interpol , for conspiracy and appropriation of public funds .
( Malufar is a neologism invented by Brazilians , a verb meaning “ to steal public money ” .
the goal of the campaign , which included Avaaz.org in recent weeks , was to gather 2 million signatures before today Wednesday April 7 , the day the project is to be decided on in the Chamber of Deputies .
if approved in the Chamber , the bill goes to the Senate .
with the tagline “ A vote has no price , it has consequences ” , the Ficha Limpa campaign was launched in April 2008 by the Movimento de Combate à Corrupção Eleitoral &#91; Movement Against Electoral Corruption , pt &#93; with the goal to improve the profile of candidates running for office in the country :
in order to do this , we prepared a bill by popular initiative about the previous records of the candidates to tighten the criteria of ineligibility , that is , those who can not run for elections :
people convicted in first or single instance or through complaint in court ( in the case of politicians with special jurisdiction ) for serious crimes such as racism , murder , rape , drug trafficking and misuse of public funds .
such persons must be preventively barred from elections to deal with their problems with criminal justice .
one of the many banners that have become popular in the blogosphere
in addition to the 1.6 million signatures collected at the grassroots by activists and church groups , the project won the sympathy of the blogosphere , which embraced the project .
in October last year , Arthurius Maximus published the banner above , calling readers to participate in the campaign and saying it was high time they forgot any ideological differences and put pressure on MPs to approve the bill :
forget &#91; ... &#93; the customary insults of ideological debates .
forget the World Cup , the Olympics or the Brazilian Big Brother .
forget that your football team might be champion or might be demoted .
forget that your teacher is boring or that your students do not give a shit about their studies .
forget that your boss does not value you or forget your lazy employees .
time to forget the ideological differences and to shine in a new era in national politics .
&#91; ... &#93; As you might have expected ( in the House of Representatives , more than a third of the congressmen would be immediately ineligible if the bill passed ) , politicians are working to bar , modify or make the project harmless .
a signature to end corruption .
banner by Renato Hirata
Pedro Hutsch Balboni , who normally does not blog about politics , opens an exception to promote the online petition hosted by Avaaz , even if the votes there are not for real :
of course people won &apos;t be able to vote on this , we are left with very important causes like the &#91; 2005 &#93; gun ban referendum , whereas choosing “ whether we want corrupt politicians or not ” is only decided by the Deputies ( can you believe it , the politicians ! ) .
but , in the middle of this dirt , there are also good politicians , who are really interested in the future of this country , who are against corruption in politics .
not everyone is optimistic about the Ficha Limpa bill approval .
Fernandinho Brasileiro thinks that such a project in a country like Brazil even looks like a bad taste joke :
MCCE tries in vain to pass this bill that runs into the constitution itself and does not provoke the slightest interest from politicians .
after all , Mr “ Castle Deputy ” &#91; see background story &#93; , the deputy who does not give a shit about public opinion , those who receive bribes , the bloodsuckers , are totally opposed to this law , as they would be directly affected by it .
the Ficha Limpa law does not take into consideration the political and economic system that prevails in the country .
other bloggers asks about the feasibility of making such projects work in reality .
Ricardo RicBrSp says the idea is not too bad , but as he does not believe it would work but bring chaos , he prefers to campaign for null vote :
if this were to happen the whole of Brazil would have no direction , no leadership , no executive power , because it can only operate under current conditions , fueled by corruption .
going viral
despite the pessimism of some , on the eve of the vote in the Chamber of Deputies , the bill became viral , doing the rounds in mailing lists and having even made it many times to the Twitter trending topics for Brazil .
many tweets promoted the Avaaz petition , but Tico Santa Cruz pointed out contradictions in the Brazilian law , which does not allow that people with criminal record apply to be public servants :
@ Ticostacruz : those with criminal records can not bid to work as a public servant , so it is the same logic for politicians http : / / bit.ly / b2SVXu – Sign it !

many , however , have no hope the bill will be signed into law .
@ jrkbza is one of them :
@ jrkbza : are they seriously believing that this Ficha Limpa bill will be approved by the deputies ?
I hope so , but I don &apos;t think it will .
and not even members of parliament are that confident .
deputy Chico Alencar , who backs the project , calls the attention of the population :
@ depchicoalencar : ‘ Ficha limpa ’ this week in the Chamber .
watch out : they &apos;ll either try to “ improve ” the bill ( = make it innocuous ) or postpone voting …
however , having the support of both , left and right wing parties in some degree , the project makes some people hopeful , such as Adriana Cristina , who believes that people can change the country with the power of their votes :
@ adryanacristina : let &apos;s put pressure on the deputies reaching 2 million signatures to show that if they don &apos;t vote for “ Ficha Limpa ” we won &apos;t vote for them !
Malaysia &apos;s 14-Year Old Bride
recently , it has been reported that an arranged marriage between a 14-year-old girl and a 23-year-old teacher ‘ has triggered a call for a fresh debate on child marriage ’ .
under Malaysia ’ s Syariah Law , which has jurisdiction over Muslims , Muslims under the age of 16 would require the consent of the Syariah Court before a marriage is allowed .
in this case , the Court had granted permission for the couple to marry .
Glenda Larke believes that a child marriage is no different to paedophilia , even if it is legal .
a 14-year-old school girl is not an adult .
she &apos;s not a woman , even if she has started her menses .
she &apos;s still a child .
she looks up to adults .
her religion and her culture tell her to obey her elders , especially her parents .
she is gullible and vulnerable .
a 23 year old man who marries her – an educated man , not some illiterate fellow whose society is still steeped in the 19th century idea that children should be working at 12 and married at 14 – is purely and simply a paedophile .
B.Joe is of the opinion that the rights of children and minors are not being upheld by the Syariah Court and the girl ’ s parents .
and the funny part of the whole deal is that the marriage was approved by the Syariah Court – what happened to the protection of the minor ?
why the parents could not wait for a few more years until the minor is able to decisions for herself ?
UN : dhimmi also believes that it is morally wrong .
study after study shows that girls subjected to sexual activity at such early ages suffer not only damage to their still-developing reproductive systems , but also lasting psychological trauma .
however , Fyzal took a more neutral stance on the issue .
in the situation above the consent of Syariah Court has been obtained .
that means we should have confidence in our Syariah Judges – they must have taken into account all circumstances before granting consent .
such consent , I believe , had been granted on the confidence of the judges that the man can take care of the girl and the girl could grow up well under the care of that man .
if the judge doubted it , such consent will not be granted .
thus , I submit that in the issue of the marriage of Muslim girls under the age of 16 , lets the Syariah Courts do their work .
they know when to grant the consent and when not to grant the consent .
but I am of the view that open discussion is still required between the Government and the Syariah experts to deal with this issue .

Africa : ICTs for Refugees and Displaced Persons
in recent weeks Global Voices has presented to its readers more examples of how citizen media is used to amplify the voices of refugees and displaced people .
however , while blogs and social networking sites clearly have a role to play in empowering marginalized groups , so too do ICTs in general .
MobileActive , for example , is encouraged by the potential for mobile phones to allow refugees to not only remain in contact with loved ones , but to also more easily locate them .
attention is especially drawn to a special issue of Forced Migration Review which takes an in-depth look at the use of ICTs in this context .
refugees in Uganda are using SMS and cellphones to reconnect with family members and close friends .

refugees often experience a compound trauma : the situation that caused them to flee in the first place , as well as the fact that many families become separated during migration .
for refugee &apos;s health and well-being and ability to resettle , it is vital to know the whereabouts of relatives , their safety , and their ability to remain in contact .
today , mobile phones are the most important technology for refugees to find relatives and remain in contact .
the Forced Migration Review Issue 38 , The Technology Issue covers technologies for refugees in particular .
two chapters shine a light on the use of mobile phones among refugees , as well as some of the problems with this tech to find and contact family member such as issues of security , and accessibility .
deputy UN High Commissioner for Refugees T Alexander Aleinikoff provides an introduction to the special issue :
Superficially at least , today ’ s refugee camps do not appear significantly different from those that existed 30 or 40 years ago .
Modernisation seems to have passed them by .
but upon a closer look , it becomes apparent that things are changing .
today , refugees and IDPs in the poorest of countries often have access to a mobile phone and are able to watch satellite TV .
Internet cafés have sprung up in some settlements , the hardware purchased by refugee entrepreneurs or donated by humanitarian organisations such as UNHCR .
and aid agencies themselves are increasingly making use of advanced technology : Geographic information systems , Skype , biometric databases and Google Earth , to give just a few examples .
in one article , the example of a tracing project implemented by the Refugee Consortium of Kenya ( RCK ) in cooperation with Refugees United ( RU ) is highlighted :
in 1991 Ahmed Hassan Osman * fled the conflict in Somalia , leaving his family in Kismayu , and made his way to Kenya in search of asylum .
Ahmed lived for a while in Ifo refugee camp before being resettled to Colorado in the US where he was granted full US citizenship .
in 1992 , his cousin Abdulahi Sheikh arrived in Kenya in search of support . granted refugee status , Abdulahi ended up in Dagahaley camp in Dadaab .
he believed Ahmed was either in Dadaab or had been there but his efforts to find him were unsuccessful and he soon gave up hope of ever finding him .
in fact , Abdulahi believed Ahmed had gone back to Somalia .
in early 2011 RCK employed Abdulahi to assist the RU project in Dagahaley refugee camp .
Abdulahi registered with the tracing project and began a search for missing loved ones .
coming across a name that was familiar , he contacted the person through the RU message system .
when he received a reply he realised that , after 20 years of separation and search , he had found his beloved cousin .
today , the two keep in touch regularly and both Abdulahi and Ahmed continue to search for more friends and family members .
of course , as MobileActive also stresses , some problems with local infrastructure remain an obstacle to the widespread adoption of such systems :
in some areas of Africa , there is no telecommunications coverage .
workshop participants commented that where it does exist , phone connections are regularly cut off , and some of them had also experienced intrusion in communication such as crossed lines .
the strength of the network signal overseas is weak , and the lack of a reliable or steady source of electricity in a recipient ’ s country can be a major problem , although this varies by region .
growth of populations in some areas weakens network strength , due to the drain on power .
individuals may also have difficulty accessing electricity to charge their mobile phones .
finding the best technology to use for different family members can be difficult , particularly if they themselves are displaced , because of factors such as the variety of available services , whether the family member could afford them and whether they have the skills to use them .
one participant observed that the majority of their family members overseas needed to access communication technology through others .
one participant described the difficulties she had in contacting her husband in a camp .
she sent money to him to buy a phone but other people in the camp would also use it leaving her often waiting for hours to get in touch .
cheap options such as email , voice-over-internet or instant messaging may not be accessible or affordable , and access to the internet in Africa is very expensive .
furthermore , displaced family members overseas may not know how to use these facilities .
from providing refugees with access to information on health and educational opportunities to using Facebook , Gmail Chat and Skype to maintain connections with family members and friends across geographical divides , the issue provides a comprehensive overview of how ICTs are being used .
Ushahidi also gets a mention in relation to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti as well as in general as it pertains to conflict , disaster and refugees .
indeed , PBS ’ Idea Lab takes a look at an Al Jazeera and Ushahidi collaboration to connect and empower Somalis separated by conflict and famine :
Somalia Speaks is a collaboration between Souktel , a Palestinian-based organization providing SMS messaging services , Ushahidi , Al Jazeera , Crowdflower , and the African Diaspora Institute .
“ We wanted to find out the perspective of normal Somali citizens to tell us how the crisis has affected them and the Somali diaspora , ” Al Jazeera &apos;s Soud Hyder said in an interview .
the goal of Somalia Speaks is to aggregate unheard voices from inside the region as well as from the Somalia diaspora by asking via text message : how has the Somalia Conflict affected your life ?
responses are translated into English and plotted on a map .
since the launch , approximately 3,000 SMS messages have been received .
for Al Jazeera , Somalia Speaks is also a chance to test innovative mobile approaches to citizen media and news gathering .
in October 2010 , MobileActive also profiled a mobile-based project implemented by Refugees United in Uganda with the support of Ericsson , UNHCR and the Omidyar Network , noting that one blog called it “ the social network that is more important than Facebook . ”
the Technology Issue by Forced Migration Review can be read online here . this post is part of our special coverage on Refugees .
Iran : scandal over Minister &apos;s Forged Oxford University Degree
Ali Kordan , Iran &apos;s new Minister of the Interior , has recently been under fire for presenting a “ fake ” Ph.D. degree from the prestigious Oxford University in the United Kingdom .
several websites , including the conservative Alef have published a scan of Kordan &apos;s “ Oxford Honorary Doctorate of Law Degree ” .
Alef points out that there are several grammatical errors in the so called Oxford certificate , such as : “ to be benefitted from its scientific privileges ” .
also , “ entitled ” was spelled “ intitled ” .
Alef has also uploaded several faxes that this site exchanged with Oxford University on the issue .
the website was then filtered in Iran .
while Iranian authorities are investigating this case , Oxford University announced that they have no record of Mr. Kordan graduating from there .
Iranian blogger , Mr. Behi , writes :
President Ahmadinejad performed yet another miracle : he selected someone as interior minister who claimed to have a Ph.D. degree in law from The University of Oxford !
when questions rose on the authenticity of the degree , the guy outraged , threatened the media and produced this to shut them up .
a degree so suspicious that is feared to be faked , with grammar mistakes and with names signing it who are not even members of the Faculty of Law !
if Ahmadinejad wants to fake the next election , he &apos;d better employ someone who does it less obviously .
what a shame !
Mohmmad Ali Abtahi , former reformist vice president and blogger , writes that when he was the deputy of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance , he met an Iranian official who had “ bought ” his Ph.D.
according to Abtahi , it seems the price was around US $ 1000 .
according to another blogger , Shirzad &#91; Fa &#93; it seems that Ali Kordan does not even hold an undergraduate degree .
the blogger adds :
it means he cheated all these years and got paid as a Ph.D. holder … One of deputies in the Iranian Parliament asked Kordan : “ How did you get your Ph.D. in Law , when you say you wrote your thesis in Islamic Education ? ” “ How did you defend it when you cannot speak English . Kordan replied , “ I had a translator . ”
blogger Jomhour says &#91; Fa &#93; Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defended his Minister and asked , “ Who needs these torn papers ! ”
the blogger asks :
if the certificates are useless , torn , paper why did Ahmadinejad &apos;s Minister pretend to have one … It is not the first time that Ahmadinejad calls official documents torn papers .
previously he has also called United Nations resolutions against an Iranian nuclear program just useless torn papers .
Ali Akbar Javanfekr , Ahmadinejad &apos;s media adviser , says &#91; Fa &#93; the Ministry of Sciences should take a decision about Kordan &apos;s Ph.D. and suggests it would be better we not to involve personal political opinions on the issue .
Colombian Government Plans Peace Talks with FARC
in the blog Crónicas , Santos García Zapata explains the context around the Presidential decision to start peace talks with guerrilla groups .
the Congress ’ Peace Commission has declared that President Santos “ is not alone ” in his determination to reach peace .
Algeria-Egypt : online Feud Over Football Match
tension is building between Egyptian and Algerian football fans ahead of a decisive match due to take place in Cairo on November 14 .
the encounter will determine which of both teams will qualify to next year &apos;s FIFA World Cup in South Africa .
Egypt needs at least a two-goal win to force a playoff on a neutral ground while Algeria , which has failed to qualify to the World Cup since 1986 , will battle to keep its current leading position in the qualifiers group .
ahead of the Saturday showdown , rival fans have been gearing up offline , as well as in heated online exchanges , escalating into a bitter “ cyber-war ” of intimidation .
Algerian blogger Adel , sums up the chain of events that led to the row .
he writes :
it seems that the match already started online , away from the football pitch .
well before the 22 players entered the famous Cairo Stadium , a bitter showdown began between Algerian and Egyptian Facebookers .
it all started with friendly discussions in forums , before things got out of proportion .
wanting to show their expertise in image editing , the Egyptians were the first to open hostilities by publishing “ anti-Algerian ” photographs.The Egyptians wanted to show that their players were the “ strongest ” and that they are able to crush the Algerian national team .
this gave the go-ahead to a war of a peculiar kind .
a war of images and parody .
videos , dubbing scenes taken from famous Hollywood blockbusters , flooded YouTube , placing the face-off at a Homeric level .
in the following video &#91; Ar &#93; , posted by hakemvoip , Mel Gibson is Rabah Wallace ( Braveheart ) , an Algerian war leader who tries to galvanize his troops ahead of the much expected confrontation :
in this other video , Egyptian ulyesis welcomes Algerian fans to what he calls “ hell ” in Cairo :
blogger GEMYHOoOD &#91; Ar &#93; posts pictures of thousands of Egyptian fans who queued up in different parts of Cairo , hoping to get tickets for the match .
he publishes pictures of the gatherings :
GEMYHOoOD also posts some eyewitness accounts :
I took the day off to come to the club at 8 AM &#91; to get tickets &#93; .
sadly I found a huge crowd and a large queue of about 3000 , with people pushing and swearing .
I couldn &apos;t move .
I was stuck .
I thought , this is a disgrace .
the official bus of the Algerian football team , which arrived in Cairo on November 12 , was allegedly assaulted by local fans , as the following video , posted on YouTube by Vidéos Mouloudia Club d &apos;Oran , seems to be showing :
the world football governing body FIFA , felt it necessary to issue a warning to the football associations of Algeria and Egypt , reminding both that “ the preliminary competition for the 2010 World Cup should end as it began , in the spirit of fair play with the necessary cooperation of all the parties . ”
a website , Algerie Egypte Match &#91; Ar , Fr &#93; , dedicated to the event and monitoring all kind of news related to the match , was created by Algerian fans .
within this climate of bitter rivalry , some people created a group on the social networking website Facebook , pleading for more tempered feelings .
Laama Bouchema posts a message on the group &apos;s Wall saying :
&#91; a &#93; s much as i am angry for what happend to the algerian team , i do not judge a whole nation for what some idiots did !
it is stupid what angry fans are doing !
for god &apos;s sake it wont matter who gets in the &#91; Wold Cup &#93; .
Egyptian blogger Lasto Adri &#91; Ar &#93; , deplores how what was supposed to be a sporting event , degenerated into a nasty confrontation .
she writes :
I &apos;m surprised by the level of intolerance and the mean language used by fans of the Egyptian and Algerian teams , which appears in most comments on news and sport websites … I &apos;m also bewildered by the way some anchors and journalists ( from both sides ) , are fueling this tragedy through their fiery comments …
Algerian fans misbehaved in the previous game .. but is the Egyptian reaction right ?
.. Should the answer be ( as some suggested ) the poisoning of Algerian players ?
harassing and depriving them from sleep ?
setting the stadium ablaze the day of the match ?
I am upset by the comments on most sites .. I remembered when Algeria – led by President Houari Boumedienne – despite its extreme poverty , came to the support of Egypt in the 1973 war .. I &apos;m saddened by the fact that such a relationship between two peoples might break up over a foot ball …
Togo : Preacher Transports 4.2 kg of Cocaine Hidden in Lollipops to Build Church

the drugs were hidden inside caramel lollipops ; Koufoualesse argued that he did not know about the cocaine and that the lollipops were to be sold to help build a church .
Russia : anti-government Protest Covered By Bloggers , Ignored By Media
at least 7,000 protesters gathered on the streets of Kaliningrad &#91; ENG &#93; , the country &apos;s westernmost city , on January 30 to demand , among other things , the resignation of the regional governor Georgy Boos &#91; ENG &#93; and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
but don &apos;t count on the leading Russian media outlets to tell you about it .
the biggest and most popular TV channels keep their silence .
mainstream newspapers and radio stations ignore the rally and go about their business like nothing happened .
but it only takes a quick glance at the most popular blog posts on RuNet ( Russian Internet ) to realize that the protest in Kaliningrad is the hottest topic of the day .
famous political leaders , journalists and regular netizens flooded the blogosphere with their takes on the protest .
Boris Nemtsov ( a.k.a. LJ user b-nemtsov ) , a former Russian Deputy Prime Minister , wrote an inspiring post “ Kaliningrad is the hope of free Russia ” where he stressed the uniqueness of the protest in Kaliningrad &#91; RUS &#93; :
I haven &apos;t seen such a grandiose rally for the last ten years .
at the protest , people expressed their political demands : the resignation of Putin and governor Boos .
the uniqueness of the Kaliningrad phenomenon is participation of all oppositional groups of the region in the protest .
blogger olegmakarov added &#91; RUS &#93; that , unlike in the past , the police forces in the city did not even try to prevent people from protesting .
Nemtsov later talked about the unusual friendliness of the Kaliningrad police in a short video &#91; RUS &#93; shot during his detention in Moscow on January 31 .
LJ user yashin ) , a political activist and columnist for an oppositional Russian newspaper “ Novaya Gazeta , ” explained &#91; RUS &#93; the friendly attitude of the police :
the police forces stayed calm .
no aggression , following the law , a SWAT team peacefully slept in trucks parked on the side .
the reason is obvious : when more than 10,000 people gather on the square , the police are with people .
because it is easy to disperse 100 people .
and 12,000 people can themselves disperse anyone if needed .
many hundreds of comments to those blogs cover a wide range of feelings .
many people seem to believe that the protest will change the situation in the country for the better .
the vast majority of bloggers agree with the claim that something like this was unimaginable several years ago when the approval rating of Vladimir Putin was through the roof .
many people see the protest as a sign of big changes in political landscape of the country .
but not everyone on the bogosphere shares the optimism .
Nikolay Troitsky ( a.k.a. LJ user _ kutuzov ) , a political analyst for the Russian Information Agency , is not that exited &#91; RUS &#93; about the rally &apos;s results :
many people went to protest in Kaliningrad , many unhappy people went out in Vladivostok , the whole city of Tambov , Lipetsk and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky can go on the streets .
all this is not important .
nothing will move and nothing will change until the mass protests start happening in Moscow .
it is rubbish .
it &apos;s too little .
LJ user clen _ lj replied &#91; RUS &#93; to Troitsky :
everything big starts with a small thing .
a couple of years ago , it was difficult to imagine that ten thousand people with different political views would go out under the slogan of Putin &apos;s resignation .
but Troitsky is still not convinced :
it will take another 10-15 years for everything big to start with a small thing .
the posts on the lack of media coverage of the protest also occasionally emerge in the blogosphere .
blogger kt-withlove wrote &#91; RUS &#93; :
why the protest with 10,000 people is covered only by Lenta.ru ?
RIAN &#91; Russian Information Agency - GV &#93; is silent .
Vesti.ru &#91; Web site of a news program on TV channel &quot; Russia &quot; - GV &#93; is silent .
one can feel the censorship ) ) )
but it looks like the mainstream media censorship is no match for an open information access online where Russians can easily practice free speech .
but as the Russian blogosphere is gradually becoming mainstream , the question is how long does it take for the government to start treating it the way it treats the mainstream media .
Global Health : world Toilet Day Raises a Stink
while it may sound like a bad joke , today &apos;s World Toilet Day focuses on a not-so-funny issue impacting almost half the world &apos;s population — a lack of toilets and sanitation .
people may be too embarrassed to openly talk about it , but everyone does it , toilet or not .
world Toilet Day helps people celebrate the importance of sanitation and raise awareness for the 2.5 billion people who don &apos;t have access to toilets and proper sanitation .
this video by the nonprofit WaterAid highlights the luxury of having a toilet .
celebrating your can may seem silly , but not having one can not only lead to embarrassment , lack of dignity and safety issues , but also preventable diseases and even death .
when people don &apos;t have toilets , they &apos;re forced to relieve themselves in open streets , fields , or back alleys .
the result ?
the contamination of drinking water and food sources , which leads to a slew of health risks .
lack of sanitation is the world ’ s biggest cause of infection and kills 1.8 million people , mostly children , a year .
even countries with abundant toilets have to deal with problems ranging from unhygienic public toilets to waterway-destroying sewage disposal .
Vanilla , blogging on Let &apos;s Look At It This Way from Singapore , says that people should care about toilets :
“ I know this is a crappy topic to most people .
it is unfortunate that it is a ‘ taboo ’ topic to talk about openly and many people remain ignorant about the scale of the problem .
I fail to understand how this can be an unimportant topic when , on an average , we visit the toilet 2500 times a year , or 6-8 times a day .
in our life time , we would have spent 3 years in the toilet . ”
organized by the nonprofit The World Toilet Organization , World Toilet Day is being celebrated globally with various events .
to further increase awareness , WaterAid announced the launch of its new ToiletFinder UK App for iPhone users this week .
the free app helps Brits find the nearest public toilet while reminding them how lucky they are to have clean and safe toilets .
the largest event today , called The Big Squat , asks people to stop and squat for one minute in a public place to raise awareness .
these photos show people squatting globally , including this one of preschoolers in Singapore :
a blog from Brunei , the world according to panyaluru … , also shows appreciation for the toilet by putting it into perspective :
“ Imagine if we are walking along in the row of shops in Kiulap or Gadong .
suddenly the tummy grumbles , just like the worst ribut you can think off .
no rest bite .
grumble and grumble .
rumblings .
the light is on amber and ready to turn green .
but no toilets in sight .
not a single public toilet in the rows of shops … Add to that no water , no tissue , nothing !
that could be the worst day of your life , your worst nightmare , ever worse than the nightmares those kids have in the Nightmare on Elm Street Movies .
on this day , let ’ s show our appreciation to our toilets . ”
despite its serious side , many people have used humor to celebrate World Toilet Day .
in the U.K. , the blog London City Drains features a 10-question toilet quiz , while in this video high school teacher Matt Cheplic sings about the day .
some bloggers point out that toilets alone may not be the answer .
Sandhya , blogging on Maradhi Manni in India , says many men don &apos;t use available toilets :
“ In a city like Chennai , where the climate is hot nearly 10 months of the year , I see men urinating on the roadside all the time .
when women can control and go home and relieve themselves , why can &apos;t men do so , I don &apos;t know .
so , first of all people should be fined heavily for doing this crime ( yes , it is crime ) on the spot .
I have seen them doing this on the wall of the public toilets !
in Srirangam , I saw them urinating on the compound wall of the temple even though every street surrounding the temple had toilets , which were clean , but pay toilets ! ”
while lack of sanitation impacts everyone , the taboo around toilets can disproportionately affect women .
in some countries , modesty forces women do their business in fields before sunrise or to hold it until after the sun sets , leading to health and safety concerns .
Joanne Sprague , blogging on Overturning Boulders in India , observes that women are absent from the morning toilet run in Chennai , while in Ethiopia the blog AN ADVENTURE IN ADDIS notices a similar situation :
“ I ’ ve heard so often about the lack of toilet facilities for women or lack of toilets in general ; that teenage girls in the countryside get up at 4 am to go out in the dark to do their business so they don ’ t get bullied by the boys at school or stop going to school altogether .
men just pee anywhere , cigarette in hand and there ’ s an assumption that women don ’ t need to , if they are thought about at all … .I want to see a huge billboard in Amharic saying ‘ Girls go too ’ with a picture of Barbie sitting on a toilet . ”
to celebrate World Toilet Day , blogger Jonathan Stray , takes readers on an international tour of toilets he &apos;s visited , from Thailand and the U.K. to West Africa and Oman , concluding :
“ We in the west with our flush toilets and toilet paper and sparkling shower stalls are the exception ; the rest of the world thinks a bathroom is a wet , smelly place , when they have a bathroom at all .
a good toilet means you probably have a very good quality of life , so enjoy yours .
happy World Toilet Day ! ”

Tunisia : doctored Photographs Symptomatic of the State of The National Press
the use of national media as an instrument of propaganda has been fairly well documented in Tunisia .
Tunisian citizen media have been well adept at tracking the numerous instances of fabrication of information and censorship of publications critical of the government .
the latest evidence of media manipulation was identified by Tunisian bloggers on August 20 when newspaper Le Temps and its Arabic version Assabah published reports on fundation Zeitouna sending of humanitarian food supply to the victims of the floods in Pakistan .
to illustrate the report and the involvement of businessman and the president son-in-law Sakhr El Matri in the initiative , Le Temps published a photo showing Sakhr El Matri inspecting the materials before they were loaded into the aircraft :
photo in Le Temps showing modified images via Nawaat.org
the community blog Nawaat describes features on the images that suggest that they have been doctored &#91; fr &#93; :
Nawaat finds a bit of humour noting that at least , the Arabic version of the newspaper did a slightly better job at doctoring the photos :
Assabah , the arabic version of the newspaper , also published the same photo with a slightly better photoshopping effort albeit still quite detectable .
when one zooms in on the contentious area , one can see that the right arm is now seen behind the elbow of the man with the blue shirt as the laws of optic would dictate
same image in Assabah with a different modification via Nawaat.org
the fact that the doctored images were outed online clearly reached the editors of the newspapers because the photos were promptly replaced soon after in the online version .
a video posted on facebook did show Sakhr El Matri inspecting a humanitarian airplane but it is unclear whether the video was shot before or after the photos were published .
it is all the more astonishing that doctored photos would be utilized in two national newspapers so liberally if it seems that original images were available using the video footage .
one must also note that Sakhr El Matri is fully involved in the management of both newspapers .
Tunisian bloggers have also wondered in what capacity Sakhr El Matri , a civilian , was allowed to access the runway of what looks like a military base airport .
Tunisian twitter user Lilopatra also wonders what kind of plane the Zeitouna foundation used to transport the humanitarian food supply to Pakistan .
she adds :
if we always try to consider issues from the perspectives of the top person , it will considerably slow down the maturity process and decision making ability of citizens # Tunisia
unfortunately , these doctored photos are fairly symptomatic of other manufactured information in Tunisia .
for instance in 2009 , the news agency Tunis Afrique Press ( TAP ) reported that Tunisia was ranked 32 out of 165 countries on the political stability index generated by The Economist Intelligence Unit .
the only problem is that the index actually shows that Tunisia was ranked 134th , a hundred slots below the one stated in the introduction of the article .
update : it is important to clarify , as a reader points out , that the list ranks the most instable countries first .
therefore it is correct to assert that Tunisia is the 32nd most politically stable nation .
the use of the reversed ranking instead of the ranking as stated by EIU is explained by Nawaat as follows :
while it &#91; the ranking &#93; is … ” upside down ” , the presentation of the index in such manner by TAP is most certainly for the “ sake of clarity ” and understandably so .
after all , to speak of instability in the country known for , as often stated by officials , its security and stability could … “ destabilize ” the reader
snapshot of The EIU Political Stability Index via Nawaat.org
in 2007 , the same agency was guilty of overstating a report that claimed that the International Herald Tribune wrote a full page report on the educational system of Tunisia , including two articles about the government striving provide the best educational system for its citizens and the importance of education for the development of the nation .
they omitted an important part though , they forgot to mention that there was never such articles in the IHT news section but rather a full commercial page in the paid advertisement section .
the original TAP articles about the political stability index and the IHT report are not accessible to the public online anymore .
Tunisia is often praised for its robust export-driven liberal economy but slammed for its authoritarian political system .
the Economist &apos;s 2008 democracy index classified Tunisia as an authoritarian regime with a ranking of 141 out of 167 studied countries .
Guinean Journalist Mysteriously Disappears in Angola
where is Milocas Pereira ?
a question echoing through the blogosphere for a couple of weeks , but the response is slow in coming .
on social networks a movement sprung up to pressure Guinean authorities to investigate the disappearance , six months ago , of the journalist and university professor in the Angolan capital city Luanda , where she has lived since 2004 .
on Facebook the group “ SOS , STOP !
– Queremos a Jornalista Milocas de volta ” ( We Want Journalist Milocas Back ) already has 5,775 members .
recently , the President of the Association of Community of Guinea-Bissau Immigrants in the United States , Celina Spencer , also launched a petition directed to the UN High Commission of Human Rights , to try and get support to locate the journalist .
she offered some interviews , analyzing some of the crises currently occurring within Guinea-Bissau .
specifically , the Guinean government &apos;s role and presence of the Angolan military “ Missang ” deployed to Guinea-Bissau for military reformation &#91; on which Global Voices reported upon the coup d &apos;etat in April 2012 &#93; .
it is unknown whether her disappearance is connected with the interviews or not .
it is certain however , she was assaulted by strangers .
afterwards , feeling threatened in Luanda , she considered and confided to a friend that she desired to return back home .
in an interview with Angolan television , at the beginning of January , the professor spoke about the situation in Guinea-Bissau after the death of President Malam Bacai Sanhá .
after this , Milocas Pereira said that she began to feel under great pressure .
on last November 3 , the Sindicato dos Jornalistas Angolanos ( Union of Angolan Journalists ) denounced that the Guinean journalist had been “ terrorized ” in Luanda :
Milocas Pereira was attacked in the beginning of the month of May by unknown people , before having communicated her intention to leave Angola to some people she had spoken with .
she pointed to this attack as the cause for this decision .
according to “ Sol Mansi ” Radio , the journalist had no doubts that the attack had strong political motivations :
she was running the risk of losing her life , and the only solution that she had was to immediately leave Angola , and return to her country .
counselled by a friend to publicly denounce the attack , MP said she preferred not to .
further counselled to go to Portugal , MP said she did not trust the Portuguese and said she would feel better in Guinea-Bissau with those responsible for the transition .
last October , in statements to the same radio station , the Secretary of State for Communities in Guinea-Bissau , Idelfrides Gomes Fernandes confirmed the news about the possible disappearance of the journalist for the first time .
four months after her mysterious disappearance , the family decided to contact authorities , but the only response that they got was silence .
in its November 2nd edition , the Novo Jornal ( New Newspaper ) ( Angola ) dedicated an entire page to the disappearance of the journalist .
two months ago , Bartolomeu Capita of the National Movement of Cabinda wrote on the site of the organization Peace &amp; collaborative development network that Milocas Pereira could have been ordered killed in Angola :
nobody has seen Ms. Pereira or simply heard from her for almost a month now .
yet she was teaching at the independent University of Angola .
concerns have arisen which must be addressed .
more and more fellow scholars are discreetly suggesting that she may have been murdered , for having sought to investigate certain matters related to the obscure links between Angola &apos;s criminal regime and Guinea-Bissau .
news of the disappearance of the 58 year old journalist was made public at a time in which the family – that was trying not to complicate police investigations – began to lose hope that Milocas was still alive .
the brother of the professor , Carlos Pereira , who lives in Lisbon , said to Voice of America :
what comes to us &#91; from Luanda &#93; is this , she has disappeared since the end of July .
we suspect a lot .
that she could have run into many things and needed to flee , hide or had some could of retaliation .
on the blog Rispito , the Guinean Samba Bari alleges that the disappearance is another challenge for the transitional authorities and that the situation could widen the fissure between the Guinean government not recognized by Luanda and the Angolan government .
Myanmar &apos;s Unique Naming System
whenever a Myanmar national reveals that he or she does not have a surname , foreigners usually wonder why .
Myanmar might be one of the very few countries in the world where at least 90 percent of its population do not have a surname or family name .
the members of the same family can have completely different names and the number of words in each name can vary greatly .
WhatIsMyanmar writes about the unique naming practice in Myanmar :
but for us , Myanmar , last name is just a word in stories written in English .
believe it or not !
we don ’ t have family name at all .
and it ’ s apparently no space for another box beside the column of Name in any form to fill up IN MYANMAR .

and explains how people from Myanmar usually fill out forms which ask for both first name and last name :
but whenever we try to fill up the online forms , we have no choice except filling the family name space as they make it mandatory .
and , what do we fill ?
for me , I put first two words of my name as first name and last word as last name .
so random ?
well , at that point , you may wanna know how many words are there in each name ?
my wise answer is “ it depends ” .
yes , it totally depends of how creative the parents or whoever give the names are .
Twobmad mentioned how it is difficult to deal with Myanmar names in foreign communities :
I always got confused when it comes to filling the name such as first , middle and last name .
the same thing happens , after living in a foreign country , friends who would like to know how they would call me .
they are confused as well .
because when they will me by name first name , it is not either the way I have been called in my family as well as in my previous community .
they would use my first name to call me but I would feel strange if I have been called by the name which I never heard before .
ba Kaung blogged about the naming practice in Myanmar which includes astrological beliefs as well :
a few years later , after witnessing different cultural practices around the world , I realized that the Burmese custom of naming is fairly unique . it symbolizes the combination of the particular virtue for a person and astrological calculation of the day of the week that the person was born based on Burmese lunar calendar year .
he also covered the designation in Myanmar language which is important to its people but sometimes confuses foreigners such as “ U ” ( pronounced as Oo ) in “ U Thant “ .
in addition , people with one-word names usually face difficulties defining the family name as the first word such as “ U ” , “ Ma ” , “ Daw ” and so on , which are not their names technically :
expression of respect is also a matter of utmost importance to address the name of Myanmar people .
one can be addressed with an appropriate honorific salutation before the given name depends on the level of age , degree of relationship , and gender .
it will be considered impolite way of calling someone ’ s name in a direct manner of speaking . to address younger ones and peers before their names ,
to address elder ones before their names , “ U ” or “ Oo ” is used as a masculine and formal form .
“ Daw ” is used as a feminine and formal form .
since there is no family name for Myanmar nationals , women do not need to change any part of their name even after they get married , Dharana writes :
my third project has been to learn how to correctly pronounce my colleagues ’ names .
Burmese names depend on which day of the week a person was born and they don ’ t have a family name component .
this means women get to keep their entire given name even after marriage – something my female colleagues seem to take quite some pride in !
on the other hand , some ethnicities in Myanmar , descendants of India and Christians follow the pratice of having a family name .
Lionslayer writes that few people in Myanmar have surnames :
some people likes to take their father ’ s name using British naming system . Aung San Suu Kyi is daughter of Aung San and Hayma Nay Win is daughter of Nay Win .
yet you may rarely see those kinds .
Burmese people tends to name their new born babies according to astrology rather than naming after someone .
some of ethnics in Myanmar do have family names .
and some Muslims and Christians also name after their fathers or grandfathers
he concluded that the Myanmar government should set up a family record registration as it is difficult to trace one &apos;s family tree :
there is a downside of not having a family name .
it ’ s very difficult to trace someone ’ s ancestors for more than 5 generations .
it ’ s not a big problem if Myanmar has a family registry office .
I hope the government set up such a record and inquiry service .
anyway , We are not alone on Earth without family names .
I just learned that there are some more Asian ethnics without family names too .

Embassy difficulties
French Defense Minister Gérard Longuet reported to the French Senate Commission on Foreign Affairs on the morning of April 7 , 2011 .
he reported that the forces protecting Laurent Gbagbo number around 1,000 and explained that the main difficulty regarding the intervention of the presidential palace in Cocody ( where Gbagbo is hiding ) is the presence of numerous foreign embassies surrounding it .
the latter are fast becoming strategical and tactical points :
200 hommes pour défendre Gbagbo ?

Côte d &apos;Ivoire : Abidjan in the Waning Hours of Gbagbo &apos;s Regime
this post is part of our special coverage Côte d &apos;Ivoire Unrest 2011 .
the last two days have been rich in twists and turns in Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
forces loyal to Alassane Dramane Ouattara , the internationally recognised president of Côte d &apos;Ivoire , and Guillaume Soro , Ouattara &apos;s prime minister , began an offensive towards the South and the West of the country .
in less than three days , they succeeded in taking over the cities of Douékoué and reached Yamoussoukro on March 30th .
the Forces Républicaine de Côte d &apos;Ivoire ( Republican Forces of Côte d &apos;Ivoire ) have entered Abidjan , the main city of Côte d &apos;Ivoire where the incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to step down in December 2010 after losing the presidential election , may still be located .
the Ivorian online community commented on the events , and here is a quick snapshot of a few conversations .
fear of MACA Prisoners
Maison d &apos;Arrêt et de Correction d &apos;Abidjan ( MACA ) is the prison of Abidjan .
following news that prisoners had been released , Léon Guéré ( @ Cocoloposo ) wrote on Twitter on March 31 :
breaking News : MACA opened , prisoners on the lam
following this announcement , netizens started fearing that these prisoners would be given weapons :
@ Abidjannais225 , replying to @ Cocoloposo , said :
confirm please !
this is serious .
LMP &#91; party of Laurent Gbagbo &#93; wants to create chaos in the country
online activist “ K. ” ( @ Sanders225 ) confirmed the same day that prisoners of the MACA , and from two other prisons had been freed .
later , a news story on Reuters said up to 5000 prisoners had been freed in Abidjan .
where is Laurent Gbagbo ?
Guillaume Soro , the prime minister announced that Laurent Gbagbo had until 7pm GMT on March 31 , 2011 to resign .
this caused plenty of ironic reactions on the Twitter hashtag for news on Côte d &apos;Ivoire , # civ2010 :
fifteen minutes before the announced deadline , @ Malko7 tweeted a countdown :
and when the time was reached , Marie L &apos;Ange ( @ Attou _ 225 ) commented :
Nnenna tweeted :
in the meantime , violent clashes were taking place at the Radio Télévision Ivoirienne , Ivorian National TV .
the station was managed by Gbagbo partisans until the day before .
between 9pm GMT and 10.40 GMT , the same video was broadcast repeatedly : Laurent Gbagbo and his wife Simone , surrounded by their close entourage having a conversation in the Garden of the Presidential Residence in Cocody .
Laurent Gbagbo looks preoccupied , and Simone does not seem to realise the current situation of Abidjan , as shown in the following video posted by abidjannetTV , the YouTube account of the Ivorian news site :
the signal of the RTI finally stopped at 10.40 pm GMT , as shown in this picture shared by Olivier Vauluisant ( @ batelier59 ) :
end of Transmission of RTI &apos;s signal Batelier59 on Twitpic
according to Senam Beheton ( @ SenamBeheton ) on Twitter , these images where shown while Ouattara &apos;s FRCI were taking control of the State Television :
landlords have probably arrived .
is playtime over ?
sky News was reporting on April 1 that Laurent Gbagbo and his wife could still be in their palace in Cocody , while surrounded by Ouattara &apos;s FRCI .
later the same day , another version was given according to which Laurent Gbagbo and wife Simone had left the residence for the Presidential Palace in Plateau Area , Abidjan .
EdithBrou wrote on Twitter :

Bolivia : Ex-Beauty Queen Named Candidate for Governor of Beni
for many , the news that Bolivian President Evo Morales would name ex-Miss Bolivia Jessica Jordan , 25 , as the Movement Towards Socialism ( MAS ) party candidate for governor of the Department of Bení seemed like a late Day of the Innocents ( Bolivia &apos;s version of April Fools Day ) joke .
however , when the announcement became official in a live televised press conference , the reaction became immediate on Twitter , as well as the reaction to those reactions .
photo of Jessica Jordan by Hugo Miranda and used with permission .
initial opinions on Twitter were ones of disbelief that a former beauty queen would be nominated to participate in the elections in such a high-ranking position .
Diego Arrázola ( @ darrazola ) wrote :
not even for council member JESSICA JORDAN , but for GOVERNOR !
what is happening ?
is it still Day of the Innocents ?
Mariela Castrillo ( @ ardilla _ ilusa ) wrote :
it is hilarious about Jessica Jordan … .there aren &apos;t more people in Beni ?
no more young people with dreams ?
what a shame ..
there were similar messages of disbelief , and many referred to the fact that Jordan was the former Miss Bolivia .
however , others thought that it was not fair for people to react in this manner .
Patricia ( @ arquitecta ) counters :
what is the matter with you all ?
you think it is normal when someone ugly takes power , but when the candidate is beautiful , you complain … it is machismo !
Jaime Durán of the blog Economía Política , Desde el Lado Gracioso criticizes those that have already written off the candidate :
then there are those who forget their own positions regarding gender equality , who say that surely the girl is beautiful , but it is unlikely that her head is useful for something other than fixing her hair .
seeing the quality of governors that Beni has had so far , I doubt that one can criticize the beautiful Jessica Jordan for that matter .
I am sure that she will show aptitude on the matters that she will deal with , I &apos;ve always thought that beauty and intelligence are not incompatible at all .
one of the major questions that this nomination raises is “ What &apos;s in it for MAS ? ” Beni is a department in the Bolivian Orient that has traditionally been under the control of the opposition .
placing a nationally-known figure , who has not been a party member or active in politics is seemingly attracting the attention of the entire country and could turn the tide in that part of the country .
Hugo Miranda of Angel Caido adds his thoughts :
this is worth commenting , maybe it is obvious that the MAS is using public figures in the Departments where it does not dominate , in order to win the Governorships and Mayorships , in this way to have total control over all of Bolivia .
maybe for some , Jessica is being used for those ends by the all-powerful Evo Morales .
the doubt remains , and I think that Jessica deserves all this because she loves Bolivia very much .
the strategy seems to be working as some bloggers who have been apolitical , or even in opposition to the MAS party are starting to support Jordan .
however , some are making it clear that their support is going to the candidate , and not the political party .
even those people who are not eligible to vote in the Department are expressing their desire to help the candidate .
it still remains to be seen whether the strategy will work in the elections scheduled for April 4 , 2010 .
Miranda , who has not been a supporter of the MAS party , writes that the one candidate that he will support is Jordan to the extent that he will include free campaign advertising on his sites .
Durán concludes :
I think that the election in Beni will be the most interesting of all of the April elections .
in addition , from this platform ( his blog ) I announce that I am willing to travel to the beautiful lands of ( Beni ) to help out in the campaign .
Bahrain : journalists Denied Entry at the Airport
this post is part of our special coverage Bahrain Protests 2011 .
Bahrain awoke to a violent crackdown by police on demonstrators camped out at the country &apos;s iconic Lulu ( Pearl ) roundabout on Wednesday .
that afternoon , I boarded a flight from Doha , Qatar , to Bahrain , in part to see for myself what was unfolding in the island nation I once called home .
hours later , I found myself on a flight back to Doha , without having been allowed out of the airport .
here is how my story largely unfolded :
view from Bahrain International Airport .

@ omarc : hmm , SMS tweets not workin … at Doha airport , en route to Bahrain .
guess we &apos;ll see if the gov really is stopping people from coming in
@ omarc : asked to take a seat on arrival at Bahrain immigration .
no reasons given , just waiting to hear from them …
not sure what made them so suspicious – my mixed ethnicity , visas in my passport from Oman to Iraq , or the sponsor on my old Qatar residency …
@ omarc : at Bahraini immigration for 1hr , they ask who I work for … “ You used to work for Al Jazeera , right ? ” Yes , is there a problem ?
“ No problem ”
@ omarc : hit the 2hr mark waiting @ Bahrain immigration to enter the country .
journalists from UK , France and Japan sitting here too .
@ omarc : ladies from Ch 4 &amp; Radio France ( respectively ) as well as the Japanese gentleman have been allowed through into Bahrain .
still waiting …
while some journalists were being allowed in , others – including from BBC Arabic and US-funded Al Hurra – were reportedly denied access .
Mohammed Jamjoom , a reporter for CNN was asked by the Ministry of Information to leave the country .
@ JamjoomCNN : was not given a reason for my expulsion from Bahrain … Was told I was the only CNN team member being asked to leave … # Bahrain
Jamjoom can be seen in this CNN report speaking about his experience in Bahrain .
Alex Delmar-Morgan , a Doha-based WSJ reporter , was also detained briefly near Lulu ( Pearl ) roundabout in Manama , while CBS journalist Toula Vlahou reported being targeted by authorities .
as for me :
@ omarc : three hours at Bahrain immigration – now they say the country is not open for visitors , Manama is not safe , and I should go home .
@ omarc : Bahrain immigration officers ask me to accept their apology for denying me entry to the country , but say “ it will be fine in 2 to 3 days ” .
@ omarc : got my passport back after just shy of 5hrs , with a return boarding card marked for 5 : 30am … QA kindly rebooked me on 11 : 25pm flight
while sitting at Bahrain immigration , I didn &apos;t have access to the Internet , and instead , live-tweeted the event by SMS .
upon arriving back in Doha , I found a flurry of reaction to my tweets , which ranged from the concerned :
to the supportive :
@ nabeelalmahari : @ omarc best of luck mate I hope u all can make it
@ bhrabroad : @ omarc we can give you all the info you need even if u r at the airport # Bahrain
the skeptical :
@ Nninanina : @ omarc that proveregime doesnt want any 2 C crimes done against unarmed protesters what differ # Bahrain from Qaddafi using army against ppl
@ maljaya3 : @ omarc By the time you get there , they would have prepared the stage for you to see what they want you to see .
and the downright rude :
@ HubiBahrain : @ omarc get the hint … .
you are NOT welcomed all of you are bunch of liers
many thanks to those who tried to help , and good luck to the journalist on the ground , trying to cover Bahrain &apos;s story in such trying times .
you can read a narrative version of this story on Boing Boing , as well as the full set of tweets &amp; reactions on Doha News .

Mali : citizens Stunned by Sudden Military Coup
Renegade soldiers have announced that they are seizing power in Mali , after taking over the state television building and presidential palace .
they say President Amadou Toumani Touré &apos;s government failed to adequately support their troops in an increasingly violent struggle with Tuareg rebels in the north of the country who threaten to seek secession from Mali .
many citizens are perplexed as to why a coup is being staged so soon ahead of already scheduled elections on April 29 , 2012 , and there are many theories .
the leader of the coup in Mali Capitaine Sanogo via @ Youngmalian
Capitaine Sanogo is the leader of the new National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State ( CNRDR ) who say they will pilot the transition until the elections in April .
a spokesman of the committee , Lieutenant Kanoré stated that although they have dissolved the current institutions , they have no intention of holding on to power .
fights between soldiers who support the coup and others that remain loyal to President Touré are still ongoing .
some politicians and high-ranking officers have reportedly been arrested in Bamako , the capital city .
Malians citizens are a bit stunned by the turn of events .
here are some reactions after learning of the power grab by the armed mutiny &#91; fr and en &#93; :
@ TheSalifou : I am scared for my country … # Mali
@ Abdou _ Diarra : the Malian president Amadou Toumani Touré is allegedly well and is staying in a safe location according to a loyal soldier # Mali
@ Youngmalian ATT ( Mali &apos;s president ) was democratically elected by the people and his mandate was over in June .
what rights do the soldiers have to act on behalf of the people # Mali
@ ibiriti : democracy is not just about regular elections replacing one incompetent lot with another .
it has to deliver goods
@ philinthe _ : banks + petrol stations closed in # Bamako # Mali .
talking to taxi drivers who are asking double their normal price .
@ temite : whatever happens , the loser will inevitably be that unity , fraternal bond between peoples &amp; cultures # Mali
conspiracy theories abound as to why a coup is being staged only few weeks before the scheduled elections :
@ diatus2 : the coup in # Mali was expected because ATT ( Mali &apos;s president ) was letting the situation with the tuareg rebels linger so he could bring a third mandate
@ Giovannidjossou : # ATT ( Mali &apos;s president ) isn &apos;t doing anything against the terrorists in the north of Mali because the troubles would allow him to postpone the elections until next June !
@ Joe _ 1789 : I denounce : this coup that was conceived by armed bandits who are sell-outs of Francophone Africa , against Mali and its democratically elected president
the Twitter account of the Malian presidency has not been updated since March 21 when it refuted the alleged power grab :
@ PresidenceMali : formal denial : the Minister of Defence is neither hurt nor arrested .
he is at his desk and calmly attending to his daily tasks
state-sponsored Violence in Angola
blogger Claudio Silva argues on Africa Is a Country that a deeper look at state-sponsored violence ( urban evictions and crackdowns on protest ) is needed to put into perspective two viral videos that recently shocked the country ( see Global Voices coverage ) .
he writes “ the violence in Angola comes from the very top : the State ” .
Southeast Asia : sex and web censorship
regulating internet content today is viewed as an anti-democratic practice but Southeast Asian governments seem able to justify it by invoking the need to save the young from the scourge of indecent sexual behavior .
Indonesia ’ s plan to filter web of “ bad ” content through its Multimedia Content Screening team was shelved last February after it was opposed by the public .
today , the proposal is being revived in the wake of a celebrity sex tape scandal which continues to shock both the young and old in the world ’ s most populous Muslim-majority nation .
after enacting an anti-pornography law two years ago , Indonesia now wants to enforce an internet blacklist in response to the demand of conservative voices to protect the morals of the young .
a similar celebrity sex scandal hounded the Philippines last year which paved the way for the passage of an anti-voyeurism law .
the internet was also blamed for the instant dissemination of the sex tapes which prodded lawmakers to craft a cybercrime bill .
in Cambodia , the government is proposing to establish a state-run exchange point to control all local internet service providers which is intended to strengthen internet security against pornography , theft and other cybercrimes .
the draft regulation is not yet final but it is expected that the government will seriously pursue this measure especially after it recently became almost helpless in stopping the cell phone and internet uploading of an illegally taped video of nude ladies bathing in a monastery .
Southeast Asian governments do no always need sex scandals to censor the web since they can always cite other reasons , like national security , to filter and monitor internet content .
for example , Thailand became the first country in the world to shut down 100,000 websites for containing “ dangerous ” material .
it punishes bloggers , writers and website administrators for violating the lese majeste law .
Vietnam was accused by Google and McAfee of launching cyber attacks against some websites , specifically websites that advocate opposition to bauxite mining , a controversial issue in the country .
but politically-driven internet regulation often encounters strong opposition from internet users and it always elicits condemnation around the world , especially from media groups and human rights organizations .
governments can always ignore the noisy critics but they will also lose credibility .
governments with democratic trappings cannot afford to censor the online media for an extended period .
but regulating the web to stop pornography and other immoral acts somehow generates only a whisper of protest .
it has become the safest ruse to block “ harmful ” websites .
Myanmar ’ s internet regulation policy has been identified as one of the draconian measures imposed by the ruling junta but its decision to ban two weekly journals for posting photos of female models in short pants didn ’ t draw the normal level of opposition from democracy groups .
the aggressive drive to eliminate sex and sexual imageries in the online domain may be a symptom of the rising tide of conservatism in many Southeast Asian nations .
the morality card is being played to produce desirable attitudes , sentiments and behavior among the population even if this strategy disrespects the diverse cultures in the region .
when Indonesia passed the anti-porn law , the Bali governor protested since the law is contrary to the local tradition where making historic nude statues and erotic dances are sometimes still popular .
when Cambodia blocked websites showing pornography or sexy images , it included reahu.net for containing artistic illustrations of ancient bare-breasted Apsara dancers and a Khmer Rouge soldier .
another problem is the vague definition of what constitutes images and actions that are pornographic , indecent , immoral , and obscene .
Filipino activists are worried that the cybercrime bill would now make it unlawful to publish or upload materials that contradict the official state interpretation of what is decent , moral , and proper .
governments have mastered the tools and techniques of censorship in the traditional media .
they are now testing the limits of online regulation .
Indonesia ’ s plan to enforce an internet blacklist should be monitored because of its impact in the region .
Indonesia has more than 40 million internet users and it is acknowledged as the Twitter capital of Asia .
if Indonesia succeeds in filtering web content , other countries in the region are expected to follow this model .
web censorship does not only cut access to information ; it also weakens the power of internet users to form online solidarities .
to really protect the young and innocent , the best solution is to give them , their parents , and the community in general , the proper education and relevant information about the potential and risks of surfing the web .
African photographers , writers and artists find their voice in blogs
as more Africans come to realize the power of blogging as a tool for expression on a global scale , the number of bloggers has increased and so has the themes in focus .
in that number of growing blogs , a lot of African artists have also joined in with a huge increase noted in poetry blogs as well as emerging photography and visual arts blogs .
we review some of them .
Poéfrika is a weblog of creative , Africa-inspired writing .
the blog features poetry by various African poets , interviews with poets , writers as well news and information on world renowned poets and writers alike .
the blog also has a lot of resource material for would be poet as it lists links to various poetry publishing magazines , writers who have been featured in the blog and other links of interest to writers including their potrait photos .
Poéfrika is run by Rethabile Masilo a Lesotho citizen but currently based in France .
he also runs Canopic Jar and Basotho which also feature written and visual art .
Fikira Zangu ( Swahili for My Thoughts ) is a Kenyan blog ran by Bonyo Buogha Anthony who is based in Nairobi , Kenya .
the slogan for his blog is
“ Intense thoughts like active beings , come and go Haunt us then flee , leaving ajar the door . ”
this is what he says about himself
… .I my words forgot , and thoughts my wrote ; I &apos;m weeping laughter , Humming thoughts and writing beats , Walking thoughts and thinking walks … .
I would say that is a poetic piece right there .
Hi poetry is short and precise with most not exceeding 10 lines .
the themes range from love to politics to his challenges as a poet .
an excerpt from his poem – Will you still be mine
will you still be mine in the morning
after the evening passion fades
after all the pleasures of last night
have all been swept away
will you still be mine
after the bitter arguments and fighting
after harsh words have been exchanged
will you open your arms and let me back in

Merlin is a Campus student born in 87 .
he describes himself on his blog , iceboxmerlin .
got a swag to walk the talk , talk the walk sometimes , but always a down to earth and sensational individual to be around ! ’
you can tell from the image header that he is a great fan of animations .
he labels his blog , ‘ The Phanton Thought … … .. ’
his disclaimer ,
“ Here are my thoughts on the world , life and the unraveling of the universe .
the symptom of an involved mind with the features of life , is the intelligence and later a harnessed genius .
it is the achieved Phantom thought of thick air !
his blog features a lot of poetry and prose in which he explores different issues and themes .
an excerpt of his poem , ‘ The air is thick ! …
where the air is thick !
I have gone to a place ,
like what a journey would be …
and had sweet thick mango juice ,
a Kayamba playing in the back ground ,
like that group of men call themselves Kayamba Africa
there was a man though ,
a Rasta Man chewing at Muguka
green gobbler and something he &apos;s mumbling
between stuffing his mouth .
and puffing a cigarette ,
the air here is unmistakably thick
so he says with a thick baritone voice ,
“ write us some of that scribble you call poetry … ”
“ am in a mood for anything ”
and a thick air came about me ,
to put some sense into him !

his depictions of influential world faces on are superbly done with emotions that one can almost touch .
his blog is not more than a month old , something he started after attending a workshop on blogging and social networks in Nairobi .
he is currently putting together his first ever official collection that is titled “ Politics in Black and White ”
this is what he states as the purpose of art :
“ The main function of art should be to connect to people .
each of us appreciates art in one form or another , but we are turned off by the ‘ elite ’ who decided to complicate art by using labels such as ‘ surreal &apos; , ‘ new age ’ and ‘ contemporary &apos; .
the best art is the art that you love ! ”
we look forward to seeing the collection online .

this is how she describes herself :
” Black ; from the curl of my hair to the toe on my foot … . African ; it &apos;s in the blood flowing in my veins , the music in my voice , the dance in my walk … . lover of words ; written , drawn , sketched , scratched … Appreciative of the power of said words ; be they written , spoken , hidden or displayed ” .
her blog which is barely one year old confronts issues of trafficking of African Women for prostitution , love , culture and celebration of African Men among other themes ,
these blogs are proof that there is more to Africa than politics as has been depicted by many African bloggers .
we can be sure of seeing more such blogs .
Malaysia : state government introduces &apos; 1Toilet ’ policy
Malaysia ’ s Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak introduced the One Malaysia concept , popularly referred as 1Malaysia , when he took office .
being a multi-racial country , the main aim of 1Malaysia is to promote national unity and to strengthen the ties between various ethnic groups .
1Toilet policy is based on the 1Malaysia concept
borrowing the branding of 1Malaysia , the state government of Terengganu recently introduces the &apos; 1Toilet ’ policy as a move for both teachers and students ( of the same gender ) to share toilets to promote a sense of oneness .
“ When students share the toilets with the teacher , they ( students ) will believe that they are on par with academicians and this automatically invokes a sense of being important to an organisation , which , in this case , is the school , ” says State Education , Higher Learning , Human Resource , Science and Technology Committee chairman Ahmad Razif Abd Rahman in local daily The Star .
the policy will also extend beyond the loo as teachers are also encouraged to eat at the school ’ s cafeteria with the students .
it is a way for both parties to mingle during recess .
there were mixed reactions from the blogosphere regarding this topic .
some took it as a joke , while others thought it was a positive initiative .
Jeff Ooi , who is a prominent blogger and now a Member of Parliament says :
this time , 1Malaysia &apos;s product extension is where you pee .
life And Ti ( m ) es Of Liang Seng could not believe that the state government is actually introducing the 1Toilet concept :
I would understand the sharing of canteen part .
but to share toilet to instill a sense of belonging and create excellence ?
come on .
we can do better .
journalist , blogger and Global Voices author Niki Cheong writes in his personal blog :
which nutcase came up with this brilliant idea &#91; … &#93; I think sharing a toilet with the teacher won ’ t help a student excel in his or her studies , proper teaching will !
what ’ s the heck is going on ?
are we going to have to start eating 1ton mee after this ?
or only listen to 1Buck Short ?
or are we going to get people registering names like 1Sharina for birth certificates ?
Thots Here And There believes that leaders should walk the talk before implementing any policies :
why don &apos;t we start with the elite groups first before going to the majority ?
in my school , the upper crust get a special key to their own special toilet &#91; ... &#93; I know in certain companies in the private sectors there is such a privilege too .
I remember a friend being all excited because he had reached that privileged level of having his own key to that special place !
now , if we want to implement such a thing as 1toilet in school – imagine queueing up with the students to use the toilet – let us start with the upper level of administrators first .
leaders talk about 1Malaysia … come on , walk the talk .
show us , leaders of Malaysia that we are one in all ways inclusive in the use of toilet ! ! !
Voices Inside My Head explains the positive aspect of the 1Toilet policy :
when I was in school I did wonder the same thing , how come teachers get to pee in seperate toilets .
do they pee differently ?
do they have something else we don ’ t have ?
I think it should be done across the board , even at work places top management sharing the same toilets !
perhaps even ministers should share the same toilets as other government staff and that ’ s when I would really say our politicians are walking the talk !
this author , via his personal blog , says :
teachers should also lead by example and getting the best from their students .
if a student is already having an inferiority complex feeling in the classroom , how can he / she invoke a sense of importance with the 1Toilet policy ?
do we have to share the toilet to have a feeling of oneness between students and teachers ?
should this solidarity start in the classroom itself ?

the breaking news came in at 1 pm GMT on April 11 , 2011 : Laurent Gbagbo was arrested at his residence in Cocody , with his wife , Simone , and close entourage .
five months after he refused to hand the power to internationally recognised new president of Côte d &apos;Ivoire , Alassane Ouattara , the crisis in the country has now seemingly found its epilogue .
the sequence of events from April 10 to 11 , 2011
the French presidential office ( @ Elysée ) announced via Twitter that France had accepted to take part in a new military intervention in Côte d &apos;Ivoire on April 10 , 2011 :
@ Elysée : in agreement with President Ouattara , the UN Secretary General &#91; Ban Ki Moon &#93; asked N. Sarkozy to continue the French involvement in the UNOCI &#91; Côte d &apos;Ivoire &#93; operation
by making this statement , the Elysée justified resuming the military bombardments targeted at the Presidential Residence in Cocody , Abidjan , where Laurent Gbagbo was bunkering down . this decision was made in response to an attack directed at the Golf Hotel , the former headquarters of Ouattara &apos;s camp , by Gbagbo &apos;s Forces of Defense and Security ( FDS ) .
the bombings began at 5 pm GMT ( Abidjan Time ) .
this video was posted by Youtube User terryko0 on April 11 .

in the morning of April 11 , 2011 , the following video shot from Blockhaus , an Ebrié borough in the district of Cocody , Abidjan , showed tanks belonging to UNICORN , the French force in Côte d &apos;Ivoire on the move .
according to lgconnectTV , the user who posted the media on YouTube on April 11 , they were headed to Laurent Gbagbo &apos;s residence :
at 11 am GMT , international French television channel France24 confirmed the information on its live coverage page :
Armoured vehicles , backed by an helicopter , are approaching the residence of the outgoing president Laurent Gbagbo , according to testimonies gathered by AFP .
according to a Reuters press release published two hours later , Laurent Gbagbo was then arrested by French Special Forces , and handed to Ouattara &apos;s Republican Forces .
France24 , referring to the latter wrote :
&#91; breaking NEWS &#93; Reuters reports that Laurent Gbagbo has been arrested by French Special Forces
peace against all odds
following their arrestation , the Gbagbo couple was taken to the Hotel du Golf , under the close escort of international forces .
in the following video broadcasted by TCI , a TV channel known to be close to Alassane Ouattara , Laurent Gbagbo is handed a bulletproof vest to protect his life as he is being arrested :
Alassane Ouattara , the internationally recognised president of Côte d &apos;Ivoire ordered his forces not to violate Laurent Gbagbo and wife Simone &apos;s human rights .
TCI also posted another video in which the former president Gbagbo calls for the end of fightings , and for the return to peace :
I want us to stop using weaponry , I want us to enter the civilian part of the conflict , and end the crisis as fast as possible for the country to restart .
in an address to the Ivorians and to the international community on April 11 , 2011 , Alassane Ouattara reaffirmed his will to enforce the rule of law , guarantee the “ physical integrity ” of Laurent Gbagbo and his wife , and take the first steps towards rendering justice .
this drive for peace is shared by many Ivorians , such as Diouf Mamy ( @ mymaluydealbi ) who wrote on Twitter :
@ mymaluydealbi : after all that &apos;s happened , I hope Ouattara will be the president of all the Ivorians without exception .
let peace be back in Côte d &apos;Ivoire .

Chile : powerful 8.8-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Country
at 3 : 34 a.m. local time , an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 struck off the coast of the Maule region in Chile .
the earthquake was felt in the capital city of Santiago located 325km from the epicenter .
extensive damage has been reported throughout the country , and the number of casualties continues to go up .
throughout the day , aftershocks have also been felt in the region .
a blog Terremoto Chile ( Earthquake Chile ) was quickly created by Francisco soon after the earthquake hit .
in addition to posting recommendations on what citizens should do following the earthquake , he has been collecting and linking to various Twitpic pictures .

near the epicenter , Robinson Esparza of the citizen newspaper El aMaule , part of the Diarios Ciudadanos network has been updating a post with the latest regional and national news .
many comments have been worrying about family members in areas outside the capital , and this lack of communication has continued to be an issue for relatives trying to contact family and friends in places where electricity and phone lines have been affected .
Rodríguez de R. ( @ micronauta ) writes about this frustration :
trying for hours to communicate with family in Valparaíso , the fixed telephone line of ( the company ) VTR is disastrous , they shouldn &apos;t let them provide service : @
those who have been posting on the Terremoto Chile blog have also created a Twitter account called Ayuda Chile ( Help Chile ) in which information from other Twitter users who are looking for family members are collected and re-tweeted .
some Twitter users such as Pablo González Carcey have also offered to call relatives for those such as Daniela Alvarado who was unable to reach her brother in Chile .
he follows up :
@ DaniAlvaradoA , I made the phone call and your family is fine !
Hugs
after daybreak , more images of the damage soon appearing online .
Claudio Olivares went on a walking tour of Santiago to survey the damage and uploaded the photos on Owly , as did Costanza Campos , who took some photos of the damage to some of Santiago &apos;s churches .
YouTube user Franciso Vivallo Sainz took the following video of the collapse of a platform in the Bilbao Towers in Las Condes neighborhood of Santiago :
there are already tsunami warnings issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center for locations bordering the Pacific Ocean .
Chile : the 1985 Meeting Between McCain and Pinochet
in 1985 , a U.S. Congressman named John McCain traveled to Chile and met with dictator Augusto Pinochet , among other government officials .
Chilean blogger Juan Guillermo Tejeda writes about some of the details of the meeting :
the senator spent half an hour with our little monster , and also met with Admiral Merino , whose sadistic humor we know all too well … The meeting , organized by the then-ambassador Hernán Felipe Errázuriz , did not appear in the media and the Senator did not make any comment .
Dinges wrote about some of the context of the meeting in the Chilean blog of the Center of Journalistic Information and Investigation ( CIPER for its initials in Spanish )
the car bombing on Sheridan Circle in the U.S. capital was widely described at the time as the most egregious act of international terrorism perpetrated on U.S. soil by a foreign power .
at the time of McCain &apos;s meeting with Pinochet , Chile &apos;s democratic opposition was desperately seeking support from democratic leaders around the world in an attempt to pressure Pinochet to allow a return to democracy and force a peaceful end to the dictatorship , already in its 12th year .
other U.S. congressional leaders who visited Chile made public statements against the dictatorship and in support of a return to democracy , at times becoming the target of violent pro-Pinochet demonstrations .
at his blog Chile From Within , Chilean-American blogger Tomás Dinges links to the articles written by “ document-maven and father ” and provides additional links to information , including a response from the McCain campaign that appeared in the Miami Herald &apos;s Naked Politics blog .
many Chilean and Latin American blogs are republishing John Dinges ’ articles , as a way of spreading the information .
Madagascar : debating the Worth of Foreign Direct Investment
while Madagascar attempts to find a way out of a prolonged political crisis , Malagasy bloggers are discussing the value of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .
the worth of foreign investment came into sharp contrast when a land deal with Korean investor Daewoo came under criticism and partly triggered the current crisis .
many Malagasy believe that Madagascar , like many other African countries is rich in natural resources but that the land has been plagued by poor governance and unfair trade deals .
ten years ago , The Economist labeled Africa “ The Hopeless Continent ” .
their most recent publication highlights the rapid growth of many African countries ‘ GDP .
still , the growth is not equally felt throughout the continent .
in fact , Madagascar is projected to have one of the lowest level of growth in all of Africa .
Additionally , the capital city Antananarivo and other cities are currently experiencing frequent running water and power outages that have provoked frustration and outrage among Malagasy citizens .
the current situation is one of the reasons Antananarivo has been ranked as one of the cities with the lowest quality of life in the world by the Mercer ’ s 2011 quality of living survey .
having been marred in a lengthy political quagmire , the Malagasy blogosphere is trying to steer the debate away from a political solution to an overall debate on how to re-ignite an economy that has faltered over the past three years .

making FDI work for Malagasy people
land deals have been discussed at length in Madagascar as a way to get out of poverty ; the aborted Daewoo deal was the most publicized case but similar deals have been implemented without much hesitation or reaction .
the soundness of deals related to the mineral wealth of Madagascar has been recently debated by Malagasy experts .
Blaise Stephen is working at the International Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Madagascar .
he voiced his frustration with the current status-quo in the Madagascar political system that according to him is the main roadblock preventing more bilateral cooperation with foreign investors :
we are currently in the process of building up a long term bilateral trading collaboration between Madagascar and Kuwait that would be beneficial for Malagasy companies .
the goal is to set up a loan for three billion dollars over five years with one billion available right away that could be used for high return investment activities ( investment and not operational funding ) .
the negotiation is around the following line : 1 ) Madagascar will be borrowing at an interest rate of 3.4 % … 2 ) the State could loan to Malagasy companies at 5.6 % instead of the 18 or 20 % rate currently proposed by the national banks on very short term periods .
in reaction to his post , Ndimby , asks in the comment section :
why are you dreaming of an interest rate at 3,4 % when you always criticize the Bretton Woods institutions who loan at 0.5 % ?
to which , Blaise Stephen replies :
the question is not to like or dislike the Bretton Woods institutions , but to judge their effectiveness in the process of economic and social development for a country like Madagascar … Remember that these institutions have pushed countries like Russia or Argentina towards bankruptcy … so one has to ask : why an institution supposed to help the countries out of the crisis is actually helping it to sink a little more ?
Ndimby concludes the exchange on where the money comes from :
what you say can be summed up thus : money is odorless .
who cares where it comes from , for what purpose or in what context it is used as long as you pay it back “ on time ” without the apparent conditionalities that you seem to dread .
still , I doubt that those loans are made out of love for humanity and are without hidden agenda .
a land rich in natural resources and rife with corruption
what Ndimby hints at is the risk of loan without conditionalities or lack of transparency on the use of investment funds .
perspectives économiques en Afrique sums up the current economic situation :
the political environment is still unstable .
in this context , the emerging countries represent an opportunity for Madagascar .
China has not officially recognized the current government but many Chinese companies have contracted deals with the State .
in 2010 , Chinese group Wuhan Iron and Steel Co ( WISCO ) loaned $ 100 million USD to exploit iron mines .
if the mines are as vast as projected , they could invest for more than $ 8 billion USD which would be the largest foreign investment ever in Madagascar .
in a country rife with corruption , they will have to show that they can transform this opportunity into development .
as mentioned earlier , the lack of clear rules and structure during the current transitional period is already very conducive to all kind of corruption .
in this article , Franck R. highlights recent instances of corruption :
in Madagascar , notably under the current transition government , we like to take our time except when it comes to getting richer &#91; ... &#93; the UNICEF cars that were confiscated , the outrageous sudden wealth of a businessman who acquired it in a few months , a building in Antanimena , major stock options in Madarail &#91; ... &#93; and he is not the only one to make money .
and so goes the transition .
Ndimby concludes on the link between corruption and the political crisis :
it &apos;s because of such mentality that systematically tries to hide the reality and distract the attention from the sheer incompetence of the public funds that the crisis lingers on .
it &apos;s because they always encourage superficiality and flashy announcements , because they always try to convince that a coup is for the betterment of the general population , and because they try to convince others that the government is supported by the people when it holds power only thanks to repression and corruption .
we should not be surprised that international recognition is so hard to achieve after two years and that national unity keeps slipping away .
Malagasy bloggers seem to come to a consensus that foreign direct investment can only be as good as the transparency that accompanies its implementation .
otherwise , it &apos;s just another all too common story of wasted money that will benefit corrupt African leaders .

Venezuela : interacting with the Works of Artist Jesus Soto
the works of Venezuelan artist Jesús Soto ( 1923 – 2005 ) are among the most famous representations of Latin American modern art , known mostly for his kinetic works .
Soto was born in Ciudad Bolívar , Venezuela , where he began working as a painter of cinema posters .
he received his education in the cities of Caracas and Maracaibo , but it was in Paris where his career took a powerful turn .
his most famous works are the “ penetrables , ” which are interactive sculptures consisting of an array of square , thin , dangling tubes of shiny colors made from plastic and in which the public can walk through .
photo of a child in a Soto exhibit by Alé and used under a Creative Commons license .
according to the art experts , Soto &apos;s art is inseparable from the viewer , who is an active participant of the artist ’ s piece .
the illusion and the senses are completed by the perceptions of the mind as a result of observing , touching , and becoming part of the piece .
Venezuelan bloggers and the online community in general , celebrate his art through articles , reviews , and videos taken in museums and inside the works themselves , while explaining the meaning of Soto ’ s works in their culture , landscape and daily life .
in his blog Literanova , Eduardo Casanova goes a bit deeper on Soto ’ s life and gives an insight of the history of the city he was born :
Jesus Soto was born in 1923 in a city full of history : Ciudad Bolívar , where the press was released for the first time in the country and the creation of the Great Colombia was conceived .
this was an isolated population , with no museums or art activities .
he used to say that he learned how paint by himself .
he left his birth town and went to Maracaibo , in the western part of the country to be Director of a school of Arts .
in 1950 , Soto went to Paris and that is where he started the creation of new forms ( of art ) .

the YouTube channel of VenezuelaTuya gives an example of an experience walking through a piece exhibited in the Jesús Soto Museum , in Ciudad Bolívar :
the blog Talento Venezolano also dedicates a space to talk about the artists and his most famous creations :
in 1967 ( Soto ) created the first of his “ Penetrables ” , which are plastic tubes through which the spectator can feel him / herself in a magical space .
both works were exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art , the Grand Palais and the Pompidou Center in Paris .
you Tube has also been a way for people to show their contact and emotions while interacting with Soto ’ s works .
children in particular , have had a special approach to the artistic experience inside the artist ’ s work , which has been shown and shared through these videos :

Uganda : nodding Disease Denying Children Their Future
nodding disease is a mentally and physically disabling disease that affects children between 1 and 10 years .
it is currently restricted to small regions in South Sudan , Tanzania and northern Uganda .
the disease is incurable at the moment and its cause is not known .
recently , some old people have also shown signs of the disease .
the areas affected by the disease are mainly in the northern region of the country .
the disease denies the children a chance to be productive as they cannot do anything for themselves , be it holding a knife to make a meal for the girls , and holding a hoe to plant a single seed for the boys .
an 18 year old man may look like a 3 year old boy and has to be carried around and held to get some heat in the body .
the first symptoms of this disease is the continuous nodding of the head , failure to eat and drink .
later on the child becomes stunted physically and mentally .
a Ugandan journalist , Florence Naluyimba , has taken the first initiative to investigate and bring the issue to light .
she says although the government is trying to provide medicine to help the victims in 3 health centers , they have to travel long distances on foot or on bicycles to reach the health centers .
the sick ones cannot take themselves to the hospitals and have to be carried on the back or put on bicycles for over 30km .
the disease usually leads to seizures and at times this makes them fall into fire , sharp objects or in ponds / rivers , leading to death or severe injuries .
many children have lost body parts such as fingers in these accidents .
it so happens that the victims can be too weak to even cry .
the Center for Disease Control plans to carry out aerial spraying targeting black flies , which are suspected to be the major cause of this illness .
it is not clear whether this will help or not .
Ugandan villagers complain that samples were taken to USA since 2010 , but they have never received any reliable information about the cure and cause since that time .
below are some pictures and YouTube videos about the disease .
nodding disease in its initial stages .

Paraguay : from Forced Labor to Indigenous Leader
when Margarita Mbywangi was five years-old , she was taken from her parents and sold several times into forced domestic labor in the homes of the Paraguayan elite .
this was a common occurrence in the Aché indigenous communities in Paraguay during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner ( 1954-1989 ) .
these practices were ways that landowners could remove the Aché from their ancestral lands and take over their lands .
as a result of these kidnappings , many young Aché would find themselves far from their homes and far from their indigenous roots .
Mbywangi is currently taking part in the Rising Voices project Aché djawu ( The Aché word ) , and she recently wrote a short blog post about her life :
I , Mbywangi , was told that I was born in &#91; the community &#93; of Kuetuvy in 1962 . when I was five years-old , I was stolen from my mother during the time of the dictatorship .
I was raised by a Paraguayan family until I was 16 years-old . and in 1980 , when I turned 20 , I returned to my Aché family in the community of Chupapou .
I was unable to find my parents .
I was only able to find my brothers .
Margarita Mbywangi
when Mbywangi finally returned home in the early 1980s , she became a nurse and also became a mother .
she continues in the blog post :
in 1981 , I had my first child and said to myself , now I have a companion and on that day I felt complete .
I spent those years raising my son and attending to the health of the people of my community .
however , in the decades later she became more politically active in defense of indigenous rights .
she was once a candidate for the Paraguayan Senate and was even placed in jail for her role in protests to defend natural reserves from illegal logging .
in 2008 , Mbywangi received an invitation from the administration of former President Fernando Lugo to become the Cabinet Minister for Indigenous Affairs .
she became the first member of an indigenous community to hold that position .
as part of the Rising Voices project , Mbywangi has begun to use the collective blog to share her experiences .
she also has opened up a Twitter account ( @ MargaMbywangi ) , but is still becoming accustomed to updating it on a regular basis .
in this video , she talks about the importance of sharing her story with other indigenous communities and the global audience at large .
she closes her blog post by explaining her name in the Aché tradition :
I like it when they call me Mbywangi because that is the name that my birth mother gave me , and Margarita is the name that my second mother gave me , even though I was not recognized by them as a daughter .
I only have my name , and I feel happy with the two names that I have .
burqa Strains Multicultural Australia
since the proposed bans on the wearing of the burqa in France , the issue has been simmering in the Australian blogosphere .
an Australian radio shock-jock , and ex-police officer , drew criticism recently over his opposition to the wearing of the burqa in public .
Michael Smith argued that bank staff and shop assistants are concerned with possible criminal misuse .
he also suggested that young children are frightened by encounters with women wearing the “ full-on burqa ” , comparing it to “ kids crying , getting the fright of their lives when seeing Santa Claus ” .
a radio interview with Smith can be heard at Michael Smith Meets the Press .
when the French bans were proposed during the middle of 2009 , Canberra journalist Virginia Haussegger argued on her blog for its prohibition on the grounds of gender equality :
by covering herself in a burka , a woman is relinquishing the right to express herself as a female .
she is agreeing to suppress her own sexuality .
there is no place here for the burka .
Australians must rally to have the burka banned .
ban the Burka
Anna Greer at The Punch blogs about , “ human rights and social justice issues and … the state of the world ” .
she has a totally different take on women ’ s rights :
no matter what you think of Islamic veiling one thing is for sure – criminalising the women who wear the burqa or niqab is only going to render them more invisible .
… This selective concern for women ’ s rights is merely a way for people to articulate their racist nationalism and it ’ s an attitude that can be found through all levels of society – in the general populace , in the media , in the government .
Anna finishes with a touch of irony :
imposing dress codes on people in order to oppose the imposing of dress codes on people is completely counterproductive , but as I outlined above , that ’ s not the real reason these laws are being considered , is it ?
burqa ban is about our fears not their oppression
Smith ’ s views were probed at Andrew Landeryou ’ s online site VexNews :
it ’ s a scary debate that Smith has started at one level because vilifying people on religious grounds or for their religious customs that don ’ t harm others can be a slippery slope .
… Part of the complexity is that some Muslims – and other religions for that matter – wear hair-covering as part of their religious tradition .
Presumably no one other than the bigoted have an issue with that .
hopefully the legitimate issue of canvassing security concerns in banks or other vulnerable areas that could be terror or robbery targets won ’ t be confused with the agenda of those who wish to vilify one of the world ’ s great religions .
burqa BAN BANK BRAWL : radio host says no face covering in banks but is he race-baiting ?
in a longer article at Online Opinion , Sadanand Dhume , the author of My Friend the Fanatic : travels with an Indonesian Islamist , canvasses both sides of this emotive issue .
he concludes with a positive view of the French debate :
in the end , though the French brand of in-your-face secularism may come under criticism by both Muslims and Western liberals , the country ’ s experience holds valuable lessons for the rest of the world .
France has not suffered a major terrorist attack since a spate of bombings in the 1990s linked to the civil war in Algeria .
and in a 2006 Pew poll of Muslim attitudes , France was the only major European country where nearly half of Muslims felt they were citizens of their country before being members of their faith .
( in Germany , Britain and Spain , overwhelming majorities claimed a primary allegiance to Islam .
) Ultimately , this record more than anything else will guide French policy on a sensitive subject .
the French burqa ban : culture clash unveiled
fortunately ‘ bigots ’ do not have the support of the mainstream Australian political parties .
nevertheless , there was some disquiet recently when Tony Abbott , the leader of the Federal Opposition , raised the question of minority rights and multiculturalism :
migrants would be more popular if minority leaders encouraged them to adopt more mainstream values and abide by the law , he said .
” The inescapable minimum that we insist upon is obedience to the law , ” Mr Abbott said .
” It would help to bolster public support for immigration and acceptance of social diversity if more minority leaders were as ready to show to mainstream Australian values the respect they demand of their own . ”
obey the law at least , Abbott tells migrants
Uganda : students riot , Kampala burns
two separate tragedies struck Kampala , the capital of Uganda , on Tuesday : students at Makerere University rioted after the shooting death of two of their peers .
and the Kasubi Tombs , a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the burial location of the king of one of Uganda &apos;s largest ethnic groups , burned to the ground .
riots at Makerere University
according to Ugandan newspapers , the riots at Makerere University , Uganda &apos;s largest university , began after two students were shot dead and another critically injured by a security guard Monday night during a meeting about the current Student Guild elections .
the Daily Monitor reports two versions of the events :
police say many students had gathered at the Hostel for the final leg of the Guild election campaigns when the watchman , suspecting one of the students could have intended to damage a vehicle in the parking lot , opened fire .
earlier reports suggested supporters of Simon Kamau , one of the contestants in the guild presidential race , clashed with those of NRM &apos;s John Taylor , prompting the shooting of the Kenyan students .
the New Vision suggests the shootings were a result of a disagreement between one candidate and the supporter of another :
as the group prepared to leave , they were confronted in the compound by Nyongesa , who is believed to belong to the camp of John Kamau , one of the two Kenyans in the guild race .
he reportedly tried to hit &#91; candidate John &#93; Teira with a bench when the group rejected his calls to leave the hostel .
a brief commotion ensued , which , according to eyewitnesses , compelled the guard to fire the bullet that hit the three students .
students responded on Tuesday by marching through Makerere University grounds , carrying signs and a coffin to protest the killings .
both newspapers report that the protests turned violent and that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
ole Tangen Jr , a journalist living in Kampala , was one of the first to blog about the Makerere riots .
he wondered why more students weren &apos;t using social media networks to spread the news :
last night two Makerere students were shot by an armed security guard leading to widespread riots near the university today .
however no one thought to utilize Twitter to get the story out .
searches for # Makerere all day on Twitter Search resulted in nothing more than news reports .
how is it that students — particularly politically-active students — are not making use of the social media tools available to them .
is it ignorance of Twitter ?
is it the high cost of an internet connection ?
what has led to this ?
a Twitter search for “ makerere ” largely supported his claim , with most tweets consisting of links to newspaper articles .
still , some Twitter users in Kampala were able to add some context :
@ arthurnakkaka ( 18 hours ago ) : gunshots being fired .
or its tear gas ?
# Makerere
@ arthurnakkaka ( 18 hours ago ) : students screaming and running .
situation getting bad # Makerere
@ aspindler2 ( 18 hours ago ) : demonstrations at Makerere Univ . Kampala uganda after shooting of 2 stdnts last night by security guard .

@ mirembe _ maria ( 14 hours ago ) : the makerere University Strike has left two dead and one in critical condition , what is the way forward for the Government about all this ?
Kasubi Tombs Burn
on Tuesday night , in an apparently unrelated incident , the Kasubi Tombs , the burial site of the kings of Uganda &apos;s Baganda ethnic group , burned to the ground .
the current king of the Baganda people has been in the news recently for his clashes with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni .
in September 2009 , the tension between the two led to deadly riots in Kampala , and citizens fear that the fire could lead to future unrest .
Ugandan blogger 27th Comrade writes :
usually it is arson when a place like that burns down .
they are made of grass thatch , the tombs , so the fire will be absolutely devastating .
already , some f * * * wits around me are saying “ Government ! ” I &apos;d be more-likely to say “ Opposition ! ” But I guess it is more-likely some staffer who was careless with fire .
let us wait for news .
blogger and journalist Rosebell writes :
this relationship between President Museveni ’ s government and Buganda Kingdom is far from rosy and this has already given fertile ground for many to think there was some foulplay .
many people seem to expect riots to breakout at dawn .
we only hope there will be a thorough investigation into the burning of the tombs and that no people will lose their lives and property .
this is crucial time for Buganda leadership too .
the Kasubi tombs are equally a heritage for the country so i hope both sides deal with this issue with maximum restraint .
Ugandans on Twitter are equally worried :
@ daphnzempire ( 6 hours ago ) : Kasubi tombs is on fire .. oh my God where are we headed
@ Kakazi ( 6 hours ago ) : Kasubi tombs burnt down about 2hours ago .. I honestly pray it wasn &apos;t arson ! !
a great loss to our heritage .. : - (
@ mugumya ( 6 hours ago ) : I fear there might be some kind of disturbance 2moro after Kasubi tombs are gutted in Kampala
Lauren , an American who formerly lived in Kampala , remembers taking friends to visit the tombs :
the Kasubi Tombs are more than important cultural and historic structures to me .
when we lived in Uganda , they were my neighbors .
our apartment was at the bottom of Kasubi Hill , and we passed the Tombs every day to and from downtown Kampala .
we took numerous visitors to see the tombs to learn more about the Buganda tribe , its history and culture .
I always loved passing the guards of the Tombs ; dressed in the traditional saffron-colored robe and leaning against the big tree out front , they waited patiently to greet the next set of visitors .

Palestine : reactions to Launch of Google.ps
“ Over the years google has been adding many of the world ’ s local domains like google.co.uk and google.jo in which case they provides localized search results , ” says blogger ArabCrunch , announcing Google &apos;s decision to add the domain google.ps to the list .
the new localized Google domain is intended to work in the West Bank and Gaza , where Palestinian Internet service providers ( ISPs ) operate .
last week , the Google Arabia blog announced the addition and the reasons behind it :
today we &apos;re adding an additional domain to our list , google.ps.
the new domain will give Arabic-speaking users in the Palestinian Territories , who use Palestinian ISPs , access to Google in Arabic – and eventually , access to more locally-relevant content .
with the launch of google.ps , we bring the total number of Google domains worldwide to more than 160 .
in a statement to ArabCrunch , Google also explained how the change will affect AdWords :
with AdWords , you can target your ads to countries or territories , or to specific regions and cities .
the Adwords system uses several factors to determine whether to show your ad including the Google domain being used ( .fr , .de , .kr , etc .
) , the actual search term the user submits and when possible , we determine the user &apos;s general physical location based upon their computer &apos;s Internet Protocol ( IP ) address . ” The AdWords system uses several factors to determine whether to show your ad including the Google domain being used ( .
Kr , etc .. ) , The actual search term the user submits and when possible , we determine the user &apos;s general physical location based upon their computer &apos;s Internet Protocol ( IP ) address .
window into Palestine explains that Palestinians in East Jerusalem will not have automatic access to google.ps ( note : anyone can access google.ps by typing the URL in directly ) :
aside from East Jerusalem , which falls under de facto Israeli authority , Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have generally relied on www.google.jo , Jordan &apos;s domain , and Egypt &apos;s www.google.com.eg , respectively .
Twitter user migueldeicaza expressed excitement for the latest addition to the Google family :
daiski , another Twitter user based in Qatar , thanked Google for the initiative :
google.ps is available in both English and Arabic .

Egyptian Tycoon Sentenced to Death
Egyptians witnessed the most unexpected verdict in the history of their judiciary system : billionaire Hesham Talaat Moustafa , along with his hired hitman Mohsen El Sokary , have both been sentenced to death for their roles in the murder of Lebanese singer Suzanne Tameem .
the gruesome murder took place in Dubai , UAE , and Thursday &apos;s sentence was met with shock and bewilderment as the blogosphere comes to terms with the verdict .
Egyptian prolific blogger Zeinobia broke the news :
on May 21 , Judge Muhammadi Qunsuwa announced the case will be referred to Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa , the nation &apos;s highest religious official , who will rule on Moustafa &apos;s death sentence on June 25 .
shocking as it is to everyone , the verdict left the convicted in awe .
journalist Ahmed El Desouky was among the first who reported the reactions from the court to the Egyptian online community saying :
there was an uproar in court after the sentence was pronounced and those concerned expressed their extreme anger and shock describing the verdict as extremely harsh .
reactions varied outside the court house , but the majority of people saw that the punishment was fair for a man who abused his authority , influence and money , thinking that he was above the law .
reactions fluctuated , between approval and support to the verdict to sympathy and sadness .
in her post , Desert Cat was surprised that both Moustafa and El Sokary received the same verdict :
sadly the verdict came today contrary to what everyone expected and the case is now being referred to the Grand Mufti .
once the verdict was read , chaos erupted in court , with the families of Mohsen and Hesham screaming as well as the employees of the Talaat Moustafa Group , who couldn &apos;t believe what they heard .
meanwhile , Hesham and Mohsen were completely silent .
personally , I couldn &apos;t believe it because Hesham &apos;s crime was instigating murder while Mohsen was the one who killed .
how can their punishment be the same ?
Ahmed Shokeir answered her question in the comments section of this post saying :
in most laws , the punishment for those who instigate crimes is the same as that for the criminals .
in some laws , the punishment is even more severe than that met to the criminal .
the Egyptian real-estate tycoon ’ s supporters on Facebook , reacted to the verdict on “ Free Hesham Talaat Moustafa ’ group as well .
Ashraf Elmanwaty said :
I still have hope HTM will be free … This is an over reaction judgment
while Miral El Ramlawy wrote :
90 % of Egyptians do NOT believe he did it and the court owes it to the Egyptians to announce what they based the verdict upon ! !
phone calls that don &apos;t have any explicit message is NO PROOF … we are waiting for justification !
after the shock , analysis took place .
Zeinobia explains :
• when the judge says that that the papers of the convicted will be sent to the grand Mufti for consulting means in most situations that that convicted will face the death penalty .
the death penalty needs the opinion of the grand Mufti to support it from the religious point of view , the Sharia point of view to fulfill justice.It is not everyday that you order the death of someone .
• In most cases if not all of them the grand Mufti approves and supports the judge ’ s verdict .
she then continues :
• Second in case of Hisham and Sokary , the judge will announce the final verdict on the next 25th of June 2009 , which is nearly about month and 5 days , I believe it is a long period to stand in the death row .
• Third when the judge announces the final verdict , the lawyers of the convicted will have the right to &#91; appeal &#93; .
so there might be a second round which is what we will figure out on June 25th .
meanwhile , there are questions and doubts about Hisham ’ s high profile real estate business .
the Mideast Institute Editor &apos;s blog reports :
the Talaat Mustafa Group ( TMG ) , a huge real estate conglomerate through which Mustafa made his billions , doesn &apos;t want any stockholders to worry just because the company &apos;s founder and namesake is under a death sentence .
a TMG official reassures investors :
Sawaftah said that TMG ’ s corporate structure prevents “ the absence of one individual ” from affecting its activity
Zambia : opposition Leader Addresses Facebook Parliament in a First
Zambia ’ s opposition National Restoration Party ( NAREP ) president Elias Chipimo Jr. has become the country ’ s first politician to “ address ” the make believe 1,318 member Facebook Zambian parliament after he was allowed by the “ Speaker ” to post his end of year message .
the Hon Speaker first posted the following message before he posted Chipimo ’ s speech :
important ANNOUNCEMENT
Hon Members .
may we welcome Hon Elias Chipimo , NAREP President to officially address this House by delivering end of year message from NAREP .
as usual , the House ll proceed to debate his address .
once we get hold of UPND President , Hon HaKainde Hichilema , and also Republican President , H. E. Michael C. Sata , we shall let them address the House .
President Chipimo , its an honour to have you in the House .
you may address this august House .
part of Chipimo &apos;s post reads :

Year-end message from the National Restoration Party ( NAREP )
looking beyond 2011 : what the PF administration can start to do in its next 90 days in office
Zambia faces many challenges ranging from poor healthcare , dilapidated and inadequate infrastructure , limited access to quality education and an economy that is still not meeting the development needs of the majority of the people in spite of its strong performance over the last few years .
tackling these problems will no doubt require long-term focus , energy and vision .
there are , however , 3 pressing issues that require a clear , committed and immediate response : ( 1 ) unemployment ; ( 2 ) corruption ; and ( 3 ) excessive presidential and executive power .
Sub-Saharan Africa , and indeed Zambia , was not unaffected by these events .
remote though the idea may seem , the sentiments that prompted the democratic revolutions in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen and Libya were similar to those that resulted in the conclusive Patriotic Front ( PF ) victory on 23 September .
clearly , after 20 in power , something must went seriously wrong within the Movement for Multiparty Democracy ( MMD ) – the party that brought an end to UNIP ’ s 27 year rule .
a number of “ Members of Parliament ” in debating the “ speech ” , hailed the move to engage politicians in the virtual parliament .
one member , Rodger Chali praised the opposition politician for being new media savvy :
Mr Speaker Sir , let me thank Hon. Chipimo for his submission and for being one the the leaders who understands the power of new media .
let me submit however that , Zambia is not lacking intelligent presidents , but a system which allows provinces and districts to flourish without looking to Lusaka .
I would therefore wish to challenge Hon. Chipimo to champion the cause of a free Zambia from Lusaka control .
this is the only agenda which will bring prosperity .
if he can deliver this one issue before 2016 , i can trust him to be president .
Mr Speaker , I would not what to hear that the hon. can only do this if elected president .
Kasololo Chisenga said :
Hon Zapp Speaker Sir indeed presidential candidate Hon.Elias Chipimo raises some important points that are worth debati ng in the house .
I am particularly taken by his suggestion of growing biofules &#91; bio-fuel &#93; and coming up with a ‘ new economy ‘ in Z … ambia .
this is indeed innovaribve and is what is expected from a youthful leader such as him .
it is my hope that such ideas can be ytaken seriously to reduce the leve of unemployment in the land .
on the same issue of bio-fuel , Nicholas Mutalama added :
Hon. Speaker Sir , the exploration of bio-fuel is now extensive in the West and farmers busy utilising this initiative through government and privately funded programmes .
why does it take us so long to jump on sustainable opportunities such … as these to move forward .
Sir , the previous regimes together with the current administration have focused on programmes that hardly produce anything worthy … .. !
this we can do or maybe just maybe , we are waiting for another investor or donor to come to our rescue when clearly through serious fiscal responsibility and accountability would give us the much needed funds for the initial investment .
Zambian People &apos;s Parliament ( ZAPP ) was formed shortly after the September 20 elections which saw an opposition party , the Patriotic Front ( PF ) , unseat the ruling MMD that had been in power for 20 years .
the group was formed on the back of another Facebook group , the Zambian Peoples Pact which campaigned against the former ruling party .
the following is the group ’ s description :
the Zambian People ’ s Parliament ( ZAPP ) is a replication of the Zambian Parliament comprising a cross-section of citizens who constructively discuss , analyze , debate , persuade and agree on issues which border on democratic governance .
specifically , ZAPP is a place where citizens contribute their voice on Zambia ’ s democratic governance , political and socioeconomic development .
the essence of these online debates shall be to enable citizens make input into parliamentary and government ’ s policy and decision-making and provide a fora for issue-based discussion by politically-minded citizens , leaders in our communities and experts thus enabling the group to mold an opinion and influence decision-making .
mission Statement
the Mission of ZAPP is to engage citizens , leaders in parliament and government , public and private sectors in jointly setting policy direction and ensuring decisions made at all levels reflect the will of the Zambian people to be governed according to democratic tenets .
vision Statement
ZAPP ’ s Vision is a leading platform for both ordinary and empowered Zambians who freely express themselves and are heard in Zambia ’ s democratic governance and promotion of socioeconomic activities of the nation .

Martinique : election , tension and abstention
on Sunday March 14th , all French citizens including those in the four French overseas departments ( Martinique , Guadeloupe , French Guiana and Reunion ) were asked to vote for the regional elections and the regional assembly in charge of devolved powers such as planning adult professional training , building and funding public high schools , financing and promoting cultural projects .
the vote took place in a very busy electoral period : Martinicans were asked to decide for more autonomy in their department , only in January .
two major elections in a three-month period may have been too much for the 55.55 % of Martinican voters who decided to stay home and not vote , as shown by Bondamanjak &apos;s post .
blogger Evolution Martinique comments on this high abstention figure :
the winner of the 1st round is obviously the surprisingly high abstention rate ( more than 55 % ) &#91; ... &#93; .
in the same post , the blogger also gives possible reasons to explain why people resorted to abstention :
the repetition of ballots in a very short period from January 10th to March 14th .
the issue of the institutional status must have been more important in the eyes of the citizens , whereas the regional elections are considered as politicking .
the low quality of the debate and of the political programs as well as the noxious atmosphere of the campaign .
4 . the incongruous choice of voting for the 2nd round .
Martinican blogger &#91; moi &#93; ‘ s playground shares her opinion about the first round of the elections , in a post which details the results for each list , along with her personal comments .
Incidentally , she sums up the central stake of this election in Martinique :
three lists are still in for the second round , in which the legendary duel between Marie-Jeanne and Letchimy will meet its end .
the same duel is acknowledged by Bondamanjak in a post entitled “ André Lesueur , la troisième voix ” ( André Lesueur , the third voice ) .
both &#91; moi &#93; and Bondamanjak comment on the significant decrease of right-wing voters in Martinique .
she wonders :
since when hasn &apos;t the right-wing qualified for the second round of regional elections ?
a comment to Bondamanjak ‘ s post says :
Juan &#91; ... &#93; to conclude , I &apos;d say that in my opinion the right wing is threatened by political uselessness .
the remarks made by Martinican bloggers concerning the poor quality of the campaigns , the tiredness of the population with elections and the difficult position of the right-wing parties is not an exclusive feature of the overseas departments , since mainland French elections followed the very same pattern , as this post by French blogger Ma Liberté , explains .

Iran : is the State Afraid of a 13-Year Old Girl ?
banning people from traveling abroad has been an old practice used by the Iranian state to raise pressure on political and civil society activists for years .
however , a security court created a stir recently by banning foreign travel for jailed human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh ’ s husband and their 13-year-old daughter , Mehraveh Khandan .
Nasrin Stoudeh has been sentenced to 11 years in prison .
Ensiloos writes :
Mehraveh &apos;s father says in his Facebook that even if his daughter , Mehraveh , had committed a crime , she should have been summoned to a court for minors , not to Evin &#91; prison &#93; .
Haghemoslamema says &#91; fa &#93; :
the blogger also published a photo of Mehraveh with her brother :

today , Monday 16 July , Mehraveh &apos;s case came to light .
Jomhouriat writes , “ my country is proud of this innocent girl whose travel ban shows the &#91; Iranian &#93; Islamic Republic is collapsing . ”
it is not the first time Nasrin &apos;s children have highlighted the pain of political prisoners ’ families .
about a month ago , Iranian social networking site users shared the following video footage of Nasrin Sotoudeh trying to play with her four year old son through a window in a prison visit .
Guatemala : 7 Indigenous Protesters Killed in Totonicapán
this post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights .
at least 7 civilians were killed , up to 32 were injured , and 35 were intoxicated on October 4 , 2012 , when combined armed forces violently removed demonstrators from Cuatro Caminos ( “ four roads ” ) , a well-known intersection of roads that go to Quetzaltenango , Guatemala City , Huehuetenango and Totonicapán .
demonstrators blocked the road to protest the rising price of electricity in the area .
they also demand a dialogue with the government to discuss their objections to the education and constitutional reforms proposed by President Otto Pérez Molina .
the demonstrators were representatives from indigenous communities from Totonicapan , an exceptional , mostly indigenous ( 90 % ) community in the Guatemalan highlands .
while demonstrations are common in the area , the number of persons killed and injured is highly unusual .
there is evidence that members of the Guatemalan Army were carrying guns , although the Minister of Interior has denied it , arguing that the peasants killed each other , as Mario Rodríguez explains in his blog post “ Declarations full of cynicism ” .

Totonicapán is one of the best organized and least violent areas in the country , in spite of extreme poverty with up to 82.2 % of malnourished people .
hard working and one of the most active environmentalist communities , the people in Totonicapán are dedicated to preserving the forest and their water sources , as described by Cultural Survival :
the forest has been preserved for generations , thanks to the work of people who have lived in harmony with the world around them , by means of ancestral knowledge of resource management and active participation of each community .
for such level of care and management you need a well-organized community and active leaders seeking common good .
Totonicapán is one of the few territories where indigenous authorities exercise power , divided in 48 cantons , lead by community mayors and a President who serves as the mediator in case of conflicts and as the spokesperson when it is necessary to dialogue beyond the community .
in 2011 , for the first time in history , a single woman , law student María del Carmen Tacam , was elected President of the Cantons in Totonicapán .
she explained in an interview that she follows the instructions of the consensus of all 48 local authorities .
as reported by Voces Mayas , María del Carmen explained that while appealing to refrain from violent measures , the indigenous communities blocked the Cuatro Caminos intersection because the government and the corporations did not respond to their clear demands .
she also mentioned that the local hospital collapsed due to the number of people injured .
in her declarations , María del Carmen explained to the press that the community of Totonicapán demanded a dialogue to find solutions to three sensitive issues :
the Constitutional Reform proposed by the President , which they disapprove .
education reform , as they oppose the modifications to the requirements to become a school teacher .
rising cost of electricity because the company did not stick to their commitments .
the community wants to keep the dialogue open and is waiting for clear responses from the government of Pérez Molina .
during the previous government , the dialogue between the government and the communities was mediated by the Ombudsman , as documents show , but this time he was denied access .

furthermore , as early as March 2012 , different voices raised their concerns about the rapidly growing size and role of the military in Guatemala and the presence of so-called “ mega projects ” like the Goldcorp mine .
Cascadia solidaria comments about the increased militarized actions against civilians :
the strategic use of roadblocks by indigenous and campesino organizations as form of political pressure and re-vindication is harshly contested by the state and powerful economic actors , especially the business lobby CACIF * , which has campaigned for the prohibition and repression of blockades as violations of the right to freedom of movement .
the Pérez Molina administration has previously used violence to break up roadblocks and occupations by students , teachers , and parents protesting exclusionary education reforms ; if today ’ s deaths are confirmed to be the responsibility of security forces , it will mark the first clear instance of mortal government repression against civilian protest under Mano Dura .
while community leaders have called for investigation of the deaths , if the administration follows the blueprint established by its response to social conflict and protest in Barillas , Huehuetenango , repressive measures such as arrests of protest leaders or declaration of a state of exception could be implemented instead .
in an official statement , the President – who is the maximum authority and Commander in Chief of the Guatemalan Army – indicated that he has ordered an investigation into the violence and deaths from October 4 .
in the meantime , the communities are waiting for dialogue and responses .

year After Coup , Madagascar &apos;s Leaders Face Sanctions
on the anniversary of the coup d &apos;etat of March 17 , 2009 in Madagascar , individual sanctions are about to be imposed upon the current leaders of Madagascar for not respecting the resolutions of Maputo that were previously agreed upon by all participants .
this decision come after a warning a month earlier from the African Union and the International Contact Group and follow several annulments of international trade accords that have affected the local industries .
they also come on the heel of reports by Amnesty International and the US State Department that document multiple human rights violations and ongoing illegal international trafficking of precious rosewood from Madagascar rain forests .
according to a Malagasy insider , the individual sanctions would result in a freeze of the financial assets of the people present in the list and possible arrest if they travel outside Madagascar ( fr ) .
the government remains defiant in the face of the impending sanctions , arguing that only national elections will provide an effective exit to the crisis .
the organization and monitoring of these elections are not clearly defined yet and parliamentary elections have already been postponed from the initial proposed schedule .
the political deadlock is compounded by humanitarian concerns caused by Tropical Storm Hubert that killed 14 and left 37,891 homeless after making landfall earlier in the week .

reflecting upon the upcoming sanctions on national Malagasy leaders , Citoyenne Malgache , a blogger based in Madagascar , has mixed feelings about the possible consequences for the everyday Malagasy citizens .
she is torn between satisfaction and fear ( fr ) :
satisfied ?
only If the African Union is not just posting the list of the penalized perpetrators but also presents concrete and immediate actions to the Malagasy people for the implementation of the Maputo agreement &#91; .. &#93; Worried ?
depending on what the AU will decide to say or do , Rajoelina &apos;s group and their armed forces may provide resistance &#91; .. &#93; On March 17 , I wonder in what world I will wake up to
Madagoravox is also dreaming of a country with different standards so that it won &apos;t have to go through this cycle of crisis ever again ( fr ) :
one can dream of politics that would not come from sporadic meetings , personal agenda , or partisan ambition , but politics that would be the fruit of commitment to personal morals and ethics .
Ndimby thinks that a true exit to the crisis can only be reached through an in-depth dialog between former foes and not the make-believe meetings that both parties held earlier and that were consensual only on the surface ( fr ) :
Unilateralism is not about whether there was a debate or not but it comes from the fact that the bases of the debate were already so skewed that it prevented a conversation on important subjects and to rally the leaders who can truly bring a resolution to the crisis .
an initiative called “ Mitsangana ” ( Stand Up in Malagasy ) to get politicians from all parties to respond to question from Malagasy citizens has been created on Facebook .
while the crisis perseveres , the social toll is gradually increasing .
health workers and physicians were on strike for months and factory workers were seen gathering outside a factory that plans to let them go in April .

as is often the case , rural communities are often more dramatically affected by poverty .
Louise , from Southern Madagascar , tells her story of hardship and explains that the many changes over the years have depleted her region of land resources and fish species :
according to the World Bank , the struggle of the Malagasy economy has already forced the government to slash $ 200 million USD for the public service from their national budget .
Achille52 explains that the educational system is the first to suffer and that this budget cut will have dire consequences on the future of the nation ( fr ) :
lack of funding is the main problem for public schools .
teachers are not motivated enough because of their miserable salaries and the children of the disenfranchised classes are not focused on school work anymore .
if we cancel subsidies now , where are we headed to ?
South Africa : to vuvuzela or not to vuvuzela ?
discussions about the popular instrument called the vuvuzela blown by South African football fans have dominated the blogosphere since the beginning of Confederations Cup 2009 in South Africa , which ended last week .
journalists , TV viewers , coaches and some foreign players called for a ban of the instrument during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .
the debate is as loud as the instrument itself .
there is even an online petition to ban the instrument .
FIFA has allowed vuvuzelas during the World Cup 2010 arguing that it is part of an authentic South African football culture .
this is Wikipedia description of the vuvuzela :
a blowing horn , approximately one metre in length , commonly blown by fans at football matches in South Africa .
the origin of the name is disputed .
it may originate from the Zulu for “ making noise , ” from the “ vuvu ” sound it makes , or from township slang related to the word for “ shower . ”
opinions in the blogosphere are deeply divided .
some bloggers are completely outraged by the sound produced by vuvuzelas while others call for tolerance and understanding .
one blogger goes as far as claiming that the instrument spreads HIV !
Dave Taylor describes vuvuzelas as “ the traditional instruments of football mayhem . ”
to Chris of World Cup blog , the vuvuzela is “ that giant swarm of insects … ” :
that giant swarm of insects you ’ ve been hearing at every Confederations Cup game is not , in fact , one of the Biblical Plagues migrating south .
it ’ s actually called a vuvuzela …
capitals Kremlin considers the vuvuzela the most annoying noisemaker :
ladies and gentlemen , Caps Kremlin is pleased to present to you : the world &apos;s most annoying noisemaker , the vuvuzela .
there is one long description of the vuvuzela from 24.com :
… take a sport from England called football , take a snort of glitter-eyed powder-nosed marketing gnomes , a large liquor conglomerate wanting to increase market share , add a white guy called Van Schalkwyk with a take-the-gap mentality and a plastics factory and what do you get ?
the vuvuzela .
pitch Invasion calls the vuvuzela “ Satan &apos;s instrument . ”
welcome to plastic Africa :
you then follow it up with a barrage of press releases about the kudu horn being used in ancient times to summon villagers to meetings , Christian cults claiming it as part of their sacred rituals and we get stuck with football games that can only be watched on TV with the mute button firmly on .
and if you don ’ t like it , you must be at best a racist or at worst one of those guys who when he hears the word “ culture ” reaches for his gun .
welcome to plastic Africa .
and rue an opportunity missed .
from the Foreign Policy blog , “ The World Cup &apos;s biggest concern is a trumpet , ”
five years ago , when South Africa won the right to host the 2010 World Cup , many were concerned whether the country had the infrastructure to host the huge tournament .
with one year to go , though , most observers agree that the country will be pass that test . instead , the biggest complaints have centered on an instrument called the vuvuzela .
ReasonCheck wonders , “ … if these heathen brutes could be introduced to the joys of producing actual musical notes from their hellish plastic pipes ” :
if you ’ ve caught any of the games on TV , you would have heard a continuous droning sound , like a perpetually embittered swarm of hornets .
but you really have to be there to appreciate the full horror of the cacophony .
I took my son to a game a few nights ago and have been suffering from headaches ever since , and am sleeping fitfully .
I then got to thinking that if these heathen brutes could be introduced to the joys of producing actual musical notes from their hellish plastic pipes there might just be a shift in Zeitgeist amongst them and they might seek to actually make music .
pitch Invasion looks at the history of noisemaking in world football starting with the first popular noisemaker in Britain , the wooden rattle :
the first popular noisemaker in football — and one that made a sound to make even a vuvuzela wince — was the wooden rattle in Britain .
writing in the Guardian , Simon Burnton hoped that “ perhaps South Africa can learn from the loud wooden rattles that soundtracked British football in the post-war era – and fell out of favour when everyone realised just how annoying they were .
I can only hope that one day soon a similar fate will befall the vuvuzelas . ”
yet it was a shift in the entire base of fan culture , rather than a simple realisation that rattles were annoying , that removed the rattle from the terraces .
though a fairly recent instrument at South African football games , some trace the roots to African tradition .
“ The ancestor of the vuvuzela is said to be the kudu horn – ixilongo in isiXhosa , mhalamhala in Tshivenda – blown to summon African villagers to meetings . ”
it seems to have been in 1992 that the vuvuzela was first used at South African football matches , by supporters of AmaZulu F.C ..
supporters made the horns out of discarded tin cans , and the use spread wildly , to the joy of many and the irritation of some : South African writer Jon Qwelane wrote in 2007 that “ Nowadays , there is an instrument from hell , called the vuvuzela , which has largely formed my decision to abandon all live games and rather watch on TV , with the sound totally muted . ”
in the 2000s , with South Africa ’ s World Cup bid on the horizon , the vuvuzela became a mass produced commercialised phenomenon as the result of a grant given by SAB Miller ( the giant South African brewer ) to Neil van Schalkwyk ’ s company Masincedane Sport in 2001 , who began to mass produce a cheap plastic version .
SA Sucks disputes the “ history ” of the vuvuzela as “ the ridiculous lie being spread via Wikipedia ” :
incredibly , the ridiculous lie is now being spread via Wikipedia ( thanks Karooboy for pointing out ) that the origin of the Vuvuzela is actually based on a “ Kudu horn ” that the blacks used to blow .
I almost died laughing at this pathetic fiction but suppose its to be expected – the truth that these destructive beasts ripped them from trains in orgies of vandalism is obviously too politically incorrect to swallow .
a bit further down this article is an image of a yellow horn-shaped vuvuzela – I got this image from one of the hundreds of spam emails which landed up in my mailbox , urging me to order 10 000 of these pieces of shit , with my corporate logo stuck on them .
the horn shape is extremely unusual but as with the Wikipedia article , to be expected as PR companies do their best to bury the real history behind it .
according to SA Sucks there is nothing authentic African about the vuvuzela :
one of the things I love most about the politicians that run this fair dominion is how , at their discretion , they can make up their own history as they go along . the vuvuzela is one such example .
those arguing for the vuvuzela maintain that it is part of the great South African soccer culture and that not allowing it would truly be an injustice .
bullshit .
they ’ ve been around less than ten years .
it was only when some bastard called “ Neil van Schalkwyk , the co-owner of Masincedane Sport , which manufactures the plastic vuvuzela , won the SAB KickStart Award in 2001 , which is an SAB-run project that assists entrepreneurs by providing grants and mentorship during the start-up phase of business . ” that the vuvuzela really started making an impact .
Dave Taylor found the noise from the vuvuzela annoying and distracting :
a half-dozen fans having one of these , or even a lot of fans who blow on them to celebrate a goal or terrific defensively play is one thing , but as those of us that watched the FIFA Confederations Cup learned , the practice in South Africa seems to be to keep a continuous drone of vuvuzela going throughout the match .
and we ’ re not talking about twenty or thirty people in the stadium , we ’ re talking about hundreds , if not thousands , of locals keeping a deafening racket during the entire match .
I found the constant clamor to be most distracting and annoying , and it even got in the way of being able to hear the crowd reaction to terrific plays or bad calls by referees both .
language Log notes that vuvuzela “ is woth 23 scrabble points even before bonuses — or would be , if it were added to the official word list . ”
mark Gleeson at Reuters blog thinks that in the end money will talk louder than any vuvuzela .
he says that the debate around the vuvuzela has become “ almost a neo-colonial conflict ” :
the debate around the vuvuzela was always going to generate big noise but for some South African commentators it has become almost a neo-colonial conflict .
the noisy trumpet , which dominates the sound waves around the stadiums during the Confederations Cup , has got a lot of people covering their ears .
complaints from TV viewers across Europe have been vociferous enough for the future of the plastic pest to become the major item on the agenda at the series of press conferences FIFA president Sepp Blatter has held during the tournament in South Africa .
at the end the day , it is the big TV money that talks .
if the world ’ s broadcasters feel the cacophony of vuvuzelas detracts from the viewing pleasure of their public , FIFA will be forced to back down and ban the trumpets from the 2010 World Cup stadiums .
it won ’ t have anything to do with any ‘ ism , just cold hard cash .
Bob of the unofficial blog of DC United does not understand the vuvuzela haters :
I personally don &apos;t understand the vuvuzela haters .
I guess some people have no ability to filter out these quiet buzzing sounds from the ubiquitous noisemakers in the stands during the Confederations Cup matches .
apparently , they are called vuvuzelas .
I want one .
from the very first seconds of the very first Confederations Cup match that I watched this year , New Zealand v Spain , I thought , “ what is that interesting sound ? ” and then promptly filtered it out .
in a similar way , when I lived in Rosslyn , under the flight path of the planes approaching National Airport , the noisy planes bothered me for about a week .
then I didn &apos;t hear it anymore .
anyone who has been to a live soccer match knows that it is an event of experiences .
there is the game itself , but there are songs , Roman Candles , smoke bombs , drums , horns .
oh yeah , and drunk supporters too .
some of his readers disagree .
one of them hates “ the damn thing ” because it destroys the game atmosphere :
I &apos;m one of the haters , and I can &apos;t comprehend someone who actually enjoys watching soccer on TV liking them .
I hate the damn things .
but it &apos;s not because they &apos;re loud and annoying .
lots of things — hell , lots of people — are loud and annoying , even ( especially ) at soccer matches .
it &apos;s not because they &apos;re loud and annoying .
it &apos;s because they absolutely , completely , utterly destroy the game-related atmosphere at the matches .
destroy it .
another reader says , “ it &apos;s insane ” :
* You * may have some wonderful ability to push it into your mental background , but for most of us , it &apos;s insane .
the sound is * not * “ atmospheric ” , it is * not * a minor part of the viewing experience , and it is * not * acceptable .
Setumo writes about the vuvuzela and intolerance :
for the record , we do not blow the vuvuzela because we are Africans .
we blow the vuvuzela because we get an adrenalin rush from the creative noise it makes .
also , we get an adrenalin rush because we are human .
not because we are Africans !
now that we have moved away from the racial stereotype , it becomes easier to clear the noise .
subsequently , we could agree in unison that this is a matter of like , dislike and intolerance .
one of Setumo &apos;s readers argues that World Cup is not and “ African ” thing :
so the Vuvu is an African thing ? ?
the FIFA 2010 fiasco is not an “ African ” thing .. it is an international thing .
the fact is that SA is only hosting the tourno , and trying hard to get as many international visitors to SA next year .
so , have a bit of understanding that most non-Africans find the V-noise irritating in the extreme .
I doubt that many non-African countries aspire to be anything like “ African ” , given the general mayhem , murder , &amp; mis-Government that exists in this sick Continent .
another reader likes the sound so much and would even buy vuvuzela ringtone !
@ mcOlly – As a Texan , I would totally buy that ringtone .
all this uproar over the vuvuzela is silly .
if it doesn ’ t sound nice on TV , then the broadcasters should turn the stadium mics down .
I just learned of the vuvuzela by watching the Confederations Cup , and it makes me want to go to the WC even more .
Shine2010 thinks that vuvuzelas will teach the world tolerance and respect :
… maybe an encounter with a few thousand vuvuzelas will force the world , and soccer , to actually adopt some of the ideals – tolerance , respect , etc .
Robyn has become a vuvuzela addict :
I first tried to blow a vuvuzela two weeks ago , at the start of the Confederations Cup which has been held in South Africa ahead of next year ’ s World Cup .
I failed miserably .
I blew and I blew and nothing happened , just a few insipid little parps .
but at the Brazil vs. Italy game , I got the hang of the vuvuzela and quickly joined the crowd in a jaunty one-note tune .
Baaaah !
Baaah !
Baaah !
it is a sound so irritating and so obnoxious that it ’ s best to stick with the maxim “ if you can ’ t beat ‘ em , join em . ” Not blowing a vuvuzela at a South African football game not only makes you feel a bit left out but it also makes you resent the noise everyone else it making .
I Luv SA has a piece of advice for vuvuzela haters , “ Suck it up ” :
me , I &apos;d say to Fifa , you bought the spiel to host the cup in South Africa , you get to eat up the whole enchilada which includes the main ingredient , the vuvuzela .
it &apos;s like telling English fans to shut the irritating background drone they call singing .
Suck it up .
“ Critics are saying they are too noisy .
I say so what ? , ” writes Ash on South Africa Football Fans blog :
that is the purpose of the Vuvuzela after all .
it is there to get the atmosphere buzzzzing .
this is Africa and we are renowned for dancing and singing and generally creating a great vibe at our football matches .
it ’ s all part of the uniquely South African experience and I ’ m certain that if our foreign visitors attend the games and experience the electrifying atmosphere they will fall in love with the Vuvuzela .
to me asking the local supporters to leave their Vuvuzela ’ s at home would be like asking the Liverpool fans not to sing You &apos;ll Never Walk Alone , or asking the Brazilian fans not to create the Samba atmosphere at their matches .
“ What happened to dancing and singing and costumes ? , ” one reader asks and adds , “ Don &apos;t let your only contribution to the world be an almost universally annoying one !
if that is the only culture South Africa has to share , that is pretty bad .
whatever happened to dancing and singing and costumes ? seems to work for other countries just fine .
don &apos;t let your only contribution to the world be an almost universally annoying one !
it &apos;s a question of hospitality too .
blasting noise in our ears is just plain rude .
I for one am turning the sound off .
I feel sorry for anyone travelling to SA to watch the games .
they have no choice in the matter .
another reader compares the vuvuzela sound to “ an annoying swarm of bees buzzing around your head … ” :
the argument the blogger is making about comparing Liverpool songs and Brazil &apos;s samba atmosphere borders on retarded .
I would certainly ask a Liverpool fan to stop if they just screamed one note of YWNWA in my ear for an hour and a half .
there is a big difference between an annoying swarm of bees buzzing around your head a samba dance .
“ You won &apos;t be watching your local teams or players , ” another reader responds :
how is South Africa telling the world that they are football visitors ?
visitors to the country yes .
visitors to football ?
don &apos;t make me laugh .
this is not South African football next year .
it &apos;s world football in South Africa .
you won &apos;t be watching your local teams or players .
Anders tells us that vuvuzela haters are the people who were watching the games on TV :
the vuvuzela outcry is mainly coming from those , like my friend , who are watching the tournament abroad .
in the stadium , the fans love them .
it &apos;s one of those things you bemoan until you actually are able to try it : think laser pointer .
on TV the horns conflict with the commentary , among other things , but in the ground the ambient noise is part of the atmosphere .
it is undoubtedly less abrasive in person than it is via satellite .
the real vuvuzela war , we are told , is not on the Internet but in the Netherlands :
there is a real Vuvuzela war threat in the Netherlands .
the company SoccerID reported Monday to import the controversial South African horn to Europe .
within three to four weeks the first Vuvuzela &apos;s should be for sale in the Netherlands .
NoLimitation however , claims to have exclusive distribution rights for the Vuvuzela .
NoLimitation BV acquired the exclusive rights to the Vuvuzela and use of the name through Urbas Kehrberg GmbH , the German company which claims to have the rights to all EU countries .
this means that , according NoLimitation , they are the only company in the Netherlands with the right to sell the three-piece horn under the name Vuvuzela .
Chris of World Cup blog agrees that the vuvuzela is “ quintessentially South African ” but …
problem is , it ’ s also quintessentially obnoxious .
if you ’ ve watched even 30 seconds of a Confederations Cup , you ’ ve surely noticed the all-enveloping buzzing sound – and chances are those horns are the reason you only watched 30 seconds .
it ’ s just one long 90 minute droning sound . to the point you begin to wonder when the B-list horror movie is going to break out before your eyes .
I ’ ve personally begun watching the games on mute – what with the combination of ESPN ’ s commentary team and the vuvuzela capable of being substituted for lethal injection and all .
Phobian suggests that the vuvuzela be allowed when South Africa plays :
the World Cup is for everyone , not just the Vuvuzela blowers .
maybe they should only be allowed at games where SA plays .
the other soccer teams playing should also have some say in whether there should be Vuvuzelas or not at their games .
SA Sucks takes the vuvuzela debate to a totally new ground by arguing that apart from the possibility of damaging one &apos;s hearing , the instrument might spread HIV / AIDS !
SA Sucks writes , “ Apparently Sipho would empty the vuvuzela every often by swinging it wildly , splattering strings of HIV-positive / TB ( &amp; God knows what other nasty diseases ) gob all over the hapless person behind , in front of and next to him . ” :
medical experts are issuing warnings that the noise from a vuvuzela can permanently damage a person ’ s hearing , but that ’ s never mind the HIV / AIDS dangers of this thing .
from last week ’ s Confederations Cup matches , spectators were blasted from all directions by the earth-shattering noise of the vuvuzela . in addition to the health hazards of ringing ears and thundering headaches , a by-product of mindlessly blowing on this instrument is the accumulation of a huge amount of saliva .
apparently Sipho would empty the vuvuzela every often by swinging it wildly , splattering strings of HIV-positive / TB ( &amp; God knows what other nasty diseases ) gob all over the hapless person behind , in front of and next to him .
the vuvuzela is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the “ Sub-Saharan Africoon ” :
personally , I love it !
if anything is going to bring the World Cup 2010 down , and become a symbol of everything that is wrong with the sub-Saharan Africoon , it will be the damned vuvuzela .
just think how the filth , squalor , violent ape-like behaviour and deafening racket this thing produces will be beamed into 500 million White Western homes , for all the world to see .
SA Sucks warns World Cup visitors to prepare for an anthropological “ baptism of fire . ” The blogger experienced himself “ three hours of hell on earth ” :
but on Sunday I was subjected to more than three hours of this hell on earth.I vowed , then and there , that after that first ( and only ) evening of the authentic South African soccer experience , I would never ever allow myself to be subjected to it again .
there were many things amiss that left me disappointed and angry that evening , but none so offensive to my senses as the Vuvuzela .
“ If FIFA were to ban the vuvuzela then they may as well scrap the rotation policy of the World Cup and just stage it every year in Europe at times that suit the Europeans and with a European atmosphere at the stadia , ” writes Visual Guidance :
of course , there has to be something to moan about though .
no complaints from the people at the stadium .
they love it .
no , it is the sofa slobs thousands of miles away , slouched in front of their TV and whining that the noise is giving them a headache .
Boo hoo .
answer me this – are the horns any more annoying than the Ultras with mega-phones at partisan stadia across the peninsula or the England Band droning out ‘ The Great Escape ’ constantly at Wembley ?
this tournament is being played in Africa .
this is what they do at football games in their country , it ’ s their football culture .
if FIFA were to ban the vuvuzela then they may as well scrap the rotation policy of the World Cup and just stage it every year in Europe at times that suit the Europeans and with a European atmosphere at the stadia .
Garreth finds the vuvuzela &apos;s noise awful and horrifying but feels that the global football community needs to explore new footballing cultures :
even though the noise is awful ( horrifying really ) I ’ m inclined to agree with the SAFA on this one .
as much as the World Cup is about football it is also about the global football community and exploring new footballing cultures .
if I ’ m starting to sound a bit like a hippy here I ’ m sorry , but it generally is the way I feel .
the vuvuzela sound is annoying and that is why walls of Jericho fell !
the sound is annoying !
that ’ s why the walls of Jericho fell !
the people of Jericho broke the walls down on themselves to escape the blaring !
death was the sweeter option .
now , as for those South African fans , they are ALL LUNGS !
don ’ t they realize the commotion they ’ re creating ?
nobody will buy a ticket to have some guy blow the crap out of a vuvuzela throughout the match !
Cape Town Daily Photo does not think the noise was all that bad :
I ’ ve never been a fan of the vuvuzela ( that long plastic trumpet that South African supporters blow at soccer matches ) , but to be honest , it really wasn ’ t so bad .
they weren ’ t too loud and I have to say that they did add to the atmosphere significantly .
they are an integral part of South African soccer culture and it just wouldn ’ t be the same without them .
getting ready for World Cup 2010 ?
buy ear plugs from a music store – you ’ ll still be able to enjoy the atmosphere , even if you find a vuvuzela positioned right next to your ear .
if you are a fan of vuvuzela , you can visit Blow Me website to blow the virtual vuvuzela .
Ethiopia : Muslim Protest Gaining Momentum
signs of Ethiopian Muslims activism against government ’ s meddling in their religious affairs became evident when they took their campaign online in May .
as their online activism grows offline , members of Ethiopian Federal Police have started using force against the protesters .

according to local activists Facebook page Dimtsachin Yisema ( Let Our Voice Be Heard ) physical violence , which includes transgressing sacred places in their mosques , was used against them .
an Ethiopian Muslim campaigner and writer Merim Bint Islam posts on her Facebook page with a note :
this is how brutal beatings were done on our brother , yesterday in Awuliya .
Addis News Updates ‏ @ AddisFocus # Ethiopia &apos;n regime &apos;s forces unshamefully confiscated over a hundred animals ( oxen ) from a Mesjid in Addis which was ready for sadaqa . # Islam
the YouTube video below shows Ethiopian Muslim protestors in April 2012 :
though the actions of the police were reportedly brutal , activists on Facebook page are incessantly advising their fellow Muslims to keep their calm .
Ethiopian Muslims Facebook page shared Ahmedin Jebel ’ s note which reads &#91; amh &#93; :
to All Ethiopian Muslims since the beginning of our movement for the last six months we have strived to keep ourselves away from destructive demonstration as these actions would cancel out our struggle .
different groups have been trying to instigate us to violent actions by their wounding actions .
they even transgressed our sacred places but we should stand our ground firmly because if we succumb to their tactics we will become losers .
meanwhile , Abiye Teklemariam wrote on Facebook :
activists claim gov &apos;t underlings may deliberately stage a fake violent demo. near the AU headquarters to blame it on Muslim protesters .
political and religious situation in Ethiopia look uncertain as rumors about whereabouts and health of the Prime Minster Meles Zenawi circulate and Muslim protests gain momentum .
Islam is the second-most widely practiced religion in Ethiopia after Christianity .

Mexicans Elect Their Next President
on July 1 , Mexicans went to the polls to elect their next President .
from before the elections , the sentiment among most netizens was that it would be a close race between Enrique Peña Nieto ( EPN ) from the Institutional Revolutionary Party and Andrés Manuel López Obrador ( AMLO ) from the Party of the Democratic Revolution , although supporters of Josefina Vázquez Mota ( from the current ruling party ) did not lose hope .
as soon as the polls opened , netizens began to share their thoughts and experiences .
Twitter user @ YONOFUI affirmed :
today is the first day of a country which will begin to grow and realize that without citizen work there will be no achievements .
the hashtag # Elecciones2012 ( 2012 Elections ) quickly became worldwide trending topic .
many netizens started to organize websites and hashtags to gather reports on fraud and other forms of illegal actions like campaigning near a polling station .
Tonatiuh Bravo ( @ tonatiuhbravo ) used one of these hashtags , # Operacion1J , to report the following :
if you want proof of the buying of voting IDs , here &apos;s the video # Operacion1J yfrog.us / gh5kgiz
“ The vote is free and secret ” .
Mexicans vote at a polling station in Mexico City on July 1 , 2012 .

after the first partial results were released , mainstream media from all over the world , including Mexico , rushed to inform that the Electoral Federal Institution ( IFE ) had projected Enrique Peña Nieto as the winner .
while his followers celebrated , some netizens were disappointed and others were dubious .
Peña Nieto was quick to claim victory even after only a small percentage of the votes had been counted , filling his Twitter account ( @ EPN ) with thank you notes and words of victory , which raised the suspicion of fraud among netizens .
thank you to all Mexicans ! you have spoken and have chosen to vote for a change of direction .
Freelance journalist Erik de la Regera ( @ erikdelareguera ) asked :
question : how did IFE manage to make a projection of Peña winning w / 7-8 % with only &lt; 25 % of votes counted and the race getting tighter
while the community Think Mexican ( @ thinkmexican ) pointed out :
by declaring EPN winner , AMLO is being pressured by media , Calderón and IFE to concede .
why the rush ?
what are they afraid of ?
real change ?
final results will be released on Wednesday , July 4 .

Mexico : two Students Killed During Protest in Ayotzinapa
two students , Jorge Alexis Herrera Pino and Gabriel Echeverría de Jesús , were killed on December 12 , 2011 , during a protest held by students of the rural school Raúl Isidro Burgos in Ayotzinapa , Chilpancingo , the capital of the state of Guerrero , Mexico .
the protest blocked the highway “ Autopista del Sol ” which leads to the tourist area of Acapulco .
Contradicting versions of events have been published online , including the version given by the authorities of Guerrero who said this protest was “ unusual ” , and that “ strange agents ” not related to the students participated in the mobilization .
la Jornada de Guerrero published a chronicle of the events :
everything started with a smoke curtain , provoked by the tear gas bombs that came out of the hands of the federal police .
&#91; .. &#93; After that came the first gust of bullets form the federal police , who were authorized to proceed via radio .
the second gust , which was longer , came from different hands : ministerial police opened fire against the students from the right lane ( of the highway from north to south ) &#91; ... &#93; It didn &apos;t take long for the federal police to aim at the same target .
&#91; … &#93; On the other side , Ayotzinapa &apos;s side , the rural students with a daily budget for food of 3.50 dollars , responded with sticks and stones .
the domestic bombs that they had weren &apos;t used because they didn &apos;t have time to load them with gas from the 2 gas stations on of each side of the highway .
some , trying to defend themselves , had time to light up the bottles they got from the service station .
the police then threw some fragmentation grenades at the students , that by then were seeking refuge in the space between the buses and concrete walls that divide the highway .
there were five grenades in total and none detonated , but they provoked panic &#91; ... &#93; .
the only ones not moving were two students , both 22 years old
the normalista school involved in the protest has been historically in resistance and belongs to an old tradition of ‘ escuelas normalistas rurales ’ , which are schools that form teachers from very poor and disadvantage communities .
the school in question belongs to the Federación de Estudiantes Campesinos Socialistas de México ( Federation of Rural Socialist Students of México ) .
journalist Diego Osorno , who specializes in social conflicts , wrote a story for the blog Nuesta Aparente Rendición about the normalistas conflict in Guerrero , specifically the school of Ayotzinapa .
the school issued a communique in which they denied having any weapons and demand justice for the killings , which they labeled as “ extrajudicial execution ” .
the text also explains the repeated cancellations of scheduled meetings with the Minister of Education of Guerrero and demand the governor &apos;s resignation

on December 13 , Justice Authority Alberto López Rosas , during a radio interview with Carmen Aristegui , declared that one of the detainees – who is 19-years-old – had an AK-47 , but they didn &apos;t know if the bullets matched the caliber that killed the two students .
however he said the weapon is not the kind used by police , and made it clear that the police &apos;s actions did not constitute repression , that they only wanted to bring order .
in relation to this , La Jornada published a report about the use of torture to “ fabricate ” a confession related to the AK-47 .
later that day , López Rosas contradicted his earlier version , saying that the shots might have been fired by the “ ministerial police ” .
but during the events , Roberto Ramirez ( @ robertoramirezb ) , head of information of La Jornada Guerrero , tweeted :
# Ayotzinapa This is not a clash , it is a crime
he also reported via Twitter that a reporter had been detained because he looked like a student , and had been heavily beaten before his release .
Ramírez also tweeted that some grenades made in England were found on the scene .
on Twitter , users have been sharing a few , very graphic images of the fallen students ( &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; ) ; one of the photos shows a student with signs of torture . Reforma , one of the major media outlets in Mexico , published a video where a person in plain clothes is seen firing a weapon .
they also posted a sequence of photographs of one of the students running moments before getting shot .
meanwhile , El Universal reported that the shots that killed the students were aimed at their heads , and Revista Proceso added that witnesses said the police shot the students .
in a press conference held on December 13 , students of Ayotzinapa said the police made a call and were given the “ green light ” to do whatever they wanted – then they started shooting , Contralínea reports .
according to La Jornada , four people suffered bullet injuries , and student Édgar David Espíritu is in a coma .
Twenty-three people were released on December 13 at noon , but 15 are reported missing and reports say one person is still being held by authorities .
later on December 13 , the Secretary and Sub Secretary of Security , together with the Chief Prosecutor of Chilpancingo , were relieved of their duties by the governor of Guerrero .
Twitter users expressed their outrage with the hasthag # Ayotzinapa :
@ roblesmaloof : blaming those who are killed for their own deaths , it is as old as dictatorships and we &apos;re not going to believe it . # Ayotzinapa .
@ danischmidt : I am having breakfast &#91; and finding out about the &#93; assassination of 2 normalistas because of the abuse of the federal police # Ayotzinapa .
@ VinitoPereda : I don ’ t doubt that the # PF ( federal police ) act in consequence of the psychosis that Calderon &apos;s war has produced .
they were STUDENTS not narcos # Ayotzinapa .
@ Morf0 : first they killed the right to education then they killed them &#91; the students &#93; # Ayotzinapa
@ blanchepetrich : so the students from the countryside # Ayotzinapa are too “ radical ” ?
give them reasons , arguments , answers , not bullets !
@ roblesmaloof : it is so hard for conventional media to say that the students of # Ayotzinapa were assassinated .
@ Asteris : is # Mexico now perceived by int &apos;l media as another Iraq ?
too much quotidian violence to even bother covering it ? # Ayotzinapa # Chilpancingo
Hamlet García Almaguer ( @ hamletgar ) blogged in LetraJoven :
that &apos;s the problem , those who have lived in Guerrero know than Guerrero is rough and that at any moment &#91; people &#93; can raise up ; and they also know that homicides committed by the powerful are intolerable .
Mexico &apos;s Human Rights Commission has opened an investigation on the incident .
Zambia 2011 : two Events That Shook the Country
undoubtedly , two events in Zambia will go down as having shaken the country in seismic ways .
the first was the death of Second Republican President Frederick Chiluba , a maverick trade unionist turned-politician who defeated Zambia ’ s founding president Dr Kenneth Kaunda who had been in power for 27 years but was swept out of office in the first multi-party elections after 17 years of one party “ democracy ” .
this is how one Zambian blogger , Munshya , remembered Chiluba :
here a man without High School education worked hard as a bus conductor to read a few A Level courses which he later admitted to have flanked .
Additionally , not to be outdone by his many challenges , Chiluba went as far as Tanzania looking for opportunities .
when he came back to Zambia in his twenties , he translated the knowledge he acquired while working in the Tanzanian Sisal industry into good use .
he used his courageousness and his fearlessness to become a defender of his fellow workers .
through the trade union , a diminutive Chiluba had found an opportunity to talk and walk the tallest .
@ ictjournalist tweeted :
@ ictjournalist : @ GNdhlovu i remember him as a person who who started a revolution in Africa which has spread all over
afriwoman was a little sad :
@ afriwoman : listening to Zambian radio stations , going through pics of # Chiluba &apos;s funeral courtesy of @ QfmZambia .
didn &apos;t like the guy but a little sad
the second was the defeat of the ruling MMD after clocking 20 years in power and only three years in office of the incumbent president Rupiah Banda who lost to PF ’ s Michael Sata at his fourth attempt at the presidency .
after his election president Sata , in another political masterstroke , surprised the world when he appointed his long time ally and his party ’ s vice president , Dr Guy Scott , a white Zambian who has been on the country ’ s political scene for over 20 years .
reacting to Guy Scott &apos;s appointment , Zambian tweep and blogger @ missbwalya noted :
@ missbwalya : Zambia is the only African country with a white VP . wonder how that will be received by “ anti-white African ” militants .
Zambia &apos;s new Vice President Guy Scott .
image from the ruling Patriotic Front website .
Chiluba ’ s death , which citizens first learnt of through Twitter , shocked the nation which only three years before , had buried a sitting president , Levy Mwanawasa who died in France after collapsing in Egypt while on international duty .
Chiluba ’ s death became a hot campaign issue for the MMD whose cadres threatened to beat Sata if he attended the funeral of his once boss under whom he saved not only as cabinet minister but as the MMD ’ s national secretary .
Sata never set foot at the funeral venue following threats to beat him up by MMD cadres but he unexpectedly turned up at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre where Chiluba ’ s body lay in state and paid his last respects , viewing it along ordinary citizens , vexing even security officials who did not know what to do with the then opposition leader who was clearly in bad books with President Banda .
by the time the belligerent MMD cadres turned up to sort Sata out , he had already left Mulungushi .
this was probably one move that increased Sata ’ s stature in potential voters ’ minds .
the irony , however , is that Chiluba , before his demise , touted himself as President Banda ’ s political consultant who vowed to deliver Sata ’ s perceived regional strongholds to the MMD .
supporters in a truck celebrate the victory of opposition leader Michael Sata as he was sworn in as the fifth Zambian president .
related to Chiluba ’ s death was the presidential election for which the MMD was sure to win with its well-financed campaign vis-à-vis a Spartan and low key campaign strategy of the PF which adopted the slogan “ Donchi Kubeba ” with donchi being a corruption of the English word , don ’ t and kubeba being tell .
the MMD government tried to suppress the release of poll results when it became apparent that things were not going their way but netizens where clearly a step ahead releasing the results on Twitter , Facebook and social networks .
President Sata has embarked on a massive investigation of corrupt activities under the previous administration and within a few weeks of commencement of the investigations , security wings dug out billions of Zambian Kwacha from a former minister ’ s farm .
several other former cabinet ministers have since been arrested or have had their properties suspected to have been corruptly obtained , seized .
when the scale of impropriety became apparent , citizens started calling for the removal of President Banda &apos;s immunity from prosecution .
netizens also wondered whether the former president implicated himself in his farewell speech .
on Facebook , Gongs Jhala asked :
do you think RB and his sons will face criminal prosecution ?
I found it interesting when he said they did not “ knowingly abuse public resources ” &#91; does &#93; that mean they abused public resources but did not know they were doing so ?
many netizens weighed in on the fight against corruption :
@ lwangamwilu : some people miraculously acquired wealth in 3 years in office , let them be investigated – Milupi # Zambia
@ stevenputter : # Zambia , 1000 bicycles “ for personal use ” thought it was only God that could be in more than one place at a time , no wonder investigated
perhaps we should mention the Barotseland Agreement debate , which picked up in 2011 .
long considered a non-issue during decades of one party rule , Barotseland became an issue of political contention in 2011 .
two people were killed in January 2011 after riots broke out in Mongu , the capital of Western Province over reinstatement of the Barotseland Agreement of 1964 .
some activists in the region argue that the Barotseland Agreement provides for separation from the rest of Zambia .
Uganda Marks 50 Years of Independence
image source : Uganda @ 50 Facebook page .
on Tuesday 9 October , 1962 , Uganda got its independence as the Union Jack flag of England was lowered , the Ugandan flag raised whilst jubilant Ugandans sang the Uganda National Anthem .
on Tuesday 9 October , 2012 , Uganda marked the Golden Jubilee of this historic event .
many occasions have taken place around the country to mark this special day , which started with the Kampala Carnival on Sunday 7 October .
many people converged at Kololo Airstrip today to mark the 50 years of independence .
Uganda has had eight presidents since independence , namely , King Sir Edward Muteesa II , Apollo Milton Obote , Idi Amin Dada , Yusuf kironde Lule , Godfrey Lukongwa Binayiisa , Paulo Muwanga , Tito Okello Lutwa , and the current President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni .
the country still faces challenges of health , education , press freedom among others .
generally however , many Ugandans seem to be happy about 50 years of independence , and look forward to the next 50 years , as they say Yoga Yoga Uganda ( the title of the official Uganda @ 50 song , which means congratulations in Luganda ) .
some Ugandans , however , think the the celebration is a waste of resources in a country where some people sleep hungry .
Ugandans online have been discussing the Jubilee on Twitter and Facebook .
Twitter
during the main event , there was a spectacular show by Uganda &apos;s fighter jets .
Norman Anguzu tweets a pic of the jets in air :
@ normzo : # UgandaAt50 Awesome picture from ‘ The Mzungu Diaries &apos; # Ugandapic.twitter.com / IJ25bPUw
Lucy Smize tweets about the colors of the Ugandan flag and their meanings :
Patricia Kahill wishes Ugandans nice independence day , but comments on the load shedding of power by Umeme , the company providing hydro electric power :
@ pkahill : happy independence day in Dark # fumemeug @ 50 # ILoveUgBecause more
Rosebell Kagumire says that despite Uganda celebrating 50 years , the country does show any sign of maturity :
@ rosebellk : you r celebrating 50 years of independence + no sign of maturity whatsoever !
you cant stand dissent , how will you grow ? # Ugandaat50
Angelo Izama believes Uganda is still one of the most beautiful countries in the world :
@ opiaiya : still possibly one of the most beautiful countries in the world # Uganda @ 50
Vanessa proposes a tost to Uganda &apos;s Jubilee :
@ v _ sees _ you : a toast to Uganda !
50 years Independent !
\ ☺ / May God continue to bless our nation !
Timothy Kalyegira tweets about Google Uganda &apos;s Jubilee homepage :
@ timkalyegira : even Google is into Uganda @ 50 hype , with a Uganda theme on its homepage .
( but I bet the Internet link is off at Google &apos;s Kampala office !

Maxentia comments about the colors she wore today :
@ maxen1987 : btw , i wore my national flag colours ; black yellow red to honour the day # Uganda @ 50. it feels good
happy Betty believes she is blessed to witness Uganda at 50 years :
happy Betty : Blesed 2b hea as Uganda meks 50 sure i shall stil b around at 100 bt 2my generation thus far our fathers hv come its our turn 2take Uganda thr da nxt 50 yrs we determine what we shall have then-God sure is with us !
Facebook
Edwinsmith Kigozi says :
it feels really good to see Ugandans coming together to celebrate 50 years as Ugandans not looking at the different political parties but just as Ugandans .
let &apos;s go Uganda .
for God and my country .
Akampa Ivan feels that the fighter jets show was not the best Uganda could have :
someone should have given me a good stone to shoot for you one of these Jets that have been polluting Kampala with noise and smoke .
I wonder whether our Government lacks a proper procurement unit to procure jets that are of advanced technology of current other than old crap or Uganda lacks qualified personnel with jet flying skills .
so much disappointed .
a proper ride would actually move faster than these jets .
anyway its Uganda at 50 , and am proud to be Ugandan .
happy Golden Jubilee Uganda ! ! ! !
lets celebrate .
shy V Okecho notes that as Uganda is growing old , everything else is growing old too , a reference to un-repaired roads , schools and hospitals :
but Uganda @ 50 as it grows , the roads have also grown , Hospitals grown with no medicine M.P &apos;s get bribes of 200,000 to pass the budget .
but Uganda my country .
Evelyn Mirembe Nkuyahaga says :
wow this is just awesome !
I Love my Country and my President !
Ululululu … Thank you Jesus for Uganda !
Uganda : blogs , Twitter Keep World Informed as Kampala Riots Continue
as riots shook Kampala , the capital of Uganda , for the second day , bloggers and other netizens rallied to keep the world informed .
within 24 hours of the first riots , concerned Kampalans launched Uganda Witness , a crisis reporting site where Ugandans can share news of deaths , looting , presence of government forces and other related information .
as of Friday afternoon ( 9pm GMT ) the site had received multiple reports of rioting in downtown Kampala and several of the city &apos;s suburbs .
screenshot from UgandaWitness.net showing where riots have been reported .
Ugandan blogger The 27th Comrade has spent the past few months developing a system for sending Twitter messages and posting Facebook status updates via Uganda Telecom cell phones .
on Friday , in response to the riots , he rolled out the service early , posting directions on the Kampala-based communal blog The Kampalan , ensuring the privacy of users :
now , the situation in Kampala has caused a premature announcement ( of sorts ) for this service .
what to do , though ?
the men make plans , the gods decide .
in short , there is no censorship , no fear , and no favour .
post away .
: o ) The exchanges are not cached in the system in a way that would injure privacy at all , and indeed many things are made complex ( signing up , messaging ) precisely because your privacy is being respected .
a tweet from Kampala resident and brand new Twitter user dgel urging others to use Twitter to spread news of the riots has been making its rounds through the Ugandan Twitter community .
he writes :
@ dgel : “ Anyone in Kampala , please teach at least one other person how to use twitter , and encourage them to keep us all updated .
news from Kampala &apos;s mainstream has been increasingly hard to come by as the government has detained reporters and closed radio stations throughout the city .
Joe at Uganda Talks explains :
readers last night will have been aware that popular Luganda station CBS was taken off the air last night for allegedly inciting violence and mobilising the rioters .
today the Government also suspended the licenses of Suubi FM , Radio Sapientia and Radio Two Akaboozi Kubiri on the same grounds .
fresh Apples , who has been posting updates since the riots began , reports that the government posted guards at the CBS radio masts on Buziga Hill in Kampala :
CBS Radio station is now off air -reportedly cut of by the Government
CBS off air- Millitary police now guarding Masts at Buziga
multiple Twitter reports coming in from Ugandans in Kampala indicate that the government is targeting individual journalists as well :
@ mugamuya : “ VoA ( local FM ) reporter detained in Kayunga after kampala riots. maybe in npolice cell somewhere .
NTV reporter arrested briefly ”
@ uginsomniac : Moses Kibuuka ( NTV ) &amp; Yahaya Iga Muyingo ( Voice of Africa ) arrested in Kayunga today are out on bond .
their equip still in custody .
according to residents of Kampala , the television and radio stations that are still on air are broadcasting little or no information about the riots .
Tumwijuke at Ugandan Insomniac writes :
what is radio for if not for immediate news immediately ?
where was the citizen talk-back ?
why no discussion of the hooliganism of many of the protesters ?
where are the rolling interviews with the Buganda Kingdom , the police and government ?
where were the call-ins from Masaka town , Nyendo , Kayunga and Mukono where the rioting was taking place ?
why no debate on media freedom ?
why no discussion on why the Broadcasting Council exists ?
any news I am receiving on the situation in Kampala I am getting from Twitter , Facebook and blogs .
Sarah of The Malan Family writes :
TV Uganda is playing music videos and NTV Uganda is showing “ Thats so Raven ” * rolls eyes * .
BBC has a man on the ground reporting on it ( … .from freaking Nairobi ) so I &apos;m sure he has “ up to the minute updates ” for us ! ! ! !
Twitter users in Uganda were also noting the lack of news coverage on the riots :
@ CamaraAfrica : “ Wow … everyone hurry and turn to NBS for a riveting report on … wait for it … how to play golf .
@ solomonking : come on ! !
UBC has shown an annoying NLP short programme by Ethan Mussolini like 5 times in two hours and nothing on the riots ! !
Jon Gos , founder of Uganda-based software company Appfrica and 2009 TED Fellow , was surprised by how quickly Ugandans turned to Twitter to spread news :
one of the things that surprised me was how a handful of Twitter users drove the coverage for a lot of people .
as I and others like @ camaraafrica , @ mugumya , @ solomonking heard the latest here in Uganda , we feverishly updated Twitter and Facebook , our only means of reaching the outside world .
in another post on the Appfrica blog , Jon writes :
the mainstream news has picked up on what ’ s going on but local press has been shut down .
either due to too much traffic ( web ) or otherwise .
so many of us , expats or not are relying on Twitter for information .
she writes : “ We came to the conclusion that this was either tear gas or a smoke bomb because we saw people running in all different directions immediately after it went off . ”
Tanzania , Ethiopia : Meles Zenawi ‘ Tweets ’ from Grave
Monday &apos;s official confirmation of Ethiopia ’ s Prime Minster Meles Zenawi &apos;s death , sparked reactions among social media users in Tanzania , especially after tweets started appearing from what some thought was Zenawi &apos;s official Twitter account .
in all started when Zitto Zuberi Kabwe , a Member of Parliament from Tanzania , sent this tweet :
@ zittokabwe : my condolences to the people of # Ethiopia following the death of Prime Minister # MelesZenawi Hope for a democratic developmental Abbysinia
Susan Mashibe ‏ replied :
and Swahili Street concluded :
Chambi Chachage tweeted a blog post titled ‘ Meles Zenawi &apos;s Farewell to Young African Leaders ‘ from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa ( UNECA ) on 16 November 2006 , which was retweeted by others .
and then suddenly @ PMMelesZenawi intervened , apparently ‘ tweeting after death ’ to Tanzania &apos;s Member of Parliament Zitto Kabwe :
@ PMMelesZenawi : @ zittokabwe please be better than I was .
not fun up here I am preparing 2 pay for some of this http : / / www.ethiopianreview.net / index / ? p = 42267
Meles Zenawi ‏ @ PMMelesZenawi – tweeting after death .
source : Twitter Screen Shot
this tweet to Zitto Kabwe , who has more than 29,000 followers , caused a stir , setting off speculation- was ‏ @ PMMelesZenawi hacked by opponents ?
@ zittokabwe : @ hmgeleka this account seems not to be genuine of recent @ pmmeleszenawi
Zitto Zuberi Kabwe concluded , and continued :
@ zittokabwe : @ AnnieTANZANIA tweets by @ PMMelesZenawi not genuine .
ignore them .
account hacked by his opponents
Omar Ilyas backed it :
@ omarilyas : this account is fake from the begining @ PMMelesZenawi – a parody type like that one of @ Julius _ S _ Malema @ zittokabwe
however , the debate on Meles Zenawi ’ s legacy continued ranging from both admiration for Meles ability to ‘ get the job done ’ to the widespread awareness that Meles was not a democrat :
@ Htunga : @ zittokabwe Who is Meles seriously ? I see Ethiopians starving n dying in lorries .. I remember the shooting in 2010 too .
@ zittokabwe : @ Htunga were Tanzanians not starving and dying during Nyerere ?
but we celebrate him because of his principles .
Meles the same ’
@ zittokabwe : @ PMMelesZenawi regardless of his mistakes , # MelesZenawi remains a role model to me .
you have freedom to bring back # TheDerg or Isaias
the fake ( supposedly hacked ) @ PMMelesZenawi Twitter account , which managed to set off the debate mentioned above , also raises the question of why many public figures and politicians in Africa haven ’ t had their Twitter accounts verified .
reportedly , in many cases Twitter takes too long , or simply never respond to requests for verifying accounts .
Twitter is extremely popular in Tanzania as a tool for exchanging views and debate and also as a platform for breaking news .
Twitter , however , can easily be abused as in @ PMMelesZenawi case , and can also cause confusion and suspicion with regard to authenticity and reliability of sources .
other fake , hacked or parody African Twitter profiles at present are : @ Hailemdesalegne , @ Julius _ S _ Malema , @ kabwezitto , @ alfredmutua and @ MwaiKibaki
Meles Zenawi was President of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995 and later became the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in 1995 following the general elections that year .

Caribbean : Lightning Bolt Strikes Beijing
“ Lightning Bolt ” – Screenshot by hybridvigour .
visit his photostream .
this post is going to be as long as Jamaican Usain Bolt ‘ s sprint to 100m-dash Olympic glory was short and ever-so sweet – because Caribbean bloggers still have not come down from the high that Bolt &apos;s amazing win has created .
9.69 was the magic number that brought the Jamaican sprinter the Olympic gold .
and he did it , to quote The New York Times , “ by a mile . ”
as if Bolt &apos;s masterful domination of the “ fastest men in the world ” field weren &apos;t enough , Trinidadian Richard Thompson , who made an impressive showing earlier this year at the NCAA Championships , winning gold in both the 100m and 60m ( indoor ) events , pulled off an upset and came in second .
Twitter and Facebook were immediately abuzz , with bloggers calling it “ the race of the Olympics ” and admitting they were “ much prouder than usual to be West Indian ” .
the significance of the Caribbean finishing in first and second place in one of the most prestigious events of the Olympic games soon began to sink in .
this is the first time since the 1976 Games in Montreal ( when Trinidadian Hasley Crawford took top honours ) that a West Indian has brought home the gold in the 100m dash .
just as significant an achievement was the fact that six out of the eight finalists were from regional territories .
in the words of Jamaican blogger Active Voice :
right now it looks like the Caribbean has a monopoly on track and field !
… while West Indies Cricket Blog adds :
Jamaicans were understandably exuberant !
blog To The World says :
it was pandemonium and wild celebrations as Jamaica ’ s Usain Bolt won the Olympic 100m sprint in a World record time of 9.69 seconds ( breaking his own record of 9.72 . what was so surprising about this performance is that he started celebrating with about 20 meters to go .
before heading out the door to join “ motorcade in progress in Falmouth ” , he also notes that the victory was a special one for him , since he knows Bolt personally :
he is from Sherwood Content in my parish of Trelawny .
when he was at high school ( William Knibb Memorial High ) almost every evening he used to hang out in my video store before going home so I have always watched his progress over the years .
prior to the win , some bloggers were mischievously making fun of the fact that the “ super-drug ” behind the stellar performances from the Jamaicans was what West Indians refer to as “ blue food ” – hearty staples such as yams and other ground provisions .
Montego Bay Day By Day agreed that “ yellow yam , dasheen &amp; coco does the body good indeed ” , but was less-than-impressed by the fact that NBC did not bring a live feed of the race :
if Tyson Gay had qualified would they have thought it worthy of carrying , even though Gay &apos;s butt would have been quite properly whooped by Usain Bolt ?
Sour grapes indeed … Pity Asafa Powell didn &apos;t get the bronze … but cho so it go sometimes .
go through West Indies ! !
we proud of unu !
and sure enough , the proud posts kept on coming .
Jamaican Stunner asks :
how could I not join in the throng of proud bloggers in saluting such a remarkable , record breaking performance , finely executed by Usain Bolt ?
the world breaking record was amazing but what was even more fascinating was the fact that Bolt slowed down and started to celebrate his victory from approximately the 80m mark !
what the hell !
can you imagine what the record would have been if he didn &apos;t ease up ?
the rest of the region soon chimed in .
Barbadian diaspora blogger Jdid says :
how aptly named is this guy ?
Bolt wow !
9.69 and he was celebrating at the 80m mark .
Congrats !
big up Jamaica !
last night on CBC ( Canada ) they had this discussion about why Jamaica has produced such amazing sprinters over the years …
moving back to Jamaica seems to have the answer :
if it &apos;s one thing that we Jamaicans can be counted on , it &apos;s to enjoy the fact that we have the world &apos;s greatest sprint factory .
what many don &apos;t know is that a major factor in our success is the intense rivalry that exists among our high schools , that starts at age 11 and continues for a lifetime .
whatever the secret , there was no doubt as to Bolt &apos;s ability .
living in Barbados referred to the World # 1 as “ a weapon of mass destruction ” , while Cayman Islands blogger Mad Bull called him “ greased lightning ” , adding :
the only thing is , can you imagine what time he might have got if he ran his utmost best for the whole race ? !
he shut down and started celebrating the win from about the 75 metre mark !
I am sorry he didn ’ t go pedal-to-da-metal all the way through , just so we could see what the man is actually capable of !
Trinidad and Tobago-based Media Watch called the race “ Stunning !
fantastic !
electric ! ” before going on to critique the poor local MSM coverage of the event – perhaps he should have gone online , where Andre Bagoo was live-blogging the race .
Kudos kept pouring in – from Grenada , Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago .
as news broke that Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding “ has promised a massive welcome home celebration for Jamaica &apos;s first gold medalist in the Beijing Olympics , Usain Bolt , and the rest of the Olympic Team “ , Living Guyana suggested a few ways in which proper homage could be paid to the outstanding Olympian :
if … Bruce Golding … has any sense he would declare Monday a national holiday in Jamaica , he would rename Knutsford Boulevard , Usain Bolt Speedway and he would declare August 16th Usain Bolt Day .
he should be rewarded with land , 9.69 square miles of it in Jamaica .
and a house as well .
but not everyone was awe-struck by “ The Lightning Bolt ” .
while Living Guyana answered BBC Sport ‘ s Matt Slater &apos;s “ Did I just watch a man run sideways through the line , slapping his chest , and still travel 100m in 9.69 seconds ? ” Twitter question with a matter-of-fact “ Ah , yes Matt , you did .
your eyes weren &apos;t fooling you ” , Jamaican Long Bench thought the theatrics were a bit too much :
I hope someone reminds him that he is still a human being .
obnoxious men are are tolerated for only so long , even if they are Jamaican , and no matter how fast they can run .
amidst his joy for his Caribbean compatriots , Living Guyana felt a twinge of disappointment for the Guyanese Olympic contingent :
the two Caribbean countries which have invested heavily in athletics are seeing the results and enjoying the limelight on the world stage .
these two countries have proper , world class athletics stadia , excellent athletics programmes , fantastic coaches … and in other news Guyanese athletes continue to bomb out of the Olympics without any notice whatsoever .
still , nothing could stem the overwhelming tide of happiness that washed over the West Indies when two islands at opposite ends of the archipelago brought home the gold and the silver in one of the most high-profile events of the 2008 Olympic Games .
the good news spread from China to the Caribbean , from island shores to diaspora scattered far and wide .
a Mi Ver , who lives in Florida , captured the region &apos;s sense of pride and accomplishment as she recounts a conversation with her father , who called from Trinidad to bring her up to speed :
“ I decided to break the rules today &apos; cause we celebratin &apos; , ” says the old man , “ and call you while I &apos;m drivin ’ on the highway .
Usain Bolt from Jamaica jus ’ won gold in the men 100 meters , Richard Thompson from Trinidad took silver and the U.S. came third . ”
he sounds so jolly when he rings off .
* Five minutes later *
“ Did I tell you that two men from the Caribbean are the fastest men in the world ? ”
“ Yeah , I think yuh did . ”
“ Well ah gone . ”
drive safe . ”
“ Love you too .

Brazil : daily Violence Against Women
the recent assassination of a woman by the alleged father of her baby , and a promising young Brazilian goalkeeper , has been on the media spotlight , shocking the country for the level of violence involved in the crime .
at the same time , Instituto Sangari , a non profit for social awareness on scientific culture based in São Paulo , published its 2010 Map of Violence in Brazil stating that 10 women are assassinated everyday in the country .
inevitably , the blogsphere put the two together and condemnation of such crimes became a hot topic beyond the sensationalist broadcasting of mainstream media , which has been limited to the footballer &apos;s crime .
according to Nilcéa Freire , minister of women policies , violence against women is in fact largely ignored by the media :
when there are cases , mainly related to famous people that make it to the news , society realizes what happens on a daily basis and does not get in the newspapers .
women are rapped , subjugated daily though inequality .
aware of this , women &apos;s groups , such as Pão e Rosas &#91; Bread and Roses , pt &#93; , ask how many more such cases have to happen and call on all oppressed women to organize themselves in schools , neighborhoods and workplaces .
we must demand shelters for women victims of violence and for their sons and daughters , subsidized by the state , but under control of the victims of violence themselves , of the organizations and commissions of women independent from the state , from unions , from the police and from the church .

cases of violence against women in Brazil are anything but uniform .
if on one hand 50 districts surpass 10 killings per 100.000 inhabitants , more than half of Brazilian cities didn &apos;t register any murders .
when comparing Brazilian states , the discrepancies are equally surprising :
Espírito Santo , first place in the ranking , has levels of 10,3 murders of women for each 100.000 inhabitants .
“ The results show the concentration of killings in Brazil to be heterogenous .
it is hard to find a pattern that gives an explanation of the causes ” says researcher Julio Jacobo Wiaselfisz , author of the study .
in the last 10 years , over 41.000 women from all social classes aged between 18 and 30 years old were killed , often witnessed by their children who are also often victims of violence too .
lack of support services for women in risk situations is pointed as one of causes of impunity for attackers in spite of the Maria _ da _ Penha law passed in 2006 , which granted women protection after a complaint and assured them that attackers would be punished .
the new law didn &apos;t prevent the murder of hairdresser Maria Islaine de Morais , killed in January in front of the cameras by her ex-husband , against who she had filed 8 complaints .
violence against women , we can stop it ! , CC Licensed
in fact , most victims are murdered by relatives , husbands , boyfriends or other man that they may have rejected .
saying no to sex or wanting to break up the relationship make these cases .
in 50 % of them the motive was qualified as futile , such as cases resulting from domestic arguments .
10 % are passional crimes , related to jealousy , for example , and 10 % are related to using or selling drugs .
the roots of the violence are denounced as inherent to the misogyny that characterizes Brazilian culture :
these soap operas of violence against women are revealing all the brutality against the Brazilian woman .
the insides of Brazilian misogynistic culture are exposed ; the iceberg of a reality we hide underneath the rug has been turned .
the violence numbers are so high that we are scared and ask if such actions are done by human beings !
for blogger Flávia D. women are also themselves part of the problem .
they often accept and incorporate the role of women in society as subjugated to men , and are frequently the first ones pointing the finger at women that behave in a manner they consider to be inappropriate , minimizing the perpetrator &apos;s action even if unconsciously .
for the Barbarelas , a blog dedicated to fighting against all violence , it is necessary to unite society in order to put an end to all the violence inflicted on women .
violence against women and girls is intolerable , unacceptable , hurts humanity &apos;s consciousness , it is a violation of human rights .
it affects health , decreases the age expectancy and women &apos;s quality of life .
Brazil , as a signer of international documents on the rights of women , and having a national legislation to comply with , cannot stay silent and omissive .
we expect each authority to act .
and that society , the movements of women and men for gender equality , protest against this manifestations of cultural backwardness , of misogyny and omission .
women needing help in Brazil can call free 180 to denounce any violence against them or any neglect from authorities regarding their complaints and cases .
the information was extracted from blog Contra Machismo who reminds readers on its post title that in Brazil violence against women still happens on a daily basis .

Côte d &apos;Ivoire : uproar Over Unauthorized Press Use of Blogger &apos;s Photos
Christmas 2011 in Côte d &apos;Ivoire was different from those of previous years .
eight months after the change of regime , the authorities wanted to mark it with completely new decorations in the country and by organizing huge fireworks displays on December 30-31 , 2011 .
a great many Ivorians went out to take advantage of these various spectacles and the supporting technology , and everyone left with souvenir photos .
if it was a good experience for these amateur photographers , that was not the case for Audrey Carlalie .
this young Ivorian student , a professional part-time photographer , saw her photos of the fireworks display published by certain Ivorian newspapers and even the largest online Ivorian information portal – without her permission .
she did not hesitate to complain on her Facebook page , and soon the blogs and other social networks had picked up the buzz .
the Ivorian blogger Edith Brou sets the scene in her blog and explains :
in fact , Ivorian dailies such as le Jour plus , le Nouveau Réveil , Nord-Sud , l ’ Intelligent d ’ Abidjan and even the historic Internet portal Abidjan.net , did not hesitate to publish her photos , while the least of considerations would have been to send her a private message on Facebook or Twitter ( she is always connected ) to obtain her permission .
as soon as Edith Brou &apos;s post was released , the Ivorian blogosphere relayed the affair , like Yoyo , another blogger who backs Ivorian journalists in their fight for recognition and respect for their work :
since yesterday , the disappointment can be read in many comments regarding journalists of the Ivorian written press .
these professionals , who scream their outrage at the smallest trespass into their profession , apparently do not hesitate to take shortcuts in order to secure the work of others in a much less honorable manner .
in this same vein , the keyword # Carlaliegate was created on Twitter to discuss the topic , and the reactions are proliferating .
screen shot of reactions to # Carlaliegate on Twitter
what is intriguing about the affair is that the incriminated newspapers have not dared to apologize .
the worst of these newspapers is L &apos;intelligent d &apos;Abidjan , which defends itself as follows :
Friday ( December 30 , 2011 ) The IA ( Intelligent d &apos;Abidjan ) had photographers at the Palais de la Culture .
they had no transportation and had to cross the bridge to get to the office .
the layout artist then went digging on Facebook and found this photo .
we are sorry that we did not cite the author , but since the image was in the public domain and was not made for profit , why should we pay ?
we are sorry that we did not cite the author .
we will do so shortly and find the means to better enable our photographers to do their work .
for Stephane Kouakou , another active Ivorian Internet user , this situation adds to the bad press that Ivorian journalists seem determined to continue cultivating :
as I have already pointed out in my “ Bad press ” articles , the Ivorian press has many bad practices which are already causing it to lose paying readers .
it has now added another feather to its cap , making it lose a little more of the credibility that it did not even have .
currently , the buzz on the web continues and actions are underway , as Yehni Djidji notes in her post on the subject :
Abidjan.net has simply removed the photos from its site .
l &apos;intelligent d &apos;Abidjan has proposed the following compensation : re-posting of the photo with her name ( inside the newspaper but not on the first page ) , a collaboration agreement so that the photos will be paid for , and a PDF version of the newspaper to be sent to Carlalie within ONE MONTH .
before that , this same newspaper tried several other tactics on the net that deserve to be dissected , doubtless in another article .
Carlalie , who has sought the counsel of legal advisors , can no longer speak on the subject , but the last time that I spoke with her , the other press organizations had not responded to her attempts at communication .
Uganda : police Paint Protesters Pink
Ugandan police have responded to the past month &apos;s ongoing Walk to Work protests by spraying protesters with tear gas and live bullets .
during a demonstration on Tuesday , they took a different tack , firing water cannons filled with pink liquid at demonstrators who were attempting to walk to Constitution Square in the center of Kampala .
Uganda &apos;s New Vision Newspaper tweeted a photo of opposition leaders covered in the paint .
Yfrog Photo user flashdancer11 shared the photo below :
some bloggers pointed out the irony of the government spraying protesters pink — a color often associated with the gay and lesbian community — given the anti-homosexuality bill currently making its way through Uganda &apos;s Parliament .
blogger Afrogay writes :
… might this also be a subliminal response to the leader of the opposition , Kizza Besigye , for pledging four months ago to decriminalize homosexuality if elected ?
to which AfroGay would say to the head of the military guys drenching opposition in pink : thanks guys but the pink color is really just a metaphor .
there is no need to take it too literally .
the hashtag # pinkstuff is also popular topic in the Ugandan Twittersphere :
@ Rosejackson3 : so illegal to # walk2work in UG w / o permit .
if you fly , blocked .
if you stand- # pinkstuff
@ ishtank : on the other hand , think of the stories we &apos;ll tell our great-grandchildren .
“ Kaaka , where were you the day # pinkStuff # trended on # Twitter ? ”
while many found the “ pink stuff ” humorous , others are still upset at the government &apos;s treatment of protesters .
blogger KellyUganda writes :
why does this seem incredibly Hitler / Nazi-esque to me ?
as if people don &apos;t have the right to demonstrate !
I don &apos;t know how Museveni can even pretend to be running a democracy .
no doubt these people are being sprayed pink so that police can harrass and interrogate them and abuse them in the effort to crush their spirit of civic duty and freedom of expression !
in a post titled “ Turning Pink , ” another blogger , Rhino , laments the government &apos;s actions :
I &apos;m starting to dislike my government very much , it shows so much fear , infantile logic and an alarming willingness to resort to violence .
that is not what I want from it .
I want it to be just , to inspire me to be a better person and to help me create a better place for my kin and I to live in .
I don &apos;t want it to threaten me with death should I choose to differ in opinion and practice , if that is the society it wishes to create , then I would rather not be party to it .
Palestine : documentary About Arafat &apos;s Death Prompts Questions
on 3 July , 2012 the news channel Al Jazeera broadcast a documentary that investigated the mysterious death of Palestinian president Yasser Arafat .
he died in Paris on 11 November , 2004 and the documentary alleges that rather than dying of natural causes , Arafat was poisoned with polonium .
both during and after the airing of the documentary , many Palestinian Twitter users tweeted their thoughts and reactions regarding the evidence presented in it .
the majority were not surprised by the allegations that Arafat was poisoned , something that has long been claimed by many .
however the allegation that polonium was used was a new detail . ‏

Twitter user This Is Gaza tweeted :
Al Jazeera reveals new facts about Arafat &apos;s death after a nine-month investigation found high levels of the poisonous element polonium in the belongings of &#91; late &#93; president Arafat .
and I commented :
everyone is now wondering what new information was given in the Al Jazeera documentary , when the whole nation knew he was poisoned .
Twitter user Majd responded :
Yasser Arafat &apos;s mausoleum .
Nour Abed did not hide her bad opinion of Al Jazeera and the media in general , but she did praise it for the documetary :
Diana Alzeer was looking forward to even more answers :
founder of Banned Militant Group in Pakistan Offers Aid to U.S.
after causing wide spread damage along the Atlantic Coast in United States , Super storm sandy is being labelled as the costliest storm ever .
with estimates running as high as $ 45 billion for reconstruction and rebuilding , the country prepares to cope with the losses .
at least 33 people have been reported dead and scores displaced across the East Coast .
amidst the furor , Hafiz Mohammad Saeed , the founder of banned militant organization Lashkar e Taiba ( LeT ) and head of Jaamat ud Dawa ( JuD ) offered a considerable amount of humanitarian aid to the US to bear losses .

pledging help of every kind , he said “ Jamaat-ud-Dawa is ready to send its volunteers , doctors , food , medicines and other relief items on humanitarian grounds if the US government allows us . ”
known as the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks , the JuD founder also carries a $ 10million US bounty on his head .
the American Embassy in Pakistani capital Islamabad however refused to accept help from Saeed .
using their Twitter account , the embassy made it clear that while they appreciate the gesture of Muslims to help , they clearly did not take his offer seriously .
@ usembislamabad ( US Embassy Islamabad ) : we respect the Islamic tradition of help to the needy , but we can ’ t take Hafiz Saeed ’ s offer seriously .
following the tweet , a spokesperson for JuD posted the following replies :
@ JuD _ Official ( Jamat ‘ ud ’ Da &apos;wah ) : @ usembislamabad Our offer was precisely due to the seriousness of the matter .
we hope Muslims in # US will keep the tradition alive .
Inshallah
@ JuD _ Official ( Jamat ‘ ud ’ Da &apos;wah ) @ usembislamabad Our Help offer is for the American people , we will engage Muslims in US to be at forefront to help their fellow countrymen .
@ JuD _ Official ( Jamat ‘ ud ’ Da &apos;wah ) : @ usembislamabad # USAID Rajiv Shah took us serious when he visited our relief camp in 2010 &amp; distributed relief goods there – # Hafiz Saeed
the US embassy went as far as calling Saeed a suspect for his involvement in Mumbai attacks and also labelling his organization JuD as a ‘ designated terrorist ’ organization .
@ usembislamabad ( US Embassy Islamabad ‏ ) : Saaed is wanted for suspected involvement in the Mumbai attacks , which killed 166 .
JuD is a UN &amp; US-designated terrorist org .
the Twitter account for JuD was once more ready with a response .
@ JuD _ Official ( Jamat ‘ ud ’ Da &apos;wah ) : @ usembislamabad US govt has conceded to the fact of inadmissible evidence against Hafiz Saeed .
UNSCR hearing is pending .
leaves nothing behind .
reactions over this offer remain mixed .
@ Rifaqat _ Mir ( Rifaqat A. Mir ) : in spite of the enmity the US poses to Hafiz Saeed he still has the generosity and benevolence to show compassion for his enemy
@ humayusuf ( Huma Yusuf ) : they say Muslims don &apos;t have a sense of humour , but Hafiz Saeed &apos;s offer to help # Sandy victims is HILARIOUS http : / / www.thenews.com.pk / Todays-News-13-18499-Hafiz-Saeed-offers-humanitarian-aid-to-US …
@ anDYRude ( Anirudh Malladi ) : just read that Hafiz Saeed , a dreaded terrorist , has offered “ Help in the form of food , doctors etc ” to victims of # HurricaneSandy .
LMAO !
@ nidak _ ( Nida Khan ) : entertaining exchange of trolling going on between Hafiz Saeedand the US embassy Islamabad . 1-1 , I &apos;d say .
# NextRound ?
@ anamzehra86 ( Anam Zehra ) : us Embassy &apos;s response to Hafiz Saeed &apos;s offer is their way of saying ” we take your religion seriously , you should too ”
Côte d &apos;Ivoire : blogger and Journalist Théophile Kouamouo Arrested with his Team since July 13th
on Tuesday July 13th , the blog of Le Nouveau Courrier , reported that they received an unexpected police visit after publishing that morning the first installment of an in-depth series that was to last the whole week on alleged corruption in the cocoa and coffee trade in Côte d &apos;Ivoire ( see original in French here ) .
&#91; ... &#93; the paper has published today , on the front page , an exclusive feature about the investigation on embezzlement in the coffee-cocoa trade titled : “ The black book of the coffee-cocoa trade , how the baron &apos;s have pillaged the planters ’ money .
the impact this report has had in the readership this morning has made public prosecutor Raymond Tchimou react .
under his orders and without a search warrant , criminal police officers have shown up at the Nouveau Courrier &apos;s offices with the goal , they said , to recover the source document used to write our article .
after searching all the computers in the editorial offices , they finally left with a laptop instead of the famous document .
following the unsuccessful search at Le Nouveau Courrier &apos;s offices , publisher Stéphane Guédé , managing editor Théophile Kouamouo and editor Saint Claver Oula were taken into police custody after refusing to reveal their sources .
the Nouveau Courrier is a new information daily that started publication in Côte d &apos;Ivoire less than two months ago , on May 25th , with the intention of offering a fresh and in-depth perspective on current affairs .
managing editor Théophile Kouamouo is one of the first and most popular bloggers in Francophone Africa and the recipient , alongside his wife Nadine Tchaptchet-Kouamouo who is also a journalist , he &apos;s also been a recipient of a Rising Voices grant for his project Abidjan BlogCamps around blog trainings in Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
he is French citizen of Cameroonian origin and a former correspondent of the French daily Le Monde who has been based in Abidjan for over a decade , and is a well-respected journalist as well as a regular journalism lecturer in Côte d &apos;Ivoire and elsewhere .
a self-described serial web entrepreneur , one of his most successful internet endeavors has been the Ivorian blogging platform Ivoire-Blog .
several bloggers and journalists have shown their support to Kouamouo and the rest of the Le Nouveau Courrier team through an online petition asking for their immediate release , as well as through Twitter and a Facebook group where they have shared updates about the case .
through that group we have learnt that the three journalists have been in police custody since Tuesday being , still pressured to reveal their sources , and that on Friday July 16th their case is to be heard by the judge .
it seems they have being transferred to the MACA ( Maison d &apos;Arrêt Centrale D &apos;Abidjan , Abidjan &apos;s Central Prison ) .
Ivorian blogger Manasse Dehe , the creator of the Facebook group , wrote today :
it &apos;s not about releasing them anymore , that &apos;s the problem .
it &apos;s about finding which fault they have committed , it &apos;s been already decided that they have to pay for something that they haven &apos;t done .
now the lawyers are fighting for what they &apos;re going to put on them , even the smallest infraction
ask the Président of the Republic to react on your wall !
because he &apos;s a man of justice , he can get the 3 journalists of Le Nouveau Courrier released of this suffering that they don &apos;t deserve ! ! !
Saint-Clavier Oula in his cell today
this is the last update from Le Nouveau Courrier &apos;s Facebook page :
Théophile Kouamouo , Saint-Clavier Oula , Stéphane Bahi are locked up in a cell that &apos;s packed .
waiting for their turn to see the judge .
Oula is very weak .
he started a hunger strike and is also refusing to take his medicine … .
since the news of their detention broke out on Tuesday , the journalists have been receiving numerous shows of support by colleagues and bloggers in Côte d &apos;Ivoire and abroad .
reporters Without Borders released a statement on Wednesday 14th saying that :
they had not seen such methods used by the authorities in Côte d ’ Ivoire for many years .
the theft charge does not stand up .
it should be borne in mind that protection of the confidentiality of sources is a fundamental principle of journalism , one that is particular appropriate for such a sensitive issue as corruption in the coffee and cocoa trade .
in the Facebook group some colleagues have pointed out that the first article in the official Code of Ethics for the Ivorian Journalist published by the Ministry of Communications ( see original in French here ) states the rights of journalists in Côte d &apos;Ivoire :
it also states the duties of the journalists , among them :
this morning the Ivorian newspaper association ( Gepci ) issued a statement condemning the arrest as an attack to freedom of expression in Côte d &apos;Ivoire :
the Ivorian citizen journalism portal Avenue225 , who has been following the affair since Tuesday , reported that the newspaper unions who have pledged to publish the rest of the investigative report on the coffee and cocoa business if they &apos;re not released today .

Iran : women Say No to the War Monster
woman = Man , Source : Khodnevis
the Iranian Islamic regime has ignored International Women &apos;s Day for more than three decades .
it does not recognize March 8 , and has even banned women organizations from celebrating the day .
but each year Iranian women both in the real and virtual world stil celebrate .
as international sanctions bite and tension over Iran &apos;s nuclear program rises , this year several activists have published videos on the women &apos;s rights website Change for Equality saying , “ I am against the war . ”
these activists say :
war is not just bombs and the destruction of our homes .
even before we embark on a war , it seems that the lives of women have already become more difficult .
war has focused its gaze on women and moves closer , step by step .
we do not want to become the silent victims of this monster .
on March 8 , 2012 while being denied the opportunity to celebrate the day or express our demands in the streets , we have taken this opportunity to say that we are opposed to war and each of these short films express our reasons for that opposition .
reality behind the war photos
no red alert for children
war leaves scars on women
war is a real monster , but unfortunately so is dictatorship and prison .
the Iranian blogger Jaarchi reminds us that 47 women are imprisoned in Iran for their social and political activities .
South Africa : ANC hosts debate on twitter for upcoming elections
there is a final push by political parties contesting the upcoming elections in South Africa .
in particular , the ruling party the ANC ( African National Congress ) held a debate via twitter today .
Interestingly , the political parties have begun to make use of Social Media and social networks to get their message across .
the most prominent party making use of these techniques has been the DA ( Democratic Alliance ) whose campaign seems to have been inspired by President Obama &apos;s election campaign last year .
the DA have been managing a presence on social networks and several twitter accounts such as that of the mayor of Cape town and head of the DA , Helen Zille .
however , today the ANC announced on a newly created twitter account “ ANC _ DEBATE ” that they would be hosting a live debate with questions fielded by Jessie Duarte , an anti apartheid activist and current spokesperson for the ANC .
after the announcement there was some debate on the usefulness of this .
a South African twitter user @ woganmay even created a special page on twittersa , to aggregate all the comments .
some reactions to the debate however were negative and the ANC took criticism .
for example , Jason felt that all of this was too late .
while Naeem felt that the amount of South African voters that are on twitter constitute a very small minority .
the ANC _ Debate account saw a flood of questions directed towards it , and some of the responses are summarized below .
@ Saulkza : let &apos;s talk economy : what are you going to do to stop a local recession ?
what about unemployment ?
@ ANC _ debate : a massive public investment in infrastructure will stimulate economic activity , increased public works , support to key sectors .
@ nikzaz : what will you do about crime in south africa ?
@ ANC _ debate : overhaul criminal justice system – better coordination , modernise systems , more resources .
organise communities and deal with causes .
@ shaynekrige : what in your opinion was the ANC &apos;s biggest mistake over the last 15 years ?
@ ANC _ debate : not so much a mistake , but not enough effort put into involving people in govt and in decisions about their lives .
this comment interesting , as it begs the question : are we going to see an overhaul of the current ANC , a new way of including people in government decisions ?
maybe government 2.0 ?
they also responded to comments and fears of censorship of the press
@ jasdonwar : what do you have to say against allegations that South Africa &apos;s media will be curtailed by the government after the election ?
@ ANC _ debate : that &apos;s a scare tactic .
ANC fought for media freedom and there &apos;s nothing to suggest we would undermine it .
on the issue of censorship of satirical cartoonists
@ JeremyTNel : do you believe that cartoonists are too irreverent ?
would the ANC like to regulate satire ?
@ ANC _ debate : cartoonists are supposed to be irreverent .
satire is important . but they should adhere to same code of ethics as any other journalist .
on questions of power and sustainability
@ flintza : again .
how do you plan to meet SA power needs while limiting our carbon footprint .
focus seems to be coal ( short sighted )
@ ANC _ debate : SA needs to move away from coal but likely to remain major source of energy for foreseeable future .
increasing investment in nuclear , solar and wind power .
on questions of Jacob Zuma the presidential candidate being in the dock for corruption charges
@ ANC _ debate : all are equal before the law and have a right to be presumed innocent .
ANC maintains law must take its course &amp; this applies to Zuma as much as anyone else .
on AIDS prevention strategy
@ ANC _ Debate : focus on prevention , encourage condom use and responsible behaviour .
expand ART to cover all who need it .
strengthen p / ships across society
@ irenebarnard : how will you keep the public informed about the status of your full HIV “ aggressive prevention campaign ” ?
@ ANC _ debate : people need to be involved in implementation through local health facilities , NGOs , govt izimbizo in addition to traditional media .
for further coverage of the debate , visit Capetownalive which also has a summary of some of the questions .
some users reported that they had been blocked or ignored however Jessie responded that no users had been blocked , they did however acknowledge that not all questions were answered .
there seems to be plans to make this Q &amp; A session a regular thing as it was announced that next week Friday another session will be held .
I responded on my blog , that even though this debate is coming at a very late stage and only engages with users on twitter , it is however a major step in the right direction for the ANC as it gives people direct access to the party .
if something similar could be rolled out nationwide allowing people with just a mobile phone to post questions and receive responses from party candidates this could prove very useful in engaging all South Africans .
Iran : radio Zamaneh , a “ radio for bloggers ”
radio Zamaneh ( Persian : رادیو زمانه ) is an Amsterdam-based Persian language radio .
“ Zamaneh ” is the Persian literary term for “ time ” .
radio Zamaneh ( RZ ) is an independent broadcasting organisation , registered as a non-profit organisation in the Netherlands , with headquarters and a studio in Amsterdam .
the coordinator of the radio is the Dutch NGO Press Now .
it launched about two years ago and calls itself a ‘ radio for bloggers &apos; .
Kamran Ashtary , blogger , photographer and Zamnaeh &apos;s director of Communication &amp; Development shares Zamaneh &apos;s challenges , hopes , achievements and Iranian citizen media .
RZ has called itself a radio for bloggers .
why such a slogan ?
how much influence have bloggers had at RZ ?
in Iran many journalists have turned to blogging to communicate since many newspapers are continually harassed and shut down .
most of Radio Zamaneh &apos;s contributors were , and still are , bloggers .
our director , Mehdi Jami , started blogging several years before joining Radio Zamaneh .
as Radio Zamaneh has based its media policy on Citizen Journalism , reaching out to bloggers is natural .
since August 2006 , when Radio Zamaneh started , we have actively promoted bloggers on our site and in our radio programs .
many were involved in the development of RZ .
radio Zamaneh in many ways is connected to bloggers and blogging .
just take a look at our extensive blogroll .
radio Zamaneh aims for two-way communication .
this is something that blogs are known for .
this is why our site is working like a set of blogs .
each regular contributor has their own page / blog and readers can comment on every page .
there are several news sites , outside of Iran , such as Deutsche Welle ( DW ) Perisan site , covering Iranian blogs .
is there a difference between RZ &apos;s approach toward blogging and theirs ?
we don &apos;t just cover bloggers , we are bloggers and our style is bloggish : friendly , informal , different , personalized , and diverse .
blogging is a part of our daily life .
we are talking on blogs and quoting blogs .
we see them as a source of information about how people think about politics and social issues .
we see Iranian youth culture as a culture promoted by blogs and we are working to make the informality of blogging a trend in media making .
radio Zamaneh is derived from and inspired by blogging .
that is very different from just covering blogs by other media outlets .
how have Iranian bloggers reacted to RZ ?
collaborating or criticizing ?
a search at Technorati , will show you that there are more than 30,000 links to the items we publish on our site .
in addition , Canada-based Iranian blogger , Arash Kamangir ‘ s Didish Report , which searches Iranian site feeds for links to other sites , consistently shows that we are at the top of the list for receiving links .
these show that many bloggers are interested in RZ and referring to us .
many of them work with us in different ways and some are critical too .
bloggers are not ignoring what we publish .
we welcome both collaboration and criticism .
in fact , one of our contributors thinks we could use more people poking fun at us .
we invite criticism of Radio Zamaneh and even sponsored a competition with a review of the site as its focus .
this competition helped us discover some of our current colleagues .
radio Zamaneh has a solid record of publishing differing opinions .
RZ has a list of bloggers in its first page .
some have criticized RZ for only listing “ politically correct ” blogs , and not ones that are against the Islamic Republic .
how do you answer them ?
the Berkman Center at Harvard University reports that more than 60,000 blogs in Iran are continually updated .
obviously , we cannot link to all of them .
radio Zamaneh does not promote bloggers based on their political views .
while we try to remain independent , we link to blogs with strong political points of view , including those that can be seen as * for * or * against * the regime .
we read many blogs and do not limit our list to a select group .
that said , Radio Zamaneh tries not to link to blogs with strong affiliations to political groups or extremists .
some news sites are afraid to give more voices to citizen media because they consider them as unreliable sources of information .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s hard to give up control .
fortunately , most of us have been bloggers ourselves , so we see both sides .
what we normally get from blogs are views , not news .
any news from blogs must be checked against other sources .
blogs may be a starting point for a news story , but we do not rely on them as a source .
at the same time , we try to do training and work with citizen journalists so that they can provide reliable information .
in fact , we are currently working on a special training site for citizen journalism which will be for our network and for registered users .
outside of Iran many Persian sites covering politics , such as DW or Gozarr , have blog sections .
inside Iran very , very few mainstream news sites have such a section .
why the difference ?
inside Iran , they want to have more control over what people read .
they just don &apos;t have the habit of presenting points of view that they cannot control .
to be fair , major Western news sources have been slow to embrace bloggers as well .
it &apos;s not normal for a news organization to link to competing sources of information .
what has been RZ &apos;s most important added value to Iranian media ?
RZ has proven that it is possible to present an independent take on Iran and the news .
it provides a voice for the unheard , and highlights marginalized groups in Iran : writers , Sunnis , women , bloggers , Armenians , Zoroastrians , and other ethnic and religious minorities .
radio Zamaneh republishes , highlights , and links to articles written on the web by domestic critics of Iranian politics , which are ignored by domestic media in Iran .
in addition we run programming that challenges the taboos of Iranian society such as relationships and sex .
sometimes , the challenge is with the official reading of politics and news ; sometimes it is with the dogmatic views held by many inside and outside Iran .
what are the most important challenges ?
if we want to stay on top of the game and hold on to our audience , we constantly need to stay in communication with them .
you have to have an open communication channel .
we need to encourage more reader and listener participation .
we need to keep our ears open .
we have to stay fresh and be our own harshest critic , and we have to work hard to remain fair and independent .
a lot of people would like us to take sides , whether it &apos;s against the government in Iran or for them , but we work hard to remain independent despite whatever personal beliefs we have .
the other major challenge for us is how to survive and make a sustainable media .
we believe that for a sustainable civil society in Iran we need sustainable democratic media in and for Iran .
how does RZ deal with filtering ?
it &apos;s a cat and mouse game .
we have to continually find new holes to hide in .
we have changed our domain name 5 times !
we send our newsletters every day to many people who want to read RZ and have no direct access .
but we cannot say that we can evade filtering .
many pages are blocked .
despite that , more than 60 % of our readers are from Iran .
sometimes a piece gets published from provincial or local bloggers .
are there any sharp differences between what Tehran-based bloggers write and provincial ones ?
in many ways those who live outside the capital feel isolated and ignored .
for many , Iran means Tehran .
Tehran is very important , but we do not ignore cities in Kurdistan , Khorasan , Azarbayjan , Khuzistan , Fars , and the rest of the country .
we try to see them all and give them voice and confidence and support .
we have a program designed to find good provincial blogs and promote them by quoting from them and talking to them .
we always welcome contributions from provincial areas even though we cannot spend as much time covering them as we do major cities .

Uganda : bloggers discuss anti-gay bill
the Ugandan anti gay bill has been tabled in parliament and now it awaits the president Yoweri Museveni to sign and make homosexuality officially illegal .
the previous code was not clear but now the bill called “ The anti homosexuality Bill 2009 ” tabled by a member of parliament David Bahati which states that any homosexuality act or tendencies might face the death penalty or face life imprisonment .
the Ugandan writes :
the multiple laws that I will be breaking as soon as the president signs this law .
well , our detractors had already said that we would be stiffed with a tougher law , but this goes way beyond that .
if I attempt to commit the offense … ( god , the number of times that I have made passes and they have been rejected !
) Each of those times was worth 7 years in jail .
before , we could be liable to life imprisonment .
gug hereby declares that , when the President of the Republic signs this law , gug will be liable to the death penalty … because I and my lover are serial offenders , breaking this law .
the bill further prohibits adoption by gay couples ; any person who aids , promotes counsels any acts of homosexuality in any way will face up to seven years imprisonment , or risk a fine of sh100m .
it states the ill effects of homosexuality as :
research indicates that the homosexuality has a variety of negative consequences including higher incidences of violence , sexually transmitted diseases , and use of drugs .
the higher incidence of separation and break-up in homosexual relationships also creates a highly unstable environment for children raised by homosexuals through adoption or otherwise , and can have profound psychological consequences on those children .
in addition , the promotion of homosexual behavior undermines our traditional family values .
given Uganda ’ s historical , legal , cultural and religious values which maintain that the family , based on marriage between a man and a woman is the basic unit of society .
this Bill aims at strengthening the nation ’ s capacity to deal with emerging internal and external threats to the traditional heterosexual family .
these threats include : redefining human rights to elevate homosexual and transgender behavior as legally protected categories of people .
there is also need to protect our children and youths who are made vulnerable to sexual abuse and deviation as a result of cultural changes , uncensored information technologies , parentless child developmental settings and increasing attempts by homosexuals to raise children in homosexual relationships through adoption , foster care , or otherwise .
producers , publishers and distributors of material containing homosexuality especially if a business , an NGO will have its certificate or registration canceled and the director will face seven years in prison .
that includes gay blogs in Uganda :
poor sympathizers .
you are not left to love us .
no , all lovers of gays , and gays in Uganda will suffer , and be punished by this law .
any press conferences ?
not by gay Ugandans .
you see , we are a pariah people that will never be like all other Ugandans .
ha ha ha ha ha !
oh , the gayuganda blog is one of the things which are illegal , as per that bill .
I am furiously promoting homosexuality on this blog , complaining about a law like this .
so , 5 years in prison , and my ( non existent ) bank balance will be set back by 100M Uganda shillings … !
and the people who dare to give us condoms and lubricant for sex … Or , if you dare to have an HIV prevention program for homosexuals in Uganda … or even try to teach safer sex .
well , the penalties are stiff .
very stiff .
jail , and jail and other things .
here are the objective of the bill .
the objectives of the Bill are :
( a ) To protect marriage as that only between a man and a woman in Uganda ;
( b ) To prohibit homosexual behavior and related practices in Uganda as they constitute a threat to the traditional family ;
( C ) To safeguard the health of Ugandan citizens from the negative effects of homosexuality and related practices ;
( d ) To establish progressive legislation protective of the traditional family that can serve as a model for other countries ;
( e ) To prohibit ratification of any international treaties , conventions , protocols and declarations which are contrary or inconsistent with the provisions of this Act ;
( f ) To ensure that no international instruments to which Uganda is already a party can be interpreted or applied in Uganda in a way that was never intended at the time the document was created ;
gay Ugandan is urging you to take this cause with him and asks you if he deserves to die because of this :
if you are outside the country , why , that is very good .
your congregation can be made aware of all the good things that some Christians in Uganda wish some sinners called gay Ugandans .
I am sure your outrage will help .
a letter , a protest match , questions to leaders of Uganda , religious and otherwise traveling outside the country .
this is a moral question , how can they justify killing me because I am gay , living in a gay relationship with another gay man ?
# Ok , what of gay people in other countries .
you are our friends .
yes , we dare to ask our gay brothers and sisters for help , especially when our countrymates believe we should be patriotic enough to ‘ die ’ in the name of their moral uprightness , for god and country .
tell your local gay group about it .
organise protests , big and small .
educate any who doesnt know about it .
write letters of protest .
be courteous , ( the framer of the bill says that we homosexuals want to kill him .
he says we have already written him ‘ threatening ’ letters .
AfroGay another Ugandan blogger compares the Ugandan to the government to the Nazis , he says the time to flag down the bill is now :
again , as I have argued here and elsewhere , we are best advised to keep our powder dry for the real battle if the bill is ever passed and signed into law .
so , I for one don &apos;t plan on saying too much about the nuts and bolts of what is wrong with it .
and the reason is simple : if we point out what is wrong with it now , our detractors will use what we say to clean up the bill .
best then to shout foul as loud as we can on the discriminatory elements of the bill without guiding them around the glaring technical , legal , constitutional and human rights minefield they are sleep-walking towards with this bill .
a Nigerian blogger Anengiyefa thinks the bill is flawed and the panel who made the bill are ignorant about homosexuality , He says homosexuality cannot be an offense , you cannot punish someone for having sexual feelings for another person :
Mr Bahati goes on to demand the death penalty for what he calls “ aggravated homosexuality ” .
I read this and I wondered if the said Mr Bahati has ever had the opportunity to sit inside a classroom in his life , given that unless he is starkly illiterate , he ought to know that there are no law books in any Common Law jurisdiction , ( including Uganda ) , that refer to an offense known as ‘ homosexuality &apos; .
homosexuality cannot be an offense !
you cannot make it an offense and punish a person for having feelings of sexual and emotional attraction towards others of the same gender .
you cannot prove ‘ homosexuality ’ in a court of law to the standard of proof that is required in a criminal court .
Anengiyefa sees that Uganda has just seen hypocrisy of MPs who have unified and are ready to pass a law victimizing homosexuality in the name of morality : this beats the purpose why the system is so anxious to criminalize consensual sex amongst two adults of the same gender and omitting important issues like ethnic violence , tribalism , AIDS , child rape etc :
this outbreak of frenzied homophobia is the epitome of the hypocrisy that pervades political life in Africa .
this bill is deemed necessary according to the MP David Bahati who introduced it .
he claims that the purpose of the bill is to protect children and the “ traditional family ” .
Bahrain : ‘ Boycott the Olympics ’
this post is part of our special coverage London 2012 Olympics and Bahrain Protests 2011 / 12 .
the son of the King of Bahrain , Prince Nasser Bin Hamad Al Khalifa is the front man of Bahrain &apos;s sports ; not democratically chosen but appointed like the rest of his family , who are in power .
the young man gained fame after the February 14 uprising last year , when he allegedly personally tortured many Bahraini athletes , who joined the ranks of protesters at massive demonstrations , demanding political change in the country .
Nasser used Twitter during the uprising , tweeting under his real name , threatening to extract revenge from those who are anti-regime .
when campaigns started to call for his elimination from the London Olympics , he deleted his tweets .
all tweets deleted last month when the prince was afraid to be banned from London for torture allegations .
last November , ESPN created a big fuss by revisiting the issue of Bahrain &apos;s detained and tortured athletes .
in the video , the athletes speak of losing their spots in their teams , being detained , severely humiliated as traitors , having their Shia beliefs insulted , and personally tortured by the Prince .
arrest the torturer
at the opening ceremony of the Olympics , an activist &#91; note : identity anonymous for safety reasons &#93; tweeted this picture of Nasser Bin Hamad with the Foreign minister of Bahrain :
anonymous : the guy front right with the red tie .
VIP at the # Olympics .
of athletes .
Prince Nasser of # Bahrain .
Bahrainu Citizen commented :
@ Bahrainycitizen : Nasser Bin Hamad was personally involved in torture of detainees and today is allowed to attend the opening ceremony # Olympics
tweep Kenneth Lipp noted :
@ kennethlipp : I hear the Bahrain royal family is attendant at the Olympics . any civilized nation would have them immediately arrested .
Iraqi activist Khalid Ibrahim tweeted :
@ khalidibrahim12 : no doubt to invite a torturer fr # Bahrain by the gov of # Uk is against all the ethics and principles on which the # Olympics has been set up .
in return , Bahraini human rights activist Maryam Alkhawaja ( daughter of imprisoned opposition figure Abdulhadi Alkhawaja ) called for boycotting the Olympics :
@ MARYAMALKHAWAJA : RT if u agree : I &apos;m boycotting # olympics2012 bcz despite being given evidence , # UK n # Olympics allowed alleged torturer of # Bahrain to attend
the athletes don &apos;t represent us
only three of Bahrain Olympic athletes are born to Bahraini parents .
image by @ Ali _ Milanello on Twitter .
another reason for calls to boycott the Olympics are the number of naturalized athletes in the squad .
during the opening ceremony , many Bahrainis tweeted those athletes have been naturalized and have no relationship to Bahrain whatsoever except holding the nationality to represent the country in games and get paid for it .
this issue is controversial in Bahrain considering how those athletes come to replace “ unwanted ” Bahraini athletes and because of ‘ political naturalization ’ that has been long practiced by the government to expand its base of supporters and to employ them in security forces .
in a comment , Bahraini Ala &apos;a Al Shehabi tweeted :
@ alaashehabi : no joy as we watch the # Bahrain # Olympics team with one token Bahraini ( rest naturalized ) -our heart sinks for over 20 imprisoned athletes
with sarcasm , Bahraini blogger Amira Al-Hussaini wrote :
@ JustAmira : almost all our # Bahrain # Olympics team was born in Ethiopia and Kenya .
didn &apos;t realise we had such a large Bahraini community there !
she also added :
@ JustAmira : would be great for # Bahrain if there was a competition in # teargassing at the # Olympics
similarly , pro-regime Twitter user @ ATEEKSTER wrote to criticize anti-regime protesters :
@ ATEEKSTER : too the bad Olympics doesn &apos;t have a sport for “ Molotov throwing ” , we could have won the golden medal in that .
Tala responded to him saying :
@ Taltool11 : what about the game of using live bullets to see if you die when I shoot you

Ecuador : government Suspends Television Channel Teleamazonas
on December 22 , the Ecuadorian television channel Teleamazonas was taken off the air by the Superintendent of Telecommunications , under a provisional suspension of 72 hours .
Teleamazonas is a channel that has been characterized as one that does not follow the official governmental line .
during those 3 years , it has maintained strong discrepancies with President Rafael Correa &apos;s regime , which has called many times for the closing of the television channel .
the Superintendent of Telecommunications justified the channel &apos;s closing because of the events of May 22 , 2009 , when it spread news based on assumptions regarding the exploitation of gas on the Puná Island that will affect the residents of the island , who make a living in the fishing industry .
according to the Superintendent , upon spreading the news , Teleamazonas violated Article 18 , Number 1 of the current Constitution that establishes the right of all persons to “ look for , receive , exchange , produce and spread true , verified , timely , diverse , uncensored facts , events , and general interest processes is and with ulterior responsibility . ”
soon after , there were voices of protest from different sectors in Ecuador , which are also planning marches and protests against the measure .
for many , it is an attack on freedom of expression .
this recent event is also relevant just as the members of the National Congress are debating the new Communications Law , which was made known after dissolving a previous agreement between assembly members from the governmental party and opposition .
there are also online opinions for and against the government measure .
for many , the closing of the television channel is a clear attack on free press and it also becomes an intimidating act .
for Xica of the blog La Alharaca :
for as much as the Ecuadorian government has decided to take Teleamazonas off the air for only 3 days , it is enough to send a strong message to other media and to the members of the assembly : we can close a media channel and we do not need a media law to do so .
the editorial line of Teleamazonas , which is against the government , also has its detractors , and many news anchorman Jorge Ortiz as its visible head , which always makes biting comments against the government .
in addition , the fact that the channel is own by banker Fidel Egas also places public speculation about impartiality and information bias .
in regards to this , Eduardo Varas of the blog Más Libros , Autores y Otros Riesgos writes :
to applaud that it is the Executive branch that calls to prohibit opinions or define what or what is not a profession is a cruel act that confuses everything and it is not important to them .
all of us should have the freedom to say what we want , if we are a media outlet with all of the money in the world and with an owner who thinks of himself as the conveyor of truth , or a president who also thinks of himself as the owner of the truth , or an idiot like me , or idiots that celebrate the closing of media channels as fair maneuvers .
all of us .
the suspension is already finalized and it yet to see if this will affect the new Communication Law that is currently being debate in the National Congress .

coup in Niger : bloggers sigh in relief at the ousting of President Tandja
a mural of Mamadou Tandja hanging in the office of President ( Photo by Jacob Silberberg for Panos Pictures )
on Thursday , February 18th a coup took place in Niger in which President Mamadou Tandja was captured after a gun battle in the capital , Niamey , led by led by Col. Abdoulaye Adamou Harouna ( who was was the former aide-de-camp of Niger &apos;s previous coup leader Maj. Daouda Mallam Wanke ) .
in a quite unpoplar move , a few months ago Tandja illegally changed the constitution to allow him a third term in what was generally considered a mass fraud referendum ( see Jen Brea &apos;s roundup on the reactions caused by that decision ) .
for a few hours , confusion reigned about what was going on .
Raffaella Toticchi in Niamey wrote on Thursday afternoon &#91; Es &#93; :
gunshots have been heard and some people have been wounded and taken to the nearest hospital , but for the time being we don &apos;t know much more than that .
in a televised announcement , spokesman for the plotters Abdoul Karim Goukouyé said Niger &apos;s constitution had been suspended and all state institutions dissolved .
Instantanés du Niger , the blog of a French expat in Niamey , reported that the the national TV station ORTN broadcasted military music for most of the evening leading up to the announcement .
she also reported that the rest of the evening and the following day were calm .
blogger Texas in Africa gives some background on the reasons for the coup :
first , about 7.8 million ( 3 / 5 ) of Niger &apos;s citizens experience severe or moderate food insecurity .
second , and more importantly , President Tandja had angered many Nigeriens in 2009 when he dissolved parliament and enacted constitutional reforms that gave him broad powers with few checks or balances .
Tandja was constitutionally required to step down from office in December , as that was the end of his second five-year term in office , but the changes he made to the constitution allowed him to stay in office for three more years .
these moves were extremely unpopular ; 10,000 protesters came out on Sunday to dispute Tandja &apos;s actions .
clearly , this coup is the result of the ongoing political crisis .
as put by Nigerien commenter Ali Dan-Bouzoua in a discussion list about internet in Niger , unfortuntely there hasn &apos;t been much citizen media covering the event :
very few blogs or tweets , photos … on the situation in Niger .
we consume online &#91; content &#93; but we produce none .
Guineans are very active and present online .
however , Nigeriens have expressed themselves through comments left on news sites such as tamtaminfo.com seemed to approve of the ousting of President Tandja albeit with some reservations for the transitional government :
Ousman Diallo Yacoubou :
to the military of our dear country , the whole Nigerien people salute you , you have proved that you are the true guards of the people and democracy .
but until now there is one thing that we don &apos;t know : the length of your transition .
Sabitou Oumarou :
it &apos;s a shame that democrats like us are applauding a coup d &apos;Etat .
but we have to realize that there are two ways of fighting : one with reason and one with force .
the first one is unique to human beings , the second one we have in common with animals .
but when the first one shows its limitations , it is necessary to reach to the second one to restore order and respect for the law .
Likewise , a few African bloggers and tweeterers have reacted to the coup , mostly expressing relief or celebrating Tandja &apos;s removal due to the illegal constitutional changes he approved last year .
like Ato Kwamena Dadzie from Ghana , who echoed a common sentiment :
Awada Ehemir from Chad thinks the reactions to the coup are hypocritical :
coup d &apos;État in Niger … It is inmediately condemned , but next month it will be accepted by everybody .
a classic in Africa …
and the African Union who pretends to condemn it !
at the next meeting , they will roll out the red carpet for their new “ friends ” !
Tony Cassius Bolamba from the DRC shows some understanding for the coup plotters in his blog :
if I have to lean on the side of reason , I condemn all coups and constitutional tampering in Africa , but I &apos;m obliged to feel some understanding for coup leaders .
was Pascal right ?
“ Not being able to justify justice , we justify force ” .
men reap what they sow and they need to sense when to leave things alone before things leave them .
hoping that this new coup de force in Niger will benefit the real power holder : the people !
in a similar vein , the blog Guinée 50 hopes for the coup to restore democracy in Niger :
neither him ( Tandja ) nor the junta who overthrew him are enjoying a cover of consitutional legality .
therefore , there is no way that we African citizens can judge the way we felt relieved .
it isn &apos;t any better to applaud blindly these junta .
but to demand their neutrality in the prompt restauration of democracy .
we are optimistic for what will come next since , when things keep going wrong , then everything will go well in the sense wished by our peoples , who are the only holders of power .
at the citizen media portal Sahara Reporters , many commenters from Nigeria drew parallels between the situation in Niger and the one in their own country .
here are two samples :
OHYN :
this is what happens when civilian and civil institutions are too weak , too cowardly , too much “ talk-talk-only , ” to defend their own freedom from usurping so-called leaders .
this describes Nigeria perfectly : so , Nigeria is next in the coup movement : it is only logical and ripe .
Toyin Ade :
there is no difference b / w what has happened in Niger &amp; Nigeria b / c in Nigeria , we have souless , wicked &amp; unpatriotic cabals holding us to ransom as Tanja did in Niger .
if there should be any coup at all in Nigeria , it should be targetted at those useless clowns calling themselves Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s kitchen / toilet cabinet that have arrogated to themselves what they don &apos;t have .
Daniel Hongramngaye from Chad , also draws a parallel between Niger and his own country at the blog Makaïla :
what is happening under our eyes in neighboring Niger , in many respects ought to inspire our officers , our military , our worthy soldiers if there are still any left .
the political situation in Chad is more execrable than the Niger &apos;s .
indeed , Idriss Deby Itno is identical to Mamadou Tandja if not worse .
Brazil : “ Do It Yourself ” Clean Elections
&#91; this post was originally published on Ushahidi &apos;s blog .
Ushahidi is an open-source mapping tool that was developed in Kenya at a time of crisis in 2008 and has since been used for crowdsourcing worldwide .
school children being told to chant candidates ’ names by their teachers .
civil servants getting sacked for not campaigning for their political bosses .
Zinc roofing being traded for votes .
the public wholesaling of voters ’ personal data to campaigners .
death threats to those who denounce electoral crimes .
welcome to the unpleasant side of Brazilian electioneering .
these are just some of the reports coming from Eleitor 2010 , a “ crowdsourcing ” project aiming to facilitate citizen reports of abuses of the electoral process in Brazil .
in the largest democracy in Latin America – with over 120 million voters – this year , voters go to the polls they will be choosing the successor of one of the country &apos;s most popular Presidents in history ( Luiz Inácio “ Lula ” da Silva ) but also voting on governors , a large portion of Congress .
every country has its own unique political culture and oddities .
even the most minimal democracy has its own rules around electioneering , the mechanics of the vote , and ensuring that the state regulates the electoral process .
Brazil was one of the first democracies of its size to use electronic voting machines .
it also has compulsory voting .
but other aspects of its electoral process are unique , including attempts to strictly regulate of online campaigning , vote buying and what are called “ showmícios ” ( concert-rallies ) .
Brazil has very clear and comprehensive laws regulating elections but the problem is enforcing these laws .
there is a real culture of politicians subverting the law , maintaining a privileged position as patrons of voters in Brazil .
this stems from a distant colonial past and continued persistent inequality , where entrenched elite interests have maintained themselves .
the idea behind Eleitor 2010 , which is a purely volunteer , non-partisan project run by a virtual team with zero funding , is to engage the voter beyond the day of the election .
according to Paula Góes and Diego Casaes , its creators – who met via Twitter and now collaborate on Global Voices Online , the project is to promote critical and active citizenship , that challenges some of the arcane and undemocratic practices mentioned above .
Eleitor 2010 runs on the open source software Ushahidi , a web-based platform which received much attention for its utility in mapping incidents after the Haiti earthquake , driven by SMS reports from the ground .
Ushahidi has yet to reach its full potential as an election monitoring platform , say Góes and Casaes .
with an estimated 25 % of the country online every day , and one of the highest mobile subscriber rates in Latin America , they hope Brazil could be the place where it comes of age this year .
four weeks away from the election , Eleitor 2010 already has 230 + reports , from every state in the country , and from the most remote areas .
however , it is an uphill battle to get the message out about the platform , in a country where broadcast and print media are still strong , held in the hands of a privileged elite bent on defending its interests .
despite this , the communications team at Eleitor 2010 has generated some media attention , and networking with other online transparency initiatives has been crucial .
Google recently featured Eleitor 2010 on its page dedicated to the Brazilian elections .
Góes and Casaes hope that with their awareness campaign – on social networks including Orkut with over 40 million users , partnerships with networks of internet cafés , NGOs , and social movements – Eleitor 2010 will break through and change the way thousands of voters engage in the electoral process .
through the plaftorm , some entertaining anecdotes have already come to light , well in advance of the October 3 vote .
voters caught one man in a small town in the interior selling off Twitter accounts with 40,000 + followers for the sickeningly low price of US $ 125 . this is illegal under Brazilian electoral law .
when confronted , the man in question gave more incriminating evidence and then threatened to sue Eleitor 2010 .
the evidence , including screenshots and transcript of a chat with him , were delivered to the Electoral Courts .
another comic report from São Paulo , where teachers at a school illegally encouraged children to chant for two candidates , one for mayor and one for President , and it backfired with children instinctively chanting “ Lula ! ” “ Lula ! ” The video circulated widely , and has had over 70,000 views .
another video that raised eyebrows was one by blogger Ricardo Gama of a VW bus owned by the City Hall being used for a campaign in Rio de Janeiro .
the blogger shouts “ Are you carrying electoral propaganda in the car of the City Hall ?
this is an electoral crime !
I filmed it .
I am going to denounce you . ”
from the north of Brazil , in the state of Maranhão , word reached Eleitor 2010 that a network of evangelical churches was offering to “ trade ” 3,000 votes for “ support ” after the election .
in the state of São Paulo , one Bishop implored the faithful not to support President Lula ’ s chosen successor , Dilma Roussef .
these examples indicate how this platform and online , participatory tools will be of use in years to come . no matter whether it goes “ viral ” and becomes a household name , Eleitor 2010 and other transparency initiatives have already become game-changers this election year .
Ethiopia : land , History and Justice in Gambella
the Global Development blog of The Guardian &apos;s ( UK ) continues its coverage of land deals after the release of the largest public database on international land deals in April .
one of the countries covered in the report is Ethiopia where villagers in Gambella province are forced to settle in state-designated villages to pave the way for land grabbers .
Gambella is the poorest region in Ethiopia .
the Reporter , a local biweekly English newspaper , reports that the Ethiopian government has started evaluating the performance of investors who acquired large tracts of land to undertake commercial farm projects .
though this can be taken as an important milestone for anti-land grabbing activists , Ethiopia ’ s government decision to evaluate the performance of investors who acquired land has received a scant attention from international mainstream media .
extracts from Fred Pearce &apos;s new book , The Land Grabbers : Africa &apos;s hidden revolution , show that land grabbing has more impact on the world &apos;s poor than climate change .
in an interview , Fred Pearce notes that poor people were being moved off the land with little regard for their historical and cultural rights .
target countries of land deals from the Land Matrix Project
however , an Ethiopian government official counters this argument :
he &#91; an official from Ministry of Agriculture &#93; downplayed criticisms that the land leasing has ‘ brought negative impacts on the communities who live close to the farms ’ , claiming that ‘ due emphasis has been given to make these investments free of adverse effect on the society who dwell close to them and this would continue in strengthened manner ’ .
land activists have created an online petition and are campaigning using Facebook and Twitter .
a petition targeting top USA and UK diplomats reads :
I am extremely concerned about reports of deliberate , persistent , and serious abuses of the rights of Indigenous Peoples in southwestern Ethiopia .
the government ’ s program of “ villagization ” is forcibly removing at least 200,000 Indigenous people from their ancestral lands in the Gambella region and relocating them in new state-built villages .
although the government promises them better access to jobs , education , and health care in these villages , Human Rights Watch researchers found little or no evidence of these services .
on the contrary , displaced people fear starvation since they no longer have access to their farms , forests , and rivers .
those who raise their voices against these abuses are frequently jailed , tortured , raped , and otherwise intimidated by government security forces .
those who try to return to their ancestral lands find that the government has already leased their lands to foreign investors who are hurriedly bulldozing forests , farms , and wetlands in order to grow commercial crops of agro fuels , tea , spices , rice , and sugar cane , mostly for export .
the resulting environmental devastation and degradation will further undermine food security for Indigenous Peoples .
a Facebook group called Stop Land Grabbing in Gambella , Ethiopia reads :
a space for the international community to voice its concerns over the human rights abuses and environmental destruction the land grabbing happening in the Gambella region of Ethiopia is causing
land grabbing is the contentious issue of large-scale land acquisitions ; the buying or leasing of large pieces of land in developing countries by domestic and transnational companies , governments , and individuals
USA : honoring Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .
Martin Luther King , Jr. was born on January 15 , 1929 and became arguably the American Civil Rights Movement &apos;s most prominent advocate and speaker .
in the United States , he is honored by a national holiday , observed the third Monday in January of each year .
today , many bloggers in the United States are honoring his memory with dedicated posts , linking his legacy of social justice with issues of today , demonstrating that 42 years after King &apos;s assassination , his words are just as relevant .
the Color Line is a blog focused on the sociology of race , ethnicity , and immigration in the United States .
blogger C.N.
asks how close we are to fulfilling Martin Luther King Jr . &apos; s dream :
many Americans thought that Barack Obama ’ s election was the culmination of Dr. King ’ s dream and concrete proof that we have evolved into a “ post-racial , ” colorblind society .
unfortunately , as I and many other sociologists and commentators have argued , even in this past year , we have seen numerous incidents that illustrate just how prevalent racial distinctions and racism still are in American society .
following the discussion of numerous examples of racial issues in the United States , the blogger concludes :
ultimately , the best way for us to work toward achieving the ultimate colorblind ideal is to recognize , accept , and understand that racial distinctions still matter and that they are still the basis for continuing discrimination and inequality in American society today .
only by doing so will we move forward on achieving Dr. King ’ s final ideal — true racial equality .
Global Voices ’ own Lova Rakotomalala , who is from Madagascar but resides in the United States , wrote a post entitled “ Lesson from Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. to Madagascar , ” in which he said ( in reference to the events in Madagascar last year ) :
leadership matters .
real leaders give speeches and then walk the talk , in front of the line .
leaders do not vanish in a sheltered place when they know things are about to get dangerous and let protesters walk in harm &apos;s way to serve their agenda .
the only thing we know for sure about what really happened in Madagascar a year ago is that we could have used a Dr. King back then .
US-based blog Immigration Impact drew parallels between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and immigration today , writing :
now , more than ever , it ’ s important to remember Dr. King ’ s message that all men are created equal — not just for Hispanics and African Americans , but for all people who come to this country in search of the American Dream .
the blogger behind Preventing Homelessness reminds us that honoring Martin Luther King , Jr. means service :
today is Martin Luther King Jr . day . a day for all of us to work to improve lives , bridge social barriers , and move our nation closer to the “ Beloved Community ” that Dr. King envisioned .
today is a day of service , but we don &apos;t have to stop there .
we can resolve to make this a year of service and make a real difference in our community !
and last but not least , the anti-racist blog Racism Review leaves us with a thought about heeding King &apos;s lessons :
this Martin Luther King , Jr . day , I hope and pray we will learn the lessons Dr. King taught us .
regardless of what the majority of people say , progressive American rhetoric remains miles ahead of its deeds ( see King ’ s brilliant sermon “ Paul ’ s Letter to American Christians ” ) and gradualism is not the answer .
only collective action , creative and sustained civil disobedience , and mobilization of people of color and poor – for whom cooptation and / or cessation are not viable options — are the only potential means for achieving and sustaining real and systemic change .
USA : interracial couple denied marriage license
last week , in Hammond , Louisiana , Beth Humphrey ( who is white ) and Terence McKay ( who is black ) applied for a marriage license and were refused on the basis of their races .
the justice of the peace , Keith Bardwell , claimed that in his experience , “ interracial marriages do not last long ” and stated that he was “ doing it for the children . ”
“ Jim Crow laws ” which required separate facilities for black and white Americans ended in 1965 , and anti-miscegenation laws that forbade interracial marriage or sex ended in all states by 1967 .
but racism still exists .
although much of the time it lies beneath the surface , occasionally racism rears its ugly head in a way that is impossible to miss ; this story made headlines across the United States , prompting blog posts from the local community and beyond .
in response to Bardwell &apos;s “ defense ” that he marries black couples all the time , the anti-racist blog Stuff White People Do expressed outrage , saying :
well , how thoroughly magnanimous of you , Justice Bardwell .
not to mention , intrusively paternalistic .
speaking of Bardwell &apos;s house , which I &apos;m sure is just overrun with joyous hordes of black and white children carousing together , he also had this to say :
I have piles and piles of black friends .
they come to my home , I marry them , they use my bathroom .
I treat them just like everyone else .
Ah yes , black friends too , piles of them .
right there , in his bathroom !
a commenter on the blog , Siditty ( who also wrote her own post here ) , touched on the irony of Bardwell &apos;s anger :
I always wonder about a man who comes from Louisiana , who has a strong history of race mixing , through the system of placage as well as creole culture , is now all the sudden concerned about the children .
they weren &apos;t concerned in the 1700s , he shouldn &apos;t be now .
the blog Racism Review countered Bardwell &apos;s “ concern for the children ” with evidence on children of interracial relationships :
and , to further review the evidence , children of interracial marriages do not suffer in when compared to other children provided that they grow up in an environment that ’ s accepting of diversity and children of interracial marriages .
if children of interracial marriages encounter racism ( and other structural disadvantages ) , then they ’ re more likely to experience stress , and health-related risks due to that increased stress , such as smoking and drinking .
that ’ s a result of racism , and yet another reason to work to end racism .
it should not be used – turning logic on its head – as a reason to perpetuate racism .
and Black Girl in Maine touched on the “ what about the kids ? ” question as well , noting the experiences of her own biracial son :
as for the kids , what about the kids ?
yes , biracial kids sometimes catch flack from others but not always and I think among the youth today its almost considered cool to be biracial .
as a buddy mentioned to me my son most certainly doesn ’ t suffer from a lack of friends male or female .
I think the only time biracial kids have real issues is when they have no one to talk to them about their roots .
I think when kids are connected to their historical roots as well as community , it creates a safe space for them .
in the United States , anti-miscegenation laws in many states banned the marriage of white Americans to black Americans ( and Americans of some other ethnicities ) in a number of states .
while in some states , these laws were repealed as early as 1780 , in sixteen states the laws were not repealed until a 1967 case , Loving vs. Virginia , in which an interracial couple who had married in Washington , D.C. were arrested in their own bedroom .
their legal battle made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , at which point the laws were overturned .
a number of bloggers touched on the legal aspects of the case .
one blogger , Jay Says , writes :
as a Justice of the Peace , he should be aware that interracial marriage is not illegal anymore – having been deemed unconstitutional 40 years ago .
this particular instance hits home after this weekends National Equality March wherein I briefly interviewed an straight , interracial couple , the Newmans ( pictured ) about why they are marching .
racism , classism , sexism , homophobia , religious intolerance and other biases can and do exist in our society , but they must not exist under the law .
to allow an employee of the government who is paid by the taxes of the “ free ” people of the United States ( or in this case , a state in the United States ) to use his / her own personal beliefs to decide matters governed by civil law is abhorrent .
if he doesn ’ t agree with interracial marriage , he needs to find a new job – perhaps Grand Master of the Ku Klux Klan ?
finally , one blogger has taken the opportunity to turn this incident into a moment of learning .
the blogger , whose blog is called What Do I Know ? , begs readers to think about their own feelings on the subject :
if you doubt that racism still lives inside us all , consider your reaction to the idea of marrying outside your race , particularly if you are white and the other race is black .
Yeah , it &apos;s ok for other people , but wouldn &apos;t you find some good , rational reasons why your daughter would be making her life far more difficult when she brings home her black fiance ?
be honest .
even if you said , “ No problem ” didn &apos;t you hesitate just a little ?
if you didn &apos;t you &apos;re unusual .
with Bardwell now saying that he won &apos;t resign over the matter , one thing is certain : there is surely more news to come .
opposition NPP Takes Ghana Presidential Election Results to Court
the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , the strongest opposition party in Ghana has challenged the recent Presidential election results , claiming electoral fraud .
refusing to accept the results declared by the electoral commission , the NPP has decided to take the matter to the courts .
according to Ghana Decides :
the largest opposition party in Ghana , the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) has challenged the results of the 2012 Presidential election , accusing the Electoral Commission of Ghana of colluding with the incumbent , National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) to steal votes .
the Chairman of the Electoral Commission , Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan , has denied the allegations saying the the NPP can challenge the results in Ghana ’ s courts according to the electoral laws of the country .
the Chairman of the Electoral Commission , Dr. Kwadwo Afari Gyan , declared President Mahama winner by 50.70 % of the votes , beating his main challenger Nana Akufo-Addo of the NPP who polled 47.7 % of the votes .
NPP &apos;s projected the results online .
photo source : Nana Ado ( NPP &apos;s presidential candidate ) Facebook page .
NPP &apos;s projection on their Facebook page showed that they have won the elections according to the results they received from their polling agents .
Ghana Decides reports :
the NPP maintains that results on the “ blue sheet ” , which they received at polling stations and collation centres across the country , where slightly change to favour Candidate Mahama of the NDC .
party gurus of the NPP have been holding a crunch meeting over the matter whether to consider a court action .
Ghana Decides reports :
following this , the NPP has resolved to take the issue to court and has vowed to use all available legal means to seek justice .
meanwhile , numerous supporters of the NPP have poured onto the streets of Circle , ostensibly to listen to party leaders who are assembling near the Kwame Nkrumah Circle to address the teeming crowd .
many observer and monitoring missions , including the African Union and CODEO have endorsed the results of the Electoral Commission and have called for calm .
these are some of the views of Ghanaians on Twitter :
@ nosivid : Nana Addo goes round repeating bogus allegations of electoral fraud with the claim of having evidence and calls it EXPLANATION # GhanaDecides
@ kwasireports : “ I &apos;ll go2 court ” -Nana Akuffo-Addo reaffirms as NPP preps evidence 2 back claims of electoral fraud by rulin NDC # GhanaDecides # amaniee
‏ @ nfaoforiatta : it is clear they know they lost .
may Ghanaians stand by the truth when it is revealed .
Tis our destiny to protect .
# GhanaDecides
@ Kwabena : Ah well , I thought they wouldn &apos;t file .
let the Supreme Court decide now .
# GhanaDecides
@ sam _ btw : Ghana &apos;s opposition NPP discovered &gt; 10 % irregular votes in presidential election 2012 .
fraud ?
now it &apos;s up to the supreme court .
lawyers representing NPP formally filed a petition at the Supreme Court on 28 December , 2012 .
the NPP only has 21 days to protest against the election results by law or else the incumbent will still be sworn in on 7 January , 2013 .
Mozambique : demise of a massive biofuels project
in late December , the Council of Ministers of Mozambique made a significant announcement .
a 30,000ha land concession to biofuels firm Procana in the District of Massingir had been revoked .
the Mozambican Land Law , passed in 1997 , is quite unique .
land was nationalized at independence , and the Land Law did not change this .
it gives the state clear tools for managing land use .
private sector investors must seek 50 year land-use rights agreements , known as DUAT , or “ Land Use and Benefit Rights ” .
these DUATs are not binding for the full 50 years until after an interim two year period , when investors have to prove that they use the land productively .
the case of the Procana DUAT , a massive area bordering on the cross-border Limpopo National Park , was polemic from the beginning in 2007 .
communities were to be resettled from the Park area to the lands then subsequently conceded to Procana for sugarcane production .
these communities needed the lands for grazing , as they survive from cattle rearing .
there appeared to be no real plan to deal with the brewing conflict .
Moreover , there were worries that Procana &apos;s need for water would disturb local food production .
civil society groups supported the communities in their negotiations with Park officials through a project called Lhuvuka , but there appeared to be no progress with Procana .

Brazilian site “ Reporter Brasil ” , which has a focus on the social and environmental impact of biofuels , featured an article in early December which stated
about 30,000ha of native savana will be converted to sugarcane fields in Massingir , the driest region of this African country , causing a loss in biodiversity and excessive consumption of water ( approximately 409 billion liters a year for irrigation ) .
and 38,000 residents of the area around the Limpopo National Park will be forced to leave their lands .
the Mozambican Constitution declares that all lands in the country are property of the State , which can concede land use to companies for periods of 50 years .
this &#91; particular &#93; concession , however , is conditioned by the absence of traditional communities in the territory .
which means that , there , as in Brazil , good laws do not guarantee good practices .
( reporter Brasil tips its hat to an article in Mother Jones magazine on Procana from March 2009 .
prolific Mozambican blogger Carlos Serra featured the Procana story from the beginning in late 2007 .
the firm was originally half owned by multinational CAMEC , known as a mining / drilling company .
CAMEC &apos;s founders were known for dealings in troubled places like South Sudan , DRC , and Zimbabwe .
Serra wrote two years ago :
it would be worthwhile – this is a special message to the Minister of Agriculture , Erasmo Muhate- , also , to study the trajectory of Phil Edmonds , chairman of CAMEC .
Serra again proved his worth as political and economic analyst when he seemed to warn in early December 2009 that the Government had turned against Procana .
some online news stories claim that the principal investors in Procana lost confidence in the company earlier in 2009 .
the Government rescinded its land concession officially due its “ lack of productivity ” – having cleared only 800 ha of the total 30,000ha in its first two years of operation , falling way short in generating employment .
as in any deal of this magnitude – originally estimated at over US $ 500 million – we can only assume that there were a host of political and economic considerations at play .
in his review of the Mozambican economic scenario , blogger Basílio Muhate found the Procana case an exception &#91; Pt &#93;
the economic policy measures taken to combat the recent food and financial crises , which included subsidies to small agriculture and the installation of silos , the projects in the area of biofuels started in 2008 ( Procana was an exception in the sense that little to nothing was achieved in relation to what was predicted ) , are having positive impacts in the agriculture sector .
it is hard to detect whether the Procana case represents an interesting precedent for the management of land in the country – if the Mozambican government will scrutinize the ever-increasing number of land deals with foreign investors in the same way .
or whether the case merely represents an exception – and exceptionally bad performance on the part of foreign investment .
or both .

Caribbean : French Literary Prizes
this week , two of the most prestigious French literary prizes were awarded to two French-speaking authors of African descent : the French-speaking Caribbean blogosphere has been buzzing over this double satisfaction , in this post from Haiti , this one from Guadeloupe and this one from Martinique .
Venezuela : post-election Reflections
this post is part of our special coverage Venezuela Elections 2012 .
emotions ran high on Sunday night after the official results of the October 7 , 2012 , presidential elections were released .
President Hugo Chávez was re-elected with 55.14 % of the vote , while opposition candidate , Henrique Capriles , obtained 44.24 % , as reported by Venezuela &apos;s National Electoral Council .
part of the country celebrated the continuation of the ‘ Bolivarian Revolution ‘ under Chávez , while the other side lamented another electoral loss .
Chávez supporters reflect
Tamara Pearson in Venezuelan Analysis refers to Sunday &apos;s results as “ an imperfect victory . ” She writes that despite the celebratory mood among Chávez supporters on Sunday night , she felt “ a bit down ” :
because over six million people supported , by voting for Capriles , selfishness ( he had focused his campaign on Venezuela ending its solidarity with other countries ) and the destruction and sale of their country .
she goes on to analyze why the gap between the opposition and Chávez is narrowing .
from her perspective , “ the opposition will come out of these elections emboldened ” so “ the revolution can &apos;t lie down and relax ” :
if we don ’ t beat corruption and bureaucracy in the next period , we could lose this revolution .
now that the presidential elections are over , we have two main questions : how will we deepen the revolution , and will it survive ?

Antonio Aponte , from the blog Un Grano de Maíz &#91; es &#93; , congratulates fellow Chávez supporters for the victory , but also looks at future challenges for the Bolivarian Revolution .
he also analyzes the narrowing distance between government supporters and the opposition :
&#91; ... &#93; from a 26 % difference in the presidential election of 2006 we have moved to a weak 10 % .
we lost almost 20 % of our votes .
preliminary analysis indicates that we lost in low-income sectors and didn &apos;t gain votes from middle class sectors .
why the decline ?
the answer lies in the essence of socialism , without understanding it we are destined to fail : socialism is the essence of love , of fraternal relationships , of the sense of belonging to society .
capitalism has as its essence selfishness , individual solutions .
that is the foundation of the battle , selfishness in a fierce fight against love , and that is where our efforts must be directed .
he concludes that ‘ revolutionaries ’ must urgently acquire a ‘ culture of discussion &apos; : “ A revolution that doesn &apos;t discuss , dies ” :
study , discussion , must be the main tasks of society .
ignorance is counterrevolutionary .
¡ Long live Chávez !
Reflections from the opposition
many opposition bloggers followed Capriles ’ campaign closely , with enthusiasm for what seemed to be the right moment for a change in Venezuela .
they quickly reacted to the results , sharing their sadness and disappointment , but also looking forward with self-criticism .
blogger Alex Boyd says he “ never expected a different outcome ” .
he shares a map of the results and adds a note about electoral fraud :
Hugo Chavez trounced the opposition candidate again .
six years on , Chavez still is the choice of the majority of my countrymen .
and that &apos;s OK , I don &apos;t have a problem with that .
the good thing about it is that Henrique Capriles , Leopoldo Lopez , Ramon Guillermo Aveledo et al buried the phantom of electoral fraud in Venezuela .
by claiming , repeatedly , that the system had been sufficiently audited , and that the opposition had managed to place witnesses in 100 % of voting centres nationwide , there is no room for further entertaining the thought of fraud .
Manuel Silva from the blog No solo con la palabra thinks that one of the worst things the opposition has done throughout multiple electoral processes is not being prepared for a defeat .
however , Silva argues that the opposition &apos;s loss is not a political loss :
here we lost because &#91; ... &#93; the majority of Venezuelans identify with this form of government &#91; Chávez &#93; .
we are willing to accept abuse and trampling as a way of life , we have made insecurity something natural , we have settled for misery , we have accepted gladly to live as we have done in recent years : hating each other .
meanwhile , according to blogger Mirelis Morales Tovar from Caracas Ciudad de la Furia , the opposition hasn &apos;t learned enough :
there are many who need to look a little further .
Venezuela is not Caracas , it is not La Lagunita nor Twitter .
we are a country divided in equal parts and we must learn to look to the other side .
Alejandro Tarre argues that the opposition must be ready and willing to continue offering an alternative for Venezuelans , considering that “ politics , like life , is not stagnant but fluid ” and that in December Venezuelans will vote for mayors and governors :
the opposition mass is there , the challenge is simply to shake it out its stupor to then mobilize it .
much has been said that , after his great campaign , Capriles is in an ideal position to take lead the opposition and shield the unity Well , here is his first challenge .
now more than ever we need our rock star encouraging people and touring the country to support candidates for mayors and governors .
these are only a few of the thoughts from opposing political sides after the most intense and contested presidential election in years .
more reactions have also been shared on Twitter , the citizen media platform of choice for most Venezuelan netizens .

USA : Haitian Nationals Granted Temporary Protected Status
temporary Protected Status ( TPS ) is a special status given by the United States to foreign nationals from specific countries where there has been some sort of recent turmoil or trauma , such as war or an earthquake .
the status requires that the individual already be in the United States , and the individual must apply for consideration under TPS .
currently , TPS is given to citizens of El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua , Somalia , and Sudan .
as the name implies , the status is temporary and does not automatically qualify an individual for permanent residency ( green card ) or citizenship .
this week , following the horrific 7.0 earthquake that hit Haiti , a number of politicians and journalists began calling on the United States to give TPS to the one to two million ( by most estimates ) Haitian nationals that live in the country .
several petitions , including one by breakthrough , were circulated , and 83 Congresspersons signed a letter to President Obama requesting TPS for Haitians .
on Friday , January 15 , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano granted TPS to all Haitians currently living in the US for eighteen months .
prior to the announcement , blogger The Latin Americanist noted :
Haitian expats and immigration advocates have long clamored for TPS for Haitians , especially in light of numerous hurricanes and major storms over the past decade .
though their pleas had fallen on deaf ears by both the Bush and Obama administrations , support for Haitian TPS has gained backing from key lawmakers
also prior to the decision , American blogger and immigration scholar Koulflo Memo called TPS a “ no-brainer ” :
the right wing Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) has announced opposition to granting TPS for Haiti .
the reason they give is that they assume Haitians won ’ t leave after TPS is lifted .
they also say the Haiti situation does not meet TPS criteria .
fair ’ s opposition is dishonest and wrongheaded .
it is also racist .
I hope President Obama is not over-calculating his chances for comprehensive immigration reform later this year by appeasing the FAIR constituency on this crucial humanitarian issue .
such a non-response would indeed forsake Haiti in its time of need .
American blogger Deep Thought commended the Obama administration &apos;s decision , writing :
President Obama showed real leadership in moving quickly to help the people of Haiti .
he and Secretary Napolitano also showed compassion in suspending deportations to Haiti for eighteen months by granting TPS ( temporary protected status ) to Haitians currently in the United States ; dumping a bunch more people into the current scene of devastation would be unhelpful at best and disastrous at worst .
yes , they are getting some heat from Nativist groups but the real test of leadership is the ability to make tough decisions because they are right .
blogger and adoptive parent all buttoned up discusses thanking her representative for pushing for TPS and also requests help for Haiti &apos;s many orphans , writing :
this issue is getting a lot of press at the moment .
I hope that it makes a difference , but you and I both know that people grow tired of seeing the same sadness over and over again .
there were more than 200,000 orphans living in Port-au-Prince before all of this began , and however you feel about these issues – and they are complicated – none of this intervention is meant to undermine the integrity of the Haitian people or their desire to look after their own children .
it is just not possible for them to do so .
this is a humanitarian issue .
although Haitians in the United States are now protected for the next 18 months at minimum and able to work , the people of Haiti still need help .
here are a few organizations providing relief in Haiti , and here are a few ways you can donate hotel or frequent flier miles .

as Pope Resigns , Russians Resigned to Putin
if every community views global events though a lens of its choosing , then for the Russian Internet community the lens of choice is domestic politics .
it comes as no surprise , then , that the news that Pope Benedict XIV resigned from his post was interpreted from this angle by Russian bloggers .
it also comes as no surprise that most of these interpretations were in the form of jokes — after all , even religious Russians don &apos;t really have a dog in this fight .
without any real interest in the repercussions of Benedict &apos;s resignation for the Catholic faith or what it means in light of ever more visible priest molestation scandals , the RuNet defaulted to its favorite pastime , humor .
blogger and journalist Ivan Davydov took a social welfare angle &#91; ru &#93; :
in Russia a third of the families have been abandoned by fathers &#91; the Russian &quot; papa &quot; means both father and Pope &#93; .
and nothing , no one is making noise in the press .
RuNet &apos;s pro-government bad boy Politrash exploited &#91; ru &#93; growing tensions in the North Caucasus :
Benedict XVI : “ The leadership of the football &#91; soccer &#93; club “ Anzhi ” made me an offer I could not refuse .
FC Anzhi is based in Makhachkala , the Republic of Dagestan , and is owned by Russian billionaire Suleyman Kerimov , who since 2011 has been spending reams of cash to poach good players from European clubs like FC Milan .
while Benedict XVI is retiring , President Putin still has some juice left .
© Kancelaria Prezydenta RP .

most bloggers , however , went with the transparent Vladimir Putin parallel .
there is some symmetry in comparing the authoritarian Putin to the Pope .
both run organizations defined by “ power verticals ” , although it was a different Russian leader &#91; ru &#93; who is said to have famously queried “ The Pope ?
how many divisions has he got ? ”
Ksenia Sobchak summed up the general sentiment in a tweet &#91; ru &#93; , hinting at the dubious constitutionality of Putin &apos;s third term :
even the pope left .
on his own .
in the theocratic nation of Vatican the principle of transition of power works better than in the country of “ sovereign democracy ” …
the fake Twitter account of Rossneft president Igor Sechin implied that the Pope may have had ulterior motives in resigning :
the fake Twitter account of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the presumed “ hint ” from Benedict for Putin to bow out , with a fake quote from Putin &apos;s press-secretary :
“ Not a chance ! ” – Dmitry Peskov tersely commented on the latest news from Vatican .
the anonymous jokester KermlinRussia couldn &apos;t pass an opportunity by , mysteriously tweeting &#91; ru &#93; :
Sergei Shoigu , has for the time being , been appointed the acting Pope
Eritrea : remove current regime quickly
according to Mohammed Hagos , democracy project in Eritrea has to start with the removal of the current regime : “ The hurdle preventing the Eritrean people from having their say is the Issayas regime .

France : does Prestigious Literary Award Entail a “ Duty of Restraint ” ?
the start of this year &apos;s French literary season saw French-Senegalese novelist and playwright Marie N &apos;Diaye awarded a much-awaited Prix Goncourt .
however , N &apos;Diaye and her family move to Berlin to years ago , in large part because of French president Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s politics .
last year , the panel of this prestigious award created a sensation when it chose Afghan writer Atiq Rahimi , for his French language novel , Syngué Sabour .
will this be another opportunity to celebrate diversity in a changing French society ?
or will the moment be spoiled by controversy ?
explains DW-World :
in an interview with “ Inrockuptibles ” magazine last summer , N &apos;Diaye said she had decided to leave France and move to Berlin in 2007 “ in great part because of Sarkozy . ”
the controversy began after Eric Raoult , a lawmaker and member of Sarkozy &apos;s ruling UMP party , wrote to the culture minister last week recommending that NDiaye be reminded of the “ duty of restraint ” that comes with the Goncourt .
in response , France &apos;s cultural establishment has thrown accusations of censorship into the debate .
Bernard Pivot , a Goncourt jury member , accused Raoult of knowing nothing about the literary scene .
n &apos;Diaye , born in 1967 to a French mother and a Senegalese father , won the Goncourt prize for her novel , “ Trois femmes puissantes ” ( “ Three Powerful Women ” ) , a story about three women caught between France and Senegal and the hellish ordeal of illegal migration from Africa .
“ The story of these migrants has been told many times before , but if this can help people understand their fate a bit better , I will be happy , ” said NDiaye .
what was it that stirred Eric Raoult &apos;s ire ?
no less than an interview of the woman novelist , when she answered magazine Les Inrocks ‘ s question : “ Do you feel well in Sarkozy &apos;s France ? ” saying :
“ I find that kind of France horrendous .
the fact that we ( N &apos;Diaye , her partner , writer Jean-Yves Cendrey , and their three children ) decided to live in Berlin is not unrelated to this .
( … ) I find this atmosphere of heavy policing and vulgarity appalling … ”
renowned law blogger Maître Eolas demolishes Mr. Raoult &apos;s claim in an ironically well-argued post , finally awarding him the “ Prix Busiris ” ( “ buse ” may be translated by “ dolt ” ) .
first , he rectifies a grammatical mistake :
to begin with , and the Minister of Culture and Communications won &apos;t forget to correct by himself , the duty of restraint cannot in any case be owed to the prize-winners , but instead is owed by the prize-winners : this mistaken preposition makes the prize-winner a creditor while in the MP &apos;s mind head , he would of course be the debtor .
and legally ?
among the texts , the blogger quotes of course the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen along with the European Convention on Human Rights .
and the “ duty of restraint ” , traditionally asked from civil servants ?
the duty of restraint is often called upon indiscriminately by people who don &apos;t understand a thing about it , as forbidding a civil servant to speak up , sometimes even about quite private matters .
the lawyer concludes on the M.P. &apos; s dishonesty , before dealing the finishing blow :
let &apos;s add to all this the fact that in 2005 , as the mayor of Le Raincy , during the autumn uprisings , he was the first to declare the state of emergency in his town , yet spared by the violence , only to outmanouever the prime minister , which shows some tendency towards useless gestures in order to draw attention .
which at the same time proves the motive of political opportunism , and carries the decision along .
other bloggers also had scathing words .
on Art contemporain , la peau de l &apos;ours , Philippe Rillon writes :
we understand quite well that the duty of restraint is a rule for every servant of the state ; but since when are literature and writers put in the same category as the civil servants with their rights and duties ?
we already had a “ government culture ” , now we have become “ state artists ” , as if Paris was East-Berlin before the wall &apos;s collapse …
wouldn &apos;t it be amazing if the day after the hypermedatized celebration of the wall &apos;s collapse , this unquestioning supporter could spoil the idyllic view of the falling dominoes .
meanwhile , Marie Ndiaye , after an attempt at toning down her words in an interview with radio station Europe 1 , which in the midst of the turmoil went unnoticed , appealed to French Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand .
the latter deems the controversy “ trivial ” and “ ridiculous ” , and the main players stick to their guns .
Somalia : introducing a network of Somali journalists and bloggers
the Somali Media Centre is a forum of Somali journalists and bloggers living in Somalia and outside .
the Centre distributes news content and publishes blogs written by journalists .
the Somali Media Centre is an independent forum for the Somali journalists in and outside the country .
it is established to promote the profile of the brave , hardworking journalists who devoted their lives to serve their people worldwide .
Somalia has been dubbed as a failed state , a country associated with death , long running civil strife , warlords , terrorism and modern piracy .
but one of the most successful stories over the years has been the rise of the independent media and freedom of thought .
however , the dedication and reporting of the truth come at a price .
the Centre publishes running blogs by these journalists .
also , the Centre distributes news content and reports by the journalists .
the Centre coordinates between the Somali and non-Somali journalists .
it gives non-Somali journalists who may be traveling to Somalia with first hand advice and contacts .
the Centre also works with high profile international media organizations in commissioning , producing and filing stories and reports about Somalia and the Horn of Africa region .
Solana Larsen writes about the origin of Somali Media Centre project :
in case you hadn &apos;t guessed , I &apos;m not Somali .
in journalism school in London in 2002 I had a classmate named Harun Hassan who I used to ask a lot of questions about life in Mogadishu and Somali politics .
after we graduated , we remained friends and I introduced him to writing for openDemocracy.net where I was a commissioning editor for a few years .
later on , I became a managing editor at Global Voices Online , where we occasionally also have stories about Somali bloggers .
Harun used to tell me about ideas he had for media projects involving the Somali community in London .
he created a newsletter on paper in Somali , and at one point he approached me about making a website for something he called the Somali Media Centre .
media coverage of the Somali community in the UK was so negative and inaccurate , Harun felt the only way to correct it , was to make it easier for UK journalists to find Somali journalists and researchers to talk to .
we made a website and blog , but we were soon distracted by other work and the project lay dormant .
the website you are looking at now , is our second attempt at creating a networking tool for Somali journalists and others to use to help improve global understanding of Somalis and Somalia .
below are some of latest blog posts from The Somali Media Centre :
in a post titled , Affair to Remember , Fathia Absie writes about the conviction of Joshua Asisa , a peace-keeper in Somalia , for engaging in an affair with a young Somali woman :
military court in Kampala convicted Joshua Asisa to a one-and-half years in prison .
Mr. Asisa who is a member of the AMASOM peace-keepers in Somalia have been found guilty for engaging in an affair with a young Somali woman by the name of Nimco Omar and impregnating her after marrying her under a false pretence by telling her that he was a Muslim .
this story took place last year in Mogadisho but no one heard of it till this young woman went to Kampala and took Mr. Asisa to court for lying to her .
Mohamed Abukar Ahmed who is the Journalist that broke the story has told me that he has learned the story after it was reported by a news paper in Uganda .
after that Mr. Ahmed tried to get in touch with the leaders of the Somali community in Kambala and was able to get in touch with the girl .
he told me that Ms. Omar told him about her story and how she met Mr. Asisa who is doctor .
he was working at a private hospital for the Uganda military in Mogadisho .
“ in the spirit of spreading the word .. , ” writes Idil Osman :
the recruitment taking place in the Somali refugee camps in Dadaab , Northeastern Kenya has stirred some controversial outbursts by many in and outside the region .
however what I am particularly bewildered with is the stand-point of the Kenyan government .
I did an investigative report on this issue earlier on at work where the defense minister of Kenya firmly claimed Kenya had not given permission for this recruitment to take place .
meanwhile witnesses and human rights activists are recording and documenting evidence of these youngsters being put in Kenyan military trucks and driven to Kenyan military training bases .
many of these youngsters are taken under false pretence and the promise of regular salary and a stable job with a UN / EU / AU backed military project .
in reality they are being recruited to go and fight in the very war they fled from and had turned them into refugees .
many of these young refugees are reported to be underage and taken without their parents ’ consent .
it also violated their international human right as refugees according to the recently released Human Rights Watch press release , because refugees are meant to be kept in civilian conditions .
Solana discusses the issue of “ unnamed sources ” in Western media reports in her post titled “ When Local Sources go Unnamed “ :
just picked up the latest edition of National Geographic Magazine for their story on “ Shattered Somalia ” .
the photos of Mogadishu by Pascal Maitre are beautiful , though they show a lot of destruction .
and the writer , Robert Draper gives a fair and sympathetic summary of a complicated history .
he also definitely makes the challenges of foreign reporting in Somalia clear .
Curiously , Somali journalist Harun Hassan is mentioned by name in a photo caption of a traffic guard in Mogadishu , but as far as I can see nowhere in the text itself .
why the reluctance to reveal sources ?
if Draper has taken the trouble of contacting and interviewing Somali media sources , why not share this information with the readers ?
is this a typical experience of Somali journalists who assist Western journalists with their reporting ?
I hope members of the Somali Media Centre will help shed light on what it &apos;s like to be on that end of the reporting team .

Egypt : introducing the MorsiMeter
this post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Elections 2011 / 2012 .
on June 24 , a new president has been officially declared in Egypt and his name is Mohammed Morsi .
the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s Morsi has become Egypt &apos;s first freely elected president , and like all other candidates , he has his own presidential program and promises that voters – supposedly – elected him based on .
but how can Egyptians hold Morsi accountable for his promises and watch the progress in achieving them ?
Wael Ghonim tweeted about a new application for that .
@ Ghonim : tracking the performance of # Morsi ( Egypt &apos;s newly elected president ) : http : / / www.morsimeter.com ( via @ ezzatkamel )
MorsiMeter , Tracking the performance of Morsi , the newly elected president of Egypt
the application is created by Zabatak , ( @ Zabatak ) , a non-profit initiative which aims at making Egypt become bribery free , corruption-free and safe .
and on MorsiMeter &apos;s Facebook page , they describe the application as follows :
the is an initiative to document and monitor the performance of the new Egyptian president , Mohammed Morsi , and we will monitor what has been achieved from what he had promised in his program during his first 100 days in power .
Egyptian netizens shared their thoughts and opinions about the meter on Twitter as follows : @ MagedBk : brilliant ! http : / / Morsimeter.com
@ omarkamel : MorsiMeter NOT a bad idea .
but must also measure how good we think those ideas are to start with .
security plan SUCKS .
@ AbdoRepublic : brilliant idea to assess # morsi ‘ s performance .
goodbye Dictatorship

USA : Eid Postage Stamp Provokes Hate in Tennessee
a 2008 version of the stamp , before the price increase
as Muslims in the United States celebrate Eid al-Fitr , the celebration which marks the end of Ramadan , a pernicious chain e-mail is making its rounds .
the e-mail falsely claims that President Obama has issued a new postage stamp commemorating the two Eid celebrations and urges readers to boycott it , naming several terrorist attacks on the U.S. over the past twenty years .
the full text of the e-mail can be seen in this post by Missives from Marx , who expresses frustration at the letter , saying :
I received the following email forward today from a family member .
it is because of stuff like this that I ’ m going to have to spend four weeks of my Western Religions course deconstructing Muslim stereotypes .
this is why critical thinking has to be an essential component of all my courses .
as it turns out , there &apos;s nothing new about the letter , or the stamp .
About.com explains that the letter has been around since at least 2002 , while the stamp itself was issued on September 1 , 2001 .
Aziz Poonwalla , on the BeliefNet blog City of Brass , explains the history of the e-mail :
versions of the email , which has been making the rounds for years , have been repeatedly debunked before , but it still persists .
I &apos;ve blogged extensively about the history of the Eid stamp , the controversy that accompanied it when it was introduced ( mostly from conservative Republicans ) , and the defense of the stamp by President Bush and Speaker Hastert .
in a nutshell , the stamp was introduced on September 1st 2001 , ten days before the 9-11 attacks , during the Bush Administration .
mayor Piper joins a long list of conservative politicians who have no objection to stamps commemorating Hanukkah , Kwanzaa , even teh Chinese New year – but a stamp devoted to the muslim holiday of Eid is singled out as a threat , requiring response from “ patriotic ” Americans ?
a post on the Clarksville Online , a blog for the town of Clarksville , Tennessee , explains why the e-mail has made major headlines this year :
Clarksville Tennessee ’ s Mayor , Johnny Piper has sent an inflammatory anti-Islamic email to employees of the city , encouraging them to boycott a stamp issued by the U.S.
… Mayor Piper has since attempted to defend his actions , but they are simply indefensible .
Muslims are a integral part of this country .
they serve honorably in our armed forces , defending our nation , and our freedoms .
no one should be treated like a second class citizens based on their religious beliefs , or the actions of a radical fringe .
this incident created by our Mayor has been an embarrassment for our City , our State , and our Country .
Sheila Musaji has been tracking chain e-mails about the stamp for The American Muslim ( TAM ) since 2005 , and in an update , remarks on Mayor Piper &apos;s abhorrent actions :
I ’ m certain the good mayor was just as surprised about President Obama ’ s White House Iftar .
and , of course the final recourse of all bigots : “ I have some good Muslim friends , ” he immediately added . ”
perhaps those good Muslim friends might enlighten him as to why THIS ( PDF ) is offensive .
Egypt : Basboussa for President !
this post is part of our special coverage Egypt Revolution 2011 .
“ Former Egyptian television anchor and activist Bothaina Kamel announced on her Twitter account late Friday evening Cairo time that she plans to run for president in the next round of elections , making her the first woman ever to announce her candidacy for Egypt ’ s highest office ” , Manar Ammar
this is how Manar Ammar reported the news of Bothaina Kamel running for the Egyptian presidential elections .
Kamel ( @ basboussa1 ) has received mixed reactions from Twitter users .
Twitter user @ FaresADL could not believe it , so he wrote to Kamel wondering if the news had been confirmed or was just a rumour :
@ FaresADL : @ basboussa1 are you really running for presidency ?
Fatma Emam , who is a feminist wrote about the news :
@ fatmaemam : Bothina Kamel the first and only women candidate for presidency in # Egypt , follow her on @ basboussa1 , in solidarity # womenrights # jan25
photo taken from the Facebook account of Bothaina Kamel ; participating in a demonstration during the World Day Against Corruption .
Lara ( @ FarawlaLawra ) found it good news , whether she is convinced to vote for her or not :
@ FarawlaLawra : @ basboussa1 I am so proud and glad u r running- its a step forward to opening up the society to equal rights . ( even if i might not vote 4 u )
Mahmoud Salem , aka @ Sandmonkey , also wrote in support :
in this video uploaded to YouTube by user moushebl1 on April 3 , 2011 , Kamel announces her plans to run for presidency .
some people commented on the above video against her running for presidency .
MyHamosa : I &apos;m against us being ruled by a woman
Algeriangirls123 : I don &apos;t think she will even have the minimum votes required to enter the elections !
Radwa El-Shami questioned the reason behind the huge number of candidates running for presidency in Egypt :
the number is increasing and I am seriously starting to question the intentions and motives of every person willing to ascend the throne of Egypt .
it is looking more like I can &apos;t serve the country unless I am at the top of the hierarchy , unless I am the president .
I admit that I am also questioning who is hankering for power and prestige
I am asking why Mr. Shafiq is running for presidency ( at least 10 million Egyptians out of 45 million who have the right to vote refused him as a prime minister !
) ; why Dr. Amr Khaled is considering running for presidency ( still not confirmed ) ; what good Sheikh Hassan thinks he will do to Egypt as its president ( rumor has it that he is running for presidency ) ; why Mr. Mortada Mansour imagines he can be the president ( is he going to govern us with threats and loud voice ) ; why Ms. Bothaina Kamel wants to be the president ( feminism ?
) ; why some are cajoling Mr. Naguib Sawiris into being part of this ( news from here and there , but he personally said Baradei is his favorite figure ) ; and I am also asking what Dr. AlBaradei &apos;s stance is after the masses accepted the lame constitutional amendments by which he refuses to be the president .
Radwa then continued :
I don ’ t know if I am the only one who pessimistically perceives the situation as farcical , and this is the reason am writing .
I am voicing my concerns because I need a reassurance .
I am asking for a well-informed , insightful opinion ; I am looking for someone to talk sense .

Haiti : why All The Stories About Orphans ?
a month after a seven-point earthquake destroyed much of southern Haiti , the fate of children , and particularly orphans , has become the main story in many corners .
but Haitian voices on the topic have been few .
in this long video report posted at Telegraph21 , recorded in the days immediately following the quake , managers of two Haitian orphanages speak to the issue in two drastically different ways .
at minute 2 : 30 , the manager of an orphanage in an unnamed location in Haiti expresses frustration at the sudden interest in Haitian children , where before there was less concern .
inquiries from foreign families seeking to adopt have become daily .
“ I don &apos;t even reply , ” she says .
“ Everybody listen , I don &apos;t want to receive post-catastrophe requests . ”
a counterpart identified as Ledice , however , who cares for sixty children in a different facility , calls for relocating kids faster , and cites a lack of government services to approve adoptions , even those underway before the disaster .
“ Now it &apos;s a humanitarian cause , ” she says .
“ Let &apos;s take the kids .
we &apos;ll see the papers later . ”
much of the recent focus on kids , both mainstream and not , comes from the widely-publicized case of an American church group arrested last week while trying to bring thirty-three kids from Haiti to the Dominican Republic .
but a broader debate is also underway .
conducive , a group blog that frequently debates international adoption , notes that previous rushes to adopt children out of crisis went awry :
removing children during times of disaster is not new .
we saw this with Operation Babylift after the Vietnam War , where the American government hurriedly removed almost 3,000 children from their homeland during the Fall of Saigon in 1975 .
lawsuits between birth parents and adopted parents tied up U.S. courts for years .
birth parents claimed they never consented to the adoption , and adoptive parents claimed the adoption was legitimate .
critical adoption theorists are seeing parallels with the current rushed adoption of Haitian children .
in a post titled Orphans , Orphans , Orphans ! , ResistRacism is more specific :
how many prospective adoptive parents have been trained in cross cultural and transracial adoption issues ?
( the same parent referenced above &#91; in the post &#93; wonders about black hair care .
now that she ’ s receiving the child .
do you think she thought about other issues of race and culture ?
) ( Don ’ t even get me started about trauma issues .
that ’ s too big to even cover .
but I ’ m of the opinion that the average individual isn ’ t equipped to handle extensive trauma in a child .
why aren ’ t agencies soliciting prospective parents of Haitian descent ?
folks with experience treating trauma ?
the same post suggests a more creative solution .
here ’ s a radical thought : if some of those “ orphans ” were relinquished for adoption because their parents could not keep them , how about we airlift entire families from Haiti to the U.S. ?
if you ’ re seriously talking about the welfare of the child , isn ’ t it best for the family to remain together ?
but that wouldn ’ t serve the needs of those other families .
you know , those good families who wish to save the orphans .
renewed attention to Haiti &apos;s Restavec ( sometimes Restavek ) system has also become an issue .
in a post from before the quake , Repeating Islands says the system , “ through which parents unable to support their children send them to live with more affluent relatives or strangers for whom they receive food , shelter and education in return for work ” has become tantamount to slavery .
she quotes a United Nations investigator who visited Haiti last year to investigate the Restivek issue , saying
… Although placement with children with other family members has long been a practice in Haiti , nowadays ‘ paid recruiters scour the country looking for children to traffic both within and outside Haiti .
this practice is a severe violation of the most fundamental rights of the child . ’
most international agencies involved in crisis childcare have , in the past two weeks , stated opposition to rapid adoptions in Haiti .
the International Committee of the Red Cross , in a statement presented as an interview with one of its child protection officers , said it believed efforts to connect children with family members in Haiti should receive priority , and adoption a last resort .
… In situations where a child is evacuated , there are clear procedures to follow : the child should be accompanied by a relative or someone who knows them , if possible ; the details of the child must be registered and their family must know where the child is taken to and by whom .
unfortunately some children were evacuated in haste without all their details being recorded .
aid groups including Save the Children , World Vision and the Red Cross Disaster Fund ( which is separate from the International Committee ) , issued a joint statement also opposing evacuations and adoptions .
so did UNICEF .
so what &apos;s the controversy ?
the case of the children stopped at the border involved a Protestant church adoption group , some of which have advocated international adoption as a means of spreading their own religious views .
other evangelist Christian blogs are more careful .
Christianity Today , “ A Magazine of Evangelical Conviction ” opposed quick international adoptions :
in the initial months after an incident like this , we don &apos;t want to move children away from the area where family members are searching for them .
after the Southeast Asian tsunami in 2004 , there were many small kids virtually unidentifiable , and yet a very high percentage of those children , thanks to DNA testing and other methods , were eventually returned to family members .
the Three Kings Visit New York
the Three Kings came and went , but not before passing through New York City to celebrate with hundreds of children that came out for the parade organized by the Museo del Barrio on January 4 , an atypically sunny Friday for the month .
this Christmas celebration , whose historic and religious background is quite complex ( much like Christianity itself ) , has been a part of the Caribbean and Latin American cultural traditions for numerous centuries .
in Puerto Rico , for example , on the eve of the Three Kings ’ visit , children leave grass in a shoebox for the horses of Melchor , Gaspar , and Baltasar , thanking them for the gifts they will receive the next day .
in fact , this tradition has transformed over the years in a very creative way .
as such , the kings arrive on horseback , not on camels , and are celebrated with promises &#91; es &#93; carved by santeros ( artisans of religious images ) that are a source of inspiration and joy .
without a doubt , the Puerto Rican and Latin American communities that are alive and vibrant in the metropolis that is New York have not stopped celebrating this day with much excitement , especially the children .
so much so that the streets of East Harlem were paralyzed to see the passing of the carriages , the magi on stilts , Peruvian dances , capoeira , giant puppets and even two camels that live in a sanctuary in New Jersey .
here we share a series of photographs taken by Puerto Rican artist Josué Guarionex that show some of the faces he managed to capture amidst all the commotion .
Jesús “ Papoleto ” Melendez , a poet born and raised in East Harlem , was chosen to be the emeritus king at the parade .
dancers performing to traditional Peruvian music .
Osvaldo Gómez delighted us with his beautiful presence .
we can almost feel the energy of this band in this photo .
hundreds of boys and girls with their paper crowns from 106th to 116th Street and Park Avenue .
distinguished reporter , María Hinojosa , and activist , Angie Rivera , were chosen as the queens for this event .
Fátima Shama , commissioner for the New York Office of Immigrant Affairs , was chosen as one of the queens as well .
Tanya Torres , a Puerto Rican artist residing in East Harlem , was one of the godmothers at the parade , Nadema Agard , Cecilia Gastón , Christine Licata and Sandra Morales-De León .
walking along the streets of New York with so many children is a tremendous gift .
South Korea : birth Control Regulation Changes Provoke Debate
the Korean Food and Drug Administration announced on May 7 , 2012 , that emergency contraceptives , known as morning-after pills , will become available for purchase over the counter .
however , it has made non-emergency oral contraceptives , which were over the counter in the past , prescription-only drugs .
an emergency contraceptive prescription will still be required for teenagers .
these sudden changes regarding drug regulations have sparked heated discussions online .
while there are still debates going on about the risks and effectiveness of emergency contraceptives among medical communities , many South Korean net users have expressed dissents on the reversal .
as quoted in a Hangyoreh &#91; ko &#93; news article , woman rights organizations and especially young unmarried women , have criticized the decision as making the sale of conventional contraceptives extra inconvenient .

Twitter user @ redparco reminded &#91; ko &#93; people of the social stigma on unmarried women visiting gynaecologists in South Korean society , which is still relatively conservative and patriarchal :
when they &#91; Food and Drug Administration &#93; want to reference European cases , then they should first make gynaecologist examinations and contraceptives more accessible — just like how it is done in those European countries .
at least they should provide a social atmosphere where unmarried Korean women feel comfortable in visiting gynaecologists to get a prescription for oral contraceptives .
@ marisusa came up &#91; ko &#93; with a similar argument :
the morning-after pill sounds like blaming women for what happened .
and there is a chance it could be abused in that way .
ThinkThink , after inviting other users to join a discussion , speculated &#91; ko &#93; that the sudden shift in policy has been driven by profit maximization , rather than care for public health .
Shin Jae-eun commented right below the net user &apos;s post :
when the &#91; oral &#93; contraceptive becomes prescription-only , people conscious of other people &apos;s eyes will not be able to visit &#91; the gynaecologist &#93; easily – which may result in a spike in the abortion rate and failure in birth control &#91; ... &#93; I am totally against it .
while a majority of net users warn about the danger of emergency contraceptives , sometimes referring to them as a ‘ hormone bomb ’ , Twitter user @ _ _ mangmang tweeted &#91; ko &#93; &#91; note : this link no longer exists &#93; :
the emergency contraceptive is really – as its name says – an “ emergency ” pill , so there is nothing wrong with switching it to over the counter .
however , when the oral contraceptive is converted into a prescription-only drug , it will be really hard , almost impossible for a teenager and women living in a small suburban area and tiny community to purchase the pill &#91; discreetly &#93; .
beside women &apos;s rights groups , the Catholic Church is also resisting the decision .
the Catholic Church in Chungcheong Province even held a protest in front of the Food and Drug Administration building , warning that &#91; emergency contraceptive &#93; pills could hurt the morals of people and give wrong lessons on the value of life especially to teenagers – an argument a lots of Twitter users do not buy into .
those Catholics who claim that switching emergency contraceptives to over the counter would promote loss of morality and encourage abortion – have they lost touch with reality ?
the illegal abortion rate and the international adoption rate are already extremely high in this country .
what kind of wild imagination do they have ?
if one fails to take an oral contraceptive , then one should be able to take a pill afterwards – that is why it is called ‘ emergency ’ contraceptive .
it is quite an exaggeration to define consuming a pill within 72 hours an act of abortion .
the reversed policy on the contraceptives is expected to come into effect as early as next year .
Arabeyes : Mauritanian President Ousted in Military Coup d &apos;état
army commanders ousted Mauritania ‘ s first freely elected president in two decades , President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi , in a military coup d &apos;état Wednesday after political feuding over the firing of the country &apos;s four top generals .
military commanders announced the formation of a new state council and its leader , General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz ( one of the four fired generals ) , on state radio and television stations .
general Abdel Aziz was also involved in a 2005 coup d &apos;état in Mauritania .
Algerian The Moor Next Door has been blogging the story intensively and reports :
talking to informed Mauritanians , some of them saw the coup coming during the summer ( as it did ) , in the autumn , or not at all .
my sense was always that the coup would come this summer ( I never wrote this expressly but I expressed this view in discussion and refrained from commenting on the crisis ( 1 ) because Western Sahara Info .
one of the major pressures that forced Sidi to act the way he did towards the end was the threat of a commission being formed to investigate the financial side of his wife ’ s foundation , which would surely have done him in ever more deeply .
the commission might even have made his administration ’ s ridiculous personal expenditures public .
for instance , I am told that his air travels alone cost the state some $ 2 billion , on chartered jets , his family , full entourage , and various other luxuries .
he was between a rock and a hard place : either he would be forced to step down ( a la Olmert ) in total shame , or he would be impelled to dissolve parliament and reorganize his government , which would precipitate a coup such as today ’ s , allowing him to save political face .
flanked on both sides , he moved in desperation and met his fate .
Western Sahara Info has been blogging the crisis from its outset , and today provided up-to-the-minute information on the coup , including a brief analysis :
quick analysis , which I may regret : a tragedy for Mauritanian democracy , on the one hand , but that didn &apos;t stand much of a chance anyway ; but more importantly , a giant setback for the country &apos;s broader chances of political development .
while President Abdellahi and his cronies aren &apos;t exactly angels , Generals Ghazouani and Abdelaziz represent the very worst military-parasitic element of the Mauritanian regime , and their refusal to let the civilian side of the regime settle down in power threatens to undo it completely in the long run .
if the last coup , in August 2005 , could be met with cautious understanding by the international community , having unseated President ould Tayaa , and eventually with praise as it led to a real transformation , this time around it is different .
what happened in 2005 was that a military-personal-tribal dictatorship was overthrown and the chance arrived to replace it with a civilian semi-authoritarian structure that respected most democratic norms most of the time , and which made sensible moves towards national reconciliation , refugee return and economic development ; not heaven , but infinitely better .
this change is now being reversed .
the putschists — even though they are some of the same people as acted in 2005 — must be condemned and the result of the coup overturned if possible ; Mauritania had a golden opportunity to break its vicious circle , and it is now slipping away .
roads to Iraq , in a post entitled “ American orchestrated coup in Mauritania , ” reports the news as well :
things are happening rapidly in Mauritania , started with a coup this morning , issuing the “ statement no 1 ” on the Mauritanian TV , changing the Head of the TV because he refused to cooperate with the army chief who staged the coup , and announcing a new military junta .
in Egypt , Bella &#91; Ar &#93; says what happened in Mauritania proved that Arabs weren &apos;t cut for democracy .
it seems that democracy wasn &apos;t made for people like us – who cannot breathe outside military rule .
after giving us a brief history of Mauritania &apos;s young democracy , Bella writes :
this way , Mauritania , which was just about to reap the fruit of democracy in a pioneering move which the entire region was eyeing with excitement , things return to what they were originally , and the military intervened and the coup happened .
Kuwaiti Wild Il Deera poses a few questions about the coup .
he asks :
what is the stance of the Arab League from the leaders of this coup ?
wasn &apos;t the Mauritanian leader elected by his people ?
how can a political group , like the Arab League , which demands that it is respected in Arab and international arenas allow such a military coup to take place in one of its member countries ?
prolific Moroccan blogger Larbi linked to a news article , remarking :
you could say : Africa is a cursed continent !
his post garnered significant response .
it is true that coups are unpredictable in Africa … I wonder , though , if again , the Moroccan services have been caught short as they were in August 2005 ?
finally KABOBfest , always one to inject humor into every situation , remarks somewhat facetiously :
whereas coup culture in a lot of countries is a thing of the past ( e.g. , Syria ain &apos;t had a coup in a few decades ) some countries like to kick it old skool , harking back to when it seemed like there was a coup-a-week somewhere in the world .
while Mauritania isn &apos;t Fiji , they are keeping the tradition of pointless coups alive and well in the Arab world .
the Arabdemocracy blog also has an excellent “ obituary ” for the young democracy that was .

Morocco : students Demand Education Reform
in July , a group of Moroccan students launched a Facebook page called “ The Union of Moroccan Students to Change the Education System ” ( French acronym : UECSE ) .
the group is a gathering of young Moroccans whose aim is to “ act , and discuss concrete solutions to improve the education system ” .
in less than a month , the Facebook page attracted well over 10,000 members and a lot of support on social media .
the momentum seems to have been fueled by news that the government may be planning to toughen the tuition policy at public universities .
the group called for a nationwide demonstration on Monday , August 6 , 2012 , to “ encourage civil society and the Moroccan political elite to open a national debate on measures to reform the system . ”
the appeal was relayed on social media .
in a video , the group posted on YouTube prior to the protest , students called for radical changes in the education system .
“ The entire education system needs to be changed , ” one student says on camera .
“ The system needs to be broken down completely and rebuilt from scratch , ” says another .
a lot of students appearing on the video also denounce what they consider “ disincentive measures ” imposed by prestigious Grandes Ecoles , in particular high thresholds required to compete in college entrance exams .
on the day of the protest , hundreds of students and their parents responded to the call as documented by pictures and videos posted and shared on the internet .
the following video is from a demonstration in Morocco &apos;s largest city , Casablanca ( posted by The7Gladiator ) :
pictures posted on Flickr by Hassan Ouazzani show a great diversity of slogans denouncing corruption , favoritism , poor infrastructure and tough conditions imposed on undergraduates to enter higher education :

Moroccan students call for a reform of the education system – Photo used with kindly permission from Hassan Ouazzani

the demonstrations went on peacefully .
the group pledges to organize more sit-ins and roundtables across the country .
on its Tumblr , the UECSE writes :

French Coach Appointed to Change Kenyan Football Fortunes
on 29 August , 2012 , Football Kenya Federation ( FKF ) Chairman Sam Nyamweya announced that former French footballer and coach Henri Michel has been appointed national team coach .
after a string of bad results from the national team and missing out on two consecutive Africa Cup of Nations , as well as failing to reach the finals of regional football tournaments , FKF officials are feeling the pressure to find a way to get results .
bloggers in Kenya had their own views about Henri Michel &apos;s appointment .
Chenga Funga states this in his post ‘ The Rule of Knowns ‘ :
a 3 way dilemma .
that ’ s what has led FKF to Henri .
Michel Simply put , would you rather the known-known , known unknown or unknown unknowns ?
after witnessing the Harambee stars struggle to strike lustre in the beautiful game , stakeholders have been touting names foreign to the Kenyan tongue for the national team ’ s top job .
the dilemma therein .
others have been tried and tested in the recent past , and not many have impressed : Francis Kimanzi , “ Ghost ” Mulee , Antoine Hey and Zico , didn ’ t quite cut it .
so Sam Nyamweya and Football Kenya Federation opted to chance with the known-unknowns , Raymond Domenech ( yes , him ) , Claude Leroy , Oto Pfister , Adel Amrouche and Frenchman Michel from a more extensive shortlist .
many boast noteworthy success under their managerial careers and therefore felt equal to the task .
put in mind our football team is a wild card .
has been for a while now .
in a minute way , VERY MINUTE , our position is similar to England ’ s , currently bossed by Roy Hodgson . bags of potential , no actual results .
Admittedly , we should be thankful for the national coaches we have had , but life goes on , and it has , with Frenchman Henri Michel . our known unknown .
MutuaMaundu ‘ s blog also played down the expectations put on Monsieur Michel :
the whole country has almost gone hysterical about it .
to many , Henri Michel is the much-needed messiah to the Kenyan soccer that has literally seen the worst .
the French-man may have unrivalled feathers to his cap , but as a nation that has suffered heartbreaks and anguish due to an under-performing national team , let us tone down our expectations .
it will be prudent not to expect too much .
Frenchman Henri Michel , a reputed tactician has enjoyed great success at the game ’ s pinnacle .
as a player and coach , he led the Les Bleus , France ’ s national team , to third place in Mexico 1986 and became a household name in Morocco , after guiding the Atlas Lions to France 1998 World Cup .
he went on to steer the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia to the 2002 World Cup in Japan / Korea and was Ivory Coast ’ s coach during the 2006 World Cup in Germany .
however , bearing in mind that football administration has been deplorable , laden with corruption and all manner of ills , it will be wise not to expect too much from the new Stars tactician .
there are no proper structures to develop and nature talent in readiness for national duty .
the Kenyan premier league had to form its own independent body in 2003 , Kenya Premier League , KPL .
this was after the then Kenya Football Federation , KFF almost threw the game to the dogs .
despite the newly elected Football Kenya Federation , FKF , there is no respite in sight for Kenyan soccer .
power games have almost washed away the hope that that had engulfed the Kenyan football fraternity .
only the Late Reinhardt Fabisch had a successful tenure at the helm of the national team , besides renowned German Bernard Zgoll in the 80s .
apart from the two , foreigners Bernard Lama of France and German Antoine Hey had short , trouble-laden tenures .
they consequently left acrimoniously .
these were all precipitated by unfulfilled promises by the football administrators .
these incidents should have taught us not to over- blow with optimism with regard to Michel ’ s appointment .
we should trend carefully and give the Frenchman the necessary support to produce the desired results .
but we ought to ask ourselves if there are any long-term measures to get Kenyan soccer on track .
Henri Michel ’ s appointment and success if any will only be short-term , the long walk awaits us .
good people and football- loving Kenyans , great expectations may make us frustrated and bitter if the football does not change for the better under Monsieur Le Bon !
AllTimesNews had earlier predicted Henri Michel &apos;s appointment and also posted his successes and previous postings :
in Summary
Ex-France tactician , to be unveiled on Tuesday , seen as Kenya ’ s vehicle to football success
64-year-old Michel beat other top international coaches , among them Adel Amrouche , Tom Saintfiet and Raymond Domenech , to the job
the Frenchman knows the rugged terrain of African football , having been in the continent for two decades since he first coached Cameroon in 1994
former France coach Henri Michel will next week be named coach of the national football team , Harambee Stars .
football Kenya Federation ( FKF ) chairman Sam Nyamweya confirmed to theNation on Tuesday that Michel has accepted to take over the reins at the national team and will be unveiled by Prime Minister Raila Odinga .
Michel , who was in the country last month for negotiations , beat more than 60 foreign coaches who had applied for the position which became vacant after Francis Kimanzi was redeployed to become the technical director at FKF .
this appointment will prompt various views and Michel &apos;s job is full on from the word go .
the dismal performance that Kenya &apos;s national football team , Harambee Stars , has shown over the past four years is something the country &apos;s football fans hope to put behind them.With 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and 2014 World Cup pre-qualifiers coming up soon , Kenyan football authorities wait to see see what difference Henri Michel may make .
Paraguay : President Lugo to Forgo Salary
Fernando Lugo &apos;s presidency started with an announcement that he would forgo his monthly salary .
“ I don &apos;t need that salary , which belongs to the poor , ” said Lugo .
different local bloggers see things differently , as one applauds the decision and another wonders how Lugo will pay for his own expenses .
Carlos Rodríguez of Rescatar summarizes the reactions of some in the press who are downplaying the gesture by pointing out that the former priest does not have a wife or children to support , while others wonder whether he will spend the reserved funds at his disposition .
however , Rodríguez sees things in a different light :
in this context of Lugo &apos;s announcement to forgo his salary , we see it as his message that “ I am not here for money . ” It is a transcendent and crucial message in a country where a high , a very high , percentage of politicians , enter the field in search of political power to reach economic power as soon as possible , by stealing .
however , Jorge Torres Romero of Detrás del Papel does not quite see things the same way and thinks it was not a smart move :
the day after Lugo &apos;s announcment , some members of the press asked the question of who is willing to follow the example of the president .
obviously , no one . Federico Franco ( the new Vice-President ) , for example , said that he has a family to support and that he won &apos;t give up his legitimate right to earn a salary .
what will the president live off of ?
who will pay for his clothes , his food , and other expenses that he might have ?
does he have that much in savings ?
will he live off the rent from his properties ?
will he pay his taxes ?
or will he wait for help , gifts and invitations from friends ?
Cameroon : electric Dreams for Development by 2035
this post is part of our International Relations &amp; Security coverage .

after his reelection in November 2011 , President Paul Biya of Cameroon announced &#91; fr &#93; that the country would soon become a giant “ construction site ” .
the goal for his new term is for Cameroon to reach emerging market status by 2035 through a series of “ great achievements ” in transport and energy infrastructure development &#91; fr &#93; .
it ’ s a deadline that fails to convince &#91; fr &#93; many commentators , if only because the challenges are so great .
energy , and specifically electricity , is especially problematic .
like many other African countries , Cameroon suffers from insufficient electricity supplies .
journalist Leopold Nséké explains in an article published in Afrique Expansion Magazine :
Underequipped , the African continent is awash in the obsolescence of its facilities and bore the brunt of poor management of available resources .
representing 15 % of the world population , Africa consumes paradoxically only 3 % of the total world production of electricity .
there is no electricity in Mafa Kilda village , it &apos;s just passing by ( and going from Ngong to Garoua ) .
by Philippe Semanaz on Flickr in 2006 ( CC BY-SA 2.0 )
according to some estimates ( fr ) only 20 % of Cameroon ’ s population has a regular access to electricity supplies .
indeed , those who have access to power tend to experience cuts in supply as often as every three days .
electricity is also increasingly expensive commodity for most of the country ’ s citizens .
the privately-owned AES Sonel , for example , recently announced a 7 % rise in prices starting from June 1 , 2012 .
limited access to electricity also represents a threat to the industrialization of Cameroon , which in turn could undermine Cameroon ’ s ambition of becoming emerging economy by 2035 .
a study &#91; fr &#93; conducted by the Polytechnic National High School of Yaounde outlined that :
production losses were estimated at EU91.5 million per year in industrial enterprises because of the difficulties in supplying electricity .
these results indicate that inadequate and poor quality of electricity supply has slowed industrial development .
yet unreliable electricity supplies are also a major concern for the wider population . Feowl is a new community-led initiative that aims to refine and provide currently absent data on the impact of poor electricity supply in Douala , the economic center of Cameroon .
as Cameroon essentially relies on hydro-energy production , the Government also launched the construction of the Lom Pangar dam in the east of the country .
the project – funded by the World Bank and other international organizations – is considered to be integral to Cameroon ’ s aspirations to become an emerging economy .
the dam is expected to the increase energy production of Cameroon with a planned capacity of 7.250 billion cubic meters for a reservoir that will cover 610 km2 .
water supplies will also be held in reserve for the dry season at two damns further downstream of the Sanaga River , thereby enabling them to generate more electricity .
Christiane Badgley ’ s blog highlights some of the shortcomings of the project .
she is concerned that the electricity produced will mainly prioritize the needs of Cameroon ’ s industries :
… the urban and rural poor do not appear to be the primary beneficiaries of the Lom Pangar project .
instead , the dam is designed to regulate the flow of the Sanaga River in order to increase energy production from existing and proposed downstream hydropower plants serving the southern electricity grid and the country ’ s single largest electricity consumer , the Alucam aluminum smelter .
jointly owned by the government of Cameroon and the Canadian-based company Alcan , Alucam plans to more than double its production and needs new sources of cheap energy to do so .

activism and Motherhood in Asia
what does a woman sacrifice for the cause she fights for ?
how are her children affected by persecution taken against her ?
this post explores briefly the lives of women activists in Asia who are also mothers .
Irene Fernandez is a women and migrant rights activist in Malaysia .
for more than ten years , Irene has been faced with a ‘ criminal defamation ’ charge ( which has now been dropped ) for having published a memorandum , asking the Malaysian government to look into alleged atrocities taking place in migrant camps in the country .
aside from being an activist , which had led to her receiving the Right Livelihood Award in 2005 , Irene is also a mother to three children , Camverra Jose Maliamauv , Tania Jo and Katrina Jorene , and several foster children .
it is hard to imagine what goes on the mind of an activist like Irene , when she thinks of her children .
during her sentencing at the initial trial in 2003 , Irene was reported to have said :
I want my children and the children of all the people I work with as head of Tenaganita to enjoy and live in a society that is peaceful , where we do not fear state violence .
Irene ’ s role as a mother perhaps can best be reflected in the eyes of her daughter , Katrina Jorene , who wrote on the Micah Mandate ( a Christian-based blog seeking to raise public interest advocacy ) :
I celebrate my mother who brought me up to be constantly vigilant in life and to be clear and maddeningly persistent for the truth and for what is just , true and right .
I celebrate the countless heroes who have been present in my life especially my family members and the family at Tenaganita &#91; the organization Irene Fernandez leads &#93; .
I celebrate all who have worked silently , tirelessly and with so much care all these years for the greater good of others .
it appears Irene ’ s teachings have caused at least one of her children to take on the same activist mantle as herself .
now Katrina writes advocacy pieces dealing with minority rights and protection .
unlike Katrina Jorene , unfortunately , Alexander and Kim Aris , sons of Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Aung San Suu Kyi , have not had the opportunity to learn from their mother for more than a decade .
so strong was Ms Suu Kyi ’ s passion for Myanmar , she has spent close to fourteen years under detention in a lakeside villa in Yangon , choosing to stay for fear that the military junta would not allow her in again if she left .
Womensphere , a blog by and about women , writes :
&#91; Ms Suu Kyi &#93; British husband , the Oxford scholar , Michael Aris , died of cancer in 1999 at the age of 53 .
she was unable to see him as he was dying – the junta refused to give him an entry visa , and she feared that , if she left Burma , she would not be allowed back in .
she has not seen either of her two sons , now men in their thirties , for a decade .
little has been written about ( or by ) Alexander or Kim .
however , in 1991 , Ms Suu Kyi ’ s older son , Alexander , accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on her behalf .
again , looking through the lens of her child , we might be able to better understand Ms Suu Kyi as a mother :
speaking as her son , however , I would add that I personally believe that by her own dedication and personal sacrifice she has come to be a worthy symbol through whom the plight of all the people of Burma may be recognised .
and no one must underestimate that plight .
we must also remember that &#91; her &#93; lonely struggle taking place in a heavily guarded compound in Rangoon is part of the much larger struggle , worldwide , for the emancipation of the human spirit from political tyranny and psychological subjection .
although my mother is often described as a political dissident who strives by peaceful means for democratic change , we should remember that her quest is basically spiritual .
it is my hope that soon my mother will be able to share this feeling and to speak directly for herself instead of through me .
meanwhile , many activist mothers in Asia still face persecution .
for example , Fan Guijuan , whose house was said to have been demolished as a result of the Shanghai World Expo project , was arrested in Beijing and sent back to Shanghai , placed immediately in detention .
her son has no place to live , due to the demolition .
meanwhile , in the Philippines , Dr Edita Burgos , mother of Jonas Burgos , fights for justice for her activist son , who is said to have desaparecido ( “ disappeared ” ) .
Dr Burgos is the chair of Desaparecidos ( Families of Desaparecidos for Justice ) , an organization seeking justice for the many unaccounted for , said to be a hallmark of the Arroyo regime .
now , in Iran , humanitarian activist mothers are fast becoming global icons for human rights causes worldwide .
in silent public protest , the ‘ Mourning Mothers of Iran , ’ known in Tehran as the ‘ Mothers of Laleh , ’ peaceably seek justice for their dead or incarcerated children .
“ A mother is a mother as long as she lives . ”
Russia : bloggers Meet With Iranian Ambassador , Avoid Sensitive Topics
the meeting of Russia &apos;s top-bloggers with the Iranian Ambassador in Moscow three days after Hossein Derakhshan had been sentenced to 19.5 years of imprisonment for “ anti-government propaganda ” highlighted the clumsy attempts of the Iranian online diplomacy in Russia .
it also showed commercialization and excessive cynicism of some of the popular Russian bloggers .
the dinner lasted a couple hours .
the Ambassador , Mr. Reza Sajjadi , doesn &apos;t speak Russian and was communicating with us through an interpreter &#91; his blog is in Russian , however &#93; .
at first , he told us in brief the history of his country … &#91; ... &#93;
then we asked some questions .
it appears that our opinion of Iran is wrong , just like our opinion of Lebanon .
people there are kind , open-minded and hospitable .
in general , we have to go and check .
the Ambassador has promised to help with the visa .
all in all , the meeting went very positively .
we joked a lot , ate ice cream at the end .
the Ambassador presented us with two boxes of pistachios ( they turned out to be really tasty and sweet ) and a book in Russian , a finger thick , about the political system of Iran .
I can lend it to those who are interested .
blogger Norvezhskiy Lesnoy , too , sounded as dry and insincere as a Soviet newspaper &#91; RUS &#93; :
in the course of the conversation , the bloggers have discussed the prospects of today &apos;s Russian-Iranian relations , exchanged views on a number of relevant international affairs issues .
both sides expressed satisfaction with such a dynamic development of the relations between bloggers of the two countries , emphasizing mutual interest in strengthening them for the sake of the friendly nations of Russia and Iran .
the date of the meeting suggests that it was an Iranian attempt to fix the image of Iran in the eyes of the Russian blogosphere .
none of the other bloggers who attended the meeting wrote anything about it .
later , Sergey Dolya refused to reply to any comments about human rights in Iran .
cynicism of the bloggers who agreed to attend such an “ online diplomacy ” event ( and , even more , later wrote about it ) , after an Iranian blogger had received the most severe punishment in world history , outraged &#91; RUS &#93; Denis Loktev , a TV journalist :
these fans of free pistachios have somehow failed to ask why in Iran their fellow-bloggers are getting thrown behind the bars to die for their criticism of the regime .
what a shame .
another popular blogger , LJ user drugoi , also didn &apos;t know &#91; RUS &#93; how to interpret why bloggers with several thousand friends would attend such a meeting and ask no questions about the situation with the blogosphere in the country .
LJ user sumlenny explained &#91; RUS &#93; :
by the way , Dolya &apos;s post shows why all the hopes that bloggers control the authorities and corporations better than the mass media – these are pretty absurd hopes .
bloggers are the same – not curious , easily manipulated , etc .
plus , they don &apos;t even have those small moral and professional brakes that journalists have even in the most non-free mass media .
cases of successful control of the authorities by bloggers should rather be attributed to incredibly lucky coincidences .
in another discussion , blogger iratus wrote &#91; RUS &#93; :
the worst thing about these people is that they don &apos;t have any position .
did you really think they would ask the Ambassador any inconvenient questions ?
&#91; ... &#93; They don &apos;t care next to what flag to have their picture taken , as long as their rating doesn &apos;t fall .
because if it does , then nobody will invite them to free events and pay for planes and hotels in the future .
reflecting society , the Russian blogosphere has a hierarchy .
LiveJournal , with its “ friend ” system and the rating based on it &#91; RUS &#93; , represents one of the mechanisms of creating such a hierarchy in the virtual space .
probably , the hierarchy system can explain why LiveJournal became so popular among Russian bloggers .
the number of friends , as well as the number of mutual links and comments , affect the blogger &apos;s LiveJournal rating .
popularity is achieved partly naturally , partly with the help of various techniques of “ fixing ” the rating ( for example , when a group of not-so-popular bloggers comments on the posts of more popular ones ) .
the more comments and links , the higher the position in the “ top blogger ” rating .
as soon as the “ top blogger ” gets into the Top 50 , he / she starts to receive offers from PR agencies and corporations to review their products .
some PR agencies have their own networks of bloggers who promote products , services or even political messages .
Kuwait : in Love with Osama Bin Laden
this post is part of our special coverage The Death of Osama Bin Laden .
picture of Khulood Al-Khamis from her Twitter account
so what does it take to make a woman fall in love with someone like Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden ?
apparently , a long beard , admits Kuwaiti female columnist Khulood Al-Khamis , who stunned readers with a love letter she wrote for the terror mastermind , who was killed by the US , in Abbottabad , Pakistan , this week .
in her letter , in her column in the Kuwaiti Arabic daily Al-Qabas , Al-Khamis described Bin Laden as the man of her dreams , describing how she would have loved going with him to his cave , washing his beard and becoming one of his wives .
she ended her article promising to wait or him in heaven to continue her Scheherazade tales .
the columnist , who happens to be a short story writer , has an account on Twitter .
her article shocked many readers .
on Twitter , Al-Khamis received a lot of sarcastic mentions , including from Ayman Zawahari , a parody account of the Al-Qaeda second man , who asked her a simple small question :
Saddam Hussein , another parody account , followed :
lady Khulood Khamis , I &apos;m also a criminal who killed more people than Osama has killed , why don &apos;t you consider me ?
Yahya Taleb Ali , a young Kuwaiti writer , wrote yet another sarcastic tweet saying :
come on guys , she is expressing her opinion and crush on Osama Bin Laden ; she wants to brush his beard .
that &apos;s her opinion and expressing it is a guaranteed right .
I personally would like to brush Nietzsche &apos;s mustache .
another Twitter user , who claims to be a president of Kuwait &apos;s upper class area Shuwaikh , wrote different tweets about Al-Khamis &apos;s article , including this one :
after Khulood Al-Khamis recent article , Victoria Secret will launch a new collection entitled “ oh , Bomb Me ” consisting of lingerie planted with terrorist seductive dynamite
another Kuwaiti female Twitter user , Ghadory , did not hesitate to mock Al-Khamis , but this time in English :
# kholoudalkhamees ( ‘ Cause Ur a freak , baby ) U want it bad , bad romance With # OBL I got a whole new perspective on lady gaga song
Molten86 wrote with a serious tone :
she wants quick fame .
compliment a terrorist tyrant !
congratulations , you &apos;re a star now .
Salman Al-Naqi has also dealt with Al-Khamis &apos;s article in a serious way saying :
be careful of New Salafism that comes to us with beard shaved men and unveiled women .
writers Bader Al-Bahar and Khulood Al-Khamis are good examples

Arab World : “ Stop Crying Over Sudan ”
this post is part of our special coverage South Sudan Referendum 2011 . today &apos;s independence referendum in Sudan has put the country on the radar in the Arabic twitterosphere .
from Saudi Arabia to Palestine , Arab tweeps are discussing Sudan &apos;s unity , division and resources .
the referendum is part of the 2005 Naivasha Agreement between the Khartoum central government and the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army / Movement and may see the division of South Sudan from the rest of the country .
from Saudi Arabia , Omar Alattas asks :
when will the Sudan referendum results be announced ?
and then concludes :
today Algeria will replace Sudan as the largest Arab country
Bader Aujan , also from Saudi Arabia , is positive about the future :
Germany reunited after its division ; Hong Kong returned to China after its separation ; and I hope too that Sudan will return .
I hope this separation will be a strong incentive for development .
he further adds :
Germany is a great example how separated countries one day would join back again peacefully .
# Sudan is not an exception !
and Mohamed Osman , also tweeting from Saudi Arabia , appeals to his readers :
dear Arab brothers , Please stop crying and making an issue over Sudan .
there was a 26 year war in which you were quiet .
please continue your silence now .
Palestinian Bahaa AlKayyali prays for a united Sudan :
unity for Sudan ..
while from Jordan , Ali Dahmash points to Sudan &apos;s rich resources :
did you know that 70 % of Sudan &apos;s Oil production is located in the south .
no wonder John Kerry &amp; US politicians are supporting the division !
and back in Saudi Arabia , Bandar Bin Naif , wonders :
China : another elite &apos;s suicide – the story of Yang Yuanyuan
Yang Yuanyuan , a 30-year-old postgraduate at Shanghai Maritime University , hanged herself in her bathroom on November 25 .
she told her mother that knowledge cannot change destiny on the day before she committed suicide .
recent years have seen an increasing number of suicides committed by Chinese university students , in particular among postgraduates and doctors .
in Shanghai city 2008 , there were 23 college student suicide cases , resulted in 19 deaths .
in Guangdong 2008 , there were 26 suicide cases , resulted in 21 deaths .
what are the reasons behind all these suicide cases ?
Yang &apos;s case may shed some lights on the problem faced by our social elites .
according to report from 163.com , Yang came from a single parent family .
she and her brother was brought up by her mother and they worked hard to climb up the social ladder through education – Yang was pursuing her Master ’ s degree in Shanghai and her brother is pursuing his Doctor ’ s at Peking University .
ever since Yang &apos;s mother had been laid off from the factory , she stayed with her daughter in the dormitory in the Wuhan University where she had her undergraduate study .
she worked for two years to payback all the debts before she decided to continue her post-graduate study in Shanghai .
with little saving , she tried to apply for an extra bed for her mother in the school dormitory , but they were insulted for their rural identity .
the warden even refused Yang &apos;s mother from entering the dormitory .
Yang &apos;s death has received a lot of echoes from the Internet as it has become more and more difficult for people with high education achievement to attain the social status that they struggle for .
the magic of university diploma is vanishing .
blogger Hailing , who is sympathetic to Yang , muses about the asymmetry between education achievement and salary in Chinese society in her article who should bear the responsibility for poor postgraduate Yang Yuanyuan ’ s death ?
sometimes human are weak and fragile , who can end his life for one or two perplexed questions .
outsiders may reckon it extraordinary for a poor family to raise one Master and one Doctor , but in this society where students ’ diplomas can ’ t guarantee the corresponding job positions and salaries , who will care for your education background ?
rather , employers pay more attention to the value that employees bring them .
such reality has brought about the tragedy for this poor family who stick to the belief that a higher diploma will improve their life .
many bloggers condemns the lack of compassion in the society .
* ) points out that :
it is not poverty that killed her , but the detached and snobbish teachers and colleagues around her , those who have forever lost their compassionate heart .
SHI Sansheng shares similar opinion and slaps on the hypocritical Confucian culture :
the greatest mistake for our universities and government institutions is the lack of conscience and humanity in dealing with people .
how come these tragedies keep recurring in our society ?
and yet we believe that we are the nation of netiquette with 5,000 years civilization ?
lecturers and policy-makers are always preaching morality but in reality they are a bunch of scoundrels .
even if Confucian spirit is good in many aspects , when it is used for covering up the dark side of our society , it becomes a tool for fooling people .
it is quite obvious that people with high education are not socially as marginal as the rural migrant workers or peasants .
it begs the question on why educated people are psychologically so fragile ?
REN Haiyong reckoned the tragedy reflected on the defected school and family education .
in his blog article , “ The three missing affections ” :
in my opinion , to understand Yang ’ s despair we ought to first understand the three sources of human happiness : family love , friendship and romantic love relation … Our school and family education ignores the need of affections .
teachers and parents believe that love relation will hinder young people &apos;s education and insist that they have to focus on their study only .
they should think in their students and kids ’ position and give special care for girls .
our society has imposed a morality based on repression of affection on girls – they can not show any interest in boys and can only focus on their study in order to become a model student .
so the better a girl performs in exams , the more she would oppress her affection and sexual desires .
however , human nature cannot be changed .
the restraint always has a limit and would eventually break down if it goes too tight .
South Korea : a National Mourning on A Vietnamese Bride &apos;s Death
South Korean bloggers grieve for a Vietnam bride who was killed by her Korean husband a week after she landed Korea .
Thach Thi Hoang Ngoc ( age 20 ) was stabbed and beaten to death by her husband Jang Du Hyo ( age 47 ) who had a mental illness .
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak passed his condolence to the victim &apos;s family via Korean ambassador in Vietnam .
Korean bloggers , while expressing their grievances to the murdered bride , urged the government and the police to clamp down the unwarranted marriage agencies who often lead marriages into tragedies by hiding the husband &apos;s mental history , characters and status .
a screen shot image of a portal site after entering a search word : Vietnam brides .
when you enter a search word ‘ Vietnam brides ’ in the Naver.com , Korea &apos;s most widely used portal site , almost nine out of ten are the marriage broker sites , alluring young Korean guys that they can get a Vietnam or other foreign bride in a reasonable price .
the murdered young bride , Ngoc was the one on the market .
she arrived in Korea on July 1 , got married and found as a cold body on 8 .
she could not speak Korean and knew nothing about her husband and about his mental instability .
the husband later told the local police that he was instructed by a ghost to kill his wife .
many Koreans were appalled by the news , most of them calling the incident as a national shame .
a lawyer blogger Springlaw commented in a posting that starts with a sentence ‘ I am posting it , hoping such incident never happens again ’ that the marriage was wrong from the start and it got ‘ festered ’ by the miscommunication , ignorance and late response .
this problem got festered and festered furthermore and finally imploded as seen in this case .
Korean guys nearly ‘ bought ’ brides and their marriage got stained by the physical violence and abusive languages under the situation they cannot understand each other ’ s language .
I am worried this may go beyond a family matter , into a matter between countries … This wrong , fraud marriage pattern has been rampant from long ago and so many foreign brides had been hurt by it .
of course the media have pointed this problem out , but Korean people and the government was hardly responded to it and this lead into this shameful murder of a Vietnamese wife .
the international marriage is on a sharp rise in Korea .
around 11 percent ( 35 thousand cases ) of the whole marriage are international , according to Korea Statistics Office .
but many suspect it as a conditional marriage between an unmarriable Korean guy and a young foreign bride whom sold at around 7 to 10 thousand dollars .
almost every case the couples do not speak each other ’ s language , and the dysfunctional marriage ends up as the husbands beat the wives and the wives ran away .
when the situation is bearable , the wives send money to their parents back in their homeland .
the money young brides sent often transforms into a huge sum of money due to the currency margin .
a Korean blogger Trustme77 living in Vietnam coalesced Vietnamese comments to a news report on the story .
some shared their heartbreaking stories and others did not hold back their raging anger toward the marriage brokers and the government .
this is sad : many Vietnamese women do not care their dignities as a exchange for the money and more sad thing is that the Vietnamese law is too loose .
( Bui Tan Man )
a life of a gamble : many young women do not understand what the life in foreign countries would be like .
most of them imagine it would be like a life in paradise .
but that is a mistake of these naïve women .
( Ta Duc Thong )
there is no happiness when you realize : I am married to Korean husband and now living in Korea .
I got married via a broker and I cried ( for happiness ) when I was selected as the bride among several hundred other women … After several months of paper works , I arrived in Korea and my dream went shattered down .
my husband has no job and he was an epileptic .
when I realized that I was being ripped , I cried a lot thinking about my homeland .
( Nguyen Thi Hong )
those international brokers should be punished .
why the government do some serious work on it ?
( Anh Minh )
Korean society ’ s apathy is not helping the situation , commented a blogger Danbee 928 , urging Koreans to remember their humble times in the 1960s and 70s , when many Korean went to war zone or Western countries to earn money to home .

USA : Fort Hood massacre puts spotlight on Muslims in Army
a shooting rampage carried out by US Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan that killed 13 and injured 31 in Fort hood , Texas has once again put Muslims in America under the spotlight – especially those serving in the army .
moments after Major Hasan was announced as the suspected shooter , there was clear discomfort among newscasters and commentators regarding his religious and ethnic background .
it &apos;s also been widely reported that Muslim service members have sometimes faced attacks from fellow services members .
Howard M. Friedman , Professor of Law Emeritus at the University of Toledo , says in his blog ReligionClause :
“ The military has been actively recruiting Muslims with the linguistic skills and cultural understanding needed to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
however Muslims in the service face suspicion by some of their officers .
whatever suspicions of Muslim service members existed before the shootings , one can only fear that they may have been heightened by the mass murder in Fort Hood .
questions are still being raised as to whether Major Hasan was an extremist who carried out the attack based on religious ideology or he was simply mentally ill .
in Canada , writer Gwynne Dyer , at Vancouver weekly free paper Straight.com , argues that pointing out the murderer &apos;s religion overlooks some very serious issues :
“ After a few days while the commentariat hesitated before competing narratives , the media are settling on the explanation that it was ethnic / racial / religious abuse that drove Nidal crazy .
bad people doing un-American things were ultimately responsible for the tragedy , and there ’ s an end to it .
the one explanation that is excluded is that America ’ s wars in Muslim lands overseas are radicalizing Muslims at home .
never mind that the homegrown Muslim terrorists who attacked the London transport system in 2005 , and the various Muslim plotters who have been caught in other Western countries before their plans came to fruition , have almost all blamed the Western invasions of Muslim countries for radicalizing them .
never mind , above all , that what really radicalized them was the fact that those invasions made no sense in terms of Western security . ”
Fox News , often criticized for its bias on issues related to immigration and conservative politics , is reportedly calling for the “ screening of Muslims ” in the army .
at the Veterans Today website , a retired officer of the United States Coast Guard , Tom Barnes , says the news channel is playing up the stereotype to create “ us versus them ” tensions :
“ … the news channel is being very “ unhelpful ” to say the least if this initially reasonable question soon turns into another Fox Channel crusade against “ them ” .
this stuff is not only getting old , it is dangerous .
the story is here .
as I have previously pointed out , this kind of thing has happened before in the U.S. Armed Forces .
I am getting tired of Fox News telling me who my enemies are .
all the time .
non stop .
I had no idea there were so many “ thems ” out there ! ”
a number of newspapers are now examining how Major Hasan &apos;s actions will affect Muslims serving the in US army , and Muslim residents around Fort Hood .
here is a video report by euroamericannews on YouTube about how some Fort Hood Muslims view the events .
as the investigation of the massacre continues , the spotlight on Muslims serving in the army will likely continue .

Uganda : President &apos;s wife appointed to cabinet
Janet Museveni
February &apos;s cabinet reshuffle has Ugandan bloggers making 2011 election predictions .
among the new appointments President Yoweri Museveni made was the posting of his wife Janet as state minister for Karamoja , a region in northeastern Uganda that has been plagued by conflict and extreme poverty for decades .
while some bloggers think the high-profile appointment could bring much-needed attention to the region , others are more skeptical .
Ariaka notes :
Takinfg the cue , H.E President Yoweri finally made the cabinet reshuffle that had lingered in the grapvine for over six months .
and what a reshuffle .
we saw the appointment of a first lady , also MP for Ruhama county of Ntungamo district to the Karamoja portfolio .
we saw Syda Bumba , transfered from Labour to the all important Finance docket .
it is the first time in Uganda that a first lady is a Minister , forget that hers is a junior portfolio .
it is also the first time that a women has been appointed a finance Minister .
these are not simple appointments .
it is a political chess game where the master has his eye set on victory .
Daniel Kalinaki , a journalist who often blogs on political issues and who published an editorial on the appointment in Uganda &apos;s Daily Monitor , agrees :
there is , of course , nothing wrong with Janet ’ s ambitions .
she is a Ugandan and has a right to seek or be appointed to any office for which she is qualified .
however , when a President has been in power for 23 years and begins to surround himself with relatives , friends and in-laws , he begins to look more like a village chief bent on carrying on his bloodline than a reforming democrat .
Antipop at Let There Be Me takes a more humorous approach , speculating on how Museveni arrived at his decision .
she offers several theories , including that the announcement was a belated Valentine &apos;s Day gift :
the one about Valentine &apos;s day
… The next day at breakfast , realizing that he was in trouble , and not willing to get into any confrontation , he told her that last night was a deliberate move to get her all worked up but he had a surprise for her that would sure make up for everything .
and on Tuesday Feb 17th , she learned of it in her favorite tabloid .
she found out just how long she would have to travel to unveil her belated Valentine ’ s Day gift and was not amused .
lingerie would have done just fine .
not all bloggers are as critical , though .
phantom of Even Steven ends a post on the Oscars by asking :
in other news , what ’ s so bad about posting Janet Museveni to Karamoja ?
commenting on the post , chanelno5 defends Janet Museveni :
there is nothing wrong with that .
if she wants what everyone shuns go ahead .
in fact those people might benefit from her appointment .
Tumwijuke at Ugandan Insomiac considers this point of view , but she still questions the appointment :
perhaps this appointment is Yoweri Museveni ’ s way of sending a message of solidarity to the people of Karamoja .
perhaps he hopes that the bevy of brown nose humanitarian types who support his wife ’ s every cause will transfer their ‘ goodwill ’ to developmental programs in Karamoja .
perhaps a picture of Mama Janet cuddling a snotty nosed Karamojong baby will be good PR for the Museveni government .
still , I can ’ t shake this ominous feeling …
Dennis Matanda , who recently posted the second part of a four-part series titled “ Uganda &apos;s Next President , ” offers his predictions on who will succeed Museveni :
although the current President has not made an effort to groom a successor from the ruling National Resistance Movement , his wife Hon. Janet Museveni , MP who recently became appointed Minister and his son , Lt. Col. Muhoozi Kainerugaba are front runners .
Joe in Uganda summarizes the shake-up in a post titled “ Dynasty ? ” , noting that Janet &apos;s appointment “ was widely seen as a sign of things to come . ” He adds :
on a personal note , having worked on Karamoja for the past two months , I was delighted to see a high profile Minister taking over the portfolio .
the region is in urgent need of attention .
India , Pakistan : Sania-Shoaib Mania Rolls On
the Shoaib Malik and Sania mirza wedding controversy has been an awakening for people on the both sides of the India , Pakistan border .
with the media blitz , it seems people of both the countries are witnessing a desi version of “ papparazzi ” as TV channels , print media and other agencies have hounded , gleaned and extracted any bit of information possible about this impending wedding .
past skeletons have crept up on Shoaib in the form of his “ ex wife ” Ayesha Siddiqui , whom he had to officially divorce to end the controversy .
the allegations and the judicial case on him in India have now been taken back by the Siddiqui family for an alleged Rs . 150 million in alimony .
the twists and turns of the story have been pure mayhem for media and obviously the bloggers are not far behind .
the blogsphere in India and Pakistan have literally lit up with views and debates , some think its a sign of peace to come while others cite this marriage as a source for future acrimony .
Syed Zaki Ahmed at Pak spectator thinks that the marriage and the noise is good for businesses :
now in this situation how could businessmen lag behind .
businessmen in Pakistan have joined the party as they are getting orders for hundreds of thousands of T-shirts featuring Shoaib and Sania ahead of their wedding that is expected to take place next week on 15 April .
they call me muslim blog comments on the rationale behind the decision Sania Mirza took to marry Shoaib Malik :
what can Indian Muslims learn from Sania ’ s very personal decision ?
it is this : never be apologetic about Pakistan .
do not be needlessly cynical about that country out of fear of being dubbed a traitor .
you are not .
the Hindu right wing parties , from Bajrang Dal to Shiv Sena , did make a meal of Sania ’ s decision .
yet , the bouncy tennis sensation took the plunge .
simply because , deep in her heart , love for a Pakistani and being Indian need not necessarily be a conflicting experience .
however , Capricious thinks the marriage is going to fail :
* Sania Mirza got all the fame , popularity , wealth and iconic status in a very young age .
she became a darling of India , pampered and loved by all Indians and projected by Indian and world media .
&#91; .. &#93; She is a independent girl .
unlike majority of Muslim girls of the subcontinent , she doesn ’ t need a husband for the bread and butter .
&#91; .. &#93; The sense of providing livelihoods to the family is some thing on which man ’ s character , attitude and his authority develops .
it gives the typical Pakistani Muslim mediocre mindset .
this mindset always demands some thing extra and undue favor from the wives .
which will be absent in the marriage .
the luxury of being “ husband ” could not be availed by Shoaib Malik .
whilst every day brings new news like the Pakistani PM sending a special gift for the couple , the diatribe continues elsewhere .
Sunni Ulema Board , a group of religious scholars , reportedly issued a ‘ fatwa ’ ( religious edict ) against Sania and Shoaib for mingling freely and living together before the marriage is solemnized .
there has even been a term coined on twitter for this union with the hashtag # shoania
we have seen rumor mongering reports that the actual nikah ( marriage registry ) took place on the 9th of April .
but nothing is over until Sania and Shoaib say it &apos;s over .
it seems the media is feeding the mania and millions of people in both the country remain engrossed with all these .
obviously this will continue till the 15th of April , as two very emotional nations watch a movie like story transforming itself in real life .

Japan : latest survey on poverty destroys the prosperity myth
one Japanese in six is living in poverty says the latest Welfare Ministry report .
according to OECD figures , Japan has one of the highest poverty rates in the developed world and is 4th after only Mexico , Turkey and the U.S.
by Flickr id : Ushio Shugo
in September , Makoto Yuasa , Secretary-general of Anti Poverty Network ( 反貧困 Han Hinkon ) , had already pointed to the problem explaining Japan &apos;s poverty issue in this way :
ever since the high economic growth of the 1960s , Japan has inhabited the myth that all Japanese people belong to the middle class .
however , Japanese-style employment , which is at the heart of this myth , has been transformed by the increase in nonregular employment and other factors , and a growing number of Japanese live in poverty .
as many debate on their blogs , nowadays the income gap in Japan is far from being new .
when the economic Bubble burst in the early 90s it revealed the weaknesses in the Japanese system and since then many experts say the country has never completely recovered from recession .
Ysaki suggests how this problem has always existed but have been regarded by most Japanese as a somebody else &apos;s problem .
when I read the news I felt that this problem is very similar to that of other discriminated groups in Japan .
although there is certainly a problem and it is one very close to us we pretend not to see it and in doing so , we have come to convince ourselves that it is none of our business .
Miyabi-tale considers that the issue has a long history and that responsibility must be traced back to political inertia .
what &apos;s surprising is data from a couple of years ago showed that one person in seven lived in poverty .
there are some who consider it a positive that , despite the deep recession which affected the whole world as a consequence of the Lehman Brothers collapse , only one in five people nowadays is poor .
under the LPD government , slogans such as ‘ In Japan there is no poverty ’ or ‘ A total of one hundred million middle-class households ’ used to be announced but it has again become apparent that this was far from being the truth .
by Flickr id : caribb
there are those though who prefer to consider the other side of the coin .
Ukkii hopes that this black period in the Japanese social and economic history would bring a return of the strength of spirit for which the Japanese people are renowned .
b U T
is it all right for things to go on like this until the country &apos;s economy recovers ?
when the Japanese people were poor after the war , they did their best with no hesitation and managed to improve the situation as we now know .
if only we again had the same HUNGRY SPIRIT of that time I am sure that even if we can &apos;t immediately change the whole country , keeping our companies strong and competitive is still possible .
I am an employee but I try to see things from a CEO &apos;s point of view because if we are far-sighted , there are many discoveries and improvements to be made , which can be applied to a variety of things .
the phrase ‘ hungry spirit ’ is perhaps forgotten nowadays but I &apos;d like to put it forward again .
Ethiopia : bloggers defend Ethiopian Airlines after crash
Ethiopia-based bloggers rushed to defend the safety record of the country &apos;s national airline on Monday after one of its planes crashed near Beirut , with all 90 people on board feared dead .
Owen Abroad said he was “ very upset ” by the news in the post Ethiopian Airlines , adding :
Ethiopian Airlines has an outstanding safety record .
the staff are professional , courteous and efficient .
I will be flying from the UK to Addis on Friday on Ethiopian Airlines and , despite today ’ s tragedy , I am looking forward to it .
a commenter on the blog agreed , writing :
I ’ ve flown with them a number of times , and never had a bad experience .
they ’ re also much better with changing dates than most other airline companies .
two annoyances about the news coverage in the UK
when the crash was first announced on the news , we were told that there were 2 Brits on board , one Canadian citizen , and one French citizen .
apparently people of other nationalities are less relevant / interesting .
the second : - The airline safety expert was repeatedly questioned about the safety record of African airlines , and had to answer a number of questions about the quality of Ethiopian Airlines ’ fleet ( in particular the age of the planes ) .
I certainly don ’ t remember similar questions being asked after the Air France crash last summer .
Reuters ’ Addis-based correspondent Barry Malone wrote a post on the company &apos;s Africa News Blog titled Ethiopian plane crash should not sully success story :
when news of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash broke this morning my heart sank at the thought of covering yet another negative story about Ethiopia .
it ’ s particularly galling for Ethiopians that the airline is one of the few international success stories for a country known mostly for famine and war .
when the news emerged I also immediately knew how hard the company ’ s staff would take it .
I ’ ve been to the sprawling campus that serves as headquarters to Africa ’ s arguably flagship airline many times .
the last time was just last week to interview CEO Girma Wake and I left with a gift of Ethiopian coffee and the impression that I ’ d rarely seen people so passionate or proud about their work and what it does for their country .
Nazret.com provided running updates on the crash as the story developed through the day .
Iran : jailed blogger , Hossein Derakhshan ( “ Hoder ” ) may face death penalty
a reliable source has told Global Voices that Tehran &apos;s prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for jailed Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan ( also known as “ Hoder ” ) .
the presiding judge , named Salavati , has not yet ruled in the case .
Derakhshan has been accused of “ collaborating with enemy states , creating propaganda against the Islamic regime , insulting religious sanctity , and creating propaganda for anti-revolutionary groups . ” He was arrested 22 months ago , and his trial began in June 2010 .
the reasons for Hoder ’ s initial arrest upon his return to Iran from Canada in 2008 remain unclear , but many speculated that his two ( highly publicised ) trips to Israel were the primary reason .
Derakhshan holds a Canadian passport , but Iran does not recognize dual citizenship and visiting Israel is frowned upon by the government .
confusing in this case , is that Hoder gained worldwide notoriety as a leading Iranian blogger and free speech activist ( even blogging for Global Voices in 2004 and 2005 ) .
later he changed tacks and wrote favorably of President Mahmoud Ahmedinajhad &apos;s policies regarding the United States , nuclear weapons , Israel , and even intolerance for public dissent from human rights activists .
in April of 2009 , Iranian president , President Ahmadinejad , issued a letter calling for Hossein Derakhshan ’ s case to be processed in a timely and legal fashion .
the Canadian government has not been publicly vocal on Derakhshan &apos;s case .
a Free Hoder blog was created by online free speech activists shortly after his arrest in 2008 .
on Twitter , Sanam Dolatshahi tweeted the news of a possible death penalty , and a site in Persian called Kamtarin has also mentioned it , noting that despite previous rumors that Derakhshan was being held for “ spying ” in Israel this is apparently not one of the accusations for which the prosecutor seeks his death .
in a blog created by Derakhshan &apos;s family , Edalat Baraye Hossein Derakhshan ( meaning justice for Hossein Derakhshan ) there are still no reports or updates on this topic .
the last post on the family blog is dated August 15 , and says that Hossein &apos;s trial ended weeks ago &#91; Fa &#93; :
we are waiting for the verdict .
he had not got even one week vacation out of prison to come home … It is the second Ramadan that he is not at home … He told us the quality of food since last Ramadan became better in prison … His mother is very worried … It is said this month God answers the prayers easier … Please do not forget our Hossein .
Iranian Blogger Z8tun summed up the situation about two years ago :
“ Other Iranians have been caught visiting Israel , but were released after a few hours of interrogation .
some speculate that Derakhshan , who in recent years became a supporter of President Ahmadinejad ’ s government , was arrested because he insulted some religious leaders in the country .
he has himself argued in Western media , despite multiple testimonies of jailed bloggers , that nobody goes to jail in Iran because of the content of their blog . ”
the Islamic Republic has cracked down on the blogosphere in recent years , and there are several other bloggers sentenced to prison in Iran including human rights activist Shiva Nazar Ahari .
on 18 March 2009 , Omid Reza Mir Sayafi became the first blogger to die in suspicious circumstances in an Iranian prison .
Uganda : breaking the Culture of Silence Around Health Rights
medical care is supposed to be free in Uganda .
however , there has been a consistent shortage of medicine and health workers in the national health centres .
a video produced by Results for Development , an international non-profit organisation whose mission is to unlock solutions to tough development challenges , was released online recently to encourage Ugandans to break their silence and take control of their health rights .
introducing the video , Oscar Abello writes :
Uganda has made great strides in the past few years building up the “ hardware ” of its public distribution system for medicines – central warehouses and staffed distribution points – but the “ software ” isn ’ t quite right .
many health centers run out of medicines in the 2-3 months between deliveries , meanwhile central warehouses are chock-full of supplies .
medicine supply chain problems aren ’ t news to Uganda ’ s poor , many of them in remote rural villages , but few channels exist to bring that information to the public officials who are in position to do something about it .
in the video , Dennis Kibira , the medicines advisor at HEPS Uganda , a health consumer organization that helps increase access to essential medicine in Uganda says :
I want to see a country where people do not have to die because they have failed to receive the care that they deserve .
in 2006 , three ministers lost their posts after it was reported that they were involved in embezzlement of funds from the health sector .
their cases are still pending in court .

Rosette Mutambi , the founder and executive director of HEPS Uganda says in the video that health care is supposed to be free in Uganda , but it is not the case at the moment .
she adds that the health centres are operating over-capacity and that health workers are over-worked .
Uganda also has experiences power outages or load-shedding , which affects health centres that have no standby generators since some medicine needs refrigeration .
according to Moses Kamabare , the general manager of National Medical Stores , the organisation responsible for the storage and delivery of medicine to health centres , they makes one delivery every two months to all districts .
but a health worker on the ground says that the heath centers actually receive medicine once every three months .
medical Stores iin Uganda are always full , but there are no drugs in the health centers .
some people have to walk more than 10km to these health centers only to find that medicine is not there .
this experience is heartbreaking for many people and discourages them from coming back to the centres and seeking medical care .
a lot needs to be done to improve health care in Uganda : faster , more frequent service delivery , an increase in funding , more health centers , higher salaries for health workers , and procurement of equipment for centres .
there is also a challenge of shortage of doctors , some of whom allegedly steal medicine for their private clinics .
but the big question still stands , will this video encourage Ugandans to finally break the silence ?
China : Nobel Dream
this month , the Chinese press and online forums are saturated with coverage of Charles Kao ’ s winning of the Nobel Prize in Physics .
yet another overseas Chinese scientist has snatched the prestigious prize , this temporary moment of shared glory is quickly turned into a more profound question : when would China produce its first indigenous Nobel Prize winner ?
a commentary on Xinhua describes this psychology :
every year , when the Nobel Prize winners are announced , the Chinese will become very sentimental .
if a winner is of Chinese descendant , they will be very excited .
but after a few days , this excitement will gradually cool down or even turn into indifference .
when next year comes , this cycle will repeat .
詹晟 posted a question on an ifeng blog piece :
some people said it is a kind of discrimination against Chinese – the Nobel Prize will not be given to Chinese , it will only be given to people with a certain citizenship .
therefore , a pre-requisite for Chinese to be awarded is to become an American citizen .
but why are Chinese able to get the prize once they change citizenship ?
this echoes with an article on 青青草香 ’ s sina blog :
when we talk of an “ American Chinese ” , the keyword is not “ American ” but “ Chinese ” .
after the fervent media reporting , we have the illusion that all Chinese are sharing the Nobel pride as well .
our fragile hearts are self-comforted .
Charles Kao is the eighth Chinese Nobel Prize winner .
while we are feeling proud , should we ask the embarrassing question : why could Chinese win Nobel Prizes when they are in a foreign but not our own country ?
a commentary by 丁果 on the Southern Metropolitan Weekend outlined a few structural problems of the Chinese academic environment :
China still lacks a free academic environment , which makes it difficult to nurture innovative talents ; China lacks high-end basic research facilities , which makes it hard to attract Chinese to return to their own country ; China lacks the social atmosphere to nurture groundbreaking ideas and a suitable community for leading scientists to settle down for long periods .
詹晟 and 青青草香 also discussed some other disturbing realities .
詹晟 said :
look at the corrupted academic environment in China .
there are so-called book publication amount of PhD mentors , each ranging from a few to dozens per year .
local governments like to employ foreign consultants for advice as it is a “ stylish ” act .
if a rigorous academic environment and an effective reward mechanism do not exist , even with the glory of being the “ People ’ s Teacher ” , most academics will leave the circle and join the commercial world .
we can blame a transforming China or the waves of materialism as being the causes of all the irregularities .
but isn &apos;t it also related to our cultures or attitudes ?
青青草香 remarked :
China is keen to use number .
the number of published research papers is used to determine someone &apos;s academic quality , or to decide if a research student can proceed to the stage of thesis defense .
under this system , teachers and students alike have to publish a large amount of papers , with the accompanying result of widespread plagiarism .
while China becomes the number one producer of academic dissertations , it may also be the number one producer of academic garbage .
under the current education and research system , it is difficult for China to nurture liberal , independent and innovative scientists .
producing the first indigenous Chinese Nobel Prize winner will take some time .
in the collective English blog , the Fool &apos;s Mountain , there is also a hot discussion on “ What Lies between Chinese Writers and the Nobel Prize ” .

oil Exploration Prompts Lake Malawi / Nyasa Ownership Dispute
news that Malawi is exploring oil on Lake Nyasa ( also known as Lake Malawi , Lake Nyassa , Lake Niassa and Lago Niassa ) has attracted hot debate over the ownership of the lake .
while the Malawian government claims exclusive ownership of the lake , Tanzania is pressing for recognition of some earlier ownership of half of the lake .
the matter dates back to colonial times in 1890 , when Britain and Germany shared boundaries in East and Central Africa .
at that time hopes for any oil on the lake were far fetched .
according to journalist and blogger Mavuto Jobani , last October 2011 , Malawi said it had awarded oil exploration licenses to UK-based company Surestream Petroleum to search for oil in the lake .

quoting official Tanzanian sources , Jubani writes :
“ Malawi claims that the whole lake belongs to the country according to colonial boundaries … But our stated position is that half of the lake belongs to Tanzania , ” said Assah Mwambene , a spokesman for Tanzania ’ s foreign affairs ministry .
while some Malawians fear for the future , the government says things are under control as they have planned to deal with the matter appropriately .
bloggers like Pearson Nkhoma have avoided giving their opinion on the new development preferring to present the facts as they are .
for instance Nkhoma writes :
Lake Malawi is home to 1,000 endemic species of fish , an estimate to be more than any other place on earth .
it is Africa ’ s third-largest , after Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania and Lake Victoria which is partly also owned by Tanzania .
in Tanzania , Lake Malawi is called Lake Nyasa , a name derived from Malawi ’ s colonial name , Nyasaland .
in the early 1960s , Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda , then president of Malawi , also claimed that Mbeya in Tanzania were also part of Malawi .
Malawi media and social forums are awash with the debate about the ownership of the lake and potential wealth from the oil exploration .
most Malawians claim full ownership of Africa &apos;s third largest and fresh water lake .

the government of Tanzania ordered in 2007 that all maps that show that the border between Malawi and Tanzania running along the Tanzanian side of Lake Nyasa be impounded and set on fire , because they ‘ mislead the Tanzanian public ’ on the actual location of the border .
the two countries will meet in Malawi on 20 August , 2012 , to discuss the matter .
Uganda : President Says He Will Block Anti-Gay Bill
Uganda &apos;s proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009 still awaits a final decision by the country &apos;s Parliament , but the country &apos;s Daily Monitor newspaper reported Wednesday that President Yoweri Museveni has “ assured the US State Department of his willingness to block the Bill ” :
President Museveni has reportedly assured American authorities that he will veto Ndorwa West MP David Bahati ’ s proposed anti-gay law , a position that breaks with his recent stance and the statements of officials in his government .
activists gathered outside the Ugandan Mission to the United Nations in New York City in November to protest the bill . photo courtesy of riekhavoc on Flickr .
blogger Gay Uganda points out the contradictions in the Ugandan government &apos;s messages to the West and to Ugandans themselves :
you remember the article about the President confirming to the Americans State dept that this bill will not become law ?
well , he says that to Americans .
this is what the Govt in Uganda says to Ugandans .
government ’ s anti-gay stand stays , says minister
in a statement issued yesterday , Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa said the government does not support the promotion of homosexuality “ just like we cannot promote prostitution . ”
AfroGay speculates that the Ugandan government believed it could get away with the bill because world leaders have other things on their minds :
as in 1999 when Museveni himself ordered that gays be arrested and jailed in what was clearly an ill-thought-out throwaway &#91; again the donors intervened and Museveni beat a hasty retreat &#93; , MU7 thought that the Bahati bill would be a side issue in these times when Obama is engrossed with the Taliban , Gordon Brown is a lame duck and there is no one else taking Africa that seriously apart from the barracuda-like Chinese .
but the truth is that Obama and Europe are happy to take Uganda on because it is an easy target compared to , say , China .
Hillary Clinton said it the other day that you don &apos;t handle China the way you do a third world country and that was her way of indicating indirectly where exactly she puts Uganda in the pecking order .
in another post , AfroGay discusses what might be happening behind the scenes :
so , even if they are now being deliberately vague about it , the government has a view about the bill .
and their view is that it is terrible for their international standing and funding .
the convulsions are not over yet .
Bahati has been emboldened by the attention he has received , and he is clearly reveling in his fifteen minutes of fame .
so , he will likely not acquiesce easily .
but twist his arm the government is going to .
look out for a new clinic in Bahati ’ s constituency , promises of this and that to the people of Ndorwa and he might even be promised direct funding of his campaign for reelection .
what Museveni wants in Uganda , Museveni gets and I predict that the bill will be a shadow of its former self by the time it reaches the floor of Parliament – if it ever gets there .
Côte d &apos;Ivoire : employees of Health Institutions Strike after Four Months without Pay
S.B comments on the start of health workers ’ indefinite strike in Abidjan .
on Connection Ivorienne , he states that :
from the total no-fees for healthcare initiated by the state of Côte d &apos;Ivoire after the end of the post-electoral crisis to free selected healthcare services , employees of certain health institutions have yet to receive their salary in a regular manner .
what &apos;s worse is that their manager did not get any payments for the past 16 months .
Palestine : protests Erupt Against High Prices and Unemployment
protests are growing in the Palestinian territories , especially in the major cities of the West Bank : Hebron , Ramallah , Bethlehem and Nablus .
demonstrators are expressing their anger with the Palestinian Authority , with the high cost of living , and the high rate of unemployment among Palestinian youth .
the protests started after the Palestinian Authority declared an increase of about 8 % in fuel and petrol prices in the West Bank , starting from the beginning of September .
there was therefore a rapid rise in prices , without any significant increase in salaries or wages in the Palestinian territories .
Aban Idrees witnessed a protest in Hebron and tweeted :
in Hebron the traffic is in absolute paralysis after the protests against the high cost of living demanding the government of Fayyad to resign .
cars are barely moving in the street
blogger Ola Al Tamimi also tweeted from Hebron :
ain Sarah , the biggest street in Hebron , is now blocked by trucks and people .
some protests are beginning to move towards the National Security headquarters and the municipality building
Ola added :
this is the first time a protest has taken place in Hebron when nobody was beaten by the Preventive Security Services
Hafez Omar , a Palestinian activist and artist , tweeted :
this is the first time since 1936 that the Palestinians have protested for the sake of the cost of living !
shame on whoever wants us to forget Palestine and run after a loaf of bread …
Twitter was also flooded with funny slogans by Palestinian protesters .
Rana Baker tweeted :
one of the best banners raised today in Palestine against Fayyad &apos;s government and the high prices : “ Nowadays when I go to the market , I just ‘ like ’ and go home ! ”
another banner was captured by Lamees Suradi :
the nicest comment from Nablus : “ If you are not standing with the poor then you are not standing with the prisoners either ; please explain to us why are you still in power ! ”
Twitter user iPalestine tweeted about an attempted self-immolation by a man called Hussein Qahwaji :
a citizen poured gasoline on his body and that of his 5-year-old daughter and tried to set himself on fire , but others stopped him from doing so by force .
some reports said that Qahwaji &apos;s daughter suffers from cancer , and is actually being treated in Jordan , and that he could not afford to visit her .
it wasn &apos;t the first case of a Palestinian using self-immolation as a protest .
on September 2 , 17-year-old Ehab Abu al-Nada died in Gaza after he set himself on fire , maybe in imitation of the Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi .
Ehab Abu al-Nada had left school and used to work for 13 hours a day for just 30 shekels ( about US $ 7.4 ) in order to help his father with family expenses .
the incident gained a lot of attention , especially after a photo was published of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh with Ihab &apos;s father ; Haniyeh visited to give him “ emergency aid ” of US $ 2,000 after Ehab &apos;s death .
many wonder if this new movement will continue , and whether it could spread to other towns and cities .

@ johnlyndon1 : self immolation in Gaza ; Fayyad effigy burning in Hebron ; protests in major West Bank cities .
is spring arriving late in # Palestine ?
Senegal offers free land to Haitian earthquake survivors
President Wade , pictured here at the 2002 World Economic Forum , wants to grant Haitian earthquake survivors free land in Senegal ( image source : Wikipedia )
in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake , politicians and citizens around the world have scrambled to join the global outpouring of solidarity for Haiti , and poor countries , including many in Africa , are no exception .
Rwanda , Liberia , South Africa , Gabon , Nigeria and many others have already pleged financial aid .
however , it is the 84 year-old Senegalese president , Abdoulaye Wade , who has been making headlines .
Wade is offering free land to any Haitian earthquake survivors who wish to “ return to their origins , ” according to a spokesperson .
online , the proposal has been received with almost universal ridicule .
although Blog Politique au Senegal has yet to comment on either Wade &apos;s offer or the earthquake , it did post this commentary by Dr. EL Hadji Malick Ndiaye on the importance of “ South-South ” solidarity , published before Wade &apos;s announcement :
there are moments in the history of a country where its citizens have the chance to give their elites a lesson in ethics .
there are moments that ring out as opportunities for a people to show its moral greatness .
we cannot wallow in fatalism and forever be in the position of the recipient &#91; of help &#93; .
Senegal alone cannot put an end to the suffering of the Haitian people .
but that doesn &apos;t get us off the hook from acting , that doesn &apos;t excuse our indifferernce .
at this very moment , in Haiti , there are people dying and that is the deep reality of this earthquake .
all of our talk about solidarity means nothing at this moment unless we everything possible to be of help .
let ´ s give a little to the rest of the world , because we have already received much from the world and we may be in need one day .
citizens of powerful countries who turn toward Haiti , beyond the simple moral value of their actions , offer us a lesson on the meaning of the common good .
it is morally outrageous to pretend to be a magnificant people , with magnificant values , a people quick to condemn the defects of the West , to flaunt the values of religious solidarity , and then not lift a finger to diminish , arithmetically , the suffering of the world .
however , offering to emigrate landless Haitians is not the kind of material solidarity many envisoned .
Serigne Diagne , who has been closely following Senegal &apos;s response to the earthquake , had this to say about the scheme ( edited from the original English version ) :
… &#91; It must be assumed that &#93; Abdoulaye Wade , very nostalgic &#91; of &#93; the 19th century , believes that Marcus Garvey is still alive , and that the “ Back to Africa ” movement is still valid .
one day , he will eventually tell us is that &#91; it was &#93; the Ku Klux Klan who made the earth tremble in Haiti … each country has its own calamities .
Haiti has its own , which generate a lot of compassion , and we have ours , which do as much damage as an earthquake , such as statements by a president who has trouble staying above the fray , and whose &#91; record &#93; is a source of controversy .
the Haitian people , as was said and reiterated by the President ¨ ” Are entitled to the African soil ” .
the question remains , if they want it .
PascaleBoulerie , a reader at tak2.00221.info writes :
it &apos;s a really stupid idea , because Senegal also suffers from a shortage of cultivatable land , overpopulation , and emigration
Phillipe Souaille , coming on a post at the Tribune de Geneve , writes :
dear Gorgui , I have the feeling that your president has ( once again ) lost a chance to keep quiet .
I don &apos;t believe Haitians are dying to seek refuge in Africa .
the solution is to find a way to help the prosper in their own country .
so that they can at least achieve the same standard of living as their neighboring islands , which is at any rate higher than the average in Africa , Senegal included …
… Is this not the work of senility ?
it is time that he makes way for a replacement , if he has no other solution to offer to a peole who suffer from abandonment and exile !
Malaysia : where is Press Freedom Heading Now ?
which country is the odd one out ?
Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and Malaysia .
okay , let &apos;s say I am an obnoxious author who wants to insult your general country knowledge and you try to impress me with what you know .
so Malaysia is economically more prosperous in South East Asia region , has better developed infrastructure , with substantially lower poverty rate , hmm … you may even say more democratic .
but odd one out indeed , Malaysia is also languished way below Tanzania , Uganda and Zambia in press freedom ranking .
as recent development of press freedom in Malaysia unfolds , there are 3 key outcomes that can be observed :
1 ) Opposition parties will continue to fight the hardest through online media , after being granted limited access to print and electronic media
2 ) Despite claims or evidence of supporting free media , government continues to hold the leverage in controlling media with information and printing acts .
3 ) Information censorship is ineffective as long as Internet remains uncensored .
rising number of Internet users and independent online contents will shape major opinions and put government under pressure .
when latest press freedom index was released earlier this year , opposition politicians were quick to react through their own online party information portals and personal blogs .
their online criticism intensified when government delayed decision in renewing opposition newsletters , and the banning of satirical political cartoons offered another opportunistic moment to fuel discontent and speculation through online media .
a citizen , Lai responded :
the reason that government gave , believe it or not , was that ‘ the contents can influence the people to revolt against the leaders and government policies &apos; … Cartoons can cause the people to revolt ?
newly found weapon eh ?
Interestingly , apart from online media strategy to criticize censorship , one opposition-led state actually took the unprecedented move to table the Freedom of Information bill to disclose information of public interests to every individual .
Anil said while chiding a state government representative who rejected the bill :
today is something of a historic day for the country in our quest for a more accountable society …
as independent news portals and citizen media contents proliferate in the country , Gopal Krishnan predicted :
despite these heavy-handed responses to alternative voices , the government must surely appreciate the futility ( not to mention the political consequences ) of continuing to restrict the space for independent journalism and commentary to exist .
as of 2009 , it is estimated that over 65 percent of Malaysian homes were connected to the Internet .
beyond this , not only have we witnessed the mushrooming of various online news outlets and sources competing for our screen time , there has also been an explosion of online citizen journalism and social media , which has – among other things – truly created a new political reality in the country .
well ultimately , press freedom is not something that the government or opposition parties whimsically decide , but it is about citizens who demand the truth and reporters who want to report the truth .
like Attan said :
like I said , no matter what , we journalists lose – Najib &apos;s government suspends newspapers , Guan Eng ( DAP party leader ) bans them , and Anwar sues us .
Colombia : hard to Tell the Good Guys from the Bad
my Camera by Marcin Wichary
through citizen videos , different Colombian organizations share their unique perspectives on crime , violence and armed conflict , where it &apos;s hard to tell apart the good guys from the bad .
first , mothers and family members show up to march against the armed forces impunity on the deaths of young men due to what has been called False Positives .
in the latest false positive situation , it seems that military lured young men with promises of work to rural areas where they were then assassinated and passed off as guerrilla members killed in action .
however , the 17 accused members of the military were released when the trial deadlines were not met .
the second group is the Nasa indigenous community , who through their YouTube channel have the opportunity to tell a side of the story usually avoided by mass media .
in this case , the mines , mortar shells and other weapons left on their indigenous preserve , which is in the middle of the disputed areas between legal and illegal armed groups .
the indigenous security service has to frequently “ sweep ” the area , including houses , to dispose of these weapons left by both the national army and the guerrillas .
in the video , they ask the armed forces to please stop laying landmines and to at least come and pick up the unexploded ammunition before the members of their indigenous community stumble upon them .
in this third example , a neighborhood newspaper interviews the police to ask for the end of the year balance .
in the interview , titled “ Watch out for the bad neighbor ” the officer mentions an incident where members of a criminal gang lived in a well-to-do apartment building much to the surprise of the neighbors , smuggling out weapons inside duffel bags designed to transport tennis raquets .
but what is surprising is the recommendation the officer has for anyone : keep an eye on your neighbors and if you see young men with lots of money living on their own , eating out most of the time and bringing attractive young women into their apartment , particularly if they look like call girls , they might be members of the mafia .
do you know of any other communities and organizations who are using video to tell stories not covered by mass media or to share different perspectives on the stories making the news ?
please share them with us through the comments or write me a note !
student Dies in Protests in Dominican Republic
in the wake of the Fiscal Reform submitted to the National Congress , which was met with strong disapproval by civil society , the business sector and trade unions , various movements in opposition to the bill have been organized &#91; es &#93; .
demonstrations have been taking place since the 4th of October , when the draft bill was announced .
however , since Tuesday the 6th of November , citizens have increased the intensity of their protests , with daily numbers up .
on Thursday , the 8th of November , the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo , the sole public university in the country , was the scene of one of these anti-government protests .
but as is customary — and in spite of different regulations which prohibit it — students were confronted by a unit of armed police , culminating in the death of 21-year-old William Florián Ramírez &#91; es &#93; , a third-year medical student , hit by a bullet to the chest .
killed student , Willy Florián , as he was taken away from the disturbances by hooded individuals .
this image has been widely disseminated over the Internet .
the indignation took little time to be felt on social networks and on pirate radio .
civic leader Elizabeth Mateo , popularly known as the leader of the fight to get 4 % of GDP spent on education , published the following on Twitter :
@ ElizabethMateo : I condemn the killing of the UASD student .
I demand justice .
Likewise , investigator , consultant and columnist Olaya Dotel , stated :
young man calls for civil mobilization .
taken from the page of the Bonó Centre and reproduced with permission .
@ OlayaDotel : these corrupt individuals in control of the State are not worth a drop of the blood of our young people … not one more ! !
the controversy has spread so far that René , vocalist in the popular Puerto Rican group Calle 13 , commented on the incident :
@ Calle13Oficial : the world is looking at the Dominican Republic , hoping that justice will be done for the death of the young medical student Willy Warden !
the fusion of these and other trigger issues , far from discouraging protestors , has renewed their revolutionary spirit .
a group of around 100 people , including public figures and media , congregated in front of the buildings of the Global Foundation for Democracy and Development ( FUNGLODE ) , an institution set up by former president Leonel Fernández Reyna , who is deemed responsible for having bankrupted the nation during his eight years in power ( see video here ) &#91; es &#93; .
protestors placed candles in the street and sang their condemnation in unison , at the top of their lungs .
Twitter was the medium which gave the most coverage to the event , with Twitterers grouping themselves together under the hashtag # FrenteaFunglode .
reporter Maribel Hernández shared this from her Twitter account :
@ MaribelNexos : the National Police , a criminal gang , shouts the # FrenteaFunglode crowd .
@ MaribelNexos : the crowd is screaming Global Foundation , national shame . # FrenteaFunglode # FrenteaFunglode
but things don &apos;t stop there .
both civil organizations and individuals have flooded the Internet with a grand display of creativity , via numberless ads and images against the pro-government party and the current administration , such as those displayed below .
in the same vein , various mobilizations at all levels were planned for Friday , the 9th of November , as well as for the rest of the week .
I leave you with some of the calls to protest and examples of graphical artwork focused on the events .
Mexico : anti-kidnapping Expert is Kidnapped
Mexico is facing a crime wave , in which both national and foreign citizens are being targeted for kidnappings .
a recent case took place in Saltillo , Coahuila , when U.S. anti-kidnapping expert Félix Batista was abducted by masked gunmen .
Batista was in the country providing seminars as a consultant for the Texas-based security firm ASI Global LLC .
his experience throughout Latin America dealing with this crime is sought after for groups wanting to learn how to avoid this crime .
however , his kidnapping proves that anyone is risk .
the Mex Files has a few questions about the kidnapping case :
if Batista was an expert , how did he get himself kidnapped ?
Batista was an employee of a Houston Texas “ security consulting ” firm called ASI Global .
he reportedly was in Saltillo on personal business , but who was he working for ?
is ASI Global one of the U.S. companies receiving funding for “ Plan Merida ” … and what does this say about the competence of the trainers ?
some statistics place kidnappings as occurring approximately 2 per day and especially prevalant in the northern border states .
Mexico has the highest number of kidnappings per capita of any country in the world .
these cases affect friends and family of the abducted , such as blogger Tony Scotti , who is a friend of Batista :
I know Felix , and he is a highly competent individual .
Felix has more than 20 years of experience in the K &amp; R business .
Felix is a high profile guy , often quoted in the newspapers and in fact quoted in this month ’ s issue of Security Management Magazine .
his high profile might have been the catalyst for the abduction .
after reading the newspaper accounts it would be my guess that Felix was set up , and set up by someone he trusted .
El Nahual of México Para Los Mexicanos is worried about what this act may mean for the rest of the country :
my first reaction is laughter , but in the ironic sense .
my second reaction is fear … if an ex-military expert with 24 years of experience in the field of security is kidnapped , then that chance do the rest of us of that we won &apos;t be kidnapped ?
Uganda : the Grasshopper Syndrome takes root
Ugandan politicians are behaving like grasshoppers : “ Following the pattern of most dictator regimes coming to an end , Museveni and his collaborators in the armed occupation of Buganda are starting to behave like grasshoppers . ”
Afghanistan : high School Student Discovers Math Formula
if you are not used to reading success stories about education in Afghanistan , this one is for a change .
on 30 June , 2012 the Center of Science in Kabul announced that Khalilullah Yaqubi , a high school student from Ghazni province , had independently discovered a mathematical formula that can be used to solve ‘ second-degree quadratic equations with one unknown &apos; .
Khalilullah is an eleventh-grade student at the Al-Beruni High School in Nawabad , on the outskirts of the city of Ghazni .
speaking about the formula , Khalilullah says :
I have not seen this formula before in any book .
neither I have used any source , nor cheated from Internet .
this is all my efforts .
through this formula we can solve the problems of degree of equations ( sic ) .
some Twitter users have welcomed the news as an indication of improvements in the Afghan education sector .
Mulex , for example , has tweeted :
amazing news from Afghanistan .
sign of progress in their education system .
another Twitter user , Jasur Ashurov ( ‘ A settled nomad from Central Asia &apos; ) , wrote :
you don &apos;t always get positive news from # Afghanistan .
this why I &apos;ve been so happy to read this .
Rephrasing a Russian scientist and poet , he added :
… the Afghan land can give birth to its own Newtons and smart Platos …
the student &apos;s success particularly stands out against the background of the difficult situation confronting the school sector in Ghazni province .
members and sympathizers of the Taliban had closed many schools in the province .
recently , however , around 400 residents of one of the province &apos;s districts turned against the fundamentalist group and succeeded in reopening 81 out of the 83 schools in the area .
overall , there have been improvements in Afghanistan &apos;s education sector since the ousting of the Taliban in 2001 .
some 5,000 schools have been built ( pdf ) across the country since 2003 . yet , many of these schools still lack modern teaching facilities and face a shortage of qualified teachers .
besides , many schools for girls have recently been attacked by fundamentalists who oppose education for females in the country .
on the Outlook Afghanistan , Dilawar Sherzai describes the education system in Afghanistan as follows :
our country Afghanistan is one of the countries where proper attention has not been paid to education sector .
one of the basic reasons has been the continuous instability overwhelming the society .
the wars and conflicts – national , regional and international – that have been using Afghan land as their theater have made the development in social and educational fields suffocate to a large extent .
starting from Soviet invasion in 1979 , one can count myriads of tussles and disturbances hampering the establishment of satisfactory education system .
the problems , more basic in nature , have been the focal point of people &apos;s concentration rather than the education system .
despite all these difficulties , many Afghans succeed in becoming educated , sometimes even self-educated .
in December 2011 , another talented resident of Ghazni , without any special training or tools , flew an aircraft he had built from bits of rickshaw and a secondhand Toyota car in his garden .

Palestine : communicating with Gaza
under normal circumstances and despite a high rate of literacy , Palestine &apos;s Internet penetration rate stands between 13 and 15 per cent ( including both the West Bank and Gaza ) .
given the ongoing attacks on Gaza , however , Internet access has been significantly diminished .
although there is a small number of bloggers writing directly from Gaza , many Gaza residents are instead sending text messages and making phone calls abroad in the hopes that their stories will be told .
Mohammad of KABOBfest , who is based in the West Bank , has been reporting on Gaza for several days now .
in his first post on December 29 , he tells us :
I wanted to call my uncles and check up on them and their families , but for most of the day I couldn &apos;t .
I was too afraid to know the state they might be in .
but when I did call , I was pleasantly surprised .
my uncle Jasim told me things were much better today , there was still a fear but people had begun to recover .
we &apos;ve managed to absorb the shock of that initial attack , he said , and that is helping us get by today .
he said the sky had been quiet for about half an hour over Khan Younis , but the warships were attacking the shore . his voice was strong , just like it was when I &apos;d talk to him at any time before the massacre began , and told me to not worry so much .
they had no power , as usual , so I told him about the ongoing demonstrations and clashes in the West Bank and the outpouring of support across the world .
I told him that nobody has forgotten them , and he told me to just keep praying for them .
his youngest kids were asleep , but his daughters , Haneen and Yaqeen , were still up .
I told him to tell them we &apos;re all thinking about them .
next I called my uncle Mahmoud .
yesterday , he told me he was waiting for death .
the Israeli army had called him and told him they would bomb his home within a few minutes .
it had left us all terrified , but today he told me it had become apparent that the Israeli army had sent that message to tens of thousands of homes .
it is a sadistic and cruel tactic , designed to terrorize hundreds of thousands inside their own homes .
but his hopefulness soon disappeared .
on January 3 , Mohammed reported again :
I managed to get through to my uncle Mohammad again in Gaza City .
for the duration of the phone call , an explosion would be heard every 20 seconds or so .
in the bitter cold of the night , terror is blanketing the people of Gaza , and Gaza City in particular .
the gunfire and explosions are framed against a background of a blackened sky buzzing with invisible war planes and attack helicopters .
nobody knows what is being hit .
my uncle tells me there have been explosions all around them , near and far , from all sides , but even the local radio , which so far has been excellent at reporting what happens on the ground , cannot determine what the targets are that are being hit .
nobody is sure if the airstrikes are targeting homes , buildings , mosques or previously bombed sites , therefore nobody knows if any change in tactics has occurred .
in war , for civilians as much as for soldiers , there isn &apos;t much that is more terrifying than not knowing .
in a third post , he details calls with several family members across Gaza , comparing the situation on the ground from Gaza City to Khan Younis .
he describes one phone call with his uncle &apos;s wife :
I talked to Areej again .
she had calmed down somewhat , but still sounded very scared .
I asked her about the kids .
she said the baby , Yazeed , was asleep next to her .
DINA had also fallen asleep , and their mother had told Nada and Haya to go to their room , where it would be safer .
I asked her if they were keeping warm with the windows always open to the wind , and she said when they sleep they wear as many layers as they can and are covered in as many blankets as possible , but during the day and evening it does get very cold .
I asked about Adham , her 11 year old son .
she told me he had lit two candles and laid out his toys and was trying , despite the cold and fear and shelling and death and trauma , to play .
he had lego blocks and toy cars , and some toy soldiers .
I didn &apos;t bother asking her what he was doing with the soldiers .
I didn &apos;t want to know .
Global Voices ’ own Ayesha Saldanha of Bint Battuta in Bahrain has also been posting updates from friends in Gaza .
today &apos;s SMS update from her friend Hasan includes a telling last line :
6.30 am : “ Neither the &#91; landline &#93; telephone nor the electricity is working .
I have just got up and saw your sms .
I heard very loud tanks shelling outside .
Apache and the drone &#91; too &#93; .
they might be nearer we don &apos;t know ”
I hope so .
if electricity keeps off like in gaza we won &apos;t be able .
I am trying to call my sister or text her but in vain ”
1.30 pm : “ my wife asked why are you frowning .
give me anything that might give me a hope and I will smile I replyed .
today after the lists of our needs became too much .
medicine , food , cleaning material .
I decided to go downtown although they struck a market in Gaza .
they killed 5 and injured a group of people .
as I entered the market F16 struck 2 houses very near to the market .
all the people thought like me .
either the market or the mosque .
I felt panic .
I bought half our needs and hurried home .
in my way they struck another house near my home .
the tanks shelled a lot last night we were very worried ”
6.30 pm : “ If things got worse I &apos;d put my &#91; simcard &#93; in my wife &apos;s mobile .
F16 is shelling right now .
and the sound of the ambulance is loud .
everyday is worse than the previous ”
Mexico : telling Secrets on Twitter
Rafa Saavedra , writer and connoisseur of underground culture from the border city of Tijuana , in México , has turned each one of his electronic media channels into literary sandboxes .
on one hand , he publishes short stories and projects in his blog Crossfader Network ( and its transmutations ) ; on the other , as compulsive user @ rafadro , he has taken to Twitter as a source for creation .
his last literary-electronic project , “ Soweird ” , combines micro-fiction , secrets and Twitter .
“ Crossfader Network is my home , a place where I gather my thoughts , imagine better worlds and offer advances of what I do ” , tells Rafa in an e-mail interview , “ Twitter is my bachelor ’ s apartment : an eternal party with friends and followers , a source of ( almost ) first-hand information , a cluttered creative lab , hard irony , and genuine sincerity in 140 characters ” .
in July of this year he asked his more than 200 Twitter followers to contribute with their biggest secret ( or even a little secret , as he conceded moments after ) to create a text told by multiple voices .
with more than 40 secrets received through Twitter he came up with “ Soweird ” , where fiction and truth told 22 intimate moments of sex , shame and crime .
the final story , available through his blog in both spanish and english , is planned to be published in the Mexican literary magazine El Perro .
in the section of “ Soweird ” dedicated to the topic of family , we found the following secret :
Mauritz cheated on his girlfriend with the girlfriend of his best friend .
when they split up , she married his brother .
now he cannot explain to his girlfriend why they cannot attend family gatherings without fear of provoking a tragedy of biblical proportions .
in the crime section , we found this other secret :
Elwin started spending the checks his father sent him to pay a private university he never attended on comic books .
then , he took and spent a considerable amount of money from his first job ; he alleged he had been mugged .
another time he needed a quick procedure at a municipal office and he asked his company for an excessive amount to bribe the bureaucrat on duty ( he spent half of it on beer ) .
Saavedra &apos;s view on the microblogging service goes beyond telling trivial details : “ In Twitter , people frequently confess things so absurd , ludicrous and shameful .
come on , there &apos;s even a hashtag for # yoconfieso ( &quot; I confess &quot; ) .
so , instead of extracting a secret from my personal files , I decided that it would be very interesting to work with someone else ’ s secrets .
I was interested in knowing how far they would dare , how much it would contrast with the image I have of Twitter users with the one they show to their followers .
although he cannot reveal his followers ’ real names , Saavedra characterized the users that joined him in the project : “ There are a couple of foreigners , the age group is 19-40 years . as it can be read in the text , there are eight sections that divide the secrets ( Sex , Shame , Ex Lovers , Family , Crime , Guilty Pleasures , Temptation and Ex Friends ) .
the secrets from the Twitter users are more related to family , sex , shame and temptation .
a couple of secrets were very shocking . ”
“ Soweird ” is not the first crossover between Twitter and literature that Saavedra has achieved .
in 2007 , he was in charge of the collaborative project Microtxts , that collected 238 microfictions through the username @ microtxts , and which has been published ( as selections ) in the Mexican publications Replicante and Balbuceo .
“ I invited friends that were writers , journalists , Communications students and people that I thought could be interested in the creation of anonymous and serial micro-texts .
the basic principle of this workshop was ‘ Writing is sharing . ’ In the beginning , they could not understand fully the dynamics of Twitter nor the writing process and anonymity .
later , we reached up to 100 participants ” , commented in the interview .
“ Right now I couldn ’ t understand my life without Internet , without social networks , without everything generated by both ” , explained , “ But at the same time , I can turn off the computer and live my life without any fear .
online lives , electronic media and its use are also a border we can cross with and without restrictions .
the same thing happens with my life in Tijuana ” .
as a farewell , Saavedra shared a “ truth ” about himself in 140 characters ( or less ) :
“ I ’ ve never wanted to be someone that is not me ; however , I change so often that sometimes I cannot recognize myself : yes , a contradiction ” .
Russia : initial Coverage of the Moscow Subway Bombings
Moscow &apos;s Monday morning routine was broken today by two subway suicide bombings &#91; EN &#93; , which took the lives of at least 38 and wounded at least 70 people ( many victims were students , aged below 40 ) .
the suicide explosions were carried out by two women allegedly affiliated with the North Caucasus rebels &#91; EN &#93; .
bloggers were among the first to spread the word about the tragic event , becoming the only stable media while major news websites stopped responding due to high traffic and TV channels were too slow to prepare any material on time .
as Twitter user Krassnova noticed &#91; RUS &#93; , Twitter hashtag # metro29 &#91; RUS , EN &#93; had 40 tweets per second while TV channels managed to prepare just 4 stories .
in less than a couple of hours a website metro29.ru has been installed to cover the events .
one of the first bloggers to tell the news was Marina Litvinovich ( aka LJ user abstract2001 ) , an opposition blogger , who posted photos from Lubyanka subway station &#91; RUS &#93; , where the first blast occurred :
lobby of &quot; Lubyanka &quot; Subway Station , photo by abstract2001
here &apos;s also a YouTube video of the evacuation of passengers from Park Kultury subway station , where the second explosion took place , posted by user baranovweb :
temporary information and transportation collapse followed .
as terrified Muscovites started to check if their friends or relatives were alive , cellphone network in the centre of Moscow went down .
LJ user offnet complained that one of the reasons for the cell phone network blackout was a bureaucratic routine that required mounting an extra re-translator cell stations even in extreme situations .
Habrahabr user rubyrabbit made a complete log of the major news website blackouts .
the Sokolnicheskaya ( red ) subway line was completely closed down due to investigations .
bloggers posted a video of the jam at Komsomolskaya station .
at the same time people were cautious about using metro at all , even though other subway lines remained open .
popular blogger Nikolay Danilov ( aka LJ user nl ) posted pictures of the crowds &#91; RUS &#93; of commuters marching to their workplaces :
Muscovites getting to their workplaces , photo by Nikolay Danilov ( nl )
TV channels were not only slow but have also been accused for the lack of adequate attitude in their coverage of the event .
another popular blogger , Anton Nossik ( aka LJ user dolboeb ) , wrote &#91; RUS &#93; :
at 12 : 00 , Channel One began their regular news programme .
without any hurry , they told about subway bombings in Tokio ( 1995 ) , Baku , Paris , Dusselsdorf , London , about &#91; the Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovich &#93; ‘ s condolences , about the condolences sent by &#91; Ukrainian lawmakers &#93; , by Angela Merkel , Bernard Kushner .
then , very quickly , they gave a short report of all the major events in Moscow , one and a half minute long : 35 dead , 70 wounded , metro doesn &apos;t function from Komsomolskaya to Sportivnaya , there &apos;re traffic jams in the center , government demanding to increase security in all Russian airports .
for a couple of seconds , they had &#91; reporter &#93; Timur Seraziev reporting live from Lubyanka Square , and then they turned on the advertisements of healthy food , Pepsi , some Antistax , chocolate Inspiration , juice The Loved One , synthetic oils Mobil1 , window washing substance , new yogurt Apple Musli , Afobazol – a cure for anxiety and pressure , coffee Jacobs Monarch , wholegrain Nestle cornflakes .
each of these ads was longer than the live report from Lubyanka .
after the end of a 7-minute ad break , they started an unscheduled talk-shaw “ District . ”
both bloggers and news portals helped to fill the information vacuum .
news portal lifenews.ru posted a photo gallery &#91; RUS &#93; that included pictures of the blown-up subway train cars &#91; RUS &#93; .
LJ user seg _ o posted pictures &#91; RUS &#93; from the area near Park Kultury metro station .
both BBC and the Guardian set up their liveblogging page - LiveBlog &#91; EN &#93; and Live Coverage &#91; EN &#93; – tracking every major event happening .
LiveJournal opened up a special channel &#91; RUS &#93; to cover the topic .
below are some of the reports from those who survived the explosions :
oyolin :
I work at Lubyanka .
at school .
I start at 8 .
at 7 : 50 I arrived to Kuznetsky Most ( subway station ) .
I wanted to switch to Lubyanka , but everything was in smoke there , people were not allowed in .
I went out at Kuznetsky most .
on Lubynka Square they blocked everything , rescue teams arrived .
we have a critical situation here at work .
parents call , very nervous , moms are crying .
this is horrible .
kotikeksik :
I &apos;ve just managed to pull myself together .
I no longer tremble when I get up from the chair , I don &apos;t cry anymore .
I &apos;m trying to make myself work .
davete :
I was on my way out at Park Kultury ( subway station ) .
was about to exit the subway .
police officers are walking next to me .
a woman asks them :
- What &apos;s happened ?
- Well , some accident , technical reasons .
and at this very moment an explosion roared .
on the train going in the opposite direction , towards Kropotkinskaya station .
exploded somewhere in the middle .
there were not so many people , no stempede .
but the explosion was very powerful .
no doubt this bomb is a military-standard bomb .
Mali : fabric weaves an economical and cultural support
through videos , we see and learn about the cultural importance and economical boost that working with fabric is giving some people and organizations in Mali .
from a women &apos;s group which claim to have placed Mali as a power in the cloth dying industry , to artists who have decided to make Bogolanfini or mud dyed cloths their medium , to the touristic industry that has grown around this art .
first , via Craft : we learned of a recent fundraising activity Maureen Gosling organized to assist her in finishing her documentary about the women cloth dyers of Bamako ( Mali &apos;s capital city ) .
in this video preview , the women dyers speak about the importance their dyed cloth has in Mali and how working with it has impacted their lives :
another traditional textile is the mudcloth .
this next video from TravelWestAfrica shot in Ségou , we see how they make the dyes which include the mud that gives the cloth its name :
another name for the mudcloth is Bogolanfini ; in this following video by hubuf made in 2006 , a trainer explains to a group of students what bogolan is , what it &apos;s made of and what it means for Malian culture :
in this next video by claudiodumali we can see a group of visitors learning by doing ; with small scraps of cloth they experiment with the different dyes and muds used in Bogolan making in Ségou :
if you wish to know more about Bogolan , polbenmali has uploaded a 2 part documentary ( part 1 , part 2 ) on Issiaka Dembele , an artist who turned to Bogolan as his medium .
in the videos , Dembele speaks in French about his trade , but the images show clearly the intricate and time consuming process of dying the fabric yellow , covering it in pond mud left to rot for months which will turn the fabric black , and then going over the yellow areas to remove the dye in certain parts , painting over other colors in others :

Philippines : floods Hit Metro Manila and Nearby Provinces
strong rain has caused huge floods in many parts of Metro Manila and nearby provinces in the Luzon Island of the Philippines .
Metro Manila , the country ’ s main urban center , is composed of 17 cities and municipalities .
school classes and work in both the public and private sectors have been suspended already by the government .
the photos below , mainly from Facebook and Twitter , show the extent of the flooding in the metropolis and the situation could still worsen because the rains have not stopped as of this writing .

Twitter users are using the hashtags # rescueph and # prayforthephilippines to monitor the situation .
below is a tweet reminder for media reporters who are covering the unfolding disaster
@ katray : media friends , we appreciate the work .
I wish journalists are waterproof . but as they are not , I hope for their safety .
take care , folks .
Carl Ramota is disappointed with the delayed response of the president :
dear Aquino government , you should have done the briefing last night or early this morning .
we don &apos;t want to see you in your raincoats or jacket in a conference room , talking about the things that we already know or are now experiencing .
board amphibian vessels and do an ocular inspection of flooded areas .
go to evacuation centers and distribute relief goods .
do something !
don &apos;t just sit there and talk !
heads must roll .
Carlo Ople notes the role of new media in spreading awareness about the flooding :
as soon as the floods spread people started taking photos and uploading it on Facebook and Twitter .
their network started sharing and the network of their network shared as well until the photos became viral .
the photos showed how bad the situation was .
Angola : with Ebola Around the Corner , Borders Are Closed
due to a new outbreak of the ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the Angolan government has decided to shut down the border the two countries share , in an attempt to prevent the deadly virus entering the nation &apos;s territory . thus , the constant migratory movement between Lunda Norte ( a province in the northeast of the country ) and DR Congo has been summarily suspended .
it should be noted that the province of Lunda Norte is a gold mining area , a magnet for migrant workers .
Nelo de Carvalho writes at Blog do Nelo Ativado about the border restrictions and the challenges the government faces :
“ To say that the borders must be temporarily closed and that no one should enter or leave the country , using that direction or border .
not even the dengue mosquito may enter , and should it come , it must be pursued .
it is a strategy that any infant would take in his hours playing soldier or guerrilla , or even a general .
therefore , we have no authority or jurisdiction to guess at it .
we can only wish for luck and hope that everything works out well .
at the beginning of the year , we wish the best of luck to Angolans , with or without ebola . ”
according to the Angolan Secretary of Health , the government is preparing to inform the public about the plan put in place to prevent infection by this powerful virus .
these measures will be implemented , in addition to Lunda Norte , in the Moxico , Malanje , Uige and Lunda Sul provinces .
it is believed there have been about 40 cases of ebola , with over 10 deaths reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the last two months .
two years ago , also coming from DR Congo , namely from the Western Kasai province , the virus caused the death of about 180 people .
the Lampeirota blog lamments this situation :
“ From time to time , they speak about the disease .
I don &apos;t have the habit of thinking about it , I shield behind the idea that it is unlikely to catch me off guard .
this &#91; way of thinking &#93; is wrong .
today we can no longer be sure of things like this .
it reaches everywhere , quickly .
I am very sorry for those people who are facing this enemy .
it is not death that scares me .
it is the road towards it “
according to the WHO representative in Angola , Diosdado Nsue-Micawg , it is suspected that the handling of dead monkeys in the forests of DR Congo is the basis of the reappearance of the disease .
although fortunately there are no cases of Ebola in Angola , the health secretary says the country is prepared to deal with any eventuality because of its experience with Marburg haemorrhagic fever , a less dangerous virus similar to ebola .
this is the fourth time that the ebola virus has broken out in DR Congo , since the first in 1976 .
the highly infectious disease causes fever , vomiting , diarrhea and internal and external bleeding .
in 2005 329 people died from Marburg in Angola &apos;s northern town of Uige , close to the border with DR Congo .

Haiti : online Maps Shift from Charting Damage to Targeting Aid
here are some maps that humanitarian aid responders are using to communicate the evolving situation in Haiti ’ s earthquake zone .
nearly a week after the disaster — and aftershocks equal to major temblors — the maps and satellite imagery are proving some of the most reliable information available .
the Ushahidi Network has created a very detailed interactive map overlaying information on threats , people needing assistance , medical care , food and other aid availability by type .
the map is being updated as information is received via the Ushahidi network , Twitter and Web form .
Ushahidi &apos;s Erik Hersman , in an email message , said the system was processing mostly web and Twitter communication in the first days after the quake , because cell networks were down in much of southern Haiti .
that &apos;s changing and cell service , which is more widely distributed , “ is bringing in a lot more reports . ”
crisis Commons , a network of technology professionals that creates tools for humanitarian relief response , has announced that it has undertaken a similar project to map relief efforts and to generate a crisis-specific baseline map of Haiti ’ s capital , Port-au-Prince , for relief agencies to use as planning reference .
the project has just begun .
in New York City , the New York Public Library has a series of maps online showing camps where survivors are finding shelter .
a second set identifies damaged areas and buildings .
they are being edited and updated .
most other imagery is not interactive , but arguably gives a broader overview of the situation .
this image from the Center for Satellite Based Crisis Information measures distances from the quake ’ s epicenter to where people lived in southern Haiti pre-quake .
it ’ s color-coded to reflect population density .
according to the map , the Hatian state of Leogane , though it has not been identified by name in many news reports , was the quake ’ s epicenter , and contains several heavily-populated areas .
Carrefour , a large suburb of Port-au-Prince , is on Leogane state &apos;s border .
the city of Jacmel , on the coast , is also in Leogane and badly damaged .
as of late yesterday , broken roads and bridges were still cutting off the area , which is closer to the epicenter than Port au Prince is , from receiving aid .
the US Geological Survey has put information into a very easy to read chart of cities by population , color-coded by the quake ’ s intensity .
the result is a very fast way to understand just how many people were living in the places hit hardest by the disaster .
USGS has also posted a map of the earthquake reports it has received by phone .
it shows perceptions from people phoning the USGS to tell them what they saw .
the NYTimes has created a three-dimensional map that is extremely useful for understanding where Port-au-Prince lies in relation to Haiti ’ s geology .
it shows the city in a coastal plan at the foot of a range of mountains that complicate aid delivery .
the Times ’ map also explains very clearly the location of several neighborhoods where medical aid and food distribution has begun , and shelter has become haltingly available .
direct satellite imagery is available here .
Orbital images taken as recently as yesterday are being compared to images of Port-au-Prince and the environs before the quake , like this one .
the satellite view can determine damage and needs in areas that still do not have reliable communication .
in theory , night imagery should be able to tell us something similar about electricity , the availability of light , and perhaps fuel .
but if those images are in use , they haven ’ t been made public yet .

the Pope in Cameroon ( 1 ) : Yaoundé Clean Up Controversy
Pope Benedict XVI is visiting Cameroon from 17 to 20 March 2009 .
this has led the government to take some radical clean-up measures as described by Griet , Thorsten , Jara and Lisa blog :
1 All small shops , houses , vendor &apos;s stalls that don &apos;t look nice enough are being destroyed with a large caterpillar .
the truck comes by , looks at your stall / house / whatever and if the driver doesn &apos;t like , he just destroys it with all its content .
it all started about a week ago in the city centre .
suddenly the streets did not house streetvendors anymore , all the local shops at the post office disappeared etc .
now it &apos;s been extended all the way to the airport .
2 The road to the airport has brand new streetlights .
but then ONLY the way from the airport to the town centre .
3 Tuesday ( for sure , other days to be confirmed ) the road between airport and town centre will be blocked .
note : the pope arrives in the evening , but the road needs to be blocked from EARLY MORNING .
hence nobody can get to / from work , school etc .
this post also links to another blog by an expertriate family Sander Elke en Milan that has has photos of the destruction to roadside shops in the streets of Yaounde .
this demolition has sparked a debate on the blogs of two expatriates in Cameroon .
Συγκακοπαθησον a blog maintained by a missionary in Cameroon posted on the changes to the outlook of Yaounde as a aresult of the Pope &apos;s coming .
so what ’ s my take on the whole thing ?
it ’ s nice that the city is getting a face-lift – it sure makes things look a lot nicer , and the big street lights make driving at night or trying to get a taxi along the main route so much easier and safer – but it ’ s sad that this clean-up has to mean the destruction of people ’ s way of life .
unfortunately , these people were simply ignorant of the “ rules , ” some willfully so , and are now facing the consequences .
the sad part is that it seems the government was content to just let things be ( possibly for as long as 10 years or longer ) until something big came up , like the Pope ’ s arrival .
if they had taken these structures down as soon as they went up , there wouldn ’ t be this kind of destruction of people ’ s livelihood now .
then again , I guess the law is still the law even when it ’ s not enforced .
this point of view wasn &apos;t really shared by British-born VSO volunteer blogging at Our Man in Cameroon .
his reaction in a post entitled Impossible Missionary was simple :
street stalls are a way of life here .
they are everywhere .
it ’ s easy just to say they are illegal but they can be pretty solid structures .
what ’ s more , if they are illegal I ’ d imagine that they have only been allowed to remain because someone , somewhere is taking a regular few thousands Francs in bribes .
people here struggle .
you can bet these structures don ’ t turn over much and in a country where enterprise and entrepreneurship is so minimal … well what a way to reward it.I ask you , if you are in general agreement with what I have written and also find the missionary ’ s take as ignorant as I do , to leave a comment .
not below but instead on the missionaries own blog .
however , readers still commented on this story on the Our Man in Cameroon blog .
the reactions got to a point that , Karis , the wife of the missionary stepped-up in defence of her husband :
I never knew my husband could cause such a stir .
I think sometimes we think that only people that know us read our blogs and those people know how to take what we write instead of tearing it apart line by line without knowing us at all .
Trav , thanks for putting in a good word .
dad A , thanks for the humor .
you always put a smile on my face .
I just wish all of you that commented here and on his blog knew my husband — you wouldn ’ t be so harsh as you pull apart sentences .
he and I have had many conversations about how horrible it is that people ’ s livelihood is taken away from them and all for a few days visit from the Pope .
when we were in town on Monday and saw stuff being thrown into trucks , it made me sick to my stomach .
more than once , we said , “ But how are people going to eat tonight ?
and the next day and the next day ? ” It goes even beyond that in …
and then today , I saw him helping people move their sewing machines , their tables , their bags of stuff farther down on our road as the government came through with the bulldozer .
no , that was not emphasized enough in this post to show all of our conversations and actions , but wow … that doesn ’ t mean that my husband doesn ’ t feel for the people here !
maybe I can convince him to write another post , but I ’ m not sure because it may be best just to leave this rather than getting things torn apart again .
I ’ d better just stop .
a wife sticking up for her wonderful husband isn ’ t much of a mind changer .
the exchanges did not end at that .
this Papal visit has quite some twists to it on the blogoshpere !
Madagascar &apos;s forests decimated for $ 460,000 a day
as the world &apos;s nations gather today in Copenhagen for the United Nations Convention on Climate Change , Madagascar , having already lost 90 % of its original forest , faces continued threats from black market logging .
an illegal traffic of rosewood , a topic of conversation in the Malagasy mediasphere for a few months , has now been thoroughly exposed by an undercover team of investigators .
the details of this very profitable traffic have been made public and shared by many citizen bloggers and scientific publications .
the latest report produced by Global Witness and Environmental Investigation Agency ( EIA ) states that about $ 460,000 USD worth of trade is cut down each day , with enforcement efforts hampered by the continued absence of a government of national unity .
the full report is available here ( and in French here ) .
rosewood via Achille52 , at http : / / reflexiums.wordpress.com
the report contains names of perpetrators and the volume of the illegal traffic .
Malagasy blogger Achille quotes from the report ( fr ) :
in 2009 , eight containers left the port of Vohemar with 19,730 round logs and 50,584 flat logs in 324 containers authorised by the MEF ( see annex 9 ) .
this is the equivalent of 9700 tons of rosewood .
video showing the life of the villagers living in the area demonstrates that they clearly did not benefit from the rosewood traffic :
when one compares the $ 460,000 a day from the trade with the fact that 89 % of the Malagasy population live with less than $ 2 a day , it is easy to understand why corruption and inequality are commonly regarded as the main obstacles to human development in Madagascar .
another independent report supported by the Jane Goodall Institute Schweiz was published this week confirming the extent of what the authors , Schuurman and Lowry , call the “ Madagascar Rosewood Massacre ” ( pdf ) .
the authors also contributed to this video to raise awareness of the extent of the loss in biodiversity due to the traffic :
the US Senate legislated on this issue and Congressman Blumenauer ( D-Oregon ) wrote in a statement :
after a coup in March , the new and weakened government of Andry Rajoelina issued sweeping decrees allowing the harvest and export of wood from protected forests and World Heritage Sites .
the Obama administration has condemned the de facto government , and the Wildlife Conservation Society , the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , and Conservation International have denounced the wholesale exploitation of some of the world &apos;s most diverse forests and decimation of the local population &apos;s resources and livelihoods
the rosewood scandal have now had a serious impact in the political process of Madagascar .
former president Albert Zafy threatened to disclose names in the current Rajoelina government if a solution to unblock the deadlock over the government of national union is not found soon .
the necessity to reach a government of national union is also pressed on by the conditionality of foreign investments by the United States ( AGOA and MCC ) and the European Union ( fr ) ( NB : 70 % of the Malagasy government budget come from foreign aid ) .
Interestingly , this decree allowed for the legal investigation of Gibson guitars .
their headquarters were raided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service because the guitars were made from rosewood from the illegal traffic in Madagascar .
judging from reactions of Twitter users around the world , the fact that Gibson guitars were implicated provoked more reactions that the potential loss of the ring-tail lemur habitat .
the issue of deforestation in Madagascar is unfortunately not limited to rosewood trafficking .
slash and burn agriculture has caused much of the anthropogenic deforestation of the region .
the NGO Vakanala has produced a remarkable 3D real time visualization of the numbers of bush fires affecting Madagascar :
image via http : / / vakanala.org
Similarily , the Malagasy NGO Mistinjo has also focused its effort on capacity building of local communities that work towards forest restoration and carbon sequestration in Andasibe .
local bloggers have been raising awareness over the loss of the national rain forest for a long time ago now .
but they do more than just raising awareness , Patrick , a blogger from Tamatave , has been steadily replanting trees in the Toamasina region and involved many other associations in this process :

a screenshot of the Face the Balkans website .
fifteen young journalists from six different countries have produced a series of personal stories about representatives of the minorities ( in a broad sense ) from Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kosovo , Serbia , and Macedonia .
the stories are available in English , German , and French on the Face the Balkans website .
Haiti : experiences of the Earthquake
so far the casualty reports from Haiti &apos;s earthquake have focused on the terrifying statistics , but very few names had been attached to those numbers .
unfortunately , today , popular Dominican blogger Guillermo Peña confirmed he lost his father , Guillermo Peña Sr. , in the disaster .
the elder Peña was working in Port au Prince as an engineer with the Santo Domingo construction firm Mera , Muñoz &amp; Fondeur .
a coworker of Mr. Pena &apos;s also died .
a third was injured but has been successfully evacuated to Plaza de la Salud hospital in Santo Domingo and is receiving treatment .
many Dominican and Spanish-language bloggers have already expressed their condolences to Guillermo Peña , Jr . , who is posting his thoughts via Twitter .
the DR is feeling the quake ’ s aftermath in other ways .
Dominican blogger Jose Sille ’ claims , also via Twitter , that CESFRONT , the Dominican border patrol , is beginning to encounter Haitians desperate to flee the country .
the rumor of survivors moving to cross the border are unconfirmed , but the Dominican government has announced that the border crossings were open as normal .
the Haitian embassy in Santo Domingo is reported to be providing transportation for Haitians wishing to go to their country .
land lines are reported still down : Haiti &apos;s cell phone service has fared better .
large carrier Voila ’ sustained damage but is still working , according to Voila ’ ’ s parent company , Trilogy International Partners of Seattle , Washington , USA .
Eddyson Volcimé , who lives in Nantes , France , was able to use a cell phone to call his mother in Port au Prince shortly after the ‘ quake .
he gave an interview to a local news channel :
Haiti : après le séisme , témoignage d &apos;un Nantais
uploaded by presseocean .
– News videos from around the world .
she has no news about the rest of the family though … given that no transport is functioning everybody is on foot , so its really difficult to communicate .
Interviewer : and your mother , whereabouts on the island was she at the time ?
EV : she was in Port-au Prince itself , the epicentre of the quake .
Interviewer : she told you what happened on the telephone ?
EV : she told me what happened to her , we can &apos;t tell what it was like everywhere .
she was in a restaurant at the time the earthquake started , so there was a lot of panic .
some people died in the restaurant itself , as it caved in .
she managed to get out .
since then … well , since then , people are in the streets … well , those who had not had injuries that were too serious in any case .
Interviewer : are you worried ?
EV : for my mother- well , she is ok , everything is fine .
for the rest of the family … we just don &apos;t know at the moment , we haven &apos;t heard anything … we are waiting for news .
there have been victims , and many injured …
Interviewer : and psychologically is your mother ok ?
EV : my goodness !
she has seen a lot in her life , but she is ok , she is alright .
on the ground in Port au Prince , others are still collecting themselves .
survivor Jean Francois Labadie posted his recollections of the disaster a few hours after midnight this morning :
first earthquake , umpteenth tremor
12 : 30 PM : we really need to wish it would be the last one … Seriously , never live twice …
towards 4 : 45 PM , with our driver , we enter the parking lot of Karibean , Pétion-ville &apos;s big mart .
as usual , the way in is slowed by the usual Delmas traffic .
while driving up the entry , our Patrol began to dance .
I was imagining three or four boys standing on the bumper wanting to swing the car .
in front of us , the parking lot ground rocked like the waves at Wahoo Bay .
the Karibean building started to dance and in 3 seconds ’ time completely tumbled down .
a white cloud swept across the parking lot and you could see zombies whitened by dust appearing , in complete panic .
once the dust has settled again – although the phrase is premature – the heap of concrete from the 4-storied building seems to leave no survivor .
madness has taken over the passers-by trying to seek refuge in the Patrol while the security guards – including one seriously wounded – shut the gate behind us .
the driver , having understood quicker than me what was the matter , is putting all his efforts into praying .
he yells his incantations , his arms to the sky .
far from piercing my eardrums , he calms me down .
he is giving sense to this madness going on under our eyes .
after five minutes of torpor , the few motorists able to drive back home force the guards to open the 15 ft high fence .
the sight of Delmas looks distressing , astounding .
we will be driving for an hour between collapsed buildings , people running , weeping and yelling their faith in Jesus and calling him with arm signs , heads whitened by dust eying in disbelief , injured people , corpses or bits of them … Jean-Claude goes on energetically singing his faith during the whole trip .
my atheism is being lulled by my colleague &apos;s religious enthusiasm .
the scenes unfold as in a movie seen a thousand times .
I even manage to keep down my anxiety not being able to get back to Jehanne by noticing that the one-storied buildings held out the tremors .
I &apos;ll hug her before she understands how big the disaster is , as things were better in her part of town .
we get ready for our first night fearing the tremors which filled our evening .
our landlord-architect has our complete trust .
till later .
as of this afternoon , the first aid flights are reported to have landed at Haiti ’ s main airport .

Tanzania : 2010 General Elections Roundup
Tanzanians will go to the polls on 31 October 2010 to elect the President of the United Republic of Tanzania , President of Zanzibar , Members of Parliament and Members of the Zanzibar House of Representatives .
this is a roundup of blog posts about the elections .
Tom Rhodes reports that the Tanzanian government has threatened the press ahead of the elections :
whether the Tanzanian press feel at liberty to cover this tight race is another matter .
critical reporting on the government during this sensitive time appeared risky after Ministry of Information Permanent Secretary Sethi Kamuhanda toured print media offices earlier this month , threatening to shutter any media house that “ put the government in a bad light , ” state television reported .
more than 50 human rights and media organizations issued a joint statement last week , claiming the government has threatened the press in advance of the forthcoming elections .
since polling began , the Registrar of Newspapers , a government-run licensing agency , has been busy issuing letters to newspapers , warning against any negative coverage of the government , local journalists told CPJ .
three private weeklies , Mwanahalisi , Raia Mwena , and Tanzania Daima have all been warned by the Registrar to avoid coverage deemed “ inciteful ” by the government or face suspension .
“ Such kinds of threats have been common from the Registrar of Newspapers , whom the minister &#91; of information &#93; uses as a means to enforce self-censorship , ” the chairman of the Tanzania Editors ’ Forum , Absalom Kibanda , told me .
the country &apos;s leading Kiswahili daily , Mwananchi , received two letters from the Registrar recently threatening to suspend the paper for negative government coverage , Managing Editor Theophil Makunga told me .
ZanziBits says that the absence of violence in 2010 election campaigns in Zanzibar shows that people have embraced democracy :
in past election years , there was political violence in Zanzibar as people prepared for the elections , but not this time .
all of the campaigning has been peaceful and secure .
these are good signs for our country , because it shows that our people are embracing democracy and becoming involved in the political process .
campaigning officially ends on October 30 .
on October 31 , the Tanzanian people will choose their new leader .
we all hope that it is someone who is fairly elected and who will bring development to our country .
above all , we all hope that our elections are as peaceful as the campaigns have been .
God bless Tanzania and its islands .
Labda Hata Mimi writes about Tanzania election and the growing tech community :
there is now an Ushahidi Election Violence , Issue and Rioting Reporting Map instance up for the Tanzanian elections taking place next Sunday .

as of last week , one of four polls suggests opposition may have an edge .
I do not take a position for any party in the elections but I do hope that they are carried out peacefully .
I especially hope that my friends in country , Watanzania and Wamerikani alike , are safe .
( as Pernille points out , UCHAGUZI is a collaborative initiative between TACCEO , Tanzania ; HIVOS , Netherlands ; Haki Elimu , Tanzania ; the biggest Tz national ICT community Jamii Forums , Tanzania ; Rakesh Rajani ’ s TWAWEZA , CRECO , Kenya in association with USHAHIDI and SODNET , Kenya as technology &amp; strategy partners .
Pernille announces the launch of Uchaguzi Tanzania :
Uchaguzi , TZ is a platform that leverages on USHAHIDI &apos;s web and mobile-based technology software , enabling unprecedented collaboration between election observers and citizens to monitor elections in near-real time .
check it out now – the Tanzania elections are on Sunday , and it will be interesting to see how the crow-sourching tool will boost information in this regard .
Kenyan blogger , Chris , asks , “ Will there be trouble in Tanzania after election ? ” :
on Sunday Kenya ’ s next door neighbours , Tanzania go to the polls .
the reality on the ground is that the Tanzanians have been watching with great interest and then envy as Kenya has gone through a very eventful two years or so .
Tanzanians are now asking why ordinary folks in their country cannot be like Kenyans who to them appear to be very much aware of their rights and willing to fight for them .
I was shocked beyond words recently when I overheard ordinary Tanzanians in a Dar-es-salaam surburb discussing Sunday ’ s polls and saying that it would be a good idea to stock up in food and stay indoors , expecting the worst .
he continues :
to most Kenyans ( like the guys who never miss an opportunity to spew tribal hatred in this blog ) it would be mighty difficult to understand Tanzanian politics .
tribalism hardly exists in this country that is almost the size of both Kenya and Uganda put together and boasts of over 140 tribes ( to Kenya ’ s 40 something ) .
neither is there a history of certain tribes reigning supreme over others .
the one man who must take the most credit for this unity that is rare to find in any African country is the founding father the late Mwalimu Julius Kabarage Nyerere .
while Kenya ’ s Tom Mboya and Jomo Kenyatta prided themselves in national symbols based on strong animals like the lion , Nyerere quietly chose the unassuming Giraffe .
and there is plenty of proof in the man ’ s life that he was able to see extremely far into the horizon so much so that he still holds great sway even from the grave .
Nyerere unified the country by aggressively adopting the Swahili language into the fabric and way of life of Tanzanians .
Jerry Okungu advises Tanzanians not to fall into Kenya &apos;s trap of election violence :
three different newspapers published in Dar es Salaam cannot be wrong especially if one of them , the oldest , belongs to the CCM .
they are all saying more-or-less the same thing ; that there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air .
they are all expressing fear that Bongoland ’ s elections may be rigged in favor of the ruling party based on the mood in the country that seems to be craving for regime change in the land of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere .
signs that all is not well are clearly brought out in the latest opinion results conducted by Research and Education in Democracy in Tanzania ( REDET ) , a state owned research center housed at the University of Dar es Salaam , Synovate of Kenya and several online surveys conducted by Daily News , Uhuru Publications and ThisDay newspaper published by Reginald Mengi ’ s outfit .
in the run-up to the Kenyan elections in 2007 , we had a similar scenario where opinion polls became the centre of vicious debates , claims and counter claims of doctored results depending on who or which party was favored or dismissed by the polls .
whenever an opinion poll favored PNU , other parties and their supporters dismissed it as cooked .
on the other hand , if another pollster published results that favored ODM , other players routinely dismissed it as bogus .
VijanaFM blog lists technology initiatives that revolve around people-to-people reporting on election issues :
a few weeks ago we told you we started TZelect , an Ushahidi-based platform that aims to collect and discuss reports from East African youth about election events .
recently we were contacted by a few organizations who have put together a similar platform , Uchaguzi Tanzania , which allows for reports to be sent in via SMS .
both TZelect and Uchaguzi Tanzania are focussed on the immediete elections being held in Tanzania on October 31st of this year , as well as the long-term progress of elected candidates in office .
however , while Uchaguzi Tanzania is built to accomodate hour-to-hour updates from the general public on the ground in Tanzania , TZelect is built to collect continuous , analytical discussions about these election events , specifically from youth .
an American in Tanzania writes about her experience at a political rally for the main opposition party , Chadema :
on Thursday afternoon I attended a Chadema ( Chama Cha Demokracia na Maendeleo , or Party of Democracy and Development ) political rally for Doctor Slaa , the most popular opposition presidential candidate on the mainland .
despite the fact that he never showed up ( TIA , right ? ) and that I only understood about 40 % of what various candidates yelled crazy-African-preacher-style over the loudspeaker , it was a really interesting and enlightening experience .
I made friends with two high school teachers and we discussed ( in Swahili !
) the election , the history of Tanzania , and the platforms and promises of various parties and candidates .
Bangladesh Unites at Shahbag for 42-Year-Old War Crimes
drop by drop , the Shahbag intersection in Bangladesh &apos;s capital city Dhaka has become an ocean of people , demanding justice for atrocities committed during the country &apos;s 1971 liberation war and death penalty for war criminals .
according to some estimates as many as 500,000 people are at Shahbag .
ten days ago , the Bloggers and Online Activists Network ( BOAN ) called for protests after the Secretary General of Bangladesh &apos;s Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami Abdul Quader Mollah was found guilty of war crimes committed during 1971 .
he was sentenced to life in prison on 344 counts of murder , rape and arson by the International Crimes Tribunal on 5 February 2013 .
since Bangladesh &apos;s law allows death by hanging for heinous crimes , most people expected Quader Mollah to be taken to the gallows .
when he wasn &apos;t they took to the streets and to Facebook .

popular poet and a professor of Jahangirnagar University Khaled Hossain hopes for success of the Shahbag movement .
he writes on his Facebook wall :
this awakening is not from greed or material profit .
this is an aesthetic outcome of collective positive thoughts .
we have nothing to gain except victory .
blogger , writer and teacher Moom Rahaman calls everyone to join in at the Shahbag intersection :
those youth who are in the city and have not managed to come to Shahbag , please know that you are far away from history , away from the present and future .
still you have time to come besides us .
those who are young , this is the right time to go to Shahbag .
Tausif Hamim is a youth who is staying overnight to show solidarity to the protests .
Vaskar Abedin shares Hamim &apos;s status :
I go to Shahbag three times aday , shout slogans , when I am tired , I scratch my head , look around , see with wonder that the lamp posts have become hanging posts .
Quader Mollah &apos;s effigy is hanging in that post .
I learn new words – S for Saka Chowdhury , You are Razakar , G for Golam Azam , You are Razakar .
when I am hungry , I come back home , eat my lunch and go back to Shahbag .
the evening rolls in , the slogans get intense , as it becomes dark the burning torches smells like retribution , I collect all the used torches , put paper on the spilled kerosene , become more tired , eat peanuts and burn the peanut shells with burning candles .

a number of private TV channels are broadcasting these ongoing protests .
because of these broadcasts , Lucky Akter , a leading protester has become popular for her fiery slogans .
British-Bangladeshi Morshed Akhter writes :
from today Lucky Akter is my sister .
and in this way Lucky Akters become our sisters , “ next to kin ” .
lot of love for you .
Shimul Bashar , a reporter of a private TV channel has hopes for the # Shahbag protests :
I reiterate that these days of Shahbag will be part of history .
I do not have anything greater than this in my life .
Mama , i can &apos;t sleep .
I keep thinking about Shahbag .
I remember the faces .
many people across the board have supported the cause but Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus is keeping mum so far .
Azad Master noticed this :
Non-Nobel Dr. Zafar Iqbal has came to the podium with his wife to shout slogans .
but Nobel Laureate Dr. Yunus is keeping mum this time also .

Saikat Shuvro Aic questions Bangladesh Nationalist Party &apos;s ( the largest opposition party ) – position on the ongoing protests :
oh BNP !
the do not have voice , or foresight !
oh God , please save this party .
many think that the protests are government supported .
others think that this shows a failure of the government .
but Bijoy Mazumdar does not agree :
in politics , there is no scope to misunderstand what people want .
the people politics is for the people .
the peoples ’ politics is against injustice , repression and oppression .
the peoples ’ politics is not for power , to free the power from corruption .
those who are protesting in Shahbag , they are not doing it to empower any party .
their fight is to establish justice .
this protest in the awakening of the younger generation &#91; .. &#93;
some are thinking that this protest is a ploy of the ruling party to hide their failures in different areas .
I have a different answer .
those who are uniting and asking justice for a 42 year old crime , one day the same crowd will be vocal against those who are doing rampant corruption .
this is the same crowd that become vocal in 1971 and clinched our freedom .
in 2013 the same crowd has erupted , with a different purpose , for justice .
every day songs , poems and skits are being created .
leading singer and member of the Parliament of West Bengal , India , Kabir Suman has extended his support to the # Shahbag protests by creating songs such as the “ demands of the mass ” and the “ whole night in Shahbag . ”
every day , new Facebook accounts are being opened for and against the movement .
those for the protests include Shahbag Movement and Projonmo Square and those against are Voice of Nationalist and Bamboo Castle .
the protesters have vowed to keep Shahbag occupied till their demands are met .
Mozambique : citizen mobilization to help flood victims

Martinique : on independence and French “ paternalism ”
Martinique blogger le blog de &#91; moi &#93; &#91; FR &#93; , in another post on the ongoing workers ’ movement in Martinique and Guadeloupe , takes issue with Christophe Barbier , opinion editor of the French news magazine , L &apos;Express .
in a recent interview on the radio show C dans l &apos;air , Barbier responded to an SMS from a listener who asked , “ Why don &apos;t we just grant the overseas departments their independence ? ” Barbier replied :
“ ( … ) Whether it becomes a tourist factory for Americans , immediately fall under the control of local mafias who &#91; bring about &#93; the whitening &#91; of the country &#93; , or a new Haiti , independence is not possible without economic prosperity !
it would immediately become a dependent of another country which would be worse than being a dependent of France . ”
Le blog de &#91; moi &#93; is livid :
really Christophe Barbier ? ? ? ?
! and here , let me tell you , frankly ( and those who have been reading me for awhile know my position on the subject ) : there is good reason to become pro-independence !
the remark , the condescending tone used , the disdain … it &apos;s all there !
because if in the end one day we decide effectively to skip a step and become independence , that will be our choice , whatever the consequences , right !
after us &#91; the French &#93; chaos ? ? ?
those big babies &#91; the overseas departments &#93; won &apos;t know how to defend themselves or avoid the obstacles attached to becoming a sovereign state ?
that &apos;s the sales pitch to explain why the overseas departments must stay in the lap of the French ?
Jesus !
in a comment , Elsie disagrees Barbier &apos;s comments were necessarily condescending :
… Maybe all he wanted to say was that a country as small as Martinique ( or Guadeloupe ) , in an environment as violent as the Caribbean , would have a hard time existing and keeping the drug lords and the gangs , rife in the region , at bay without the support of a great power ( the United States instead of France ? ) .
it &apos;s not a question of knowing whether the people who would lead the country would be competent or not , it &apos;s just to say that a small country , because of its military insignificance , can only live in the shadow of a larger country which protects it …
but Elsie does take issue with the idea that only France can offer that kind of protection .
wk de l &apos;ile cites many examples where Barbier &apos;s comments ring true :
wk de l &apos;ile continues :
I must admit that , in the face of a certain contempt on the part of the government and when I read certain comments by readers of Le Monde , Le Figaro , La Libération … I am really fed up with seeing so much ignorance about who we are … Caribbean French … that I also have my own little pro-independence crisis …
my only hope is that by taking an example from the successes and failures of the countries of our region , taking into account our unique history and our connections with mainland France , Africa and Asia , that we won &apos;t shoot ourselves in the foot and that we &apos;ll put in place institutions and an economic development that really takes into account who we are .
Basing our political future on a closed identity , fed by nationalist ideology , is , in my opinion , a dangerous path .
let &apos;s make transcontinental Republic a reality ( to cite Marlène Parize &apos;s beautiful concept ) …
Clinton visits Indonesia
United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Indonesia last Wednesday .
she affirmed “ Indonesia ’ s role in handling global problems , including terrorism , protectionism , climate change and the economic crisis . ” Indonesia is the largest Muslim nation in the world and the third largest democracy .
aside from meeting the leaders of Indonesia , Clinton found the time to visit a slum community in Jakarta .
she also appeared in a teen-oriented TV show .
everything Indonesia believes Clinton &apos;s visit to Indonesia starts a new era in American foreign policy :
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s visit to Indonesia starts a new era in American foreign policy .
a lot less unilateral arrogance , a lot more inclusiveness and so-called smart power .
Mbak Rita observes that Clinton looks younger today :
“ I really think that she looks younger and more goodlooking , maybe it was because of her constant smile she gave during her visit here … Some people on some boring TV talkshow mentioned previously that Jakarta is a little overreacted with her visit .
I am glad that I was wrong about that . ”
Devi Girsang was surprised about Jakarta ’ s traffic on the day Clinton arrived :
as a Jakartan who used to stuck in traffic , I tend to be panicky if the streets are quiet and deserted look-alike .
there are only two things popped in my mind in that case ; there &apos;s a bomb terror or rampages .
remember 1998 Jakarta riots or 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing ?
then you must know what I mean
around 2 PM today , it turned out to be US Secretary of States Hillary Clinton &apos;s arrival in Jakarta that stopped the traffic !
lucky for me , there &apos;s still battery power remained on my digital camera to take a few snapshots .
Therry , in a comment , wonders if the US sent a fake Clinton :
I saw the speech Hillary made on television and I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s just me but that woman doesn &apos;t look exactly like Hillary .
I &apos;m starting to think the US government sent a fake one to us , because that woman looks too old and motherly to be Hillary !
not everybody was cheering the visit of Hillary Clinton in Indonesia .
picture from Jakarta Today
Andreas Harsono wanted Clinton to raise the issues of religious freedom , impunity , and military reform during her visit :
“ ( Clinton ) should be careful not to say that Muslims in Indonesia are “ moderate , ” as most diplomatic visitors like to say .
for members of persecuted religious groups in Indonesia , it is a useless and inaccurate cliche .
“ Concern over rising religious intolerance is not the only human rights issue Clinton should raise with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .
freedom of expression is also a huge problem on islands where ethnic minorities show their resistance toward the Indonesian state .
but in Indonesia , even peaceful acts like a flag raising can land you in jail for a long time
“ Clinton may be tempted to gloss over issues like religious freedom , impunity , and military reform , in favor of closer Indonesian-US ties .
but if she does , she ’ ll miss a golden opportunity to transform the lives of many people in Indonesia who need pressure on the government to recognize their rights . ”
via Twitter , below are some reactions to the Clinton visit :
waxinglyrical : someone asked who is Hillary Clinton ?

Uzbekistan : playing Politics on Facebook
Facebook seems to have started playing an important role in Uzbek politics .
however , so far it is more a tool for playing games with fake accounts , rather than an instrument of civil protests .
planted suicide story ?
on 6 December , 2011 , Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty reported on a suicide committed by a young woman in the western Uzbek city of Andijan .
after coming home on vacation , Gulsumoi Abdujalilova , a 32-year-old university student in Germany , was allegedly interrogated by police for four days .
according to the Uzbek NGO Human Rights Alliance , Abdujalilova was beaten at the police station and forced to write statements against Muhammad Salih , the self-exiled leader of the opposition People &apos;s Movement of Uzbekistan ( PMU ) .
the movement was formed in May 2011 from a number of foreign-based Uzbek opposition movements and rights organizations and stated its goal as being the downfall of President Islam Karimov &apos;s regime .
Facebook profile picture of Gulsumoy Abdujalilova , which is actually a photo of turkish model Armine Eşarpları
according to her Facebook account , Abdujalilova was a supporter of this movement , and a person with the name Muhammad Salih was among her Facebook friends . that was the reason , some netizens believe , that the young woman came to attention of the Uzbek authorities .
however , the PMU website has stated &#91; uz &#93; that Abdujalilova was never a member of the opposition movement .
it ’ s worth mentioning that Interior Ministry officials in Andijan gave no comment .
Abdujalilova ’ s relatives ( according to her Facebook profile she is married , and Human Rights Alliance mentioned Abdujalilova ’ s sister who allegedly found her suicide note ) have also kept silent .
the story became more perplexing when two days later , on 8 December , the opposition site Uzmetronom.com published an article with the results of a journalistic investigation , carried out by the website .
the author of the article , who remained anonymous , concluded that the entire story is provocation prepared by Muhammad Salih to destabilize Uzbek society and gain international attention .
the story has attracted the attention of netizens .
one of them comments on the idea that it may have been planted by members of the Uzbek opposition in order to smear the Uzbek government .
other suggest that it was made up by the national security services to show people the dangers of supporting the opposition movement .
it still remains unclear who could benefit from the made-up story and probably this will not be known .
Sarah Kendzior from Registan.net sums up :
&#91; ... &#93; it reveals a great deal of how rumor operates on the Uzbek political internet .
the assumption that all information is unreliable , and all sources biased , has had the perverse effect of ensuring that all rumor is taken seriously .
Prime Minister ’ s fake Facebook account
another topic that has sparked controversy among Uzbek bloggers was the Facebook account of Uzbekistan ’ s Prime-Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev .
his Facebook page , created early in May this year , has about 2,000 friends and identifies him as a 100 % Muslim with conservative political views , interested in women and married .
Catherine A. Fitzpatrick from Eurasianet.org comments :
&#91; … &#93; you can see that Mirziyoyev is inspired by Nicolas Sarkozy , Lee Myung-bak , Barack Obama , Vladimir Putin and &#91; … &#93; Islam Karimov .
his gmail address is provided , so write and ask any questions !
don &apos;t expect any cat or dog photos , however .
others wonder why the Prime Minister doesn ’ t have a personal page on Uzbekistan ’ s local social network Muloqot.uz and speculate that the main goal of his Facebook page is to attract a Western audience .
however , after a semi-official statement from the Prime Minister &apos;s “ offline office ” about contacting the Facebook administration with a request to delete the page , it became clear that the account is not authentic .
dangers of being too public
this is not the first time that high-ranking Uzbek public figures ’ names have been used for suspicious accounts in social networks .
early this May the blogosphere discussed two Twitter accounts which were affiliated with President Karimov ’ s daughter Gulnara Karimova . the first one , @ GuliKarimova , does not exist anymore .
however the second one , @ GulnaraKarimova , is active and has over 1,800 followers
as we see , social networks in Uzbekistan are getting used in some games with political background .
therefore Hugh Raiser from Eurasianet.org warns :
&#91; ... &#93; arguments about the dangers of being too public with one &apos;s affiliations on public social networking sites remain in force .
African Union Panel of the “ Not-So-Wise ”
Collins Mbalo wonders whether the African Union Panel of the Wise and the COMESA / IGAD committee of elders was unwise in their assessment of whether Kenya is ready for peaceful elections # choice2013 .
the Evolution of African Social Welfare Systems
this post is part of our special coverage Global Development .
considering the debate generated by healthcare reform in the United States and the gradual withdrawal of the French state from public-funded social action , one might think that social protection is an endangered idea .
on the contrary , the right to security is an integral component of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( Article 22 ) and an important part of the Millenium Development Goals ( MDG ) , as conceived by the United Nations .
for the majority of African countries , social welfare systems are still evolving .
each African government has chosen a system specific to its culture , with varying degrees of success , but all recognize the necessity of protecting at a minimum the most vulnerable populations .
an insufficient social protection system
Assane Fall-Diop summarizes the struggles that are still needed to achieve a real social welfare system in Africa :
social protection became a necessary theme of the electoral debates in Africa .
in Cote d ’ Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo , either the Constitution or the law make health insurance a priority goal .
however , the booming informal economy and the financial and political weaknesses of African states make it difficult to achieve real progress .
in Africa , “ only 5-10 % of the workforce receives social security coverage , ” according to the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , which notes that the situation has deteriorated over the last 20 years .
the organization emphasizes that “ close to 80 % of the population does not have access to basic healthcare . ”
end of the month pension queues .
Clermont Township , Kwazulu-Natal , South Africa by HelpAge on Flickr ( CC-license-BY ) .
Lambert Gbossa , deputy director of the International Labour Organization &apos;s Regional Office for Africa , explains why he thinks that social welfare is in decline all over the continent .
the force of informal economy is , in his opinion , one of the principal causes :
first , a runaway population boom that produces each year a cohort of first-time jobseekers ; next , a severe economic crisis , verging on recession , that wiped out the modern sector ’ s absorptive capacity ; finally , a mass rural exodus forcing many to come “ mess about ” in the cities .
in this way , the workforce rose to over 40 percent in all countries , with a growth rate above 4.5 percent , which is slightly higher than the growth rate of the general population .
at the current rate , the occupancy rate of employed workers could be more than 2 to 3 percent in the next 25 years .
since this population would be the one to benefit from an organized social security system , there is a predictable drop-off in the social benefits of such a system .
Unequal progress across the continent
steps have been taken to mitigate this lag in the development of a social welfare system for Africa .
the Africa Platform for Social Protection ( APSP ) wants to see concrete measures to elevate and reinforce the social contract between states and their citizens .
the APSP recommends &#91; fr &#93; :
for the APSP , programme design must build on existing structures , including traditional social protection systems .
at the same time , the Platform highlights that this attention to national and local situations and perceptions has to go hand in hand with the development of regional and continental approaches .
however , Lambert Gbossa is concerned about the danger represented by the willingness to provide a standard welfare system without considering the specificities of each region and without a participatory dialogue :
… the question of reforming the social welfare system in the African countries is a good one .
this question is confined within the current system and has rarely tried to insert itself into a comprehensive policy .
the result of this confinement is not only the marginalization of a great majority of the population , but more importantly the perpetuation of an often misunderstood model that prioritized social protection for the formal sector over the problems in line with identities .
the very technical and often extremely formal systems were conceived outside of these populations and were not part of a national plan for integrated development …
some successful implementations
before Mali was shaken by the current political crisis , the country had made considerable progress with regard to social protection and healthcare coverage .
this video of a project to improve the treatment of diabetes in Mali by the NGO Santé Diabète Mali , shows an example of social action with a strong impact on healthcare coverage :
mandatory health insurance was established in Mali in 2010 .
this program enabled better protection for poor and marginalized populations , but did not reinforce the two other pillars of social welfare in Mali : the development of production infrastructure and the consolidation of structural adjustments .
funding remains one of the major obstacles affecting the sustainability of these social programs .
the foundation for social welfare in Burkina Faso meanwhile is currently being built .
the basic principle of a social protection system rests on two essential tools : services and transfers .
- Services : Geographic and financial access to essential services , such as water , decontamination , health , diet , education , housing , savings , insurance
- Transfers : welfare payments to children , seniors and working individuals who earn less than what is needed to have the essential services identified above .
in a study comparing the social welfare systems of Rwanda and Burundi , Solidarité Mondiale offers the following conclusions on social welfare in these two neighboring countries :
the study comparing the social protection systems of Rwanda and Burundi clearly shows that Rwanda has already made significant strides in this key sector that are today bolstered by a strong political will and that benefit from the support of the staff of the technical support unit ( CTAMS — la Cellule Technique d ’ Appui aux Mutuelles de Santé ) within the Ministry of Health .
the government strongly encourages extremely sophisticated collaboration among the state system of social protection , current reforms , and the system of community-based health insurance .
this collaboration is a very important trump card in the process of strengthening and extending the social protection systems &#91; … &#93; Burundi , following a lengthy war , could not support the existing systems in order to extend them to the informal and rural sectors .
nevertheless , certain private initiatives have made remarkable advances in this field .
if it wants to ensure ownership and sustainability , Burundi should encourage the prioritization of social protection systems through strong popular participation .
it may be tempting to put in place a system of universal coverage , largely supported by external donors .
the withdrawal of funds by such donors could quickly lead to a disaster , as has already been the case for some provinces in the country .

Kenya : citizen Journalism of the Kibera News Network
young people in Kibera , Kenya , which is known to some as Africa &apos;s largest slum , are determined to show a different face of the place where they live .
with video cameras in hand , they scout the streets for stories to show the world how Kibera sees itself .
the project started in April 2010 , spearheaded by Map Kibera and Kibera Community Development Agenda ( KCODA ) .
they began with just two young journalists and now the team is up to 14 young people who record the videos , edit and upload them to the web : not only to their own website Kibera News Network but also to Voice of Kibera , a site which maps their videos and also other news sent in by people via SMS and other mediums .
Kibera News Network in Kenya
content is very varied : from job security issues , to reporting fires or train accidents , as well as cultural events and political activity .
this next video , for example , shows how two young men have turned to a somewhat unusual , for Kibera , employment : they own and work at a beauty salon , providing services such as manicures as well as hairstyling :
in this other video we visit Kevin Irungu , a young man who earns a living from his art :
both of the previous examples show how creativity and hard work pay off .
however , for others in Kibera making a living is a constant struggle as demonstrated by these washerwomen who work hard and sometimes don &apos;t even get paid :
in Kibera , health is an important issue : open sewage trenches and high population density means that communicable diseases can quickly spread .
added to the fact that many people don &apos;t have the economic resources to buy medication a disease can easily turn into an epidemic :
you can see more of the videos in the Kibera News Network site or on their YouTube channel .

Kenyan Poet celebrates the day with a poem :
it all started as a vision of one man ,
a the dream of one son ,
a son of Ghana , a Nkrumah who sang a song
whose words were written with the blood of our brothers sailed off
to plantations as slaves to white masters .
a song whose rhythm and tune was hummed
by the cries of our people
feet shuffling , hands trembling , mouths begging
we don ’ t know them !
we don ’ t know the freedom fighters
the rhythm of whips cracking on their backs
the sound of gunshots reigning in the dull yet sunny days ,
dark , yet moonlit nights .
the sounds had become a dirge to their ears
Syria : state Media Propaganda In Regards To Tunisia and Egypt
Syrian Blogger Maurice Aaek found &#91; ar &#93; that state-run media in Syria is publishing false information and half-truths about the protests in Tunisia and Egypt .
he found that Tishreen daily left out the reason Ben Ali left leaving it open to interpretation , and that Al-Baath daily stated that the protests in Egypt are demanding the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador , completely leaving out the demands that Mubarak must step down .

in Egypt , sexual harassment is a serious problem , and one which more and more Egyptians are speaking out against .
a protest was held in Cairo &apos;s Nasr City on July 4 by young Egyptians , both male and female , in order to send a message against harassment .
since the revolution took place , Egyptians both online and offline have been standing up against sexual harassment and gender-based violence .
in June a march against sexual harassment was attacked .
nevertheless , initiatives to combat harassment continue .
the aim of the July 4 protest was to take a stand against sexual harassment and to demand safe streets for all .
Maged Tawfiles was there and took the following photos ( all images reproduced with permission ) :
“ My freedom is my dignity ”
“ An Egyptian woman has the right to walk freely ”
“ I don &apos;t want to hate being a girl ”
“ I wish you would stop looking at my body ”
“ I want to ride a bike without being harassed ”
“ I don &apos;t harass so that my sister won &apos;t be harassed ”
“ Control yourself , not my clothes ”
“ The street is not yours , my freedom is not yours ”

Malawi : listen to Malawi Election Bloggers
Malawians are currently voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections .
a group of Malawian bloggers were trained by PenPlusBytes , an International Institute of ICT Journalism in collaboration with New Media Institute to monitor and comment on the elections using blogs , twitter and mobile phones .
let &apos;s take a look at their blogs , which are hosted on The African Elections Portal .
the African Elections Portal provides comprehensive election related information on the various countries in Africa .
according to blogger Eric Chilenje , the 2009 elections in Malawi will be heavily contested :
the 2009 General Elections will be one of those elections that appear to be heavily contensted.In the first place , we have seen the former head of state Dr Bakili Muluzi , being stopped by Malawi Electoral Commission from contesting for the third time as president.This was done in accordiance with the Malawi Constitution whiuch stipulates that a presiednt shall only serve two consecutive terms .
one other interesting aspects during the 2009 General Elections is that we have seen United Democtracti Front , a party being being led by Dr Bakili Muluzi forming a ‘ coalition ’ with Malawi Congress Party of John Tembo .
Norman Fulatira makes a similar observation :
the 2009 Elections in Malawi seem to be the first since the country attained multiparty democracy .
the hype that is there perhaps suggests that this time around the contest is high .
I percieve that the 2009 elections in Malawi hangs around the issue of greed among the leaders .
none of the leaders is mentioning about an ideology to follow once elected into power save for pressidential independent candidate Mr. James Nyondo .
McDonald Bamusi argues that what the decision of two political parties , UDF and MCP , to support a single candidate has made the race very tight :
this year &apos;s general elections in malawi have been one of the most closely contested .
this has been the case especially because of the agreement of UDF and MCP to support one candidate in the name of John Zenus Ungapake Tembo .
Michael notes that rural voters will not be taken for granted in this year &apos;s elections :
this year &apos;s race for Malawi General Elections will be tight .
all major political parties are concentrating their campaign in the rural areas .
these are the people that are in majority .
the rural masses may not be taken for granted this year as they now know and appreciate who the good leader is .
the Civil Society , Media and Religious Institutions are playing a vital role in making sure that the Electorate have the right information concerning the elections .
this will help the public to make an informed decision on who to vote for on May 19 .
Wesysylas reports that the a Democratic Progressive Party bus was stoned in Machinga Distrtict :
barely a day after some some nasty scenes occured at a rally organised by united democratict front national chairman Dr Bakili Muluzi at Goliati in Thyolo district , the scenerior wore a new face when a Democratic progressive Party Bus was on Wednsday stoned in machinga District .
the good news is that , according to the Human Rights Consultative Committee , the levels of violence during the 2009 campaign period have decreased compared to the 2004 elections :
human Rights Consultative Committee ( HRCC ) has said levels of violence during the 2009 campaign period in preparation for the 19 May general elections have decreased compared to what was experienced in 2004 .
the campaign period has ended today at 6 o ’ clock in the morning .
HRCC vice National Coordinator Cecilia Mussa said the development is a clear demonstration that Malawians have realized that power is not a tool to bring personal agenda .
the 2009 elections according to Nicolas Mbonela is one of its kind :
Malawi &apos;s fourth coming general election on 19 May 2009 will be of their own kind looking at the political developments that are transpiring in the country .
the political rivals are busy castigating each other just to make sure that they woo support from most illiterate Malawians that form the majority of the country &apos;s population and electorate .
Malawi Elections Breaking News reports that property owners in Malawi are demanding money for campaign posters places on their property :
some small scale property owners in Blantyre are demanding , at least , K500 for political posters placed in their area of business or enterprise , it has been learnt .
the development has prompted some property owners to openly advertise for their places , as one poster at Blantyre Old Town indicated Sunday morning .
one of the places where politicians are said to have paid for a place is at the Curios centre , near Malawi Savings Bank in Blantyre .
one of the curios ’ sellers disclosed in an interview the posters now selling themselves at the place were paid for , and that each did cost K500 for the depicted political parties .
the posters there include the faces of Bingu wa Mutharika and one for John Tembo , Malawi Congress Party ’ s torch bearer in the May19 polls .
Jessie Puwapuwa observes that in 1994 Malawians voted in order to get rid of Kamuzu Banda who had ruled Malawi for 30 years :
election time as it is people cast their votes inorder to put into or remove people from positions .
this is the third time Malawians will be going to polls to choose a leader after their hearts .
in 1994 Malawians were eager to go to vote just to get rid of Malawi Cogress Party which had ruled the country for 30 years under what they called ‘ Dictatorship of late His Excellency Ngazi Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda . ’ this was the beginning of democratic dispensation and the United Democratic Party President Dr. Bakili Muluzi was the first leader to be elected and re-elected in 1999 .
in 2004 Dr. Bingu Wa Mutharika was elected to this honourable office on a UDF .
in his post titled “ Malawi : the Economy , Stupid ? , ” Mujo writes , “ Despite facing a strong alliance of the main opposition leader and a former president , the incumbent is expected to win on the back of an economic boom ” :
on May 19 , voters in Malawi will go to the polls to elect their next president .
the Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for the last four years and is fielding President Bingu wa Mutharika as its candidate once again .
though critics accuse Mutharika of rigging his way into office , he is credited with helping to improve Malawi ’ s economy .
since he took over , the country has experienced an average economic growth of 7 percent .
“ He inherited a very politically and economically mismanaged legacy … and it was a very tall order to get the country running , to try to get the confidence of very important external players in Malawi , ” said Dimpho Motsamai , a political analyst at the Institute for Global Dialogue in South Africa who specializes on Malawi .
“ So his vision was one of economic rejuvenation , stricter physical management of economic resources — very prudent management of economic resources — and one that would deal with socio-economic inequalities in Malawi , ” she told Reuters Africa Journal .
George Kanyange expects the 2009 elections to be one of the most exciting elections in the history of Malawi :
this year &apos;s elections are promising to be the most exciting ever in Malawi .
there certain factors that make our elections unique .
first is the fact that one of the key political parties contesting in the elections is the ruling party , the Democrartyic Progerssive Party ( DPP ) , that was never ever eleected by the electorate for it to be in power .
another interesting aspect is that the former ruling party , the United Democratic Party ( UDF ) , is not fielding a presidential candiate after its leader , Bakili Muluzi , was rejected by the Electoral Commission , which has forced the party to go into an alliance with another leading positiion , the Malawi Congress Party ( MCP ) which is also the oldest party in the country .

Morocco : a Young Blogger Greets the World
when Salma first started keeping a blog &#91; Ar &#93; in 2008 , she was just 6 years old , probably the youngest Moroccan blogger .
she greeted the world back then with these words :
hello my friends !
welcome to my blog .
my name is Salma .
I am six-and-a-half years old .
I am in Grade One at “ Al Jahed ” school .
my father created this blog here for me , so that I can write my name , age and address , and introduce you to my teacher .
if I write or draw something , I will put it on the blog .
Salma is not a regular blogger though but every now and then , and under the supervision of her parents , she would post short stories and pictures of her school and teachers :
Salma receiving a prize at school
after a long interruption Salma finds inspiration again ( back in April ) and shares with her readers her daily hassles in the classroom .
she writes :
my colleague who sits next to me in the Arabic Language course has a high opinion of herself and thinks I am weak and she is strong .
I started to hate the Arabic language course because she keeps harassing me .
she pushes me and pinches me whenever I read a text .
I cannot concentrate with my teacher who doesn &apos;t care about my problem .
even though I complained to him , he didn &apos;t punish her or ask her to go sit elsewhere .
that &apos;s why I decided from now on , if she pinches me I &apos;ll pinch back and if she pushes , I &apos;ll push back and won &apos;t let her annoy me again .
it is not clear how many children bloggers are there in the Moroccan blogosphere and some might wonder how old should a child be before he / she can keep a blog , but something is for sure : Salma &apos;s sincere and straightforward writings makes her blog a unique and interesting read .
she deserves to be encouraged and followed .

Kenya : to Pay or Not to # PayInterns ?
Kenyan tweep @ RobertAlai started a lively debate on 14 May , 2012 about the need for companies to pay interns .
@ RobertAlai wanted tweeps to ask companies , “ # DoYouPayInterns ? ” :
@ RobertAlai : if you are an intern and you feel that you are being exploited , please email me on alai @ techmtaa.com.
let &apos;s ask # DoYouPayInterns ?
tweeps immediately took to their keyboards siding with interns :
@ madonah12 : # PayInterns Is the best Trend Ever I just love the idea that Interns should get Lunch Fare and Pocket money cc @ RobertAlai Good work
a banner in support of interns .

@ tyrus _ : Aye how come all those KE companies on Twitter who tweet “ Good morning and Good night ” and sell new products cant respond to # PayInterns ?
@ RobertAlai : “ Interns ” must be paid .
stand up for your rights and you &apos;ll find that employers are capable of paying you # PayInterns
@ TheMacharia : I wonder how many of those on # PayInterns have actually hired , not selected , but hired interns .
@ mainneli : interns should be paid .
they do the same work and same stuff like anyone else in the office , stop exploitation # Payinterns
@ tkb : @ kainvestor @ Worldbank inviting users to wiki is same as @ Wikipedia who don &apos;t # payinterns Create a global public good with all content open !
@ KenyaPolice : Kenya Police does not support the exploiation of Kenyan workers .
# PayInterns However , some tweeps sided with companies using interns without pay :
@ Kkaaria : interns , 5 years into your career , you will realize how little you actually knew when you started off .
be patient .. # payInterns
@ TerryanneChebet : my two cents to the # payinterns .
I say no .
an allowance for food and transport , however is alright .
@ mainaalex : ati # payinterns for what ? if they are that good , they should start their own companies .
show value you get paid .
@ Kamungah : @ MediaMK Interns contribute , companies gain as interns get required skills . win – Win .
some employers use them as ‘ continuous ’ interviews .
bloggers have also joined the debate .
blogger Dennis Matara argued that labour laws stipulate that interns must be paid after working for three months :
you must wake up !
you have been in intern for more than three months ?
get alive .
Labour laws clearly state that the company that takes you in as an intern is required by law to absorb you as their full time employee , paid in their scale and entitle to leave days among other benefits .
if they cannot do that , then your internship should end at the end of your third month there .
it is true and evident that some interns ‘ decide ’ to stay longer in the hope of ‘ acting good ’ in order to secure themselves a job .
yes , that is ok but if the company really needs you that much , then they must take you in .
many employers know very well that majority of these interns are straight from college , they do not have money even for their transport to work but still misuse them to the fullest .
Nairobi Wire noted that companies in Kenya paying interns are the minority :
the companies that pay there interns are the minority and they pay peanuts .
reading through some of the tweets , KCB , EABL , CIC , KPLC , KBC , Standard Group , NMG , RMS among many others have been listed as the most exploitative .
equity bank has been attacked for using CSR as a reason to have cheap labour .
KBC is the worst of all since interns have to pay to intern there .
there have also been complains of interns been sexually exploited .
this is one of the most lively discussion I &apos;ve seen on twitter in a long time .
most of the time , people are always rumbling about Kenya Power .
# PayInterns has generated so much interest that at its peak , around 150 tweets were being tweeted per minute . this is considering its only in Kenya .
various corporates have also tweeted responding to allegations that they do not remunerate their interns .
KCB tweeted , “ KCB Group does not obtain any money from interns . interns are actually paid a monthly stipend that is above the industry average ”
Egypt : we are All Laila
we are all Laila , echo Egyptian female bloggers in one voice .
who is Laila and why do Egyptian girls and women associate themselves with her ?
read on to learn how Egyptian bloggers are working to break the gender barrier and make their voices heard .
the story starts in September , 2006 , when a group of bloggers decided the time has come for them to speak up and share their own stories and experiences , as well of those of other women , with injustice .
the initiative was launched as follows :
the idea behind ‘ We are all Laila ‘ started with with Laila , a woman who was confiding her concerns to another Laila .
soon the two Lailas became three , then five and then more than 50 women , who discovered that despite the differences in their circumstances , ideas and priorities , they were all Laila at the end of the day .
Laila is the heroine of The Open Door , by novelist Latifa Al Zayat , which was later made into a movie , starring Faten Hamama .
Laila is your contemporary Egyptian girl , who faces different circumstances in a society which elevates the station of men and overlooks women .
no one cared for her dreams and ideas and what she wanted to achieve in her life .
despite all this , Laila , who was subjected to discrimination from her childhood , was able to maintain her belief in herself , and her role as a women equal in importance to men – whether at home , in the work place , at school or in society at large .
we selected Laila because it is an Egyptian story , which reflects a lot of what we go through and the pressures accumulated in our Egyptian society , and its traditions and views of women throughout history .
this does not mean that bloggers from other Arab countries cannot take part in this initiative , as the culture which oppresses Laila exists there too .
our aim on this day is to give Laila the opportunity to speak up and hear about others speaking about her , and for her to know that she is not alone in refusing and confronting the injustice she is being subjected to .
our goal is to have a voice which expresses our suffering as we are fed up of having others speak on our behalf .
our bigger goal is to share with you an essential aspect of our existence , a part which is carefully hidden inside your sister , wife and colleague at work .. and a part you are contributing to consciously or subconsciously sometimes .
since then , the campaign has continued annually with huge success – with female bloggers opening their hearts and pouring out their woes , and surprisingly getting support from men .
the following year , We are all Lailawrote :
a year has passed since the first We are all Laila day .. the idea was simply getting the largest number of female bloggers writing about the problems they faced , in a bid to discuss these issues in an open medium , which enjoys a certain level of freedom and awareness .
the aim was to open up and share as well as getting us out of the feeling of loneliness in confronting these problems .
another aim was using our credibility in the blogosphere to express the problems we face for the other gender to see them from our perspective .
it was an opportunity for us to understand one another and how we feel and try to change the discrimination facing us , even on a narrow level , which would include himself and his home .
the result was a different format of posts to mark the day , as well as including men in the conversation .
we are all Laila explains :
despite the success of the day , we were criticised over a few points , the most important was ignoring men , and not specifying the topics .
this year , we will try and overcome all those mistakes .
this time , we elected to mark the day in a different format , by asking specific questions , carefully selected by a few friends , which concern the status of Egyptian girls and women , in particular , and Egyptians , in general .
the objective is to develop a dialogue stemming from the responses to better understand ourselves and those around us .
this year &apos;s We are all Laila day will be commemorated on Egyptian blogs on October 19 .
stay tuned for coverage on the day .
Australia : Kenyan women refused refugee status
two Kenyan women are facing deportation from Australia after their asylum applications were rejected , despite risks that they may suffer forced genital mutilation if they are sent home .
according to an article in Australian newspaper , The Age , Grace Gichuhi , 22 , and Teresia Ndikaru Muturi , 21 , arrived in Australia in July last year on tourist visas for World Youth Day .
there have been few reactions to the case from most of the political blogosphere regulars in Australia .
climate change and economic stimulus strategies have dominated in the last week .
but the article on The Age has attracted 54 comments from online readers showing anything but popular disinterest .
the comments represent opposite poles of opinion , including :
let these women stay .
they applied .
their applications were assessed .
their applications were refused .
send them home .
case closed .
how pathetic that these two women should be refused asylum .
Australia could do well to have more people like these two girls and as far as I &apos;m concerned they &apos;re welcome here for as long as they wish .
on her blog , at Pocket Carnival , Penny Eager says she was moved to write to the Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship , Chris Evans on his online contact page , expressing her outrage :
I have just heard of the case of Grace Gichuhi &amp; Teresia Ndikaru Muturi , two women from Kenya who have been denied status as refugees .
I believe that the torturous practise of genital mutilation is abhorrent , and that to deny these women refugee visas is to take a weak stance on this issue .
I urge you to intervene in this case , not only to help these women , but also to send a clear message to Kenya that Australia does not condone these practises .
a religious issue ?
Aussie News and Views a self-styled “ American , Australian , Israeli , British ‘ Judeo-Christian Friendly ’ blog ” posted a video of a news clip about the women and asked :
Gee I wonder who could be behind this ?
what sort of Satan worshipping Death Cult could be alive and well in Kenya today that would do such a thing to young women ?
Philip Maguire at Whaddya Reckon ?
drew a number of comments with his post :
two Kenyan Christian women are to be deported from Australia despite facing death or genital mutilation .
maybe they should have arrived here cashed up via a boat from Indonesia .
Lisa Valentine of Embrace Australia , an online community for foreign nationals looking to live in Australia , also took up their case :
both Grace and Teresia are now terrified of what fate will lie in wait for them if they are deported back to Kenya .
a spokesman from the Australian Immigration Department said : “ Under the refugee convention , they weren ’ t found to engage with Australia ’ s international obligations .
the girls , along with Sister Aileen Crowe , a Franciscan nun who is supporting them , launched an appeal to the Australian Immigration Minister , Chris Evans , but he rejected that appeal .
a second appeal has now been launched and the girls are awaiting the results but have been told to prepare for deportation .
ironically new legislation is due to be introduced to Parliament that would ensure protection for the girls .
the legislation is called Complementary Protection and it expands the criteria under which a refugee can apply for protection .
online campaign
on Facebook a ‘ Causes ’ page titled Help save these Women from Genital Mutilation has been launched by Australians who support the women &apos;s attempt to stay in Australia .
so far , 91 people have joined .
an update was posted on Tuesday by Vanessa Muradian :
this is the most recent update – sources said these women are protected here in Australia — until Evans decides what to do with them .
whether he rejected them or not the first time we are still to know … the government need to pass the complimentary visa … which I am further researching at the moment – Basically the complimentary visa , will ‘ compliment ’ the protection visa , SO THAT THESE refugees can fall under a protection visa .
currently the protection visa doesn &apos;t protect women from GENITAL MUTILATION and honour killings .
the bill was proposed to parliament in September and currently the Liberal party are opposing this bill …
right now these women just need our support – Minister Evans will be making the decision with his privilege of Ministerial Intervention .
I guess we need to contact him …
as well as other governing bodies whom can help the government pass the complimentary bill ! ! ! ! ! !
Finland : the Language Issue
Nordic Voices writes about Finland &apos;s “ language issue . ”
South Korea : flight Attendants Demand Right To Wear Trousers
on this year &apos;s International Women &apos;s Day , March 8 , 2012 , a rather unconventional protest was held in downtown Seoul , South Korea .
female flight attendants of Asiana Airlines , one of the nation &apos;s major airlines , held a press conference in front of the Kumho Asiana building accusing the company of having sexist guidelines regarding female flight attendants ’ appearance .
Park Bong ( @ jayparkbong ) , member of a feminist organization , tweeted :
Asiana &apos;s guidelines on appearance and uniform even regulate the number of bobby pins they can use , which color eye makeup to use and even the color of their stockings .
since glasses are not allowed to be worn inside the cabin , they have to wear contact lenses in that dry environment .
the right to wear short hairstyles was one they fought for and achieved through a strike few years ago .
it is a clear indication how the company views their female labor force and its desire to control and utilize it .
screen capture image of Asiana flight attendants , Originally a video clip uploaded on Youtube by YouTube user Rogapol .
later she tweeted about the protest :
now I am heading back to my office after attending a press conference in front of the Kumho Asiana building calling for the airline to allow women crew members to wear trousers .
today is the 104th anniversary of Women &apos;s day and now I do this kind of protest .
this situation and women &apos;s status in this country are so frustrating .
according to a news article by Hankyoreh that went viral over past few days , Asiana Airlines has the most complicated rules regarding female flight attendants : the airlines uniform for women uniform exists only in skirt form — there is no version with trousers .
skirts are required to reach knee level .
female flight attendants cannot wear glasses .
hair should be held in place and pinned down to the back of the ears .
only two bobby pins in total are allowed in the hair .
restrictions are also imposed on the size of the earrings and necklaces .
eye liner and mascara should be either black or brown .
Asiana responded that the reason they don &apos;t have a trouser version of their women &apos;s uniform is that the latter is “ not compatible to the company &apos;s brand image . ”
echoing flight attendants ’ complaints , a majority of South Korean net users expressed anger regarding the company &apos;s sexist policy .
Twitter user @ vanilladoll8 tweeted :
how petty the company &apos;s brand image is if it can only be explained / defined by female employees ’ appearance .
they should care more about the flight safety and providing comfortable service , instead of pretty attendants .
@ Astralpink warns &#91; ko &#93; that too much focus on female crew members ’ appearance is could annoy people into considering a boycott of the airline .
the airline &apos;s policy on female crew members ’ appearances and uniforms are unnecessary and sexist .
the company insist they wear only skirts although it is uncomfortable in their working environment and ( worse when it comes to ) emergency situations .
if this airline really cares more about attendants ’ appearance than passenger &apos;s safety – people will boycott it .
trousers ( uniforms ) are not allowed for Asiana &apos;s flight attendants .
this guideline is anachronistic and treats women as objects they exploit to maximize the company &apos;s profit , rather than treating them as human beings .
it seems like this company ’ policy belongs more to the 1970 ′ s under the ( South Korean former President ) Park Jung-hee regime .
South Korea &apos;s Network for Glocal Activism &#91; ko &#93; filed a petition &#91; ko &#93; that read :
this guideline shows that the airline views women as objects that need to be managed / controlled by .
&#91; ... &#93; corporations such a perspective of women depreciates women employees ’ professionalism .
the petition added that the guidelines regarding female flight attendants are five pages long , male crew members are merely expected to maintain a “ clean and decent look ” .
Jamaica : explicit music banned
the long-standing controversy over the appropriateness of certain music for public airplay has once again reared its head in Jamaica .
following public discussion about a recent release by Vybz Kartel and Spice entitled “ Rampin ’ Shop ” , the lyrics of which are particularly explicit , the Jamaica Broadcasting Commission announced a ban on all sexually explicit music deemed inappropriate for airplay .
this ban went into effect on February 6 , 2009 and covered all songs that promote the act of “ daggering ” , as well as any songs that use editing techniques to remove expletives and other lewd content .
Jamaican blogger , Girl with a Purpose notes that while she does think the ban will be effective in reducing the lewd music that is heard “ for probably 50 % of the time … via radio and television ” , a large part of the responsibility lies with the adults of our society , especially parents , who need to censor themselves and realize that :
to expose their young children to lewd and explicit music , thus making them prematurely ready and aware of sex and violent acts , is wrong .
another trend in these discussions is the issue of other musical genres besides dancehall ( i.e. soca and calypso , hip hop , rap etc .
) , especially as Jamaica enters its Carnival season – a time when imported soca music takes centre stage across the island .
amidst cries of hypocrisy by several Jamaican artistes who feel that dancehall is being unfairly singled out , MadBull , a Jamaican blogger in Cayman , writes that he fully supports the ban and thinks it should be extended to any genre of music being considered for public airplay .
he exclaims on his blog :
what about soca and hip hop and so on ?
I don ’ t care what the genre is !
if the lyrics dutty , drop dem too !
that &apos;s what I think !
outspoken Jamaican blogger , Agostinho , published on his blog a letter he submitted to the editors of various local media in which he discusses the need for dancehall to revamp its image .
while he acknowledges the place of dancehall music in Jamaican society and its importance as the centre of popular culture , he feels that dancehall has a responsibility to the society from which it springs to reform its image …
not just in the interests of practicality given its increased powers of importance in the society , but also as a means of demonstrating its inherent versatility / creativity .
the latter , as we are aware , goes beyond a focus on only themes of sex and violence .
excuses regarding a chronic lack of education on the part of many of its producers and artistes are an insult to the diversity of intelligence and depth of talent within the industry / culture .
these must yield to the more urgent demands of true national development , cultural pride and meaningful progress .
Stunner &apos;s Afflictions also explains his thoughts on the ban .
he fully supports the move by the Broadcasting Commission , noting that it was long overdue :
it is their job to police what is good for public broadcast as prescribed by Television and Sound Broadcasting Regulations .
so why did they have to wait on public outcry and pressure for them to take a step to ban such material ?
what have they been doing and what are they doing , for my hard earned taxpayer dollars ?
the Broadcasting Commission need to pull up their socks and this incident really shows them up .
his followup post on Valentine &apos;s Day sought to remind readers of a crucial point :
not all of our Dancehall / Reggae music is less than desirable .
there are still very good songs being played on our airwaves .
he goes on to share a video example of one such song , “ Love Reigns ” by Tarrus Riley and Bugle , two of Jamaica &apos;s newer artistes .
since this public ban on explicit music , support has begun for more positive products to come out of the Jamaican entertainment industry .
YardFlex , tagging itself as the Ultimate Jamaican Entertainment Magazine , reported recently on Tychicus , a self-described healer and prophet who staged a one-man protest last year against “ daggering ” , and who has since come out with some clean dances that he says are inspired by the Almighty .
this discussion is ongoing as the ban is only 10 days old and the full implementation and its effects are yet to be seen .
Jamaican bloggers have all come out in full support of the ban , and see this as a time for Jamaican artistes to step up and prove their creativity to the world .
Africa : bloggers pay tribute to Michael Jackson

the death of American pop star Michael Jackson has sparked an outpouring of emotion from nearly every corner of the world .
fans are sharing their memories of Jackson on his official site in nearly a dozen languages , and the news made the front page of papers across the globe .
in Africa , bloggers are paying tribute to the King of Pop by posting pictures and music videos .
writing from Nigeria , Oluniyi David Ajao offers a list of his 26 favorite Michael Jackson songs , while Ugandan blogger Serakelz honors Jackson &apos;s memory with instructions on how to do the moonwalk , a dance move created by Jackson .
in Ghana , Kent Mensah of Africa News collects reactions to Jackson &apos;s passing on Twitter and Facebook :
“ Africa loves Michael Jackson … from birth you learn how to survive and that Michael Jackson is music … the most famous musician ever , ” Rasco Patterson said on twitter @ chickenwang4 .
“ Make this world a better place for me and you these are the words from a true legend like Michael Jackson .
I will always remember you Waco Jaco , ” Elton Afari , Accra , Ghana said on Facebook .
echoing the sentiments of many African fans , Sudanese Thinker remembers the pop star fondly :
in a lot of ways Michael Jackson was my childhood .
his music filled it with lots of joy and beautiful memories .
it uplifted me when I was down .
it made me happy when I was sad .
and as awkward and flawed as he was , I will dearly miss him and his talents .
and Ugandan blogger Dickson Wasake honors Jackson with a poem :
on the death of Michael Jackson ;
the tears fill the earth ,
black or white ;
the Liberian girl cries ,
and so does dirty Diana ,
even the stranger in Moscow ,
we all scream ;
“ Oh it ’ s too bad ; oh it ’ s too sad ;
the king is gone too soon ,
and I just can ’ t stop loving him ! ”
though many bloggers are grieving over Jackson &apos;s death , others are questioning his eccentricities , including his changing skin color .
in Ghana , blogger Emmanuel Bensa laments :
… .the African culture tells us that we don &apos;t speak ill of the dead – and I am not about to do so anytime soon , but what I will do is to categorically state how much of a bad decision it was to become a white man .
black is beautiful – and it will forever be so .
as a Black Man , Michael Jackson had the looks , the voice ; the talent .
oh what a shame .
for Ugandan blogger Rosebell , Jackson &apos;s death prompted reflections on why the news pays so much more attention to the death of a pop star than to other tragedies :
as I watched the reaction around the world to Jackson ’ s death I wondered if really all humans can ever be equal .
not that I don ’ t recognise MJ ’ s contribution to music and his great talent , I would be naïve to do so , but I wonder why we no longer get the shock when we see death around the world .
everyone seemed to say oh he died young at 50 , and then I thought that actually in Uganda life expectancy is at 50 . do you know in many African countries dying of old age is almost history ?
do you know that this shock we feel at the loss MJ ’ s death , many Iraqis face it everyday ?
the fear for the loss of their own lives and the puzzles of how their children will grow , grips people in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Omar Basawad of Safari Notes dismisses these criticisms , focusing on Jackson &apos;s legendary talent :
whatever might be said about Michael Jackson , whatever one might think of him – one thing is certain : he defined an era .
“ RIP MJ , ” writes Kenyan blogger WildeYearnings .
“ You now have the whole sky to moonwalk on … ”

Tunisia : student Jailed for Media Interview
Tunisian student Mohamed Soudani , 24 , disappeared on October 22 , 2009 , in Tunisia after giving interviews to Radio Monte Carlo International and Radio France International .
Soudani was missing for 18 days until Tunisia ’ s police contacted his family inform them that he is detained in the Murnaguiya prison about 15km away from the capital Tunis .
according to sources , the police also informed Soudani ’ s family that he was put on trial and convicted for “ disorderly conduct ” during his detention without legal counsel and was sentenced to four months in prison .
they also learned that he had since appealed his sentence .
during his court appearance on December 6 , Soudani denied the charges filed against him and stated that he was tortured aggressively during his extrajudicial detention .
his lawyers asked for a recess to study the case and his release on bail .
the release request was denied while his trial was adjourned to December 14 , 2009 .
Soudani was interviewed about his past activities as a student leader in the General Union of the Students of Tunisia .
he was involved last year in a 56-day hunger strike with another four students demanding their right to go back to school .
they have also blogged about their hunger strike experience day by day on a blog which had been censored in Tunisia .
a Facebook group and a blog have been created to support Mohamed Soudani in the hardships he is experiencing .

2012 Paralympics : a Successful Start , Remarkable Stories
this post is part of our special coverage London 2012 Olympics .
&#91; all links forward to French articles unless otherwise stated &#93;
from August 29 until September 12 , 2012 , 4,200 athletes from 166 countries will take part in the 14th edition of the Paralympic Games in London and will compete in twenty disciplines .
here is a video presenting the Paralympic Games by paralympicSportTv &#91; en &#93; :
the organizers needed 15 days after the London 2012 Olympics to rearrange and make infrastructures accessible .
Charles El Meliani on JOL press writes that a record number of tickets were sold for these games :
London has put forward tremendous efforts in terms of ticketing and exposure , consistently showcasing the Paralympics in all of its vending outlets .
the results are impressive : in total , almost 2.3 million tickets have already been sold out of the total 2.5 million initially planned .
this games could very well be a sellout : just amazing .

the competing athletes are not all born with disabilities .
Jacqueline Mallet on the blog ‘ Province de l &apos;équateur ’ explains and illustrates some remarkable stories in the following post ‘ “ I was given up for dead ” : the incredible destiny of disabled athletes ‘ :
some of these athletes have grown with their disabilities , while others have had to learn to overcome it as a result of war wounds or accidents .
struck by fate , they found in sport a way to rebuild themselves .
Mallet also writes about the journey of several athletes : Martine Wright , a survivor of the London bombings ; Derek Derenalagi , a soldier born in Fiji , given up for dead ; Rim Ju Song , the first North Korean participant who , a few months ago , could not swim ; and Hassiem Achmat , who survived a shark attack .
another blog post entitled ‘ A war mutilated Afghan en route to the London Games … ‘ shares the story of Malek Mohammad , an Afghan athlete who lost both his legs in 2005 when he stepped on a land mine near his home in Kabul .

they eventually cut off one of his arms during his captivity .
on the France Handicap Info website , Stéphane Lagoutière writes :
of course , the other big events of these games will be the return of the mentally challenged to the paralympic Games , the athletes are back 12 years after they last took part in the games .
in France , only a regional television channel will broadcast all of the events .

Costa Rica : online Videos add Humor to Presidential Elections
image by thombo2 on flickr used according to CC license
the Costa Rican Presidential elections are this Sunday and through videos , many Costa Ricans are expressing their concerns regarding the candidates and the future of their country through parody and humor .
first , we have an online video uploaded by El Basureo , where they propose an innovative solution to the age old problem of not knowing whom to vote for .
in this Costa Rican election , out of the 6 candidates running for office , four of them are in the lead : national Liberation &apos;s Laura Chinchilla , Libertarian Otto Guevara , Socialdemocrat Otton Solis and Social Christian Luis Fishman .
El Basureo proposes a new machine which will mix and match characteristics of the candidates , and the names that come off those mixes are a wink and nod to the Costarican political situation .
online video holds itself as a way to spread information and audiovisual propaganda that is sometimes pulled from the television after a short airing period .
such is the case with candidate Fishman &apos;s campaign ad which included grownups dressed as a babies in diapers dancing and playing the piano , pregnant women and a well recognized tune to the campaign &apos;s slogan “ Fishman , the lesser evil ” . it has obviously spawned parodies , such as this next one .
the only thing which was changed was the audio and subtitles , the rest of the ad was kept intact :
LaErre.tv also came out with their own take on the elections : the Presidential Candidate Kit , containing everything you could need to launch yourself on a political career .
with the initial lines of : if you are tired of other politician &apos;s promises , and of being sent to jail when you steal , why not become a candidate yourself and take care of your problems ?
it goes on to explain the skills necessary , the buzzwords you &apos;ll need and the perks you &apos;ll have once you acquire their kit and follow the steps .
Elchamukocr also posts a video making fun of Otton Solis , who during the campaign had to stop and ask for donations to continue doing TV campaigns since his funds had run out .
in the video , Otton organizes a Teleotton drive to raise cash :
Trinidad &amp; Tobago : corruption and the Rule of Law
recently , the rule of law has been taking a beating by this PP government .
with the now infamous section 34 , things have come round to another galloping dictatorship , and &#91; ... &#93; we can see how that corruption of power has changed the characters of those whom we viewed as pillars and exemplars of our society .

Mehdi Hassan is dead , but I am not sad .

Adil Omar ( @ Adil _ Omar ) tweets :
@ Adil _ Omar : I won &apos;t pretend that I listened to his music , but I was well aware of his status and impact .
RIP Mehdi Hassan
singer Talat Aziz , who was trained by Mehdi Hassan describes how he feels :
I feel a tremendous personal sense of loss .
I was his ‘ shagird ’ ( apprentice ) , I spent a lot of time with him .
for me he was a star .
I don &apos;t have words to describe his loss .
he was a great asset to the world of Ghazal .
though he was not singing for quite sometime , but he will be missed .
there will never be another Mehdi Hassan .
please check out Fawad &apos;s tribute to Mehdi Hassan , whom he terms as one of the greatest sub-continental singers of the post-partition era .
elections in India and Women
this post is part of the Global Voices Special Coverage on Indian Elections 2009
world ’ s largest democracy , India , will hold general elections starting in a few weeks from now .
in a country of more than a billion people , general election is nothing sort of a “ make or break ” time for many interest groups , political parties and the common folk .
for how their life will be for next five years is decided on that day .
a rainbow of colours of rural Indian women gathered as volunteers for social mobilisation and development in their villages .

Indian women , who have long been denied their rightful position at home , at work and at the helm of power also have a huge stake in upcoming elections .
female literacy in the country ( based on 2001 census ) is at 53.63 % compared to 75.26 % for male , but Indian women are not completely shut off from the political process .
level of their participation is increasing and a some prominent parties have women as leaders .
although more and more women are becoming aware of their voting rights and participating at local level politics , a report suggests that this year less women are likely to be elected to the country ’ s parliament .
“ The introduction of the Women ’ s Reservations Bill in 14th Lok Sabha has prompted more women asking for tickets from major parties this time , but the selection of candidates by the latter reveals that electoral politics in India still remains a male preserve .
including party Chief Sonia Gandhi , only nine women figure in the list of 90-and odd Lok Sabha candidates announced by the Congress so far and the BJP list of 232 candidates , contains only 21 women .
the Left Front , which has accused both the BJP and the Congress of lacking political will on the women ’ s reservation bill , has fielded only two women out of 42 candidates in its bastion West Bengal , down from five it had fielded in 2004 elections . ”
Samiya Anwar , a female voter , writes about upcoming elections focusing on her hometown of Hyderabad :
“ There are more women issues than men to be addressed .
first , it is the safety of women in society she dwells in .
many women in the Old City ( of Hyderabad ) do not trust police .
they go through domestic and physical violence and don ’ t complain .
we need a system where women can approach cops fearlessly .
the issues like water shortage , frequent power cuts , road accidents and physical abuse of women at workplace should be given first thought . ”
question of caste is a big one during election time in India .
as someone said “ Indians don ’ t caste their vote but vote their caste ” , the politics of dividing people based on their caste and exploiting them as “ vote banks ” is a common practice .
Joshua Meah blogging about caste system and of women in Indian politics at Washington Note says :
“ India n . ( perhaps it has potential as an adjective as well ?
this is the same country that has produced a great number of enormously powerful female politicians long before America even honestly broached the subject – Indira Gandhi being the case in point .
even now , the head of Uttar Pradesh , India &apos;s most populous state and the home to 130 million people , is headed by a woman of dalit origin ( India &apos;s lowest caste ) .
the progress of India &apos;s democracy in terms of its movement toward social equality has in some ways been as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking . ”
here is an excerpt :
“ Sonia : the Congress party is a national party with a glorious history .
Mayawati : and no future .
Sonia : don &apos;t say that .
please .
it hurts .
we are confident of coming back to power on our own .
Mayawati : really ?
look , I don &apos;t care whether anyone is from the Gandhi family or a raja or maharaja .
if you or your son threaten my vote bank in any manner , I will put you both behind bars . ”
an Alawite Outcast : how One Syrian Girl Lost Her Mother
as part of our collaboration with Syria Deeply we are cross-posting a series of articles that capture civilian voices caught in the crossfire , along with perspectives on the conflict from writers around the world .
Loubna Mrie paid a steep price for her place in Syria ’ s revolution .
as an Alawite who took a stand against President Bashar Al Assad , she pitted herself against her community ; many Alawites have remained staunchly behind Assad , as the leader of their sect and the protector of their privileged position of power .
from the start of the uprising , Loubna ’ s parents took opposite sides : her father and uncles stood with Assad , while Loubna and her mother supported the growing protests .
it was a position Loubna ’ s father made it clear he wouldn ’ t tolerate : he demanded her loyalty to the Assad camp .
in August , Loubna left her hometown of Latakia , in western Syria , fleeing across the border to Turkey .
her father kidnapped her mother and threatened to kill her as punishment .
when Loubna refused to return her father followed through on the threat .
her father killed her mother , and cut her off from the life she had known before the uprising .
Loubna is now a filmmaker with Basma , a media activist group .
she travels around Syria with a camera , chronicling the revolution on film .
we met up with her in Gaziantep , Turkey , to talk about life and war in Syria .
below is a portion of that chat .
SD : what was it like in Latakia at the beginning of the revolution ?
Mrie : it started like every other city in Syria .
the demonstrations just had the normal , peaceful slogans like , “ we want better schools ” , “ we want better jobs ” , “ we want democracy ” .
we didn ’ t even say the line “ al shaab yureed isqat al nizam ” — “ the people want the regime to fall ” .
SD : were there many Alawites protesting ?
there were hardly any .
Latakia is full of Alawites , and most of them were supporting the regime .
we had just a small slice of society that was against the regime , but they didn ’ t go to demonstrations because they were so afraid .
from day one , the regime was trying to convince people that this is not a revolution – it ’ s just terrorists or an Islamic movement against you .
SD : when did it all happen ?
when did your family fall apart ?
Mrie : it happened last November .
it was so traumatic , I couldn ’ t even think about anything .
I felt guilt , huge guilt .
I kept crying for three days , but then I realized that my mom didn ’ t die just to see me crying in my bed the whole day . so I chose the other option : to grab my camera and go back to Syria .
SD : did she speak to you in the final month ?
Loubna
Mrie : no , they kidnapped her in the middle of August .
I didn ’ t hear from her again since then .
even my aunts and my grandma didn ’ t call me because they were so afraid that if the government found out they were in touch with me , they would harm them .
even my neighborhood and my old friends didn ’ t talk with me at all .
they didn ’ t say we are sorry , we feel sad , we feel anything .
they were saying that you deserve that .
so it ’ s not only the loss of my mom that broke my heart , it ’ s also the attitude of the people that I was growing up with .
SD : what was your father ’ s argument ?
Mrie : I have no idea .
but maybe they were just convinced by these stories that the regime has been telling them : that this is an Islamic movement and they will kill you , and that you will lose everything .
I think that for the big families – my family is one of them — they are so afraid .
they know that when the regime will fall they will lose almost everything , because when the regime was in control they knew they could do anything and no one would punish them .
they could do all the stealing , the cheating , the robberies .
for me , I understand the rich families or the families that are in power , but I don ’ t understand the poor families who support Assad .
I remember my neighbors … they were so poor .
I ’ d wonder , why are you supporting this regime ?
what did the regime do for you ?
after a while we discovered it ’ s like a religious thing for them .
in the last years , it was Hafez Al Assad , and now it &apos;s Bashar Al Assad The people worship these guys .
since the revolution began , I kept telling people that the protesters who are in the streets , the opposition , they are not monsters .
I fled to Turkey with the help of the Free Syrian Army .
they were so nice to me and they helped me .
they knew that I ’ m an Alawite , but they didn ’ t kill me as the government is always trying to say .
SD : do you think they are changing their opinion at all ?
do you think the community is changing its opinion at all ?
Mrie : now they are stuck in the middle .
they are losing their children in battle .
they are losing their generation in the army .
so they know that the government is not making any good for them , but at the same time they are so afraid of the opposition .
we have Islamist elements in the revolution , and it makes them afraid .
I have been hearing stories about how , when the dead bodies come to the villages of the Alawites , all the village starts to curse Bashar Al Assad and curse his government because he ’ s not protecting them and they are sacrificing themselves for someone who is not making any efforts .
SD : from what we keep hearing , the regime has scared the Alawite community so much that they think it ’ s a battle for survival , life or their death .
how do you think that you can calm down those fears ?
Mrie : the problem in this community is that they won ’ t understand .
all they know is that if you were an Alawite and you were against the regime , your punishment will be doubled .
if they just saw the stories and just turned on the TV and heard the slogans , they would know that this is not a revolution against them .
SD : right now in the Alawite community , if somebody stands up , like you , and supports the revolution , what happens ?
Mrie : they would kill his mom .
SD : they say that ?
Mrie : no , but it happened to me .
I ’ m not a terrorist .
I didn ’ t do anything wrong .
I just stepped out from my small community and said that I am with the revolution , I am with my people .
I ’ m not going to witness all this bloodshed and keep quiet .
it ’ s not a political cause , it ’ s now a human cause … this is a revolution for us , for our children , for our grandchildren .
SD : the whole regime could change tomorrow .
whenever it happens , how is this community going to react ?
how is Syria going to change if you have so much fear within the Alawite community ?
Mrie : right now we have liberated areas .
there are Alawites in those liberated areas , so you can see samples of a new Syria , how it ’ s going to be .
&#91; the opposition is &#93; not killing the Alawites , they are not kicking them out of their houses .
we are all one .
we are just a good community .
not because of Bashar Al Assad , because we are a peaceful people .
SD : there are some Alawites in the coalition , in the opposition .
are they people that the larger Alawite community respects ?
are they people that can be leaders and help the community ?
Mrie : the community hates the Alawites who are with Moaz al Khatib .
they say these are not even Alawites — they are outcasts .
Loubna
I ’ m living the same situation myself .
they broke into my house .
they stole all my things .
they stole my papers from my college .
all I got from my Alawite community , who are supporters of the regime , was just bad words on Facebook .
SD : what did they say ?
Mrie : that you deserved it and we wish that the same thing that happened to your mom will happen to you .
SD : there might always be some anger against the Alawites for standing behind Assad ?
what does that mean for Syria ?
Mrie : in Syria the shelling is still going on and everyday we have more dead people .
so we can ’ t really decide now the shape of the future Syria .
we know that revenge doesn ’ t build a country , doesn ’ t build democracy .
we went in the streets and made sacrifices to make a new country ; revenge will not help us to do this .
but we will punish the people who did make mistakes , who killed .
Mexico : 20-year-old Woman is New Police Chief of Northern Mexican Town
her name is Marisol Valles García and she has been called the “ bravest woman in Mexico ” .
Valles García is a 20-year-old married woman studying her last year of Criminology ; she is also the new chief of police in Práxedis , Chihuahua .
Práxedis is located around 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) away from Ciudad Juárez , Mexico &apos;s most violent city .
but , why was she given this important job ?
Richard Grabman explained the situation in his blog The Mex Files :
the only candidate to step forward to command the public security force was Marisol Valles García , a twenty-year old criminology student .
the new sheriff in town ( and the youngest police chief in Mexico ) oversees a tiny department that at most can provide two shifts of patrol officers per community .
Cristhian García , a 21-year-old Mexican blogger , commented on the subject :
the mayor of this town was looking for a Chief of Police , and after reviewing all the men inside the corporation , Marisol stood up and said : “ Here everybody is scared , we are all afraid , but let &apos;s change that fear to safety ”
and to prove her courage , yesterday Marisol was photographed with her face uncovered , showing that in Mexico there are still courageous people willing to fight drug trafficking and organized crime .
an article in the news website La Polaka affirmed that , “ none of the men want to be a policeman and much less the police chief , because of the fear to be executed as many others in uniform have been . ”
currently , Mexican citizens and people from all over the world who have heard of Valles García &apos;s case have been tweeting about the news : user Adam D. Prince ( @ rabbitcincouno ) from Ohio tweeted :
# HerooftheWeek Award goes to 20 yr old Marisol Valles Garcia , a criminology student that has become Police Chief in Guadalupe , Mexico …
Laura Ruíz ( @ YoSoyBereNice ) , from Veracruz , México contributed with her opinion :
Marisol Valles Garcia a 20-year old , becomes the head of the police in Chihuahua .
– You see “ who wears the pants ” over there .
the subject was even discussed on actor Tom Cruise &apos;s account , ( @ TomCruise ) :
20yr Marisol Valles Garcia is a real-life hero as police chief of Mexico &apos;s most violent town .
let &apos;s show her support : http : / / bit.ly / ata0wm
finally , in the blog Hermosillo at Periodista Digital , the case is addressed and Valles García is mentioned as someone her region is proud of :
without a doubt , once again “ the skirts ” of one beautiful and courageous woman from Chihuahua give her region a good name .
anyway , we welcome comments as SHE , MARISOL VALLES GARCÍA , like that in capital letters , was the only one who accepted the job .

Nigeria Votes 2011 : opinions From the Polls
this post is part of our special coverage Nigeria Elections 2011 .
Nigerians voted yesterday ( 16 April , 2011 ) in the third presidential election since the nation transitioned to civilian rule in 1999 .
thus far , the election has widely been declared a success , with only sporadic reports of violence and voting irregularities .
news sources reported a large turnout , orderly queues , and voters waiting until polls closed to make sure their votes were counted .
as Africa &apos;s largest nation and a major international oil supplier , Nigeria stands in the spotlight during election season .
previous elections in 2003 and 2007 were marred by fraud and violence ; as a result , high hopes have been placed on this year &apos;s polls .
in this video uploaded to YouTube by jakobu1802 on April 9 , 2011 , parliamentary election results are tallied in Oyo State :
incumbent Goodluck Johnathan , the former vice-president who assumed office after his predecessor &apos;s death last year , is perceived as the frontrunner ; his closest competition is expected from Mohammadu Buhari , who briefly governed the country during the 1980s .
other challengers are former anti-corruption chief Nuhu Ribadu and Kano State governor Ibrahim Shekarau , as well as 16 candidates from smaller parties .
official results are expected Monday .
for more coverage , check out GV &apos;s special page on the Nigerian Election .
report from the polls
at Bella Naija , Chiedu Ifeozo wrote how he changed his mind about voting in Nigeria .
he said that although he had voted in “ every election that was held while I lived in England , ” at home in Nigeria he just “ didn &apos;t see the point , ” because of the prevalent assumption that ‘ Nigerian votes do not count ’ and ‘ the winners have already been decided . ’ But , like many young Nigerians , Ifeozo changed his mind and headed to the polls this election season :
regardless of the cynicism , there has been renewed vigor among the people of my generation regarding the 2011 elections .
various youth coalition groups have gone all out to show that it isn ’ t only ‘ cool ’ to vote but have gone as far as giving insight into exactly who was running for the various offices by performing online polls , organizing a debate , and even developing web and mobile applications for easy monitoring of the elections through citizen reports .
through these processes , the candidates became more than just names and faces on campaign posters .
they became the possible agents of change my country needed .
he then gave a blow-by-blow account of his experience on voting day :
1.04pm : when it was my turn , my heart was beating a little fast , I can ’ t lie .
we had been educated on how to correctly complete the process for our votes to count , and I didn ’ t want to make a mistake , certainly not at the last moment .
I handed the official my registration card , and he passed it to another official while he searched for my name on the list .
when he found it , he put some ink on my right thumb and ushered me to the female NYSC personnel from earlier , who tore out two separate ballot sheets folded them and stamped some information on the back .
she then wrote some details as well before handing it over to me and then directed me to the polling booth , a white folded stand with visors on both sides to prevent anyone from seeing me make my choice .
I made towards the ballot boxes , one for the senate and the other for the House of Representatives , put my ballot sheets through the slot and I was done .
I had voted for the first time , and honestly the first thing that crossed my mind was , “ that wasn ’ t so bad now was it ” .
he concluded :
5.15pm : I saw the result of my polling unit on the internet .
my lips stretched into a smile … .. “ this is is the beginning of a new day for my country . ”

in a post titled “ A different kind of war , ” Salisu Suleiman wrote about how the election season interrupts the business of daily life :
all schools were closed down .
no form of teaching or learning took place for the duration .
when it was discovered that the private school the president ’ s children attend did not close down along with others , public outcry forced it to close down also .
after the initial two weeks , an extension was sought and granted .
so for an entire month , all primary and secondary schools in the whole country were shut .
even in tertiary institutions , not much activity took place .
in that one month period , every Nigerian aged 18 and above was practically drafted to put down their names and fingerprints at various centres .
government said it was a civic duty .
Preachers harangued citizens on the need to perform this divinely inspired responsibility .
parties tried every trick known and unknown to get people to these centres .
civil society groups made sure they were not left out and they shouted loudly on the need for citizens to participate in the noble exercise .
public holidays were declared in several states to ensure that the details of all eligible citizens were captured .
sophisticated digital equipment , worth over USD 500 million , were imported .
at the end of one month of frantic activity , including a week ’ s extension , over 73 million gallant Nigerians had voluntarily participated in the noble cause .
Imnakoya expressed a cautious optimism shared by many in the blogosphere :
people came out to vote , voted , and even waited for the votes to be counted , without being intimidated by gun-trotting hoodlums , as was the case 2007 .
this appears to be the case across most South-western region of the country .
this is a significant shift from the last election .
writing at NigeriansTalk , Kunle Durojaiye agreed :
one cannot deny that there is a sense of a wind of change .
people voted , and waited behind to witness the counting and collation of votes ; media stations ran a live coverage of the elections while it lasted , and very importantly , young people influenced the exercise with the flood of information available via twitter , facebook and blackberry messaging .
without mincing words , change is inevitable , but one just wonders if the stage is truly set .
the Nigerian parliamentary election was held last Saturday , April 9 .
the presidential poll was held yesterday , April 16 .
the vote for state governors is scheduled for April 26 .
Latin America : reporting On , Twitter for journalists gets popular
the success of Twitter has had an enormous influence on many new sites , that want to copy the formula : short messages , from all kinds of devices , for a restricted audience . one of the sites that follows this example is Reporting On , a kind of Twitter for journalists , that has been in working in beta phase since last year .
and if you register , you &apos;ll find the site is getting quite successful particularly among Latin American journalists .
the structure is very similar to Twitter &apos;s ; we can write up to 140 characters , which most users take advantage of to write news in the form of headlines .
each piece of news can be tagged with many words .
we can comment in each others posts as well as reply to them , but we can &apos;t follow certain users or filter contents , except for the tags .
Pablo Mancini interviewed Ryan Sholin , who &apos;s behind the project , and he points out that Reporting On “ is a non profit project financed by Knight News Challenge in order to improve local news , connecting people who don &apos;t talk with each other enough ” .
and he adds : “ once the site is working with a healthy amount of applications , I will make the code open source and invite developers and journalists to improve it so they can launch their own versions of the site ” .
also talk about Reporting On : Bloc de Periodista ( en español ) ; The Exploding Newsroom ; Random Mumblings ; and Linchpen . at DigiDave you can find another interview to Sholin .
tweets from Beirut : day Two of the Arab Bloggers Workshop
the second day of the Arab Bloggers Workshop kicked off with a presentation about Herdict Web , a site which uses crowdsourcing to gather reports of Internet filtering from users around the world .
Qatari workshop participant Muhammad Basheer tweeted a photo from the presentation :
Muhammad Basheer tweets about Herdict
following the first presentation , Egyptian blogger Manal discussed the world of Arab techies , particularly touching about female techies in Egypt .
Lebanese NightS noted the need for more women at # ab09 :
nights calls for more female techies
after Manal &apos;s informative presentation , the bloggers broke into group workshops , touching on a variety of subjects .
one workshop , conducted by hamzoz , focused on blogging from Iraq .
Muhammad Basheer attended the presentation and tweeted :
Muhammad Basheer attended @ hamzoz &apos;s presentation
Creative Commons rep Donatella Della Ratta also attended , tweeting :
Donatella tweets about @ hamzoz &apos;s presentation
Bahraini participant Amira Al Hussaini attended a presentation by the lead of the new Rising Voices project in Yemen .
she was clearly impressed by the workshop :
Amira Al Hussaini is impressed by the number of Yemeni bloggers
the last major presentation of the day was once again perhaps the most captivating .
Anas Tawileh , founder of Meedan , presented on the Arabic-English crowd translation project .
Iraqi blogger Salam Pax best captured the sentiment in this tweet :
Salam Pax was captivated by the Meedan presentation
Tawileh opened his presentation with a number of interesting facts about the Internet including one that the number of hours spent on Facebook in a year , translated into volunteer hours , could be spent to build the Giza pyramids in only 9 days .
Amira Al Hussaini shared another of Tawileh &apos;s tidbits :
Amira Al Hussaini tweets a fun fact
tweeting about the concept , Moroccan GV author Hisham G. summed up Meedan in a few words :
Hisham G. talks about the concept of a &quot; translingual web &quot;
Lastly , Meedan itself ( which has covered the workshop here ) noted on Twitter that they &apos;ll be translating tweets from the conference ( which can otherwise be found on hashtag # ab09 ) :
Meedan will be translating tweets from the workshop
Guadeloupe : escalating tensions lead to violence
after weeks of largely peaceful protests in the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique , things took a violent turn on Monday , as police and demonstrators clashed in Guadeloupe &apos;s largest city , Pointe-à-Pitre .
workers are protesting skyrocketing unemployment and the rising costs of basic necessities , many of which are imported from France .
on the citizen media website , Agoravox , Illiouchine , a métropolitain &#91; a French citizen from mainland France &#93; , describes the scene in Guadeloupe this weekend and the calm that followed Monday night &apos;s violence , an unfortunate turn of events
the weather was gorgeous this morning , sunny , no wind , and not a cloud in the sky .
the summit of Soufrière &#91; a volcano in Guadeloupe National Park &#93; was perfectly clear .
you could see the smoke rising straight up to the sky from vents at the top of the volcano .
last night was a different story .
the areas around PAP &#91; Pointe-à-Pitre , the largest city in Guadeloupe &#93; were the center of violent scenes : fires , shops looted .
of course , grocery stores were not touched : it was the sporting goods stores and the car accessory shops that paid the price .
all over , there were new barricades this morning .
the prefect stayed calm but explained he will continue to clear up the roads .
for the moment , Saint Claude is back to normal , stores are open , people going about their business .
la Guadeloupe en colère describes Monday &apos;s events :
yesterday morning , a number of roadblocks were raised by striking militants in strategic places .
… a number of police squads , sent to the island at the beginning of the conflict , went forward with the clearing of the barricades .
the inevitable happened .
facing resistance from the protestors , security forces did not hesitate to use force .
a number of protestors were taken in for questioning , about 50 , all of whom will be released today after a short stay in police custody .
I deplore how the situation has deteriorating , where violence reigns it &apos;s because dialogue has failed … Whose fault is it ?
the state ?
the masses ?
the employers ?
everyone is responsible because everyone knows the outcome !
it was hard to wake up .
I was shocked when I learned that the newspaper shop , rare island of culture , was burned down .
I feel dread overtaking me.I decide to go to work ; &#91; I am &#93; surely too conscientious or zealous .
our supervisors contact us and tell us to go home , deeming the situation too precarious .
I leave … Smoldering garbage pave the streets …
for the first time , I ask myself where we are going …
in a comment , f parfait writes :
without justifying everything that &apos;s happened , find hope in that fact that Guadeloupean society has not even existed for 400 years , and the Guadeloupean people ( when was the abolition of slavery ? ) .
we are a society in formation .
how long did it take France to get to where it is today ? …
Caro in a comment on a Rue89 article , explains what are , in this reader &apos;s opinion , the root causes of the current conflict :
the big mistake , in my opinion , was trying to settle &#91; the unrest &#93; in French Guiana in December ( because the first rumblings of this started in French Guiana ) , without doing anything for Guadeloupe or Martinique , which everyone knew were preparing for a general strike .
the government let the situation deteriorate , all the while knowing the frustrations of the people , the exploding unemployment , that basic goods , imported from the metropole , were becoming more and more expensive
the overseas departments receive a lot of money , not only from the metropole , but also from European sources ( they are part of Europe … ) , but this money does not serve the people , who just get poorer …
… If they don &apos;t want to see all of the overseas departments explode ( French Guiana will be ready to go on strike again after the end of carnival , and things are also happening in Reunion ) , it is in the government &apos;s interest to quickly find a way to open their wallets in a way that benefits the people , and not the employers .
but that &apos;s against the philosophy of landlords .
how will this end ?
we can be worried .
we need mass support from people in mainland France , to show that our solidarity .
what happens there affects us too .
Pakistan : sugar Crisis Turns Ramadan Bitter
every year during the month of Ramadan there is usually a shortage in the food commodities market In Pakistan due to excessive demand .
this year the shortfall in supply is particularly acute in the sugar market .
to combat this the government plans to increase the volume of sales of sugar through utility stores ( subsidized government outlets ) from 40,000 tons to 100,000 tons . however just driving past any of these stores is proof enough to convince a person that sufficient supply of sugar is not available .
as per a report in The Dawn , which cites the supply condition in Karachi , the stores are getting less supplies of sugar than usual and are unable to cater the growing demands of the consumers .
the sugar price in the open market rose to Rs 55-58 per kg ( when available ) whereas the official selling price of sugar is Rs 38 per kg .
Hassan Khan remarks on the political angle to this crises on his blog :
Pakistan has approximately 80 sugar mills .
most of them owned by investors and politicians .
level of hypocrisy is that before ramzan , they have started stocking sugar and its price from Rs 38 per kg jumped to Rs 54 .
it always looks bad when you switch to Pakistani news channels but worst when such crises is on its peak and a minister is briefing press that due to increase in international prices of sugar , sugar prices are increasing in the Pakistan .
sugar Cane Production In Pakistan .
image by Flickr User Omer Wazir
Sana Saleem says that the sugar shortage is due to a reduced crop production this year :
the farmers have reportedly blamed the mill owners of not providing adequate payments .
records state that the payments to the growers were delayed for more than eight to ten months .
this discouraged farmers from sowing sugar cane and ( they ) opt ( ed ) for growing wheat instead to avail attractive incentives .
now comes time for manipulations by the mill owners .
not only are the mill owners accused of delaying payments causing a decrease in supply of about 15 to 20 percent as compared to last year , they have also hoarded large amounts of supplies .
these supplies have been hoarded ( conveniently ) in order to create an artificial shortage in the market .
Bilquis , a consultant from Lahore , provides expert analysis on this issue at CHUP :
the current year saw a natural decrease in sugar production .
in general , farmers , like others , only produce crops that give them maximum profit .
in 2008-09 , the current government increased the wheat ( purchasing ) price to Rs 950 ( minimum price ) to encourage farmers to grow wheat .
this was an attractive incentive and resulted in attracting non growers to grow wheat ( as it is profitable ) .
as a result , sugarcane farmers switched to wheat production which resulted in a drop in sugarcane production .
Moreover , over the past decade , sugar cane production has declined because of the naturally difficult / negative constitution of the sugar market .
numerous specialists state that farmers have decreased the total area under production due to water shortage , behavior of the mill ’ s management , late payments , increased input cost , and diseases and rodent attack .
they especially blame mill owners for late and / or no payments to farmers and limited irrigation water that make the farmers reluctant to grow the crop .
hence , these two factors have naturally reduced the supply of sugar by 15 to 20 percent compared to last year .
right now , the Pakistan government is thinking of importing sugar from abroad to meet this shortfall .
however , foreign traders of sugar such as Brazil and India have also raised their prices .
so the price will not be coming down anytime soon .
what happens in the next few days is critical as people are ready to come out on the streets to protest the sugar crisis .
Turkish Police Use Tear-Gas Against Protesting Mothers
Kurdish political prisoners have reached their 55th day of hunger strike .
there are hundreds of political prisoners on hunger strike in Turkey , and this has led to solidarity protests throughout Europe , and in particular within Turkey .
earlier yesterday &#91; November 4 , 2012 &#93; , the mothers of some of the political prisoners staged a sit-in , and were met with tear-gas , as well as water canisters was sprayed directly on them .
Turkish mainstream media and governmental ministers remain oblivious to unfolding anger by Kurdish people , and their disregard for a political settlement of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish question has made the situation worse .
in much of Kurdistan , there has been solidarity protests but despite the attention the hunger strikes have received within Kurdish regions , there are few mainstream media outlets reporting on the hunger strike .
the lack of media coverage has angered many Kurds , who are being vocal on social networking sites .
Hulya , from Liverpool , says :
@ hulyaulas : the biggest political hunger strike in history by Kurdish political prisoners is being ignored in world &apos;s media .
Dirman adds :
@ dirman95 : it is so hard to eat knowing that the hunger strike has been going on for over 51 days and the world is doing nothing about it … disgusting .
Al Jazeera ’ s The Stream has been the only internationally acknowledged mainstream outlet that has highlighted the gravity of the hunger strike .
they have used their social media outlets to raise awareness .
for example they recently tweeted :
@ ajstream : why has the government and Media in Turkey ignored the hunger strikes of 715 Kurdish political prisoners ?
an online petition has been launched , with 3,451 supporters so far , that asks the Turkish government to engage in constructive dialogue with the prisoners .
Judith Butler from Berkeley comments :
the Turkish government must enter into serious dialogue with these prisoners who now risk their lives to expose the injustice under which they live .
KurdishBlogger.com posted the following picture on Facebook .
Kurds in Slemani , South Kurdistan show solidarity with their Kurdish sisters and brothers ( at least 682 inmates ) who are on hunger strike in 67 prisons across Turkey .
and Tara Fatehi , a Kurdish activist in Australia , expressed her anger at the international community :
thousands of Kurdish political prisoners have been on hunger strike in Turkey since Sept 12 and the International community remains silent .
this is Kurdish hunger for freedom , it is not a new concept .
the Kurds have been fighting for rights , peace and freedom for decades .
Hannelore Kuchlersaid said it best “ Kurdistan is a country taken hostage . ” and whilst the international media want you to think this is solely about Abdullah Ocalan and the PKK , it is not .
it &apos;s about acquiring basic human rights in their own homeland .
Egypt : we Are The Champions
the Egyptian football team beat Ghana in the African Cup of Nations ’ final match , and achieved its third consecutive championship .
this is also Egypt &apos;s seventh championship since the launch of the tournament in the 50 ′ s .
bloggers join the rest of the country in celebrating the achievement .
Zeinobia wrote here about the Egyptian victory saying :
we played a good game against Ghana , and at the end fate made Gedo the reason of making nearly 80 million Egyptian happy around the globe , uniting them in a very rare occasion regardless of its psychological meaning or political meaning or whatever .
coach Hassan Shehata is insisting to become one of the best coaches not only in Egypt &apos;s football history but also in Africa &apos;s football history .
this man managed to make something great from our national team for real .
his discovery Mohamed Nagi aka Gedo . Ahmed Hassan was fantastic .
all of the players were great .
the victory wasn &apos;t only celebrated here in Egypt .
in Qatar , Qatar Living wrote here about the victory , and the expected sleepless night in Doha :
Egypt beats Ghana 1-0 to earn African Cup title ..
Mod Note : it &apos;s going to be a noisy night in Doha !
congratulations to all the Egyptians in Qatar !
an Egyptian blogger living in USA , Egyptian Wish , wrote a new post here saying :
dear Egyptians ,
congratulations for CAN2010 !
Egyptian-in-USA
also in Palestine , Hamas didn &apos;t miss the opportunity , and congratulated the Egyptians on their seventh Championship .
Kelmety wrote about it here :
Hamas has congratulated the Egyptian president , government , and people on their winning their seventh African Cup of Nations , and their third consecutive championship .
Zeinobia wrote another post here , about the Egyptian president &apos;s sons , who went to Angola to support the Egyptian football team :
I believe that the photos of the Mubarak brothers should have its own post .
as I hinted before the brothers went to Angola to watch the final match between Egypt and Ghana .
some people will see it as political publicity stunt , others knowing how crazy the brothers about football .
another blogger , My Oblivia , had a different point of view here :
therefore , will someone please bother explaining how can one lousy tournament make us cheer for the same country where this happens …
in this country people die of hunger , they die of torture , they simply die because they don ’ t have half the basic humane standards of living and medical attention , let alone awareness …
so God did not want us to win our daily battles of mere survival , instead , He destined us for winning a soccer game , and entire tournament , hallelujah , we ’ re saved !
so , this is our destined victory , in soccer …
and now , all out other problems are solved and we are eternally blessed !
and finally , the Egyptian national team usually adds a new star on their jersey every time they win the African Cup of Nations .
but Adel Ghaly was wondering here if we have any place left for an extra star :
while I was counting the benefits of participating in this year &apos;s championship , I found that the players , the coach , and the overall Egyptian football history has achieved many unmatched achievements .
but there is one problem here : where will we put all those stars on our national team &apos;s jerseys now that we have won our seventh championship .
Austria : how Social Media Set “ Universities on Fire ”
did you know that at this very moment many universities throughout Europe are occupied by students ?
thousands of them are sleeping , cooking , debating and partying in their auditoriums to protest against the under-financing of the educational system and the so-called Bologna Process , a European Union education policy .
what is so special about these protests is the fact that they have not been centrally coordinated by student unions but have been organized entirely bottom-up , with the help of online social media .
it all started in Vienna , Austria on October 22 , when a small group of students met for a flashmob in the city center to protest , and then headed to University of Vienna where they spontaneously occupied the Auditorium Maximum .
by the time police arrived , the news of the occupation had already circulated on Twitter , mobilizing so many supporters it was impossible to clear the hall .
unsereuni website
within days , the occupiers – to their own surprise – put in place a remarkable organizational structure : mobilization and communication was organized via the Twitter “ hashtags ” # unibrennt and # unsereuni ( “ university on fire ” and “ our university ” ) .
a 24h webcast from the Auditorium Maximum was put in place .
organizational tasks from cooking to cleaning were structured via a wiki , and a website communicated with the public .
Twitter , blogs and Facebook ( 32,400 fans so far ) were used to spread the word .
this had two effects :
- For the first time protests of this scale did not need the support of mass media for mobilization .
within less than a week after the beginning of the protests more than 20,000 demonstrators roamed the streets of Vienna , preceding any mass media coverage .
media contacts were limited to a bare minimum ( which produced much confusion ) .
students simply didn ‘ t need the media and since the protests lacked hierarchy , there was a shortage of spokespersons .
- Second , because everyone could follow what was going on inside the Auditorium Maximum ( the webcast produced half a million views within one month ) it kept the tabloid press from labeling the protesters as rioters or extremists .
too many people knew it wasn ‘ t true .
the power of opinion-making had shifted .
soon the protests infected other university cities in Austria and abroad : today , less than a month and a half after the first protests , almost 100 universities in Austria , Germany , Switzerland , Albania , Serbia , France , Italy , Croatia and the Netherlands are occupied or have seen other forms of mass protest .
on Wissen belastet , Max Kossatz , a blogger and media observer from Austria , has analyzed the Twitter stream : 66,379 tweets by 6,780 different usernames have been published on the subject in the last month .
1,043 pictures were posted on Twitpic and produced 125,612 views – see this Twitpic photo mashup on Youtube .
and especially interesting , is the following map of tweets that illustrates how the protests spread over time ( watch in HD and fullscreen to get the full experience ) :
Gerald Bäck of Bäck Blog , who works in the media observation business , found out that the gross reach of the tweets , i.e. the unique number of followers exposed to them , was 386,860 .
his analysis shows who the key influencers were , what URLs were most linked to and what hashtags were used most .
in his blog , smime , Michael Schuster who is specialist in semantic analysis , contributed an overview of the “ old media ” covering the events .
he counted 2,700 articles and identified four trends lasting roughly one week each : “ Protests take place ” , “ protests continue ” , “ protests widen ” , and recently , “ ok , enough now . ”
Luca Hammer of 2-Blog , a student and technical mastermind behind the Viennese web activities , has published a field report of how wikis , Twitter and webcast were used to get things rolling .
it looks like the case of # unibrennt may become an early milestone in the transformation of Austrian politics by the use of online social media .
it has created wide attention – and confusion – among established media and political structures , and created a spirit of empowerment among students and digital leaders .
Madagascar : more than 25 killed in march to presidential palace
see our special coverage page on Madagascar &apos;s Power Struggle .
at least 25 people were shot dead today in Madagascar &apos;s capital Antananarivo during a march to the presidential palace called by the city &apos;s mayor Andry Rajoelina after he declared himself the leader of a new transitional government at a political rally .
in the past weeks , a power struggle between the mayor and the president Marc Ravalomanana has led to both violence and looting .
the political gathering took place in downtown Antananarivo around noon local time .
Rajoelina announced the creation of a new transitional government , with himself as its leader , in spite of the fact that the current government is still in place .
he asked his supporters to march to the presidential Palace in Ambohitsorohitra .
when the massive crowd arrived at the palace , a delegation entered the palace at 14 : 46 local time .
this is when shots were fired .
the local twittersphere and other bloggers reported :
preliminary reports indicate that dozens of bodies are laying on the streets .
among the casualties , is said to be a cameraman from the RTA TV station ( official confirmation still pending ) .
as of 15 : 40 local time , shots were still being fired .
Rajoelina asked the armed EMMONAT forces , a military entity accepted by both parties and created during the crisis , to intervene and protect the crowds .
news releases ( Reuters , Al Jazeera ) report up to 25 deaths as images are currently streaming on national TV .
BBC and AFP only reported 5 casualties so far .
live online reports can also be found in French here .
this is a live search of Twitter for “ # madagascar ” , which is the tag people have been using throughout the past weeks of political tension and occasional violence .

Haiti , D.R. : escalating Tensions
repeating Islands reports on the murder of four Haitians in the Dominican Republic .
South Africa : on the murder of the leader of Afrikaner Resistance Movement
on the night of the 3rd of April 2010 , the leader of the Afrikaans Weerstandsbeweging ( AWB ) , an Afrikaner resistance movement , Eugene Terre &apos;Blanche , was murdered .
this has happened in the time when issues of race relations are hotly debated following the singing of ‘ kill the boer &apos; , an old apartheid activist song , by the ANC Youth leader , Julius Malema .
let &apos;s see what digital citizens in South Africa are saying about his death and the future of race relations in the county .
from the Old has been following the entire fiasco so far and here &apos;s what he &apos;s posted on the South African Scouts Association : “ Statement by the Verkenners Beweging van Suid-Afrika about the murder of Eugene Terreblanche ”
please NOTE THIS IS A ROUGH TRANSLATION FROM AFRIKAANS TO ENGLISH , PROPER VERSION WILL BE UPDATED IN A FEW MINUTES .
the Scouts Movement of South Africa has learned with sadness of the brutal murder of the elderly Eugene Terre &apos;Blanche .
Mr. Terre &apos;Blanche devoted his life in bondage to his people whom he loved had .
it is instructive to note that the murders are less than a month after Mal-emma the first time the commission had sung “ shoot the farmer . ” This follows two days of court order against Malema and can rightly be asked whether this court order an influence on the killing of our uncle Eugene .
whether there is a connection between the death of the communist Hani Paassaterdag in 1993 and the murder of Uncle Eugene Paassaterdag in 2010 for the Scouts Movement irrelevant .
the fact is , a vulnerable elderly farmer in his bedroom on barbaric way with sticks and PanGas beaten to death and the regime of the day , the climate created for this genocide being committed against our people are .
the link between Julius Malema &apos;s provocative statements and the Murder of Eugnene Terre &apos;blanche is a consistent theme when looking at the list of blog posts on the subject .
DBS on MyDigitalLife calls the event a big opportunity :
the murder of Eugene Terreblanche is a big opportunity for South Africans .
this is a great opportunity to take a big breath and show the world that we are able to be sensible , think before opening mouths and talk to each other before doing anything physically rash .
the hatred stirred up by different leaders in the past months is not good for the country .
let us use this man &apos;s death as a turning point to reconcile ourselves to the different views of the people in the country rather than lying the blame with someone singing a song .
can we do that ?
yes we can !
will we ?
well sadly I suspect not .
obviously having a bone to pick with the AWB .
KickMugabeOut hopes the former AWB Leader suffers eternal torment .
he does cover the story with some very interesting pictures and comments .
one of the pictures shows a guy wearing a T-shirt with the old Apartheid flag as well as an Israeli flag on a fence .
South Africa &apos;s president , Jacob Zuma , has made a statement on the murder of Eugene Terre &apos;Blanche .
one is covered here by the Times Live Blog .
and another perspective on Jacob Zuma &apos;s statement by From The Old :
today Jacob Zuma will speak to South Africa at 2pm .
he will most likely tell South Africans to forget about the event and that we should move on , however many claim this is not possible and that the boers are under attack .
Jacob Zuma also said today that “ South Africans not to allow agent provocateurs to take advantage of this situation by inciting or fuelling racial hatred ” .
however he seems to forget that in the past few weeks white South Africans have been constantly attacked by Julius Malema that cant seem to stop the racial hatred and blaming of white people .
from The Old also covers another statement , this time by the AWB , claiming the murder was political :
the AWB came forward and said in a press conference that the murder was in fact political and that they will retaliate against Julius Malema whom they believe is the cause of the murder .
Julius Malema in the last few weeks incited hatred against white Afrikaners and Boers by insisting on singing the “ kill the boer ” song .
as tensions grow in South Africa just as the World Cup is heading this way .
in under two months South Africa will hold the biggest sport event Africa has seen while polarization and racial tensions are peaking .
continuing on this line , Common Dialogue asks , “ Is Terre Blanche ’ s blood on Malema ’ s hands ? ” :
Eugene Terre Blanche died a violent death allegedly at the hands of his farm hands .
is this as a result of Malema singing “ kill the boer ” ?
Terre Blanche was allegedly hacked and bludgeoned to death on his farm near Ventersdorp , in the North West province , allegedly by farmworkers during an argument over R600 .
emotions are inflamed with some rightwingers even threatening to avenge the killing .
the question is just how “ miraculous ” was South Africa ’ s transition from apartheid to democracy ?
and just how dangerous are the racial utterances by people like Malema and other politicians who are fond of racial political posturing ?
from The Old , covering many aspects of the case on his blog , says this yet again from the AWB &apos;s perspective agreeing with a perspective revealed on Facebook :
“ The BWB sympathizes with the family of Eugene Terreblanche and wants to point to the fact that this deed was politically motivated by Melama as revealed on Facebook ”
white farmers all over South Africa are still under attack , now one of the biggest known boers have been murdered on his own farm because of a wage dispute allegedly .
many find it hard to believe that a normal pay dispute could lead to the death of Eugene Terreblanche the leader and founder of the AWB .
Eugene Terreblanche is said to not sleep at his farm at all and the fact that it came out that he was “ sleeping ” also brings up more doubts about the reality of what happened .
whether or not this is politically motivated is another story , a white farmer employing black people on his farm gets murdered .
the first thing that comes to mind is the song the ANC is so desperate wants to get unbanned .
the same song Julius Malema was gagged not to sing but continues to sing in Zimbabwe despite court orders .
Tony Lankester puts up his opinion in “ What Would Malema Do ? ” :
so Eugene Terreblanche has been murdered .
and although it is probably unrelated , the fact that it happened while the country debates the appropriateness of struggle songs like “ kill the boer ” is going to put the whole debate in stark relief .
it is a real life example of what the song ’ s critics have been saying , and Malemaphobes will gloat into their G &amp; T ’ s .
and while it is unlikely that a tubeless rendition of the song inspired anyone to put a bullet into a sleeping Mr Terreblanche , it will be interesting to see what Julius Malema does next .
will he back down and stop singing it ?
will he publicly condemn the murder and say that actually doing it is not what he meant ?
or will he stick to the principle he ’ s been holding forth and sing it at the next opportunity ?
FliMflaMfLiK argues that instead of focusing on “ kill the boer ” the song , and we should focus on this facts : “ Terreblanche = White Earth ” :
everyone seems to be focussing on “ the song ” but nobody is looking at “ the facts ” .
getting knickers in a twist is what people do best and what they should be doing is sitting back and looking at the logical :
they were 16 and 21 respectively – very young .
they did not run , they waited for the cops .
they were angry about not getting their monthly salary of R300.00 each ( shocking ) .
apparently Eugine treated them very badly in the past ( this I can well believe ) .
he had threatened to kill them before .
given the above , could these young lads have thought ( in their minds ) , that they were acting in self defense ?
just because Eugine was famous , it &apos;s an issue ?
these young men may not have known anything about any song in their parts .
we don &apos;t know .
perhaps it &apos;s wise to wait and see what other facts present themselves ?
and finally , in a satirical twist , Azad Essa uses the Terreblanche event to pick apart issues and stereotypes in the South African Muslim Community in his post on Thought Leader “ Was Terror ’ Blanche a Muslim ? ”
overall , one of South Africa &apos;s leading figures of the “ Afrikaner Resistance ” movement has been put to rest in violent circumstances .
from Kivu to Gaza : how the Media Choose the Conflicts They Cover
if an Israeli death is worth the death of several Palestinians , how many dead Congolese bodies for a Gazan funeral shroud ?
why conflicts in Africa receive such little media attention , in particular the horrors unfolding in Kivu , is an age-old question ( as persistent as the question of why the international media , when they do cover Africa , only cover conflicts ) .
Elia Varela Serra wrote on this website on the same theme , just a few days ago , translating part of an article on Rue89 by journalist Hugues Serraf .
Serraf &apos;s treatment of these questions has generated controversy among many francophone readers , both Congolese and Muslim .
some Rue89 readers agree with Serraf &apos;s general sentiment .
Rafa explains why the media in France pay so much more attention to Palestine than it does to Congo :
French society &apos;s hyper-awareness of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes from the presence of both of these communities in France , who replay over here whatever happens there .
in contrast , the conflict in Congo seems like just another tragedy on a cursed continent that people don &apos;t pay attention to anymore because these kinds of tragedies are so frequent .
another Ru89 reader , Pierre Haski :
last month , I saw a Congolese protest at the &#91; Place de la République in Paris &#93; about the conflict in their country .
there were a few dozen , packed in between the ropes of the &#91; riot police &#93; , passersby completely indiferent .
Saturday , I saw the Palestinian protest when it was just beginning ; television cameras were already there .
but there were many who deplored the author &apos;s ignorance of the continent .
Serraf , in his article , said :
me , I am like you .
I don &apos;t know a whole lot about Congo and this Lord &apos;s Resistance Army … Not only that , there are two Congos !
and then Africa is incredibly complex .
between natural disasters , disease epidemics , warlords roving in Land Cruisers , and all that … How do we know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys ?
he also write that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be much better-covered in France because , at least from the perspective of the public , it is much easier to differentiate between the “ good ” and the “ evil ” .
blogger Alex Engwete , who has been covering the conflict in Kivu with daily updates on his blog , rails , in a comment , against Serraf &apos;s self-stated ignorance :
I began with a certain affinity for your indignation over the silence surounding the Congolese catastrophy before finding out in your three last paragraphs where you were going .
I was even going to share with you what one of my journalist friends at the BBC confided to me in Nairobi , that that noble broadcast network asked him … to stop sending dispatches from Congo if the number of deaths was below 50 !
they were blacks and it was the heart of darkness , after all , where the norm is “ the horror ! the horror ! ” — according to Joseph Conrad … But then I realized , disillusioned , that Congo is nothing more than a beacon ( sensational pretext ) leading us toward the anticlimax of your twisted rhetoric !
if you don &apos;t know anything about the Congo , let the dead rest in peace !

Djé who blogs at case en construction writes :
the media frenzy over the horrors currently being committed in Gaza have had the tendency to turn the attention of the media ( and by extension , the public at large ) away from what is still happening in Kivu .
certain , unscrupulous journalists have even profited by using , for the purpose of pro-Israeli propaganda , the weak media attention given to the war in the east of Congo .
Djé calls Serraf &apos;s article “ a gross attempt at misinformation ” and tells to instead consider an article written on the same theme at kongotimes.info which argues that , “ The two wars carry the same fears , with almost the same stakes and risks of destabilizing the region ” .
users on the web forum islamie.com were similarly turned off by Serraf &apos;s comparison and the sensationalization of the attacks on Gaza by the media , in general . Abdullah asks , sarcastically , “ How many Afghan bodies for a Gazan funeral shroud ? ” :
in light of the current passion for Gaza , I have been very uneasy since I read a quote by Abou Ghazi saying that there are massacres all the time in Afghanistan that no one , or almost no one , cares about .
it &apos;s not that I feel more or less concerned about one or the other .
but a quote like that , that reveals ( in the first meaning of the word ) many things .
what a miserable state we are in !
we let ourselves be fed , fooled , led around by the media .
it really makes me sick .
Jounaïda :
Abou Ghazi &apos;s quote simply reflects our mediocrity .
it also reveals one thing : that we really are the puppets of the media , always thirsty for the sensational .
we need , and we will always need , concrete actions for our oppressed brothers and sisters , at least until God &apos;s words rule the earth .

Souleymene :
… I &apos;ve asked myself this sort of thing many times in the last few days .
but I would say more , the mobilization that we are living is just an epiphenomenon .
when this whole affair dies down ( and Allah knows better … ) for at a given moment it &apos;s all going to go back to “ order ” , and seeing the rulers we have , there is no risk of unrest .
the would-be jihadis that we see on the television , in Yemen and in Jordan among other places , won &apos;t be going anywhere , may ALLAH reward them for their intentions .
Muslims will return to their mundane preoccupations , Palestine will be forgotten , and the blood spilled in Gaza along with it .
Malawi &apos;s President to formally declare new love on Valentine &apos;s Day
Malawians are digesting news that the country &apos;s president Dr Bingu wa Mutharika is on May 1 to marry his former tourism minister Callister Chimombo .
this will be preceeded by a tradional custom engament on Valenetine &apos;s Day 14 February .
a couple of bloggers have wished the president well in his new found love following the death of his wife Ethel three years ago .
Emmanuel Sobilika of Malawi Digest writes :
in a press statement issued on Wednesday made available to Malawi Digest , the State House says that President Mutharika is expected to marry Chimombo on 1st May , 2010 .
however , before the official marriage itself , the two will have their traditional custom engagement on 14th February , 2010 .
14th February is the world ’ s Valentines Day where people commemorate love with their loved ones .
the official statement discloses that both Dr Mutharika and Miss Callista Chapola Chimombo are a widower and widow respectively .
state House says that both Dr Bingu wa Mutharika and Chimombo are devout Roman Catholics .
journalist Kondwani Munthali congratulates the president for what he calls :
leading the way by announcing their intentions for Holy Matrimony , adding hopefully we will find a card for the event and share with many of my freinds here the pictures .
Callista was spoted at several state functions sitting next to the president .
she earlier on denied the love story .
state house officials also refused to explain the protocol and justify the former minister &apos;s closeness to the president at the state functions .
Richard Chirombo in Malawi &apos;s commercial capital Blantyre wrote :
Chimombo has since mid-December 2009 been seen sitting next to Mutharika , a position reserved for high government officials and trusted pals .
instead , Chimombo says it is the president who chooses who to sit next to him , and as such it was “ just a previlege ” that Mutharika has allowed her to sit next to him .
this will be the second state wedding in Malawi after Bakili Muluzi &apos;s in 1999 .

South Africa : Sesame Street &apos;s HIV-Positive Muppet Raises Awareness
as the children &apos;s show Sesame Street celebrates its 40th anniversary this month , premiering its new season today , one cute and cuddly Muppet on its South African edition continues to help combat and raise awareness about HIV / AIDS .
while Sesame Street is seen in over 140 countries , each version addresses local issues and has different Muppets .
Golden-yellow Kami made her debut on the South African Sesame Street co-production , called Takalani Sesame , in 2002 in response to the country &apos;s HIV / AIDS problem .
the world &apos;s first HIV-positive Muppet , she helps educate kids about the disease and confronts issues related to being HIV-positive .
the name Kami is derived from the Setswana word “ Kamogelo , ” meaning “ acceptance . ” Sunshinestar110 , blogging on U Don &apos;t Like My Opinion … That &apos;s Fine !
talks more about Kami :
“ Kami is a healthy HIV Positive , affectionate 5 year old orphan who is a little shy but quickly joins when approached in a friendly way , She also knows a lot about HIV , she lost her mother to the disease .
when Kami was unveiled , with her mop of brown hair and she also wore a vest , wandering onto Sesame Street and wondering nervously if the residents will want to play with her .
she didn &apos;t have to worry because the other Muppets enthusiastically welcomed her . ”
Kami was introduced to help the many children in South Africa who are dealing with the HIV / AIDS crisis .
South Africa is believed to have the highest number of people infected with HIV in the world — an estimated 5.7 million people . approximately 280,000 of those infected are children 14 and younger and there are 1.4 million orphans in the country due to AIDS .
in addition to the physical complications of having HIV , there &apos;s also the stigma and taboo that comes with having the disease , which makes it harder for people to receive adequate treatment and support .
Takalani Sesame , which incorporates all 11 of South Africa &apos;s official languages , tries to help children address some of these issues head on through Kami .
however , there was much controversy when Kami was introduced , particularly in the U.S. , as many were outraged that a children &apos;s show would feature an HIV-positive character .
haven on Earth elaborates on the debate :
“ Although it was reported that Kami &apos;s arrival on Sesame Street in South Africa was welcomed ( I have a hard time accepting this as fact because of the still high level of denial still there ) , there was definite controversy here in United States .
I remember reading about this ( which is why I was so pleased to actually encounter a show airing while in South Africa – it would have never occurred to me to look for it ) .
apparently a group of Republican congressmen sent a letter to the President of PBS ( Public Broadcasting Service ) that airs Sesame Street .
the letter protested that plans to introduce a similar HIV-positive character in the United States in due course were inappropriate , given the age of the audience .
they suggested that such a move might threaten public funding of PBS &#91; Public Broadcasting Service &#93; . ”
Kami has never appeared on the American Sesame Street , though she has proven to be a very successful character on Takalani Sesame and beyond .
in 2003 , UNICEF appointed her as a global “ Champion for Children . ” In this video , she joins former U.S. president Bill Clinton to deliver a message about HIV / AIDS .
Jamie , blogging on No day but today … , discusses Kami &apos;s other successes .
“ Since most South African children know someone who has AIDS , the character has become a national hero , beloved by the country &apos;s people .
Kami has appeared at the United Nations and the World Bank and was interviewed by Katie Couric .
she has also been named a UNICEF ambassador for children and has appeared in Takalani segments alongside Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela . ”
despite Kami &apos;s success , some bloggers still believe that she &apos;s not an appropriate character for the American version of Sesame Street .
Emily Meyer , blogging for her honors class , says :
“ Although it is important for Americans to know about HIV / AIDS and the seriousness of the diseases , I think teaching kids at the ages of two and three is a little extreme .
children this young would most likely not understand about HIV and would not understand its consequences .
if Kami was to be introduced in the United States as a way to spread knowledge and combat AIDS , I do not think the intended results would occur … Kids in America are not forced to deal with the issue of HIV / AIDS at that young of an age .
I think the appropriate time for kids in America to learn about the seriousness of HIV is when they are older , about ten or eleven years old or when the student becomes sexually active ”
still , many bloggers , such as this one writing on Muppets and History , see Kami has another example of how Sesame Street has pushed the boundaries .
others profess their love for the Muppet and the message she brings to children .
and still others think she should be introduced on other versions of Sesame Street .
on her personal blog , Steisha Pintado says :
“ She shows children that it is okay to hug someone who is HIV positive , and she explains what to do when she has a cut on her finger or if you have a cut yours .
she teachers her young audience about coping with illness and loss … Even though sex is never mentioned when talking about Kami ’ s condition , some people have said that having an HIV positive character would be inappropriate for a young viewing audience .
one legislature even claimed that the Sesame Workshop would lose its government funding if it aired a program with such a character in our country .
it is so shocking to hear these words .
parents spend less and less time with their children , and allow the television to educate them more and more .
so obviously many parents aren ’ t teaching their children how to handle delicate subjects of awareness and acceptance .
parents have already allowed the Sesame Workshop to introduce acceptance with those who have disabilities and illnesses , and also with those who are a different race or religion .
how is this any different ? ”
South Africa : Julius Malema &apos;s Reverse Racism
while the antics of President Zuma have always generated intense and lively debate in the South African blogosphere , this time it is the controversial politician and the president of the African National Congress Youth League , Julius Malema , who &apos;s making headlines .
recently , Malema led students in singing an old Anti-Apartheid struggle song called Kill the Boer .
he is facing criminal charges for the song .
let &apos;s see reactions from South African bloggers .
writes a post entitled “ Shoot the Boers , they are rapists ! ! !
Julius Malema
he is such an imbecile , and they think that this little Pedi will become our next president .
I am so immigrating to another country if he becomes our commander in chief .
people think that Zuma makes us look like monkeys ; well Julius will do way worse than the honourable JZ .
he sang an old struggle song “ Shoot the Boers , they are rapists ” !
I love the fact that he believes in Democracy , but spreads hate speech !
Mr. Jackson Mthembu , spokesperson of the ANC , is actually defending him , saying it is not his fault and that he was quoted , or whatever , out of context .
well I think Julius is stupid and ignorant and a racist , but please do not quote me out of context !
that is so not what I mean , hello !
Rea from “ My Life and World ” discusses Malema &apos;s outburst in a post entitled , very aptly I might add , “ Put down that scissors Malema , before someone gives you a damn hiding ! ! ! !
we all know what happens when you run with scissors right ?
well that is exactly what Malema is doing right now , running around like a spiteful child who doesn ’ t want to listen to his mother .
the moment when he falls down and stick himself in the eye all his little friends are going to abandon him and run away leaving him bleeding like a stuck pig .
he won ’ t listen to anyone telling him what he should do .
you won ’ t believe that we are hosting the Fifa World Cup Soccer , the way he is acting .
if he thinks any overseas visitors will come here to pump this country full of money when it seems as if unrest is at the order of the day here , he is in stall for a very rude awakening .
but coming off from Malema &apos;s rant , the ANC and the South African President were quick to defend one of their executive leaders .
common Dialogue writes , “ The ANC will talk to Malema about his racial utterances ?
that would be a first ! ” :
the ANC says it will “ engage ” Youth League president Julius Malema on his recent racial outburst at a student rally .
fat chance !
the party ’ s spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi said : ” We are always in contact with the youth league , we will continue talking to them … even in this instance we would engage with them , ” he said .
Malema , according to media reports , led students at the University of Johannesburg in a song saying : “ Shoot the boere &#91; farmers &#93; , they are rapists . ”
now , we all know that Malema has been insulting people including senior members of the ANC and its alliance partners at will .
nothing has happened to him .
a few old-school white South African &apos;s have joined the fray in the blogosphere pointing out the hypocrisy .
Wessel &apos;s Place puts up his frustrations on his blog :
while Julius Malema was singing “ Shoot the Boers ” at an ANC Youth league rally , farmers were being killed in the Limpopo province .
and no black political leader said anything .
I find this sad .
I find a great inconsistency in our country .
if any white person uttered the words “ Shoot the Zulu &apos;s ” or “ Shoot the Xhosa &apos;s ” , they would have reason to fear for their lives .
in fact , when someone dared finger the presidential convoy , this person was arrested and humiliated by the authorities .
I want to believe in this country .
I want to believe in its potential .
I want to believe that my children can grow up here without having to apologize for being white .
blogging at My Digital Life , The Source puts up a fairly long rant entitled “ Kill the Kafir song ? ” …
so the ANC is defending Julius Malema for singing a song containing the lyrics , “ Shoot the boere , they are rapists ” .
ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu told Sapa by phone on Thursday morning that he will defend Malema and that the song should be seen in context ( Read full article ) .
he continues to say :
“ The issue is , indeed , some people might be correct that there might be songs we should not sing .
let them put them on the agenda and convince the ANC that we should not sing those songs and tell us why .
“ But then they should also look at songs that were sung by the forces of oppression . ”
let ’ s look at this statement
forces of oppression would most probably refer to the white government in the apartheid era and thereby extend to all whites I suppose .
now I was in an Afrikaans school and I was also in the Voortrekkers .
for those who don ’ t know , the Voortrekkers is like the boy scouts , but it celebrates the heritage of the Afrikaner nation who moved from the coastal regions inland toward what is now known as the Freestate , Gauteng , Mpumalanga and Limpopo .
Alex Matthews at Thought Leader asks , “ If killing the boers is OK , how about blacks , women and gays ? ” :
ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu has defended Julius Malema ’ s lusty renditions of the infamous “ kill the boers , they are rapists ” song , arguing ( according to this Sapa article ) that the “ the lyrics of the song had been quoted out of context ” .
“ This song was sung for many years even before Malema was born .
Julius doesn ’ t even know who ’ s the writer of the song .
he got it from us &#91; the ANC &#93; .
you must blame the ANC , don ’ t blame Julius .
but when you blame the ANC , then contextualise it , ” Sapa quotes Mthembu as saying .
by Mthembu ’ s logic , it is completely acceptable inciting people to kill others , provided there is “ context ” .
what does that mean ?
well , so as long as “ kill the blacks ” was an old apartheid song , embittered racists can chant it from the rooftops .
so long as “ kill the women ” was some sort of misogynist anthem , chauvinists can do the Macarena to it in male-only clubs .
so long as “ kill the gays ” was a major hit for bigots as they set lesbians alight , they can scream it as they throw the gays off bridges and into manholes .
consequently , Malema has apologised , which ClassicMalema.co.za covers in “ Malema Says Sorry ” :
a very rare moment for this moron to apologise for his statements .
I think the ANC came down on his ass big time .
is the road coming to an end for Ju Ju ?
Azad Essa at Thought Leader posts up a brilliant satirical piece covering the dodgy contracts Julius Malema has amassed in his very well-endowed position in government , “ Two kilo &apos;s of tenderised Malema , please ! ” :
with the country in a tizz after sizzling reactions to severe price hikes as “ tenderised Malema ” hit the newsstands , fictitious members of the ANC top-brass met at an emergency meeting on Monday to resolve the latest crisis in the party .
as news of government tenders enhancing the meagre salaries of government officials , their families , and their families ’ families , appeared to have boosted newspaper record sales over the weekend , ANC leadership came to a set of binding resolutions in a bid to root out corruption in government .
in a dramatic shift the ANC released a statement early this morning saying that it is within the right of a senior cadre not to partake in government deals .
and what does Google think of Julius Malema ?
so heres the deal .
open www.Google.com and type in “ Julius Malema is ” – wait a second or two to see the suggestions that Google will recommend .
hilarious
Definitetly , Zuma and Malema will remain a hot topic in the South African blogosphere for a long time .
Zambia : YouTube Documentary on Negative Impact of Copper Mining
a documentary on Zambian copper mining and its negative impact on society has emerged on YouTube and has so far attracted over 6,000 hits .
the clip “ Zambia : good Copper , Bad Copper ” was first reported in the blogosphere by the Zambian Economist .
Chola Mukanga , the creator of the blog , wrote :
a powerful documentary on the economic plunder of copper mining in Zambia and the associated environmental damage .
these are issues we have discussed many times on this website but it is good to see them brought together in this video .
the video was produced April 2012 .
sadly , it takes non-Zambian journalists to put a documentary like this together .
where are our investigative journalists ?
a number of netizens have reacted to the clip .
George Chisenga responded :
I really do not even know what to say but all i can say is that i feel so disgusted and i really do not know what we can do and what we shall do to make the dice fall in our favor as zambians one day
TheJosok bemoaned :
cry our beloved country .
why should we remain poor when a coveted product is plenty and mined at the expense of the locals ’ health

the least Zambians can hope for is that political leaders in the country not only get to watch the documentary but do something about it as well .
of Congo : Congolese Diaspora Erupts Against Kabila
although the community of Congolese ( DRC ) nationals based abroad was not granted the right to vote during the November 28 , 2011 , presidential and parliamentary elections , it has shown its commitment to being involved in the political debate .
using various online channels , the Congolese diaspora have organised several initiatives to raise awareness amongst fellow citizens and members of the international community .
indeed , the diaspora have succeeded in making themselves heard .
on December 7 , the ambassadors of France , the United Kingdom and Belgium in Kinshasa pressed the long-time opposition leader and candidate in the presidential election Etienne Tshisekedi to ask his partisans to stop violence in foreign capitals .
Tshisekedi came in second in the polls according to the temporary results announced by the National Independent Electoral Commission ( CENI ) .
according to Nicolas-Patience Basabose , Director of Publication of Le Congo Hebdo ( Congo Weekly ) , who is based in South Africa , the diaspora is still strongly connected to their homeland :
Congolese abroad have an important political role to play because most of them did not leave their country to discover the world , but were pushed outside the country by unfavorable social and political conditions .
expatriates have been very connected to their country , especially during the deadly &#91; President &#93; Kabila decade .
demonstrating and making some noise was probably the only way for the diaspora to make their voices count in the current electoral process .
in France , the DR of Congo Embassy in Paris was scaled by anti-Kabila protesters who said they were taking back their territory , and asserted that Tshisekedi was the real winner of the election .
the demonstrators adopted a strategy to divert the attention of French public security forces who guard the official building , and arrived hidden in a truck .
RPBIjou posted on YouTube the following images on December 5 :
violent demonstrations took place near the European Union headquarters in Brussels , Belgium ( the country that is the former colonial power in the DR of Congo ) . on December 7 , YouTube user The voice of Congo posted a video of Congolese citizens demonstrating on December 5 , in the streets of Brussels , while heading to the DR Congo embassy .
Belgian francophone news site Lesoir.be , reported that the protests turned violent and a few protesters were arrested after throwing stones at law enforcement officers and causing damage to shops and public infrastructure .
other demonstrations were organised in London , ( BBC report ) and in Italy .
the Congolese diaspora also have an important economic role to play in the future of the country .
according to an academic study , funded by the European Commission and the Belgian Ministry of Development , the 40,300 legal Congolese residents in Belgium send approximatively USD $ 130,000,000,00 to their relatives back in the DR of Congo .
it is therefore highly probable that in this country , whose GDP equals USD $ 11 billion , migrant remittances make up an important part of the national wealth .

by demonstrating in foreign capitals , Congolese of the diaspora also want to denounce certain Western powers and their mineral companies .
here is a video posted on YouTube in which a member of the Congolese diaspora in Alberta , Canada accuses Canadian companies of operating illegally in Congo :
we denounce , accuse and complain against these officials for their support and involvement in the Joseph Kabila government that the Congolese have rejected during the November 28 , 2011 elections .
they are criminals in Congo and they are also criminals in Canada and criminals according to international laws .
( … ) We have information from reliable sources about all the names of all the Canadian public figures whose companies are involved in the illicit exploitation of mines in Congo .
the day after this statement was made public , a demonstration took place in Ottawa , capital of Canada .
according to PeterPW who posted the video on YouTube , “ What started off as a peaceful protest … turned violent as protesters began hurling rocks and spraying graffiti on the Congolese embassy . ”
Johannesburg also witnessed the march of hundreds of Congolese nationals .
among them was a naked man , who shouted “ Kabila must go ” , and asked President Zuma , who allegedly supports the outgoing president , to leave Congo .
the voice of Congo posted this video :
other protests occured in Africa , particularly in Morocco .

on October 17 , 2012 , millions of people waited in line along the way from the international airport to the Royal Palace to pay respect to the King reminiscent of Sihanouk &apos;s historic return to Cambodia in November 1991 after being out of the country for 13 years .
the news of Sihanouk &apos;s death broke out during the long holiday of Pchum Ben Festival .
the mood suddenly changed in the internet as people started to send their tributes to the late King .

Khmerbird hopes to see Cambodian politicians to follow the teachings of the late King :
the King Father once said ( Source ) :
I want my country to be independent , always independent .
I have done my best , but as a human being I cannot be perfect , nobody is perfect .
I hope all Cambodian politician would follow this statement . the King Father accepted that he is not perfect but he has a clear vision to put his country independent .
Khmerbird identifies the legacy of Sihanouk :
he built a very beautiful country and made Cambodia once as the most beautiful country in Asia .
there ’ s one thing we know it is true is that he loves his country and he wants to bring happiness to his people .
the King &apos;s death inspired citizens like Koh Tha to contribute more for the progress of the country :
I watched TVs broadcasted the ceremony and historical films and documents of my late great King .
I don ’ t know why my mind feel so mixed , sad and sorrow .
my tear dropped silently .
I deeply feel that I myself as well as my country lost the great hero .
then , a very strong power come into my heart and talk my that “ Kok Tha , there is something that you need to put more effort to help and develop your country ” .
I just feel that what I have done so far is not enough and even much less than my king .
I need to continue my hard-work and my well-being to colleague , youth organizations , role models , my friends , youths , family and my love .
the National Mourning Ceremony for the King will take place until October 23 , 2012 . the public can pay their last respects by visiting the Royal Palace in the next three months .
after this period , the King &apos;s body will be cremated according to Buddhism ritual .
Japan : tell the World to Help
this post is part of our special coverage Japan Earthquake 2011 .
a simple search for pictures posted on Twitter can bring up amazing things .
search the characters “ 宮城 ” ( Miyagi ) and a handful of different pictures come up from the prefecture , one of the hardest-hit in Japan by the recent tsunami .
Scroll down , and one picture stands out , a blob of brown and blue until you click it …
picture from Kesennuma , Miyagi Prefecture , Japan , one of the areas hardest hit by the tsunami .
… to reveal a wasteland .
this is what remains of Kesennuma , a small town , once with tens of thousands of inhabitants .
read the caption , and a story emerges of a person who lived in the city .
this person sent the picture to a friend , Cherie , in Sydney , who posted the picture and email to the Internet .
the message reads :
everyone in my family somehow made it out safe .
this is the scene from our home , which is half gone .
everything in front of our home , the train station , the shopping area , has all been wiped away …
I want to show the damage to Kesennuma City via the Internet , but I cannot do anything myself .
we need help .
I want to send this message around the world , as much as possible .
I drove until I found a signal to send this e-mail .

Africa : the arrival of Seacom cable sparks debate
the arrival of an undersea cable that will increase bandwidth and lower Internet access costs throughout Africa has sparked debate and interest in the African blogoshere .
Seacom , which links South Africa , Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda and Mozambique to Europe and Asia , went live on Thursday , connecting eastern and southern Africa to the global broadband network .
Seacom connects the eastern African coastline to Europe and Asia
Johannesburg , Nairobi and Kampala received their connections on Thursday , and Addis Ababa and Kigali are expected to follow .
the cable &apos;s arrival was originally scheduled for early July , but pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia delayed operations .
the undersea link is expected to lower the cost of bandwidth by up to 90 percent and to increase access to video conferencing , high definition television and high speed Internet along the eastern African coastline .
“ Mmmh … Can &apos;t wait for the downloads to start , ” writes IT Blog Kenya .
in Uganda , Josh from In an African Minute is already noticing the difference :
the widely known technique for watching YouTube videos in Africa is to immediately pause the video when it starts , wait 20 minutes ( or much more ) until the video fully loads , and then watch .
today I ’ m at the ceremony launching SEACOM … . in the corner of a conference room , Peter Moreton , a procurement manager for SEACOM , beckoned me over to a display computer with YouTube queued up .
we launched Kung Fu baby and for the first time in Africa , I saw a YouTube video load completely and play in 6 seconds .
Munashe at TechMasai is equally thrilled :
Seacom the undersea cable we wrote about a while back is complete and has been commissioned , today .
the initiative is revolutionary for the fact that the countries which will make use of it for now , which include Kenya , Uganda , Mozambique , South Africa and Uganda .
… It is a beautiful moment for Africa , I can vouch for Kenya who until now depended on satellites for their internet needs .
Jeremy , a Nigerian blogger writing at NaijaBlog , compares Seacom to West Africa &apos;s various cable links .
West Africa comes up short :
East Africa goes broadband … while West Africa is still in the starting blocks ( actually , still in the changing room wondering what to wear ) with useless always-cut SAT3 , a phantom Glo1 ( are Alcatel &apos;s contractors stuck under a sand dune ?
) and the two new entrants , WACS and Main1 still way off beyond the horizon ( next year if we &apos;re lucky ) .
East Africa has embraced broadband and sprinted off with it while West Africa dithers and looks around .
Twitter is also abuzz with Seacom news .
some users are excited , while others are more skeptical :
“ Still absolutely amazed that you can practically download the whole of the Interwebz through one small yellow cable # seacom “
— ncallegari
“ Seacom did launch _ for real _ today .
lets see how long it takes for the ISPs to increase speeds and lower costs … ”
— dnyaga
“ is it just me or is the net in Nairobi slower today since # seacom launched ?
maybe the bandwidth is enjoying the ocean view before coming up ? ”
— mentalacrobatic
much of the Seacom skepticism surrounds the issue of pricing : though some analysts claim bandwidth costs will drop by 90 percent , others believe the actual cost cuts may be much smaller .
Kachwanya writes :
in the ideal world the cost should go down by more than 90 % , currently it cost ISPs US $ 6500 ( around KShs.487500 ) per MB of bandwidth . according to Seacom they will be charging US $ 400 ( around Kshs.30,000 ) per MB of bandwidth , but hold your breath , don ’ t expect miracles on this front .
recently UUnet CEO Tom Omariba claimed that cables will only bring down costs by 20-30 percent .
true Kenyan is concerned about transparency :
Seacom has blatantly refused to disclose to us , the consumers of the internet , which ISP ’ s have bought the bandwidth from them .
hence we are still on the dark and we do not know where we can buy the cheap and reliable internet from … . so the only alternative i am left with is to continue with my ISP staring at the machine as it loads pages at its own pace wishing that one day our dream will come true .
commenting on a post by Tanzanian blogger Issa Michuzi &#91; SW &#93; , Mdau is also worried about costs , though he has high hopes for the future :
thanks for the cable .
but when are going to roll it out in various parts of the country .
I mean if we have good inter-country connection while we do not have good connection within the country – still the cost will remain high and in my opinion we will be under utilising the capacity of the under sea cable .
for the moment , well done !
for the future , we have to work hard !
for Jellyfish , who dismisses pricing concerns by noting that such an increase in speed and quality of service would normally be accompanied by a price hike , the arrival of Seacom is a beautiful event :
in a highly publicized and coordinated event SEACOM turned on the switch which instantenously beamed Terabytes of bandwidth at the speed of light through highly polished and engineered strands of glass .
and for South African Aki Anastasiou , “ This is one small MB for my laptop , one giant TB for Africa . ”
Iran : more citizen video from protests
more than 100,000 people marched in Tehran on Monday in support of reformist presidential candidate , Mir Hussein Mousavi and his demands for an annulment of the election results that declared incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner of the election on June 12 .
the march ended in bloodshed .
at least 7 people lost their lives .
according to a report on Britain &apos;s Channel 4 television , ( aired in spite of a foreign reporting ban ) a crowd threw rocks and set fire to a building that belonged to the pro-government Basij militia .
a helmeted militiaman on the roof fired his AK-47 rifle into the air before retreating from a shower of stones .
on YouTube there is more citizen video of how this attack happened :
the morning after this shooting , the staff of Rasool Akram Hospital in Tehran demonstrated against the killings .
one demonstrator holds a placard that says : “ 8 martyrs ”
shootings or repression have not stopped the protest movement , and thousands marched again in Tehran on Tuesday .
demonstrations are growing in other cities too .
in Shiraz , protesters shown in this video burned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s photo .
10 Best African Food Blogs
MyWeku compiles a list of 10 best African food blogs for 2013 : “ There are seemingly a million food blogs out there , but only a handful showcase African food .
even so it has still been a struggle to pick 10 of our favourites for this year ( 2013 ) . ”
Mozambique : how many languages are spoken in the country ?
there are 20 languages spoken in Mozambique , according to the government website , apart from the official Portuguese .
Carlos Serra wonders if there are more , according to two renowned linguists : “ One told me that there were between 20 and 26 ; the other told me that there were 17 written and some yet to be spelled out ” .
Haiti : a life-saving video
San Francisco-based physician and blogger Dr. Jan Gurley has visited Haiti twice since the January 12 earthquake to volunteer her services .
her second visit coincided with the cholera outbreak that has claimed hundreds of lives and caused thousands more to be hospitalised since the first case appeared on October 19 , 2010 . “ Cholera is a lethal infection of hurricane proportions , ” writes Doc Gurley ( as she &apos;s known in the blogosphere ) :
you can die in as little as 3 hours , with your entire body ’ s amount of fluid coming out as stool .
socially , in Haiti , I found in February that there was already tremendous stigma attached to diarrhea .
not that surprising , really , if you think about the realities of living in a parking lot without a toilet while surrounded by hundreds of other people .
and now there are concerns that cholera may have been brought to Haiti by the very international workers who came to help . besides the devastating toll on lives ( with reports ranging from 200 to Russian reports of 500 dead from cholera ) , how much current , and potential , good-will could such an event destroy ?
Doc Gurley looked around online for an instructional video on oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) that she could leave with her Haitian colleagues and patients .
a knowledge of ORT basics could save lives , as most deaths from cholera are in fact caused by dehydration .
Doc Gurley reminds her readers that even in Haiti , video can be an effective tool for spreading information : “ People there have cell phones and texts , and everyone has an email address .
aid workers have smart phones that can show videos , and people there , just like here , love to gather ’ round and watch the tiny screen . ”
when her online searches yielded nothing but a single Hausa-language video and a handful of others covertly advertising Gatorade-style electrolyte drinks , Doc Gurley got a few friends together and made the video below .
it &apos;s mostly wordless , making it suitable for use in any country , and depicts how to make oral rehydration salts “ using only things that a person living in a sheet city would have ” , including PET water bottles and bottle caps :
4 caps sugar , 1 cap salt , 500ml clean water = life
Gabon : students Protest , Army Deployed
this post is part of our special coverage on Gabon Unrest 2011
Gabon &apos;s political crisis reached new heights on Thursday , as students protested at Omar Bongo University in the capital city , Libreville .
whereas protests last week involved mostly opposition members , the unrest appears to be developing into a wider social conflict .
currently the official government headed by President Ali Bongo , son of the late longstanding strongman Omar Bongo , stands accused of election fraud by an ‘ unofficial ’ opposition government .
former Interior Minister and opposition leader André Mba Obame , has declared himself President .
planned protests in the country have been stifled by the authorities before they can take place .
this video from YouTube user AfricaWeWish shows the protest at Omar Bongo University yesterday :
students ’ Revolt
around 2 : 00 pm CET on the 10 February , activist Jean-Pierre Rougou who is said to be close to Gabon &apos;s ‘ unofficial ’ opposition government posted on social network Twitter :
Gabon : uprising at Omar Bongo University by students who refuse to live like dogs
pictures of the 10 February demonstration were posted by Libreville resident Carel Dorian Ondo Ellassoumou on her Facebook page :

image from Carel Dorian Ondo Ellassoumou .
according to website La Voix du Peuple Gabonais ( Voice of the Gabonese People - LVDPG ) , an online newspaper managed by Gabonese living abroad , students were demonstrating because they have not received their 100 Euros ( 66,000 Central African Francs ) monthly scholarship money since July 2010 .
in addition they were protesting for the reinstatement of three professors , all members of the opposition National Union political party , who are currently ‘ refugees ’ in the Libreville United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) building with the rest of the ‘ unofficial ’ opposition government .
LVDPG reports these details about the clash between students and the authorities :
violent clashes burst out between students and the police who came to prevent them from protesting ; they &#91; the police &#93; even violated the University &apos;s charter , because they went into the campus and brutalised students within the UOB &#91; Omar Bongo University &#93; .
creators of the Facebook page Etudiants Gabonaisen Révolte ( Gabonese Students in Revolt ) , who describe themselves as “ stagnating students , lacking powerful parents at the UOB ” &#91; Omar Bongo University &#93; , posted on Thursday :
public law and order forces just entered the university and they are slaughtering us , just like in 1990 !
in 1990 , an uprising that began at the same university against late President Omar Bongo was severely repressed by the Gabonese authorities , aided by French Foreign Legion forces in what was called “ Operation Shark ” .
on the occasion of the protest this week , LVDPG shared a video report that was broadcast on French television channel Bfmtv.com in 2009 that shows the dilapidated condition of Omar Bongo University :
reactions Online
the news of the students ’ protest echoed within the Gabonese community online and reactions quickly appeared .
referring to the situation regarding the three sacked professors , Paterne Sedryk Magnaga comments on his Facebook profile :
what a pity !
in Gabon you are removed from your position when you get involved in a political party different from the one which holds the power .
this is dictatorship , not democracy .
ok L UOB , commenting on LVDPG &apos;s article on February 10 , plays down the protest :
stop your rigmarole , Gabonese students are just asking for their scholarship , nothing more , what popular uprising ?

ongoing Arrests
on Koaci , an African news website , a blogger reports the arrest of another National Union leader in Bitam , North Gabon :
we have just learned of the arrest in Bitam ( North Gabon ) of M. Bruno Nze Mezui
LVDPG reports that opposition neighborhoods of Libreville are surrounded by the authorities :
“ We are not here to terrorise our population , but rather to ensure their safety against young people who are committing crimes in those areas ” , declared a police spokesperson .
the following video shows the deployment of military forces in Nkembo and Rio , areas of Libreville , posted to Youtube on February 10 by user AfricaWeWish :
French Opposition Lend Their Voices
in a blog post entitled “ Hear the African Youth ” , Pascal Michelangeli , deputy mayor of Epinay-Sous-Seinart , a city near Paris , contrasts French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s position on the Tunisian crisis with the one he appears to have taken on Gabon &apos;s political turmoil .
he shares a link to an article on news website Gabonews.ga that says Sarkozy sent his regards to Ali Bongo on the occasion of his birthday on 9 February :
in the context of this explosive political situation , Nicolas Sarkozy sent his birthday wishes to the Gabonese President , ending his letter with a distinguished and laconic … “ your friend ” .

Egypt : Naga Hammady Massacre
respect Religions by Sarah Carr
Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7 .
on the eve of their celebrations in Egypt , Copts go to churches and celebrate the holy event .
but this year an unexpected incident happened in Naga Hammady , in Upper Egypt , where an unknown criminal opened his fire randomly on people there after they finished their prayers and were on their way back to their homes .
Zeinobia wrote a new post about the massacre in her blog saying :
I am really very sorry and angry for what happened in Naj Hammadi yesterday .
it hurts me more than the Egyptian Christians because what happened is against all Egyptians .
my condolences to the families of those who were killed and injured in this disgusting attack .
another blog , Coptic File , wrote about the incident :
a shooting gun was used from inside a car ( green Fiat ) , to randomly kill eight people and many others were wounded .
they all were from those who attended the prayers that took place in the church on the Christmas eve .
on Misr Digital , Wael Abbas also published a video of Naga Hammay shootout on his blog .
the ministry of interior says that this attack is related to an older incident when a 12-year-old Muslim girl was raped by a Christian man in the same city .
but Zeinobia can &apos;t see how such incident can be accepted as an excuse for the shooting .
she also blames the ministry of interior for the whole thing :
and with my all respect this is ridiculous , fighting a crime by a group of crimes .
I blame the ministry of interior in all of this , if there is a real respect and fear of the law nothing of this could happen .
also , Nawara shares echoes similar sentiments .
on the Ministry of Interior &apos;s press release regarding the shooting , she says :
the strangest release I &apos;ve ever read in my entire life , I &apos;ve never seen a press release blaming the victims and encouraging mass punishment .
Nawara also blamed the Egyptian Media :
the inactive Egyptian media is ignoring the incident , as if the ones who were killed yesterday are sheep .
the Cat of the Desert blamed the society and the extremists for all this .
seven young Christian children were killed , and many others were wounded .
they stole their Christmas celebrations and happiness , and killed them with their bullets .
and they are still crying on the the martyr of the sea-saw , and they called her the martyr of the hijab .
what are you waiting for after all this ignorance , and retardation ?
what are you expecting the others to think of us after this ?
God damn those who call for considering the others infidels , and on top of the the Al Quaradawy , El Huwainy , and Hassaaan .
he then posted a video of Abu Is-haq El Huwainy warning people form the Christians and the evil plots they make against Egypt !
the Egyptian blogger , Te3ma , on the other hand , believes that some foreign entities stand behind such incidents :
I &apos;m so sure that the ones behind this massacre are from outside , and not from here .
Arab World : congratulations Tunisia !
this post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Revolution 2011 .
human rights activist Moncef Marzouki , 66 , has been elected as Tunisia &apos;s new interim president today .
the opposition figure , who has been imprisoned and exiled under the regime of former President Zeine El Abidine Ben Ali , will stay in power until the new constitution of the country is drafted , and legislative and presidential elections are held .
his appointment drew reactions from Tunisian netizens , who were divided between critics and supporters .
elsewhere in the Arab world , Marzouki &apos;s appointment , which was followed by a moving acceptance speech , was noted by netizens , who cheered on Tunisia &apos;s progress towards democracy , wishing the same for their countries .
inaugural address of Mr. Marzouki , the new president of the Republic of Tunisia .
Tunisia was the launching pad of an Arab revolution which started in the town of Sidi Bouzid when unemployed Mohammed Bouazizi set himself ablaze on December 17 .
since that day , millions of Arabs across the region took to the streets of their cities , towns and villages , calling for democracy , equality , human rights and political , economic and legislative reforms .
here is a snap shot of reactions from Arab netizens from Twitter .
Yemeni Noon Arabia dreams :
@ NoonArabia : I wish one day in Yemen we get to feel proud of the person who “ we ” choose to be our leader , as the Tunisians are today .
# Yemen # Tunisia
fellow Yemeni Abubakr Al Shamahi provides a link to Marzouki &apos;s speech at the Tunisian parliament and shares another dream :
@ abubakrabdullah : amazing – Marzouki &apos;s speech at the Tunisian parliament today – I hope to see something similar in Yemen one day ..
during his swearing in ceremony , Marzouki cried when he mentioned the martyrs during Tunisia &apos;s revolution .
journalist Andrew Hammond reports :
@ Hammonda1 : # Tunisia president Marzouki chokes up at mention of the revolution &apos;s martyrs ; cites ongoing struggle of Palestinians , Syrians and Yemenis .
on this , Egyptian Menna Alaa comments :
@ TheMiinz : Egypt is not Tunisia because you will never see any one of our officials shedding tears over the martyrs .
and you will never see the Parliament rise up and chant : “ If the people wanted to live , destiny would have to respond . ”
the chant is part of the Tunisian national anthem .
a translation of the full anthem is available here .
Egyptocracy agrees :
@ Egyptocracy : amazing speech by Al Monsef Al # Marzouki .
congratulations # Tunisia .
you give us hope .
and Egyptian Abdelrahman Ayyash laments :
@ 3yyash : Tunisia made a revolution , they are the genuine and we are the copy .. Ours sucks !

Venezuela : Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s Visit Raises Controversy
Iran &apos;s President , Mahmud Ahmadinejad , arrived in Venezuela on Sunday January 8 , 2012 , in his first stop in a tour that will continue to Nicaragua , Cuba and Ecuador .
his visit has sparked strong reactions on social networks , where users are questioning whether his presence might be of some benefit for the nation .
on Twitter , some criticize Ahmadinejad &apos;s presence and the welcoming he received by the Venezuelan government .
Luis Carlos Díaz ( @ LuisCarlos ) writes :
its non-pronouncement about Ahmadineyad &apos;s visit says a lot about the Women &apos;s Ministry . Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , image by Flick user Parmida Rahimi ( CC BY 2.0 )
blogger Carlos Bauza ( @ CarlosBauza ) suggests that Ahmadinejad &apos;s visit might have influence over the upcoming Venezuelan presidential elections , while Garcilaso Pumar ( @ garcilasop ) tweets :
Mahmud Ahmadinejad is a retrograde tyrant , murderer and misogynist .
Chávez is a fool who is excited about being all that .
others are using the hashtag # FueraAhmadinejadDeVzla to demand Iran &apos;s President leave the country .
user @ PericoRipeado24 , for example , criticizes Ahmadinejad &apos;s sense of justice :
# OutAhmadinejadfromVzla Because your justice is done by hanging , when your people only steal to eat .
meanwhile , netizens who support President Chávez tweeted welcoming Ahmadinejad :
Ahmadinejad &apos;s courage to visit Venezuela , Cuba , Nicaragua and Ecuador deserves recognition , yesterday &#91; these countries were &#93; the “ backyard ” of USA , today &#91; they are &#93; sovereign countries .
welcome Mahmud Ahmadinejad President of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Leader of the Iranian Revolution .
Venezuelans Revolutionaries salute you .
comrade Mahmud Ahmadinejad welcome to the land of Bolivar , free country , sovereign and socialist … Let the squalid &#91; opposition &#93; shriek !
this is Ahmadinejad &apos;s fifth visit to Caracas .
after joking about “ big atomic bombs “ , his visit ended on Monday January 9 , with the signing of a series of bilateral agreements , including a Memorandum of Understanding of technological cooperation for training in nanoscience and nanotechnology and the exchange of teachers in this field .
Singapore : Minister &apos;s Comments Spark Internet Meme
with the following statement , Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Environment and Water Resources Grace Fu sparked off an online controversy amongst Singaporeans :
when I made the decision to join politics in 2006 , pay was not a key factor .
loss of privacy , public scrutiny on myself and my family and loss of personal time were .
the disruption to my career was also an important consideration .
I had some ground to believe that my family would not suffer a drastic change in the standard of living even though I experienced a drop in my income .
so it is with this recent pay cut .
if the balance is tilted further in the future , it will make it harder for any one considering political office .
Minister Grace Fu .
image from Wikipedia .
following the recent announcement of paycuts for ministers – which many Singaporeans feel are still not enough – Ms Fu &apos;s comments angered many who felt that those who go into public service should not do so in the expectation of huge public rewards .
Ms Fu has since come out to say that her statement had been misunderstood , something which I have observed to happen to the ruling People &apos;s Action Party members very often :
teenagers , goths and emos should just step aside .
people ’ s Action Party ( PAP ) members are by far the most misunderstood group of people in the world .
it appears as if they can ’ t say or do a thing without being misunderstood .
if they went to a MacDonald ’ s to buy a Big Mac with extra lettuce and no pickles they ’ d probably get Fillet o ’ Fish .
Ms Fu &apos;s clarification of her statement hasn &apos;t been successful in placating irked Singaporeans , as many have observed that she is still extremely well-paid compared to the average Singaporean .
Mollymeek writes sarcastically about how Ms Fu could have been misunderstood :
because of our inability to imagine the standard of living that would be compromised by a million-dollar salary , it is easy for us to think that she is materialistic .
it is our fault .
she is not materialistic .
she is not demanding a higher pay .
it is just that her standard of living is so inconceivably high that she may face difficulties making ends meet if she were to be paid the average salary of a minister in the developed world .
Ms Fu &apos;s comment soon turned into an Internet meme , with people posting their own versions .
Lee Kin Mun writes about his choice to become Singapore &apos;s “ blogfather ” mrbrown :
when I made the decision to be mrbrown in 1997 , pay was not a key factor .
kena lim kopi by ISD , kena sue until tng kor by ministers and having my newspaper column suspended were .
the disruption to my computer gaming time was also an important consideration .
I had some ground to believe that my family would not suffer a drastic change in the standard of living but we did have to sell the car and now I ride a bicycle .
I fear if the balance is tilted further in the future , I will fall off my bicycle .
Joshua Chiang on his decision to join socio-political website The Online Citizen :
when I made the decision to join TOC in 2009 , pay was not a key factor ( since it was non-existent ) .
loss of freedom vis-a-vis ISA , character assassination by the mainstream press on myself and my family and loss of my entire fortunes via defamation suits was .
the disruption to my sanity was also an important consideration .
I had some ground to believe that my family would have more room space at home if I were ever jailed .
especially when TOC was gazetted .
if the balance is tilted further in the future , it will make it harder for any one considering citizen journalism / activism .
even Danny the Democracy Bear , mascot of alternative political party the Singapore Democratic Party , weighed in :
when I made the decision to join the SDP , pay was not a key factor .
loss of privacy , public scrutiny on myself and my loss of personal time were .
that fact that I might be the party &apos;s mascot because I &apos;m the only bear there was an important consideration .
I had solid ground to believe that my family would not suffer a drastic change in the standard of living even though the PAP always likes to sue SDP members .
if the balance is tilted further and animals are prohibited to join political parties in the future , it will be harder for my fellow bears to support , let alone join the SDP .
the Tumblr blog ‘ When I made the decision … ‘ has now been set up to share these variations on Ms Fu &apos;s comment .
Morocco : Christian Aid Workers Expelled
saying goodbye to some of the orphans ( photo from the Village of Hope official website )
last week , 20 staff members of the Village of Hope , a small orphanage in a small town in rural Morocco , were deported from the country without warning , under charges of proselytizing .
the Village has quietly existed for the past ten years , and is staffed mostly by Christians from Western countries .
staff members claim they have always been transparent about their Christian identities to Moroccan authorities , without incident .
for many of the children , the orphanage is the only home they have ever known .
the Village of Hope &apos;s official Web site hosts a statement , endorsed by all of the staff members who were asked to leave the country , which reads :
on Monday 8th March , all 16 overseas workers , including 10 parents , and 13 natural-born dependents , were told they were to be evicted from the site and country .
the reason given was that the parents had been proselytizing , with no explanation of who , when , where or how this was alleged to have occurred .
no charges concerning the welfare and care of the children have ever been raised as a concern by the Moroccan authorities in the 10 year history of VOH .
the Moroccan authorities have not produced any evidence of the alleged offence and they gave only a few hours for the parents to pack up belongings and explain to their children that they might never see them again .
few media outlets have picked up on the story ( the official Moroccan news agency &#91; FR &#93; is one ) , but a number of bloggers with personal connections to the Village have begun to spread word about the incident , some with hopes of returning the staff to Morocco .
blogger Elizabeth Shelby , a Christian worker who volunteered at the orphanage in the past , is calling for prayer from her community , but also is hoping to find explanation from the government as to why the sudden change of heart occurred .
she writes :
it has been over 24 hours since 20 workers ( most , parents ) at the Village of Hope were taken from their children , unexpectedly by Moroccan officials .
they were given thirty minutes to pack their belongings and leave the country , with no guarantee of ever seeing their Moroccan children again .
the Village of Hope has been in compliance and worked with the Moroccan government for 10 years , and have had very few problems .
as of January 4th , Morocco has a new Minister of Justice ( ironic ) Mohammad Naciri , one who feels he must exercise his power in order to shut down the Village of Hope because he believes “ Christians are proselytizing . ”
Shelby is also leading a campaign on Twitter , using the hashtag # MoroccoOrphans and has started a Facebook group .
the Moroccan Dispatches has written a thoughtful piece exploring the various aspects of the government &apos;s decision , as well as the operations of the orphanage .
in respect to both , the blogger writes :
as I mentioned , it &apos;s hard to know what really is permissible and what is not in Morocco since a rule on the books does not necessarily mean anything .
so perhaps , the Moroccan authorities turned a blind eye for the past few decades just as they do with alcohol , hashish , prostitution , and speeding .
or perhaps The Village of Hope hid some of their activities .
I do not know .
an American blogger in Morocco writes in with support for the Village :
&#91; the Village &apos;s staff &#93; honestly thought they were complying with regulations , but were interrogated and deported with almost no time to pack or to say goodbye to the children .
orphans have a particularly hard lot in Islamic countries , where , even if adopted , they don &apos;t have the same rights as biological children , and even the Muslim Moroccans who worked with these kids got kicked off the premises , so there is not a single familiar face taking care of them right now .
please be in prayer for the children , for those who were deported , and for those who may still be deported .
its a rough situation , especially since Morocco has been considered a moderate nation which encourages peaceful relations between peoples of different faiths .
keep the people of this beautiful country in your prayers .

the government of Sril Lanka announced via state media and SMS today ( Monday , May 18 , 2009 ) afternoon that the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , Vellupillai Prabhakaran , is dead .
news media are reporting that Prabhakaran , who was at the helm of one of the world &apos;s most violent rebellions , was killed by rocket grenade while in a van with the head of the LTTE &apos;s navy , Soosai , and the LTTE intelligence chief , Pottu Amman .
the body of the rebel leader will undergo DNA tests to confirm identity .
about 250 members of the Tamil Tigers were reportedly killed in the final surge of fighting in the country &apos;s 26-year-old war .
Obituaries of Prabhakaran note that he was a hero to some and a ruthless killer to others .
the BBC writes , “ To his followers , Vellupillai Prabhakaran was a freedom fighter struggling for Tamil emancipation .
this cover story on Tehelka magazine reveals a lot about this war lord .
the Blogger of Beyond Skin explains it this way :
first reaction : WHAAA !
&#91; goosebumps and jaw-drop and an overwhelmingly contradictory feeling of both dread and relief .
second reaction : now what ?
after 26 years of fighting , after displacing and killing hundreds of thousands , after silencing those who dissent against both the government and the LTTE through assassinations , torture and disappearance , what now of the Tamil people ?
United National Party organizer Ajith P. Perera wrote in his own obituary for Prabhakaran in his blog , Dare to be different : “ He was a terrorist , no doubt , but Prabhakaran deserves an obituary , even in a language he barely understood , ” Perera wrote .
did he achieve anything worthwhile for his community ?
the answer is a big NO .
ethnic ( Jaffna ) Tamils are worse off than they were in 1970s .
more than half of the Tamil population has already left for good .
ethnic Tamils , the largest minority in Sri Lanka then , has now reduced to the pathetic third place after Muslims and Indian Tamils .
Jaffna , the second most advanced city in Sri Lanka , with its famous education system , is now far behind .
as a community Tamils , at least the unfortunate ones to still remain , have moved ten or twenty years backward .
they were termed as terrorists across the world .
North and East have become more and more economically dependent on Colombo .
at least for the next few years , till a UNP government implements a political solution , they will be remotely controlled from Colombo .
all thanks to Prabhakaran .
Sri Lankan Tamil activist and former LTTE member Nirmala Rajasingam explains in an opinion piece in The Independent that her sister was murdered by the LTTE 20 years ago .
for that reason , the news of the demise of the LTTE &apos;s top leadership – which ordered her killing and the killings of many other Tamil dissenters – brings overwhelming relief .
the war and carnage has at last stopped and the insistent bloodletting of Tamil dissent is now over .
but she cautions :
the continued refusal of full access to humanitarian agencies does not allay suspicions about the government &apos;s intentions toward the refugees and the LTTE cadres who have surrendered .
the last three years have seen a large number of abductions , extrajudicial killings and disappearances , almost exclusively targeting the Tamil community as the government of Sri Lanka relentlessly pursued its military campaign .
the militarisation of state and society has been able to suppress dissent in the south , even mounting attacks on journalists .
we wait to see whether the government will reverse this downward spiral in democratic governance .
blogger and columnist Indi Samarajiva used Twitter to discuss the death of Prabhakaran while he was traveling .
he posted messages to his Twitter page on Monday afternoon :
is in Hambantota .
fire crackers .
seems Prabhakaran is dead .
no glory in death , but , well , good .
may Sri Lanka rebuild # fb
they &apos;re lighting firecrackers literally meters from the gas cylinder depot .
the fishmongers are yelling to get back to work .
Hambantota town is mostly Muslim , back to business .
flag convoys thru Ambalantota .
war &apos;s over , Prabha &apos;s dead .
long live Sri Lanka # fb
Prahalathan KK , a blogger in Chennai , India , says that rejoicing in Prabhakaran &apos;s death is a diservice to the civilians killed in order to make the LTTE &apos;s defeat possible .
“ So Prabhakaran the Terrorist has been killed .
happy ?
rejoicing ?
ever thought of the thousands of innocent Tamils who were slaughtered by the indiscriminate use of artillery and chemical weapons by the Sri Lankan army during the Genocidal war ? ”
according to the Ministry of Defence website , the almost 150,000 civilians who have fled the war zone in less than a month are being cared for by the army .
but The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , the only independent organization that has had access to civilians in the conflict zone , called the situation “ nothing short of catastrophic . ” Today , they in a news release that the they have not had access to civilians in the north-east for nine days .
“ This is all the more urgent since no humanitarian aid has reached those who need it for over a week , ” said director of operations , Pierre Krähenbühl .
Selvarasa Pathmanathan , head of the LTTE ’ s International Diplomatic Relations , released a statement on Sunday announcing that the Tigers will “ silence our guns to save our people . ” He said that 3,000 civilians have died and 25,000 are injured .
prominent South Asian diaspora blog Sepia Mutiny reports on continuing protests in Canada .
in a post about a gathering in Winnipeg . Melvin writes :
they held candles , signs , black flags and pictures of children whom they see as victims of the Sri Lankan government ’ s assault on civilians .
while people in Colombo and elsewhere celebrated the apparent end of the 25-year civil war , those at the vigil mourned the deaths of innocent people and wondered what , if anything , had been solved .
“ It doesn ’ t solve anything , ” Singarajah said .
“ People ’ s grievances aren ’ t going to be over .
this government is so ruthless .
they don ’ t want to give us our rights .
as long as that is the case , the problems will go on . ”
protests have been ongoing in London , many parts of Canada and more recently in Australia .
but activist Rajasingam cautioned in Foreign Policy magazine that the Tamil diaspora has taken a misguided approach to its message :
as Sri Lanka &apos;s humanitarian crisis unfolds , the international community must make its message clear and forthright .
the Tigers and the diaspora that supports them have no claim as the “ sole representation ” of the Tamil people .
nor is secession a reasonable option .
anything more superficial than this firm engagement will play into the hands of the LTTE lobby in the West — and inflame Sinhala nationalists in Sri Lanka .
only this firm message will serve the cause of peace and democracy .

blogger Nalaka Gunawardene says that he wants to believe that the war is truly over :
sure , there is no independent verification – it has been a war without witnesses for the last few years .
but I am willing to take an unusual leap of faith if that ’ s what it takes to usher in the long-elusive peace .
I will go to the ends of the earth , and suspend disbelief if I have to , in return for lasting and meaningful peace .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa is scheduled to address Parliament and the nation on Tuesday morning .
Levant : bloggers start warming up for World Cup 2010
the World Cup will kick off in about three weeks and bloggers across the Levant have already been busy using their keyboards and camera shutters trying to capture the hysteria that engulfs the world once every four years .
Syrian and Lebanese national teams have never qualified to the World Cup finals , yet that does not stop people from being hardcore fans and showing their admiration to their favorite teams in any way possible .
while Lebanese blogger Rami from the + 961 blog was content with certain aspects of the football fever , he was not impressed by some of what his compatriots are doing .
he says :
people are getting those mini flags for their cars and balconies , it might seem silly but it ’ s cool as long as it makes people deviate a bit from the political discussions .
still , it really is pathetic when you get a flag that is more than 1 meter in width or length !
I ’ m pretty sure you could have put that spent money for a better use !

from Syria , Nasdaq on the other hand was occupied with analyzing the different reasons people get behind a certain team , highlighting religion as a factor &#91; ar &#93; :
every once in a while we hear that a player became a Muslim thus making him a star in the Islamic world , where people start cheering for him and his team in droves and carrying his pictures , etc .
only because he became a Muslim and only for that .
and he goes on to comment on the “ resourcefulness ” of the Syrian youth who can &apos;t afford to pay for premium channels so they decode them and watch the games for free instead :
of course no one doubts the abilities of Syrian youth to overcome all the hurdles that are in the way , apart from governmental ones , to achieving their goals .
ever since ART channels were in full swing some guys were able to decode their cards and by the time Al Jazeera Sport was launched we had an army of decoding experts who did not study it in universities nor learn about it in books , and perhaps they &apos;re more capable than engineers in deciphering codes and watching premium sports channels for free .
Lolitto comments by saying that she &apos;s cheering for the Italian team and the reply comes swiftly from Nasdaq :
you &apos;re a girl , so it &apos;s only normal that you &apos;re cheering for Italy .
when my nana ( grandmother ) was young , she also cheered for the Italian team and they were even more handsome than they are now according to her .
and Independence &apos; 05 blog , from Lebanon , publishes more photos of the “ flag industry ” that flourishes due to World Cup :
flags for sale in Beirut – Courtesy of Independence &apos; 05

and like the others , she dwells a little on the reasons of the somewhat excessive expressions of excitement for world cup , but reaches the same conclusion :
Tunisia elections : fairness and Impartiality ! !
as predicted , president Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali won the Tunisian elections for a fifth term .
what wasn &apos;t expected was that he would win with 89.62 per cent of the over all votes .
the prediction was that he would garner more votes .
Ben Ali &apos;s ruling party , the Democratic Constitutional Rally , also fared as well .
it won 161 of the 214 parliament seats .
the remaining 53 seats were won by six different parties : movement for Democratic Socialists , 16 seats ; Party of People &apos;s Unity , led by Mohamed Bouchiha , 12 seats ; Ahmed Inoubli &apos;s Union of Democratic Unionists , 9 seats ; Social Liberal Party , 8 seats ; Party of Greens for Progress , 6 seats and Ahmed Brahim ’ s Ettajdid Party , 2 seats .
the ruling party announced the fairness and the impartiality of the 2009 elections .
but opposition leaders and bloggers have another opinion : they think that repressive acts and stifling controls on the election process have characterized the 2009 presidential and legislative elections in Tunisia on October 25 , 2009 .
Arabasta ironically remarks :
congratulations for what you did !
my thanks go first to Tunisian citizens who accomplished their electoral duties within the framework of democracy and transparency yesterday .
they elected a new president for the country and a new parliament for another five years .
this choice was wise and well thought of .
no one has tried to influence the people and even the television channels and written media were neutral and guaranteed equal space for all the candidates and their supporters regardless of their relationship with the government .
my thanks go also to the president ( for five more years ) and I apologize for not supporting and not voting for him .
I condemn this shameful behavior even though I recall the fact t that I have never questioned the neutrality and impartiality of the elections .
as it is known that in case of fraud in the elections the results would be 98.99 % .
but an impartial observer knows that the 2009 results are not so different from those of 2002 in France when Chirac won the elections .
this is why we can say that the elections elevated us to the rank of the developed and great nations .
Nakhlet Wed El Bey ( The palm tree of the Bey &apos;s river ) wrote in Tunisian dialect :
I am not questioning the impartiality and fairness of the charade that was the Tunisian elections .
but what if we were more flexible
and took the muzzles off the real opposition mouth
thus the president would win with 77.7 %
and we would remove the hypocrisy and schizophrenia from the citizens hearts
some Thoughts from Tunisia , on his part , described what happened to him when he went to vote in the last hours of the day :
as I said , my companion went ahead of me to the polling booth .
when I entered the room , I saw those present confused and some people winking at each other and pretending as if nothing had happened ( They did not realise that we were together ) .
I soon understood everything : when the man was still in his house , they voted and signed instead of him .
then they said to him : “ Nothing has happened You can choose your candidates but you do not have to sign .
( the whole paper was signed and there is no room for another signature ) .
all this happened while I was standing there .
my companion went to vote and I heard them whispering :
the “ Omda ” ( a community chief ) voted instead of him .
India : equality
“ About 15 percent population consisting of political leaders and government servants have , through their corrupt practices , amassed 85 percent of the total wealth of India , leaving only 15 percent of it to the balanced 85 percent population of the country , ” comments Ram Bansal at India in Peril .

Russia : officer Exposes Police Corruption Using the Web
on November 6 , a police officer at the Department of Internal Affairs in Novorossiysk used his personal Web site to address Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and talk about numerous problems police officers face in Russia .
in his video address available on www.dymovskiy.ru and YouTube ( part I and part II &#91; RUS &#93; ) , Aleksey Dymovskiy is calm and meticulous .
he talks about diminishing police honor , bribes , corruption and low pay that poison lives of many police officers in Russia .
I think many people will understand me .
I want to work but I am fed up with fictional plans when we are forced to investigate crimes that don ’ t exist .
I am fed up with fictional plans when we are told that we need to imprison certain people .
I am fed up with staged crimes designed to put some people in jail .
continuing with his revelations , Dymovskiy admits putting an innocent person in jail under the pressure from his supervisor :
the director of the Department of Internal Affairs awarded me rank of a major , which I received in May , because I promised him to put an innocent person in jail .
I ’ m not afraid to say that .
I understand that it can be punishable .
but it is the truth and I admit that .
Dymovsky also appeals to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin urging him to investigate those problems and put an end to the widespread corruption in the police .
the video hit a “ viral ” stage within hours after its publication with several hundreds of thousands of clicks on YouTube .
it was widely covered by the Russian mainstream media and discussed on the countless blogs .
it is one of the first examples when Russian citizens successfully deploy new media platform to draw attention of the government toward hot issues in the country .
the novelty of “ citizen video addresses ” in Russia is best indicated by a cautious comment from one of the most popular bloggers in the country dolboeb :
a monologue with enormous force .
I won ’ t be surprised if it turns out to be a viral marketing .
the character is too out-of-this-word .
another blogger marchenk writes :
none of us is an angel … I wouldn &apos;t admire him &#91; Dymovskiy &#93; as an honest policeman and the lover of the truth ( he admits himself that he received the rank of major for putting an innocent person in jail ) .
&#91; ... &#93; However , sincere respect for bravery .
there are honest police officers after all .
because of them , it makes sense to push forward police reforms .
I hope to God his publicity gives him protection and honest consideration of his situation .
on Sunday , November 8 , Rashid Nurgaliev , the Russian minister of internal affairs , announced the audit of police forces in Novorossiysk .
meanwhile , Dymovskiy has been fired “ for libel and actions that damage the honor ” of the police .
in his interview to Russian radio station “ Ekho Moskvy , ” Dymovskiy said he had been followed and was considering sending his family to Moscow for security reasons .
Angola : elections in pictures

there are in total 220 parliamentary seats .
is Tanzania &apos;s Peaceful Reputation in Danger ?
Tanzania has experienced several crises since October 2010 general elections , including some which have resulted in violence and death .
blogger Dunia Duara made a ( not complete ) list of events fuelled by different kinds of crises or conflicts , which recently have caused serious problems in Tanzania :
2011 January : Chadema &#91; main opposition party &#93; lead demonstration in Arusha conflicts with police .
2011 February : explosions in Gongo La Mboto
2011 July : &#91; street vendors &#93; clash with police in Mwanza
2011 September : MV Spicelander sinks between Zanzibar and Pemba
2011 December : Dar es Salaam floods
2012 February : police killings in Songea
2012 April : land issues and bi-elections in Arumeru
2012 May : riots in Zanzibar related to UAMSHO &#91; separatist group in Zanzibar &#93;
2012 June : doctors ’ strike ( back in February and onwards ) and the abduction of Dr Ulimboka .
2012 July : a ferry on its way from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar sinks .
2012 July : riots in Zanzibar related to UAMSHO , and mourning of the dead from the ferry accident .
police brutality in Tanzania .
photo source : wavuti.com , used with permission .
most recently , on September 2 , 2012 , Tanzanian journalist Daudi Mwangosi was killed by a tear gas canister in Nyololo Village in Mufindi South ( Iringa Region ) in Southern Tanzania .
the Citizen was amongst the first of the Tanzanian dailies to report about the incident , describing how police used tear gas to disperse a group of CHADEMA ( opposition party ) supporters :
Mr Mwangosi becomes the second person to be killed in conflicts pitting the Police Force and the opposition party in the space of two weeks .
on August 27 , one Ally Zona was killed in Morogoro as police dispersed Chadema supporters who were gearing up for a demonstrations .
pictures of the incident in Nyololo Village quickly circulated on social media sites .
the blog Wawuti.com has collected a comprehensive selection ( see also photo above ) .
&#91; please , be warned that some of the photos are very graphic , depicting the remains of the deceased journalist whose body was blown to pieces by the tear gas canister .
the incident has been covered intensively and many different newspapers , in Kiswahili and English as well as international , have commented extensively .
social media users have expressed anger and shock over what appears to be a senseless and very violent killing .
people have expressed shock about both the killing and the police brutality .
Daraja blog was quick to produce a factual list of ‘ key sources ’ , including links to Tanzania &apos;s Media Council &apos;s statement and the World Association of Press Council &apos;s statement , but Daraja also did a thorough analysis – stating in the headline that “ a line has been crossed ” .
first , an overview of what happened :
they tell us that Mwangosi was in Nyololo together with several other journalists to report on Chadema opening an office in the village , in defiance of police orders against political activities during the census period .
there was a heavy police presence in the village .
another journalist , Godfrey Mushi of Nipashe , was apprehended by the police , and Mwangosi went to find out why .
a group of police officers then turned on Mwangosi , beating him badly for several minutes .
the reports tell us that Regional Police Commander , Michael Kamuhanda , was nearby in a stationary vehicle , and was informed that the man the police were beating was a journalist .
however , he took no steps to stop this , and a few minutes later a tear gas cannister was shot into Mwangosi &apos;s stomach from point blank range .
Mwangosi died instantly , and a police officer was injured .
journalists demonstrate in Dar es Salaam on September 10 against the police violence which caused Daudi Mwangosi &apos;s death .

Daraja continues :
there is no suggestion that Daud was doing anything improper .
he was there as a journalist , with a legitimate right to be there and to report on Chadema &apos;s activities and the police &apos;s response .
he was not there as a Chadema supporter at a rally , so he was not even breaching the police ban on political activities during the census period .
( though even if a Chadema activist who had been killed in this way , the police &apos;s actions would still have been disproportionate and wrong .
Daraja raises serious questions :
will the responsible police be held to account for this ?
and what will be the effect on the media ?
the answers are far from given .
Tanzanian media professionals have expressed their sympathy with their former colleague when they demonstrated in Dar es Salaam on September 10 , against the most recent police violence .
Tanzania &apos;s reputation as a peaceful country is indeed becoming increasingly questionable with these recent events .
China : forced Demolition
a recent case of forced demolition has raised attention to the protection of citizens ’ rights and fair conflict resolution in China .
on 13 November this year , the forcible demolition of a private building , ordered by the Chengdu local government , led to the suicide of one of its owners , Tang Fuzhen , who poured gasoline and set fire on herself .
the house stands in the way of a district government ’ s project to link two roads .
Comparisons were made with a case that happened last year , where a woman in the Minhang district of Shanghai threw self-made petrol bombs at a demolition crew preparing to destroy her house , which is the site of a transportation hub for the 2010 Shanghai Expo .
site of former home of Tang Fuzhen
cases like these are known as ‘ nail houses ’ , referring to homeowners who refuse to move from demolition zones , usually because of disagreement with the compensation offered .
the most famous one was the Chongqing nail house case in 2007 , when a Chinese couple reached negotiated agreement with the developer after 3 years of standoff .
in a recent blog post , well-known blogger Wuyuesanren ( 五岳散人 ) compared the peaceful resolution of the Chongqing nail house case with the violent incidents last month :
wonder if anyone still remembers the ‘ toughest nail house ’ .
in that incident , though the demolisher and the demolished were in some kind of opposition , both sides still played by the rules .
there were smiles and no real harm .
but judging from recent incidents , it seems that the patience of both sides had worn thin .
the oppositions and the results were violent .
a while ago , an internal speech of an official was exposed .
the official mentioned that forced demolition is an appropriate action , and even stressed that it has to ‘ create a situation of siege and massive pressure ’ to the oppressed .
these examples show that conflicts between interested parties have reached a level that violent means are necessary .
the stronger side , enjoying the favourable conditions , has no patience and sincerity to engage in negotiations .
the other side , with much more to lose , could only resort to more violent methods in response .
first they would petition , but now they are beginning to hurt themselves to attract more attention .
in an interview with the International Herald Leader , a Chinese official newspaper , he commented that China ’ s cases of forced demolition went through three stages :
at the beginning , the flow of pressure is one-way , from the oppressor to the oppressed .
the mass media is not yet involved at this stage .
in the second stage , the oppressed resort to petition and judicial means .
in the third stage , they would hurt themselves as well as the oppressors .
sometimes , there might be collective confrontation or even self-immolation .
one blogger , Yao Hongen ( 姚鸿恩 ) , talked about a nail house case in the US in his blog to contrast with those in China .
in 2006 , Edith Macefield turned down a US $ 1 million offer to sell her house to make way for a commercial development in Ballard , Seattle .
after Macefield ’ s death , it was revealed that the house was willed to the new construction project ’ s superintendent , Barry Martin , for the friendship and care he has shown to the old lady during the construction .
home of Edith Macefield
Yao Hongen said :
the old lady did not employ a lawyer ; she did not petition ; she did not go to Washington to protest ; and , needless to say , she did not make petrol bombs or set fire on herself .
all she did was to say ‘ No ’ to the developer .
among the comments that the post attracted :
Chinese citizens are the vulnerable .
the state can demolish whenever they like , and would not care if you had no place to live later !
our government used banners like post-disaster construction to forcibly take away lands .
but we do have the land and property certificates !
it ’ s a joke .
in China , the state is the most powerful and the most ruthless .
those standing in the way will be killed !
guess I would not see such kind of things happening in China in my lifetime .
Madagascar : living abroad changes a man
in an article published in March , economists William Easterly and Yaw Nyarko noted that in Sub-Saharan Africa , remittances ( money sent by immigrants abroad back to their home countries ) on average amounted to 81 percent of the foreign aid received by an individual country .
the role of the diaspora in the development of Madagascar has been discussed previously in the Malagasy blogosphere .
bloggers recently discussed the impact of living abroad on the behavior of Malagasies and how it alters their relationships with their friends and relatives back home .
news2dago narrates how a close friendship with an old friend from school slowly vanished because that friend left for France :
I had a good friend throughout high school .
he was my benchmate .
I last saw in 1992 after we both received the baccalaureat ( high school diploma ) , my friend got lucky and pursued his college studies in France .
I chose to stay back home , a personal decision , no one to blame here .
years went by and news from my friend , initially frequently received , gradually faded away .
one day I learned from a common acquaintance that he actually got married .
I kept sending him emails but to no avail .
news2dago adds that he too had a chance to go to France in 2005 but after careful consideration , decided to stay at home .
he cites a few reasons : the camaraderie seems lost among Malagasy people once in France , everyone for himself , no bonding over playing cards , plus he used the money to move abroad to create his own current project .
“ This is better than having to deal with those guys abroad with their fancy diplomas . ”
he adds :
I called him once to chat a bit and reminisce .
I told him that god &apos;s willing , I might go there for work and be one of you guys .
“ Oh really ? ” he replied then .
since I said those words , whenever I call him , I always get his voicemail .
in a related story , news2dago said that his niece came back to Madagascar from France to get married with a fellow Malagasy she met there .
they had th whole wedding planned to the T , even bringing a professional photographer from France .
they asked to use his internet connection to plan their holidays to Mahajanga after the wedding .
yet they did not deem necessary to say goodbye when they left the country back to France .
living abroad really does change a man .
reacting to the story , Ravatorano believes that feigning indifference or ignoring former friends is not limited to compatriots abroad .
however , he believes it is a minimum to respect people who helped you out .
Simp quipped : ” Forgive them for they are only human … good deeds are the seeds of good fortune and bad deeds are like karmic Damocles sword . ”
lehilahytsyresy gives a possible explanation for forsaking real friendship for utilitarian friendship ( mg ) :
“ When Malagasy abroad are squeezed by the reality of life abroad , rugged competition and everyday life stress , it &apos;s normal that the “ friendship if rich ” attitude prevails , it &apos;s necessary for survival .
however , that behavior becomes ingrained into them so even with relatives , it eventually becomes “ related if loaded ” .
Egypt : bloggers React to Cairo bombings
a French tourist was killed and around 20 people were injured when a bomb exploded outside the Al Hussein Mosque in Cairo &apos;s popular tourist area Khan Al Khalili earlier today .
and as the world was coming to grips with what was happening on the ground , Egypt &apos;s bloggers were quick at work , exchanging updates , information , analysis and concerns .
it all started when Zenobia posted a message on Twitter reporting that “ There is some kind of explosion in Cafe at Al Azhar . ” Minutes later Arabawy followed up with another confirming message which read : “ Explosion in el-Mashhad el-Husseini Street , Cairo . ”
Moftasa was the first to guess a link between the bombings and a new controversial anti-terrorism law , which will be discussed within days in the Egyptian parliament .
the draft law was met by wide objections .
nothing was confirmed yet , and rumors were circulating ; however , Zeinobia was trying to gather updates from different sources Newspapers and TV channels in a quick but comprehensive roundup .
the Arabist , who was near the area and heard both explosions himself , wrote :
am hearing reports of a bomb going off in the medieval part of Cairo near Khan al-Khalili , a major tourist destination .
will update as more news is available .
update : Al Jazeera reporting 11 deaths , three Egyptians , three Germans , one French , 16 wounded , one french dead these and others remain to be confirmed .
update 2 : already activists are saying this is conveniently close to next month when the Emergency Law is to be discussed in parliament …
update 3 : four dead ( German and French ) , 12 wounded , various nationalities .
moftasa then posts a link to a photograph from the blast area on Twitter .
and while Msfour , and American expat living in Cairo , was the first to ask bloggers on Twitter to use the tag # cairobomb , Arabawy was the first to ask bloggers to use a unified delicious tag : El-HusseinExplosion to pool all links under the same URL .
Yassary Masry &#91; Ar &#93; , Carl , Msfour , Maree , Rob , SandMonkey and Grey wool Knickers were among the first to blog about the incident , whether to comfort their friends and families or to discuss if they think there is a connection between the bombings and the anti-terrorism law or not .
Grey wool Knickers wrote a short note connecting the last events happening in Egypt , trying to relate them to the recent bombings :
as several people have noted , this comes at a very suspicious time , considering that the extension of the State of Emergency ( in place since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War , with a brief break during Sadat ’ s presidency ) was just about to be considered once again .
Mubarak ’ s government has been promising for years to come forth with an anti-terrorism law to replace martial law , which would at least give citizens some protection under Egypt ’ s constitution .
the regime is currently able to invoke the Emergency Law to do whatever it wants , which is what readers here will recognize in the abuction of Philip Rizk and Diaa Gad , among many others .
with the changes afoot in US and Israeli administrations — along with increasingly vocal , powerful and interconnected resistance groups , domestically and across the border in Gaza — it seems the aging Mubarak regime is getting nervous and finds little option to maintain its grip on power but to resort to a strategy of tension .
I think the recent release of celebrated political prisoner Ayman Nour should be considered as evidence of the panic roiling the upper echelons of this dictatorship .
for developing news on this event , check this delicious feed .
until the writing of this post it has been confirmed that a 21-year-old French girl was killed , and around 20 people of different nationalities were injured .
however , it still seems to be pretty early to jump into conclusions about who is responsible for the blast .

Ghana : President Atta Mills up against his own party ?
in the months leading to the election of President John Evans Atta Mills , many Ghanaians , including those abroad , feared that a New Democratic Congress ( NDC ) win would morph into another reign by the party ’ s founder and former military ruler , President Jerry John Rawlings .
the transition was smooth , and the relationship between Presidents Rawlings and Mills , seemed cordial .
JJ Rawlings , an unofficial blog site created to highlight the work and thoughts of the former president posted a positive report on May 18 , 2009 about President Rawlings ’ trip to South Africa on behalf of President Mills .
it reported :
President Mills thanked President Rawlings for representing Ghana at the inauguration and assured him that there would be follow up measures to take advantage of the opportunities for mutually beneficial relations between Ghana and South Africa .
but lately , tensions have been rising between President Mills and other members of the NDC party including President Rawlings .
Ato Kwamena Dadzie recently wrote in his post , “ A President Under Siege “ :
President Mills is under siege .
no doubt about that .
he has become such an easy target that an increasing number of people are baying to take a hit at him .
what is most intriguing is that the heaviest hitters are people within his own party .
the opposition can take a vacation .
just last week , it was the majority leader in parliament , Alban Bagbin .
he said the president , who likes to portray himself as a humble sheep , has surrounded himself with aides and confidantes who behave like foxes , hyenas and lions .
these people , according to Mr. Bagbin , tend to intimidate and harass anyone who tries to offer some useful counsel to the president .
days before Mr. Bagbin ’ s comment , the man who transformed the then Prof. Mill from a taxman to a politician , Jerry John Rawlings , and a group of constituency chairmen of the ruling party were expressing indignation at how the president been conducting himself in office .
Mr. Rawlings believes strongly that his protégé has employed incompetent ‘ bastards ’ who have taken advantage of their proximity to power to satisfy their selfish interests .
a blog entry posted early this year on Vibe Ghana reported that :
Kwesi Pratt , social critic and Managing Editor of The Insight , has taken a swipe at former President Jerry John Rawlings for putting spokes in the smooth running of the administration of President John Evans Atta Mills .
according to him , Jerry Rawlings ’ utterances about the administrative style of the current president are not only embarrassing , but also insulting to the intelligence of the law professor .
a comment in response to this post by someone named Prince , said :
I think ex-President Rawlings would do himself and the NDC party a world of good if he behaves in a more stately manner — after all it &apos;s just a probation period of 4years – any impression of Atta Mills being a stooge and not his own man would spell doom for the NDC party as a whole and Rawlings in particular .
Ghana Pundit recently posted an article about President Rawlings ’ response to the current debate :
it would be out of place to allow the NPP that has been rejected by Ghanaians to tell us what we should do .
if all members of the NDC and the Members of Parliament have openly come out to express their feelings , then the NPP that has been rejected would have nothing to say .
the same post included a comment by Kofi Adams , spokesman for the former president :
Mr. Kofi Adams said Rawlings believes there is need for individuals within the party to hold the government and its appointees accountable instead of their opponents in the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) .
Adams goes on to say :
it is good for the party .
it will be bad for the NPP to tell us what to do after they have been rejected and if all party legislators and others have come to the realization to let President Mills know about the feelings of party members and Ghanaians , it is good for us .
this is because , if we allow the NPP to continue to tell us , it would be like a university graduate being corrected by class six pupils .
Ato Kwamena Dadzie has received over 70 responses to his post , “ A President Under Siege ? ” Essuman-Cape Coast , one of the responders wrote :
our journalists have failed us , when NPP set up an employment agency in their Greater Accra Regional office and used it to get their foot-soldiers employed nobody asked questions ( find out from Kojo Asante-CDD ) .
go check the loan defaulters of NPP &apos;s MASLOC and LEAP credit facilities and it would shock you that they are all card-bearing NPP supporters .
NDC supporters are aware of all the above machinations of the NPP and it would be suicidal for Mills to ignore those who fought hard for him to become president .
the way Mills manages the aspirations of his own supporters and Ghanaians in general is the solution to these problems .
however , let me state that , some of the NDC Gurus are behaving like children .
words like Mediocre , Team B and Greedy Bastards are coming from ourselves .
I am well-paid but I just won &apos;t allow my boss to insult me everyday .
does anyone believe that under JJ , every NDC foot-soldier was o.k. , certainly not but no-one incited them against him .
I can agree that Mills has been slow on only one thing , that is , not arresting Molbila &apos;s killers earlier in January 2009 only for one of them to run away .
Mills would succeed and this cycle of voilence visited on defeated parties after elections would cease .
Ato Kwamena responded saying :
this country is not for any group of soldiers – be they on foot or in humvees !
after all the NPP did ( who didn &apos;t know MASLOC and LEAP were for partisan sorts ?
) their foot soldiers complained that Kufuor didn &apos;t do enough for them .
what do they want ?
a gold concession or the oil fields ?
high Energy Bills Keep Bulgarians Protesting
on Sunday , February 17 , tens of thousands of people in Bulgaria &apos;s capital Sofia and other cities continued to protest against high electricity and heating bills , and against the monopoly of energy distribution companies – ChCEZ , EVN , and Energo-Pro .
the protesters are demanding the nationalization of Bulgaria &apos;s three power utilities – CEZ , EVN , and Energo-Pro , with the National Electric Company NEK .
four people were detained as protesters in downtown Sofia clashed with police who tried to cut the rally heading for the headquarters of power utility company CEZ .
the protesters want their demands met next week – and , if this does not happen , they are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister and the President .
although nationalist parties tried to gain political advantage , protesters stood up against such manipulation , shouting “ No parties ! ”
YouTube user iasssen posted this video of the Sofia protest ( shot by SkyMedia-bg.com from the air using a quadcopter , sound recorded separately down on the ground ) .
another HD video from the Sofia protest was posted by user MickeyMouseFrance :
Bulgarian blogger Kostadin Kostadinov posted an entry titled “ Where to after the revolt ? ” &#91; bg &#93; :
around 100,000 people protested today across the country .
the protests , which began as a reaction against the pompous arrogant and brusque bills , become more social and political .
people chanted “ Boyko &#91; Boyko Borisov , Bulgarian PM &#93; out ” and “ Down with &#91; GERB , the ruling party &#93; , ” and then wondered who would follow them .
&#91; ... &#93; What those 100,000 , many of them young people , would do in the elections this summer is extremely important .
obviously , they have the potential to awake the sleeping Bulgaria and to make Bulgarians believe in themselves and change their country .
on the other hand , they do not trust anyone , and they have a good reason .
Bulgarian blogger Sabina Panayotova expressed her pessimism about the Feb . 17 protests :
these people are not those people .
- People in &#91; the summer 2012 protests of Eagle Bridge &#93; are not those of today .
the people today were sad , desperate and gray .
- Protests today were like &#91; the anti-communist protests of 1989 &#93; , except that afterwards they will likely bring communists back to power .
- Whatever happens after these protests will not be good .
in the best case , it will remain as it is .
Taralezh ( “ Hedgehog ” ) blog commented on the missing responses from the ruling party and ministries :
the first men of the country ran away from the protests and the people &apos;s “ love . ” While hundreds of thousands chanted in the streets of 35 cities in the country , none of the leaders thought of returning to Sofia to stand in front of the citizens as &#91; real &#93; men .
D-r Beloliki blog posted a collection of photos of the Feb . 17 protests across Bulgaria .
Dimi Lazhov posted photos from the northwestern city of Vratza where people protesting against the monopoly and the new “ rain tax . ” Facebook page Saprotiva ( “ Resistance ” ) has photos from the nationwide demonstrations as well , and there is also a Storify collection with reactions , here .
Bulgarian journalist Adelina Martini tweeted :
thousands protest in various cities in # Bulgaria against high electricity prices , shouting “ mafia ” and “ resignation ” , local media report
another Bulgarian journalist , Mariya Petkova , who is based in Cairo , tweeted about the protests , too :
hundreds of thousands are out in the streets across # Bulgaria protesting private monopolies of utilities and economic hardship ! !
Arab World : Romney &apos;s Middle East Agenda Rapped
Mitt Romney &apos;s foreign policy speech was rapped by netizens across the Arab World today .
tweets questioning United States ( US ) foreign policy in the Middle East continued as Romney , the Republican nominee for the US presidential elections , spoke at the Virginia Military Institute .
if elected , Romney pledged to take a more “ engaged ” foreign policy , as opposed to Obama &apos;s wait-and-see approach as “ profound upheaval ” shook the region .
he also said he would arm Syrian rebels , at least those among them who share his values .
all the way from Venezuela , journalist Dima Khatib isn &apos;t pleased .
she tweets :
@ Dima _ Khatib : all we had missing was a US Presidential candidate using Syria in his election campaign to promote himself under the pretext that he is better than Obama ! ! !
the plot is complete
and she asks :
@ Dima _ Khatib : is there anyone left who hasn &apos;t sucked the blood of the Syrian revolution for any of their interests ?
Algerian Imad Mesdoua quips :
@ ImadMesdoua : # Romney knows MENA well .
he saw # Libya and thought here &apos;s a good idea , let &apos;s arm the rebels in # Syria !
Shadi Hamid , from the Brooking Doha Centre , Qatar , writes :
@ shadihamid : Romney &apos;s Middle East speech could be important .
one hopes it can encourage Obama to clarify his own approach , which has been tepid &amp; vague .
he adds :
@ shadihamid : issue of US “ leading ” vs. “ leading from behind ” is real &amp; shouldn &apos;t be dismissed .
real doubts abt US resolve &amp; staying power in Arab world .
Bahraini human rights activist Maryam Al Khawaja says :
@ MARYAMALKHAWAJA : judging from his statements , # Romney will be a complete disaster to # humanrights in the # GCC &#91; Gulf Cooperation Council &#93; , even more so than # Obama … # bahrain
and Foreign Policy managing editor Blake Hounshell agrees :
@ blakehounshell : one point Romney and Obama seem to agree on : leaving Bahrain off the list of revolutions America supports .
while Qatari Shayma Al-Naimi , who studies in the US , tweets :
@ iShayma : # Romney really wants to talk about “ America &apos;s record ” in peaceful history ? ? ? ?
and she adds :
@ iShayma : I honestly cannot believe what # Romney is saying right now !
absolutely disgusting .
it &apos;s sad to know that people with his mentality exist .
Palestinian Iyad El-Baghdadi , who tweets from Dubai , notes :
@ iyad _ elbaghdadi : the last time the US displayed some “ leadership in the Middle East ” , 600,000 Iraqis died .
and he proposes a compromise :
@ iyad _ elbaghdadi : half my timeline says # Obama sucks , and the other half says # Romney sucks .
guys , I agree with you .
Egypt : Mubarak in Detention
this post is part of our special coverage Egypt Revolution 2011 .
just a few months ago , many Egyptians might have wished to see the country &apos;s then-President Mubarak in jail , yet almost certainly none of them imagined this wish might come true one day .
however , on Wednesday April 13 , 2011 , Egyptians woke up to the news of Mubarak &apos;s detention first thing in the morning .
here is how the moment was documented in the Egyptian social media scene .
celebrating a dictator &apos;s detention
the Egyptian writer Ibrahim Farghali compared the moment to that of the first man in space :
yesterday , Russia celebrated the anniversary of the first time a human being went into outer space , Yuri Gagarin .
and today Egypt celebrates its former president Hosni Mubarak &apos;s journey to prison .
we hope that one day Egypt celebrates similar achievements like those of the first world , and we hope then that the revolutionary spirit continues to exist in the streets .
Zeinobia also wrote a new blog post about the moment , simply titled , “ A Historical Moment “ .
she then elaborated how the president &apos;s sons were also detained :
former ousted president Mohamed Hosni Mubarak and his son Alaa and Gamal El-Din are detained for 15 days in jail .
Zeinobia then continued to explain that Mubarak is facing charges of murdering protesters and stealing public money ; however , till now Mubarak is staying in a hospital for health reasons .
Alaa and Gamal Mubarak are facing the same charges as their father .
reactions of the people
Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff documented the moment by his own way , with a series of cartoon drawings .
Mubarak Before and After Jan25 Revolution , illustration by Carlos Latuff
the majority of Egyptian status updates on Twitter over the past couple of days have also been about Mubarak &apos;s detention as well .
@ engmtm : I wish I could interrogate # Mubarak myself : d
Mubarak &apos;s voice recorded message , which he sent to Al-Arabiya news channel and which turned out to have been written by the Egyptian well known lawyer Fareed El-Deeb , is believed to be the last nail in Mubarak &apos;s coffin :
@ Eslam _ Foad : thanks to the guy who writes Mubarak &apos;s speeches , without you the revolution wouldn &apos;t have succeeded .
in the past weeks , Torah Prison became not only host for Mubarak &apos;s sons , but it has also been hosting many of the pillars of Mubarak &apos;s regime .
people on Twitter did not miss the chance to mock this fact :
@ MAkhnoukh : breaking News : Torah Jail is now called Torah Republic and it &apos;s citizens demand their independence .
it &apos;s got it &apos;s own president , government , and they do not need people there .
@ Aessameldin : Gamal Mubarak will star in Prison Break &apos;s new season , and his wife Khadija will join Desperate House Wives crew .
various fake Twitter accounts of Mubarak , his family ( Suzanne Mubarak , Alaa Mubarak , Gamal Mubarak and his wife Khadija ) , and his regime ( Fathi Sorour , Safwat El-Sharif and Ahmed Nazif ) have also been created to make fun of them .
car carrying banners in celebration of the detention of Mubarak , posted on Yfrog .
finally , despite all this , and despite the list of Mubarak &apos;s anti-achievements written by Ahmed Hayman , some people still sympathise with the former president :
@ MontuEssam : I swear to God I &apos;m now sad to be an Egyptian , because of what I &apos;m seeing now .
how come the Egyptian people carries all this amount of hatred and will to take revenge !
what &apos;s going ?
are we really that bad ?

female Yemeni Writer Harassed for “ Disrespect of Religion ”
Samia Al-Agbhari .. a Yemeni writer facing a propaganda attack .
photo shared by Afrah Nasser on Facebook
on Facebook , Yemeni blogger Afrah Nasser tackles the issue of restricting freedom of expression in her country and how a female writer is being harassed – allegedly for her disrespect of religion .
she writes :
restricting freedom of expression in Yemen continue .
another writer in Yemen is facing a severe attack ; slandering her and accusing her of disrespecting religion .
one of the best female writers in Yemen , Samia AL-agbhari is facing a media propaganda attack and threatened for her brave stance .
during one of her recent public speeches she stated , “ Yemen &apos;s fatal trio is , the Military , Religion , &amp; Tribalism . ” I don &apos;t just agree with her statement , she has also my greatest solidarity .
I &apos;m sure she will stand firm and solid , but I &apos;m concerned about her safety afterwards .
almost this time of the year , last year , Boushra al-Maqtary faced and still faces the same issue .
as I met Boushra one month ago , I can firmly say , the more those frantic religious figures fight writers , the more determined and stronger we be .
true writers are worriers .
when will they get it !
Africa : AdWords in Africa
Miquel discusses Google &apos;s AdWords in Africa : “ While it would be an excellent method for African bloggers to get a bit of money to cover their internet expenses , Google doesn &apos;t offer payment options for any country in Sub-Saharan Africa . ”
Tanzania : bloggers Analyse Tanzania 2010 Election Campaigns
on 31 October 2010 , more than 19.6 million Tanzanians will make an important decision for the future of their country .
they will take part in the fourth general election since the introduction of multiparty democracy .
with only a few days left before the polls , Tanzanian blogosphere is following closely election campaigns conducted by various political parties .
one of the controversial issues in this year ’ s campaigns , it seems , is that most of university students will not be able to vote .
senior Journalist Ndimara Tegambwage who blogs at Uhuru Hauna Kikomo &#91; SW &#93; writes about the issue :
… Thousands of students at state owned universities registered to vote at their universities .
the Ministry knew that .
election Commission knew and organised it .
students thought that they would be at their universities ( normally colleges open towards the end of September or early October , but this year the government has decided that colleges will start the semester in November ) .
in general the government knew …
he goes on to explain what happens in other countries :
.. in some other countries , there are systems to ensure that their citizens living abroad participate in elections taking place in their countries of origin .
governments collect all the votes .
and the he gives an advice to the students :
… Students can do something if the government will not change its position .
they should remain where they are .
they should urge citizens to wake up early and vote .
they should promote their parties …
another interesting issue in these campaigns is how opinion polls were conducted .
three institutions conducted the polls .
these are Research and Education for Democracy in Tanzania ( REDET ) , Synovate as well as Tanzania Citizens Information Bureau ( TCIB ) ( More information at Wavuti blog ) &#91; SW &#93; .
results from REDET and Synovate were met with mixed reactions .
Christian Bwaya blogging at Jielewe posted an article by Evarist Chahali who blogs at Kulikoni Ughaibuni .
the article expresses suspicion that there might be rigging of the final vote and that REDET ’ s opinion poll results were preparing the ground for the impending vote-rigging :
… Voters should not resign to the notion that CCM &#91; Tanzania &apos;s ruling party &#93; will steal their votes … for example if Dr. Slaa gets 51 perscent and Kikwete 41 percent .
they will then resort to the vote-rigging similar to the one in Zanzibar … It is important that not to give up hope in the face of this sabotage .
we should understand that Kikwete and his CCM are like a terminally ill patient who is ready to commit suicide to escape ( the pain ) .
we will witness more bizarre incidents than REDET ’ s …
there are those who have lost trust in REDET like Markus Mpangala who left a comment at Bwaya &apos;sblog :
… Since REDET started I have never and do not anticipate reading their research … sorry I am an opinion polls sceptic especially opinion polls of this kind … REDET spend a lot of money to research who is leading … REDET is just a game like hide and seek .
Ansbert Ngurumo blogging at Utakapojua Hujui Ndipo Utakapojua &#91; SW &#93; writes about the Synovate opinion polls :
meanwhile , Haki writing for a blog called Food for Thought posted photos showing a famous businessman and CCM supporter , Mustapha Jaffar Sabodo with the following explanation :
a businessmana and CCM supporter Mustapha Jaffar Sabodo has donated a check worth 100 million Shillings and handed it to the National Chairman of Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo ( CHADEMA ) , Freeman Mbowe .
the money is to assist the party to finalise the campaign .
one week before the general elections , there was a Q &amp; A session broadcast through ITV .
in that session Dr. Wilbrod Slaa , CHADEMA ’ s presidential candidate responded to questions direct from the people .
Maggid Mjengwa , a journalist and blogger , wondered about the presidential ‘ debate ’ :
… If it was a debate , then it would have been wise and prudent for other presidential candidates to participate .
without a doubt , other candidates have a fundamental right to be given a chance to explain their policies and to respond to voter ’ s questions .
and then he informs us that CCM barred their candidates from participating in election debates :
… Although the ruling party , CCM , has stated clearly that their candidate will not participate in the debate …
photo journalist , Issa Michuzi , who runs one of the most read Swahili blogs both within and outside the country , follows the incumbent and CCM ’ s presidential candidate Mh Jakaya Kikwete campaign as well as his supporters .
a title in one of his posts ( with photos ) says : JK Afunika Bovu Mlimba , Mahenge na Ifakara ( meaning : JK conquers Mlimba , Mahenge and Ifakara ) .
UDADISI notices that one presidential candidate from the opposition seems to trouble CCM :
… It is quite clear that Dr Wilbrod Slaa &apos;s decision to run as a presidential candidate has tilted the balance of power .
now the debate is no longer about whether the ruling party &apos;s candidate &#91; Jakay Kikwete &#93; will get a landslide victory – as in the previous election .
rather , it is about how much that victory will be cut .
in Zanzibar , there are signs that there will be peaceful elections especially after the agreement to form a Government of National Unity in the Isles .
however , there are some nagging issues as described by Salma Said :
… The Government of Zanzibar ( SMZ ) has admitted that it has registered unqualified people in the voters register due to various reasons .
apart from admitting that , the government also has admitted that Zanzibar Election Commission ( ZEC ) has employed ineligible electoral officers .
that statement has been issued by North Pemba Regional Commisioner , Dadi Faki Dadi during a seminar for regional commissioners , commanders , senior officers , security committees and Sheikhs that was held at Alternative Education Conference Hall in Vitongoji , South Pemba …
she goes on to caution Zanzibaris ( and all Tanzanians in general ) :
Swahili people have a saying ‘ what happened in the past is in the past , let us prevent the looming disease ’ .
yes , I agree with that saying but let us remember that it needs skills , creativity , knowledge , experience and enough wisdom to make sure that the disease we suffered in the past shall not inflict us again …
fierce contest for the ( Union ) presidential seat is between Jakaya Kikwete from CCM , Wilbrod Slaa from CHADEMA and Ibrahim Lipumba from CUF .
in Zanzibar , the contest is between Dr. Ali Mohamed Shein from CCM and Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad from CUF .
as a famous Swahili saying goes : will Tanzanians decide to plait or to shave ?
we will find out after the elections .

Russia : opposition Distracted by Virtual Elections , Loses Real Elections
in August , Global Voices reported on several activists from Russia ’ s protest movement running for office in local elections .
they hoped it would be easier to win these small-scale contests , which took place last weekend .
on October 14 , amid low turnout and perennial allegations of electoral fraud , Russians participated in thousands of elections across the country , voting for local mayors , city councilors , and regional legislatures .
five governorships were also in play , for the first time since Vladimir Putin canceled such elections seven years ago .
dirty tricks and mudslinging
when the dust had settled , the result was that members of the opposition movement did not do well in the few places where they fielded candidates .
the United Russia party , and other pro-Putin candidates , took the lion ’ s share of the votes in most races .
the only nominally-opposition parties to enjoy even limited success were the usual suspects : the Communists , LDPR , and Just Russia .
it remains unclear how much of United Russia ’ s success is due to fraud and other illegal actions .
nevertheless , there are widespread reports of dirty tactics .
Evgeniya Chirikova , Leader of the Khimki Forest Defenders , in Khimki , Russia ( 19 April 2011 ) , By Daniel Beilinson , CC 2.0 .
for example , journalist Dmitry Aleshkovsky blogged about the elections in a small district in the republic of Tatarstan in very apocalyptic terms :
I have seen people dying of cholera in the shade of ruined houses in Port-au-Prince demolished by an earthquake , I have seen thousands of burned houses in Georgian villages in South Ossetia &#91; … &#93; .
these &#91; Russian regional &#93; elections make me feel about the same amount of horror as what I &apos;ve described above .
Aleshkovsky went on to describe numerous violations , ranging from extra ballots in voting boxes to the forcible removal of independent observers .
the extent to which pro-government fraud was present , even in the smallest elections and for the most irrelevant of positions , is striking .
Sergey Ezhov , a member of Limonov ’ s Other Russia movement , ran for city council in the tiny town of Sarai .
he described &#91; ru &#93; that experience in his blog :
the lawlessness began a few days before the vote .
when the cardsharps understood that I ’ m making it to deputy .
quiet and peaceful Sarai was inundated with deceitful and provocative leaflets , voters were rounded up where they work and study , and told to not for Ezhov for any reason .
at the same time , the police began to interfere with our campaigning .
Ezhov lost .
he had thought that the irrelevancy of the post he sought would make him immune from government pressure .
apparently , he was wrong in that assumption .
as it turns out , some of these dirty tactics were used against United Russia members by other United Russia members .
such was the case in Angara , reports Sergey Schmidt , a local political science professor .
a United Russia candidate for mayor seemingly got the short shrift - – his campaign was plagued by scandals , the governor openly supported his opponent , and so on .
he ended up winning , however , largely because voters wanted to “ support and help the person who is being hounded , ” Schmidt argues .
it seems that the mudslinging had gone overboard .
eggs all in a single basket , where they are safest
screenshot from the opposition &apos;s Elections Commission website for the Coordinating Council vote .
most notably , the opposition &apos;s headliner also lost .
Evgenya Chirikova ’ s bid for mayor in the Moscow suburb of Khimki was the only race where the movement came together in a meaningful way , marshaling significant donations and campaign volunteers .
yet , Chirikova still lost , with just 20 % of the vote .
although there were some irregularities , exit polls &#91; ru &#93; confirmed the official vote tally .
Chirikova lost , even though she is one of the better known leaders of the opposition , particularly in Khimki , where she &apos;s an active member of the local community .
in short , the opposition fared poorly .
this is not in dispute .
but there is also no arguing that the protest movement honestly dedicated itself to winning these contests .
Chirikova was in fact the only major candidate to represent the new movement .
local elections could have been a great opportunity to try campaigning on a local level and perhaps decentralize the protest movement , devolving it to regional populations .
yet this opportunity seems to have been thrown away .
for the past month , the nation &apos;s October 14 elections were scarcely on the blogosphere &apos;s radar ( Chirikova being the exception that proves the rule ) .
indeed , for the past month , Russian netizens have been distracted by a different set of elections — the online elections for the Coordinating Council of the opposition , beginning today and ending on October 21 .
rather than compete in formal elections , dozens of local activists joined the Coordinating Council race , participating in televised debates , an essay contest , campaigning , and a host of intra-opposition squabbles — all for a seat in an institution that will be completely divorced from any actual power , even after it actually comes to exist .
perhaps , if the massive get-out-the-vote machine tasked with mobilizing netizen voters had shifted focus to actual voters , it would have succeeded in increasing the meager October 14 turnout ( especially considering how difficult it is become a verified voter on cvk2012.org &#91; ru &#93; ) .
as it stands , it ’ s almost as if the Coordinating Council induced election fatigue .
hopefully it was worth it .
Egypt : dictators and their wives
after seeing pictures of Cameroon &apos;s first lady , Egyptian Zeinobia remarks : “ I do not how much money she spent on her hair and her looks but I know the people of Cameroon need this money more . ”
of Congo : furor Over Kabila &apos;s
the Congolese blogosphere had harsh criticism for Congolese president Joseph Kabila ‘ s recent interview in The New York Times .
in it , Kabila talks about Rwanda , AFRICOM , Chinese investment , and his passion for motorcycles .
he also talked about how good help is hard to find ; many bloggers have blasted him for it .
Kabila blames corruption on Mobutu ‘ s legacy and the ineptitude of his own officials , rather than taking responsibility for his government &apos;s problems :
Q : do you have the right people to help you ?
a : ( long pause ) Mobutu led this country for over 37 years .
he created a political class and he created a mentality and we haven &apos;t done away with that .
the old ways are bad – corruption , misrule , mismanagement and all that .
our biggest mistake is that we have not found enough time to train and form our own cadres .
you don &apos;t need a thousand people to transform a country .
no , you need 3,4 , 10 , 15 people with the necessary convictions , determined and resolute .
do I have those 15 people ?
on Forum Réalisance Musengeshi Katata writes that Joseph Kabila he has injured every Congolese who had read the interview :
all the university professors , army officers , teachers , technicians , engineers , doctors , bankers , skilled workers , parents educating their children , ministers , lawyers , deputies … etc who work each day to build the future of a nation ; all of these people reduced to a team of 15 insiders ?
Flipping it around , is this really a head of state talking or nothing other than a bad coach of a football or rugby team ?
apparently , this president , having no positive results , wants to make his people out to be – and this pleases a lot of Westerners in these uncertain moments of crisis – a bunch of idiots and incompetents .
this begs the question : in this case , what is he still doing in power , the devil , if he can &apos;t trust anybody and if apparently he doesn &apos;t know how to choose the people he needs for his policies to get results ?
Joseph Kabila , President of the Democratic Republic of Congo since 2002 ( Wikipedia )
Congoliberte thinks that if Kabila really believes there are only seven people in his government worth their salt , it &apos;s time to clean house :
apparently , he can only rely on only 6 to 7 people , less than 10 , in a country the comprises more than 70 million inhabitants , to make things happen .
this is serious …
… The Congolese are looking for the justification for a presidential cabinet composed of several dozen advisers , a government of almost 60 members , a parliament of 500 deputies and 120 senators …
… Hidden talents and patriots , who certainly number in the thousands , are chomping at the bit in the shadow of those who have taken the country hostage .
Congolese men and women are waiting for &#91; Kabila &#93; to clean out the “ pigstys ” … Why shouldn &apos;t he innovate , putting something in place a presidential cabinet of less than 10 advisors and a government of less than 15 ministers ? … Now or never , it &apos;s time to make the right choice .
Mouvement Libération du Congo – Diaspora thinks Kabila &apos;s statements about the dearth of competent officials rings colonial :
for those among us who know that “ organized crime in central Africa ” has benefited from the services of Anglo-Saxons , it is possible that Joseph is sending a strong signal to his “ godfathers ” to explain his methods .
reading Joseph Kabila &apos;s response to the New York Times was like being in the presence of Karel De Gucht , Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs , claiming that in Congo he did not find , around Kabila , politicians worthy of that title .
if you &apos;re familiar with all the miseries that De Gucht &apos;s remarks caused and to hear the same discourse come from the mouth of the “ raïs ” ( i.e. , Kabila ) , you have to say to your self “ this feels bad ” .
faced with the patent failure of policies founded on exclusion , violence , corruption , and lies , Joseph quickly finds scapegoats : Mobutu , mobutists , the mobutist mentality .
this interview would have been convincing if Joseph could have cited three or four measures in his 7 years of rule taken for the common Congolese good .
there aren &apos;t any to be had .
some bloggers also debated statements Kabila made about Rwanda , with which relations have been tense .
among other things , Rwanda has so far refused to extradite Laurent Nkunda , former head of a pro-Tutsi rebel group which operated in eastern Congo .
Kabila told the New York Times reporter :
“ What are Rwanda &apos;s interests in the Congo ?
I like to believe that they are the same .
but if there is a hidden agenda , and Rwanda &apos;s interest is more or less controlling the mining concessions and all that , illegally , and if they have a hand in each and everything that goes on in North and South Kivu , then we &apos;re still a long way from trust .
let &apos;s give them the benefit of the doubt , once again , probably for the last time ”
the Mushaki Pager wonders what made Kabila take such a strong stance :
not very diplomatic .
does he want to make the Rwandan authorities angry ?
did he make a deal with France allowing him to huge such provocative language toward Rwandan allies , whom the president very recently said enjoyed a solid friendship with Kinshasa ?
Afrique des Grands Lacs posts a French translation of the interview and writes :
Mr. Kabila confirmed again that Rwanda will extradite Laurent Nkunda and that he will be brought to justice in the DRC .
however , this begs the question what leeway does Kabila have at his disposal to secure Kagame &apos;s extradition of Nkunda …
I am dumbfounded that Kabila declared that there was no arrest warrant for Nkunda .
this serious contradiction in the same interview is a clear sign that Kabila is no longer working for Nkunda &apos;s extradition .
if the Head of State himself “ forgets ” an international arrest warrant issued by his country &apos;s own justice system , how can you expect that warrant to have an effect ?
on Forum Réalisance , Katata criticizes the general merit of the interview , in particular what he thinks is Kabila &apos;s lack of substance .
he blames Western media bias :
it is all the same surprising that an elected president can show such little substance in an interview in a newspaper as important as The New York Times .
many will say : this has to do with the questions he was asked and what the journalist was after in the interview .
I recognize that &apos;s plausible : it was more about making some sort of advertisement for an African president for whom they want to rally sympathy than about testing the maturity of his logic or political competence .
after all , the Americans have a precise idea of Africa : a continent of the poor , the weak , the incapable which &#91; America &#93; needs in order to feel even stronger in its political , military and economic power .
a grand continent of beggars to which one periodically grants an excessive amount of aid , which is used to solve , somehow or another , the problems that it did not know how to solve itself .
the Idleness of African Leadership in Mali
Ousmane Gueye on the site Mondoblog writes &#91; fr &#93; about the slow deployment of African troops in northern Mali :
if we were to judge the impact of the intervention in Mali by the jubilant euphoria of liberated populations , then it should be obvious that by deploying so slowly , African countries failed Mali once again … .. All the posturing by African heads of state and yet they could not achieve a single action of their own to slow down the Islamists in Mali .
Indonesia : coins for justice
earlier today , Prita Mulyasari , a housewife who was prosecuted for writing a complaint email regarding a bad hospital service , was found guilty for defaming a private hospital by the Tangerang High Court .
the court ordered her to pay a fine of Rp . 204 M ( US $ 21,680 ) to OMNI Internasional Alam Sutera hospital .
salary of a factory worker in Jakarta is roughly US $ 106 per month .
Indonesian net users are buzzing to collect the sum in form of coins because they are outraged by the court decision and they hope the coins will overwhelm the hospital , said one activist to local newspaper Kompas .
“ When justice is spared , we collect coins ” , says tagline of Koin Keadilan , coins for justice , a new website dedicated to collect coin donation to pay Prita &apos;s fine .
image on www.koinkeadilan.com
an online declaration on the site says :
about the method , we might disagree with one another .
whether it &apos;s necessary to put donations in coins or not .
but we agree in one thing : that justice is being hurt .
we feel the same thing , that power and arrogance that wish to eliminate the freedom of expression by criminalizing it , should be fought .
protests and solidarity tweets are being sent out using the hashtags # freeprita and # helpprita .
a concert is planned in Hard Rock Cafe Jakarta .
details and updates coming up .
charity Concert for coins .
Treespotter : dear All , drop a coin for Prita – drop a coin for common sense .
or lots of coins .
she needs 2,5 tons of it .
el15abeth : social media does not expire .. we know Prita is innocent .
the verdict will only give Omni hospital a bad rep . # freeprita
# freeprita is an illustration of online people &apos;s parliament which could be more “ dangerous ” than street parliament , never underestimate us who are online .
legal experts said that Prita &apos;s prosecution under the new cyber law is unfair because the law won &apos;t be fully implemented before April 2010 .
blogger Aditya share his thoughts about the power of Microblogging :
I believe in the power of social network tools to spread this sort of news widely , at least as seen on massive movement of facebookers in support of Gecko v. Crocs ( author &apos;s note : anti corruption battle between citizens ’ backed graft fighter versus the police ) .
but , I wonder if that sum of money in form of coins could be collected soon .
not that I want to underestimate this movement , but we all know , that this kind of thing usually could end up cold like yesterday &apos;s potato .
well , hopefully not !
concluding his post , Adithya asks his readers :
friends , if and just if , you really care about freedom of expression and the protection of consumer &apos;s right , get a move on .
Mozambique : political crisis in central city of Beira
this open letter comes after the Mozambican National Resistance ( Renamo ) leadership in the central Mozambican city of Beira announced on August 28 that Davis Simango , mayor of the city of Beira , would not run for his second term office for the local elections taking place on November 19 , 2009 .
as an immediate response to the announcement , angry Renamo and Simango supporters took control of the party ’ s delegation in protest against president Afonso Dhlakama ’ s decision of substituting Simango by Manuel Pereira .
the decision sparked off two days of demonstrations in Beira , as Simango &apos;s supporters came onto the streets and demanded that the decision be reversed .
on the following Friday night , police used tear gas and rubber bullets against a crowd that had gathered in front of the Renamo offices in the neighbourhood of Munhava .
during the scuffles , a reporter from the Beira daily paper “ Diario de Mocambique ” , Antonio Chimundo , was physically attacked by Renamo members who accused him of working for the ruling Frelimo Party .
many analysts including some Renamo parliamentarians condemn Dhlakama ’ s decision and praise Davis Simango for his decision to run as an independent candidate .
the original version of the letter below is available on my blog in Portuguese .
Sir , I would not let go the opportunity to expose my views about you as leader of a party that once was great .
I also want to promise that I will not forget you next year during the general elections .
yes , I will not forget when I remember so many people that you politically assassinated .
the Independent Magazine published a short list of some of your former colleagues that fought together with you in Renamo .
but by your decision , were expelled claiming the will of the “ bases ” ( party members and supporters ) .
for now , it ’ s important to stress that Mr. Renamo President do not act and has never acted accordingly to the will of the bases ; the same you did in relation to the grinding war that you proudly claim to have commanded .
Mr. Dhlakama , you politically murdered people with higher capabilities of leading political organizations than you , people who , by their academic baggage , diplomatic tact and intelligence , raised higher the name of Renamo during the times of civil war , of peace negotiations , national reconciliation and during the debates of the Assembly of the Republic .
today , people like those are as fewer as ever in the whole history of Renamo !
Sir , nowadays , you are politically a mere a dead body .
Mozambique should be one of the few countries in the world where “ political corpses ” coexist side by side with the living , without causing shiver to the latest .
yes , I will not forget you , after consenting three smashing defeats in three presidential elections ; I will not forget you , tired I am in listening to your lies without consequence .
dear Mr. Renamo President , you should be of the politicians who most lie in this country , and politicians who more say without taking into account the consequences : you announced that you would not take part of the State Council after the 2004 elections .
but now there you are very well seated , quiet and mutt ; you did not want to recognize the outcomes of the 1999 elections , but you recognized ; you claim to be a democrat , but we all know the way you tried to massacre Devis Simango … more words for what ?
Mr. Renamo President , you are not worthy to equal yourself to a partridge , but the lying hen who never tires to crack eggs that she lays .
in my land , such hens have their beaks burned up , being the size of their beaks inversely proportional to the amount of eggs that they crack .
as Salomão Moyana said , You , Mr. Renamo President , are of the few infiltrated in Renamo who , despite having been discovered , insist in staying .
and frankly , I await from further news in 2009 after your overwhelming defeat in favour of Armando Guebuza .
the best you should do for now is to remain silent until those elections .
after losing , call for a Convention to announce your candidacy for the 2014 presidential elections !
then , your direct collaborators will come from Maringue ( Dhlakama ´ s residual armed men ) .
because those who are presently supporting you will be shortly expelled by yourself during this year or beginning of next , when you start to decide who is going to represent you in the Parliament .
great to know that Beira City does no longer support you .
carry on earning your wages without working .
because , doing opposition is for you sitting at your shadow and instigating envy against those you think ready to serve people .
long live Mr. President !
but keep in mind that in 2014 , people like those currently supporting you will scarce .
Philippines : bloggers ’ Views on Sex Education
a bee pollinates a flower in Baguio , Philippines – copyright Jay Suasin on Flickr ( used with permission )
this school year , the Philippine government is implementing a United Nations-backed sex education program in public schools for children and teenagers .
the sex education program is being piloted in selected schools around the country and will include topics such as reproductive health , HIV / AIDS prevention , and family planning .
the Catholic Church has expressed strong opposition to the program .
bloggers comment on the issue .
Tom Martin asks if sex education should be done “ in the classroom or behind a tree ? ”
no parent is going to have absolute control over the places their children are going to learn about sex and it seems to me that a wise parent would at least want his or her children to be exposed to proper sex education by trained teachers in a controlled school setting rather than learning about sex from a peer behind a tree .
the Pinoy Catholic echoes the official stand of the local clergy and adamantly suggests that sex education should be left to the parents .
a Filipina Mom Blogger points out that not all parents may know how to discuss sex with their children :
“ We can ’ t assume parents know how to discuss sex openly .
some might be uneducated to understand the anatomy of reproduction and thus fail to grasp natural birth control methods . ”
the Catacomb recommends that sex education should be given to the parents instead .
why not leave these children alone for now .. Or maybe government should try to impose a law of proper parenting , where in parents are given some constant trainings or symposiums that will equip them with proper knowledge in giving their children the right guidance as they grow up .
this will prevent not only the exposure of children to the sensitivity of sex but it will also give the parents a better chance to bond with their kids , spending quality time , giving the necessary attention , love and care …
the x-piles believes that those against the sex education program should go after the mass media instead .
the church could have overlooked the real culprit for the alleged generation of sexual perverts – the mass media .
violence and sex are prevalent on many T.V. shows and movies and these are all absorbed by the youth and children as well .
all of these have the capacity to change the moral perception of the youth ’ s developing minds , bringing them to confusion on what is right or wrong .
meanwhile , Quod Dixit Dixit questions the government &apos;s motives for implementing the program .
it is not clear to me whether the government ’ s move sprung from its idea that overpopulation is one of the root causes of grinding poverty in the Philippines and hence , it must be put into a lower gear . ( N.B.
: I always assume perhaps with precision that the main roots of poverty in the country are graft and corruption and the unabated abuse and destruction of the environment and natural resources .
the women &apos;s group Gabriela see the program as a step in the right direction .
the Department of Education ( DepEd ) ’ s Memorandum No .
26 , allowing the use of teaching modules on sex education , could be a positive step , granting that DepEd will conduct an intensive process of consultation with different stakeholders before full implementation .
this will ensure that the program is not implemented mechanically , and all arguments are heard .
in our part , GABRIELA , Gabriela Women ’ s Party and SALINLAHI are willing to become part of the consultation process and share our extensive experience in gender and sexuality education with children and parents .
Ducky Paredes , however , believes that the program is as good as dead with the appointment of Brother Armin Luistro FSC to the post of Secretary of Education by the new Aquino administration .
is this the end of the UN-funded program for sex education for lour public schools ?
probably .
one cannot see how a Christian brother can support sex education for elementary and high school students considering that many in the Catholic Church believe that exposing students to learning about sex and sexuality will surely lead to unwanted pregnancies .
Sudan : Twitter Activist Released After Two Months in Detention
this post is part of our special coverage # SudanRevolts .
the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service ( NISS ) launched a heavy-handed campaign in mid-June 2012 , arresting thousands of protesters , activists , political party members and leaders and even law-abiding citizens from protest sites , universities , public places and in many cases people ’ s homes , following anti-regime protests .
however , once the protests calmed down over two months , the NISS began releasing detainees ; August 17 marked the largest number of detainees released .
among those released is Twitter activist Usamah Mohamed Ali who was arrested from the scene of a protest in Khartoum on June 22 .
Usamah Mohamed Ali is a Sudanese Twitter activist who was arrested at a protest .
he has tweeted his prison experience following his release .
a month into Usamah ’ s arrest , Mimz wrote a blog post highlighting his detention .
a day after his release , he tweeted a mere two words but confirmed to his followers that he had been released :
adding :
@ simsimt : I &apos;m so grateful for all who campaigned for me !
tweets , topics &amp; support msgs brought a lump to my throat several times while I was reading !
a week later , Usamah wrote a series of short tweets narrating the conditions of his arrest .
he started off :
@ simsimt : without further detail for now , I was arrested by an # NISS agent in plainclothes who approached me while I was tweeting .
# SudanRevolts
@ simsimt : I remember very clearly that I was writing about the huge attempts made by # NISS to prevent any documentation of the protest .
# SudanRevolts
Usamah explained that he refused to give away the password to his phone , provoking the anger of the NISS officers :
@ simsimt : locking my phone , which I &apos;ve password-protected , later became the catalyst for much abuse , torture &amp; interrogation I &apos;d endured # SudanRevolts
stating :
@ simsimt : when taken to an # NISS pickup truck that was stationed by the protest area , I was ordered several times to unlock my phone .
# SudanRevolts
@ simsimt : I fiercely refused .
when they finally gave up on me , I was taken alone on a pickup , blindfolded , to # NISS premises in Bahri .
# SudanRevolts
he then notes the emotional and physical torture he sustained while in detention :
@ simsimt : at # NISS building , I endured almost 4 or 5 hours of verbal abuse , severe beating up and all kind of threats to unlock my phone # SudanRevolts
@ simsimt : I was threatened w / sexual assault / abuse numerous times during that day .
at one point , even by a top-rank # NISS officer .
# SudanRevolts
noting that :
@ simsimt : I endured severe beating up on my head w / a rock , &apos; cause my phone while in their possession , received a call from the U.S. # SudanRevolts
@ simsimt : the torturer who had gone pretty mad was hysterically shouting “ You &apos;re an agent , AGENT , AGENT ! ” while beating me up !
# SudanRevolts
explaining that NISS officers forcefully deprived him of sleep :
@ simsimt : when again , they finally gave up on me , I was ordered by an officer , in front of me , to be deprived from sleeping .
# SudanRevolts
Usamah concluded saying :
@ simsimt : I hold # NISS accountable for everything I &apos;ve endured .
I remember the faces of my torturers and abusive officers .

Nepal : Bio-gas Revolution

biogas technology is starting a green revolution in Nepal .
according to WWF firewood is the preferred energy source in the country as almost 87 % of households depend on it .
however , biogas is emerging as a viable alternative .
a recent report by AFP divulges that Nepal is making money ( almost 600,000 US $ in 2007 ) trading carbon emissions with the help of numerous biogas plants across the country .
for a nation struggling find cheap and sustainable source of energy , biogas certainly brings good news for Nepal .
Globalwarming Arclein , a blog on how agriculture can help reduce carbon emission , says that the low tech approach of biogas makes it accessible to the majority of Nepalese people who live in villages :
“ Biogas production is not high technology .
it takes a cistern that can be made with a shovel and perhaps setting liner stones as is often done in a modern septic field .
Capping this and drawing of the produced gas into a holding tank is simple and usage after that needs again fairly minimalist hardware that can be jury-rigged together .
the major requirement is to simply know that it can be done and that it will work .
recovery of the produced slurry later is unpleasant but no different than similar tasks attended to.It is not a convenient way to produce enough gas for household heating , but certainly sufficient to support incidental heating for cooking and producing hot water in a healthy way . ”
Nepal &apos;s success in biogas could inspire its neighbors too .
Nepal &apos;s closest ally India is also looking forward to develop alternative energy sources to deal with the growing demand in its rapidly industrialized states .
Razib Ahmed at South Asia Blog , which focuses on the region &apos;s business and social issues , says :
“ I am interested about biogas a lot because I believe that it has immense potential not only for Nepal but also for neighboring countries like India and Bangladesh .
biogas Sector Partnership Nepal ( BSP-Nepal ) is an NGO that is actively working for the promotion of biogas in the country .
until June 2008 , 172,858 biogas plants have been made with their support .
as a result , more than 1 million people are getting the benefits .
1 million people may not sound to be that much to you but you have to remember that it is mainly the poor people living in rural areas who got benefited through this technology .
not only that , I would also like to catch your attention about the fact that Nepal imports almost 100 % of its oil .
so , every biogas plant made means saving some foreign currency for the country . ”
and the interest in biogas is not a passing fad for Nepal .
after many years of hard work and careful planning , it has been able to generate significant attention .
back in 2005 , Mallika Aryal at RenewableEnergyAccess reported on Nepal &apos;s quest to generate sustainability and revenue through biogas .
“ Nepal &apos;s Biogas Support Program has extended its work to 66 of the nation &apos;s 75 districts and plans to have 200,000 biogas plants installed by 2009 .
a plant suitable for a rural household costs US $ 300 .
government subsidies have made the plants affordable .
an individual invests only $ 200 and his investment is recouped in three years .
a very good deal indeed !
now the Nepali biogas plants are on their way to becoming a “ good deal ” for the global environment .
when Kyoto Protocol , the global climate treaty , will enter into force for Nepal in December 2005 , it would be eligible to start trading the carbon dioxide not emitted by using biogas and earn up to $ 5 million per year . ”
to learn more about how biogas is helping Nepal , here is a video produced by the Nepal Project at Tokyo City University , Japan .
Mozambique : attack on Presidential candidate
Mozambican bloggers Carlos Serra and Paulo Granjo respond to the attack yesterday against politician Daviz Simango , in the northern Mozambican port city of Nacala .
in addition to the reactions from the blogosphere , Simango &apos;s party ( @ mdmwiki ) , tweeted the attack .
Simango is the mayor of Beira , and founded his new party MDM earlier this year , after falling out with traditional opposition party RENAMO .
just days ago , he and his party confirmed a planned bid for the Presidency and a campaign for the October election .
Simango was heading for a meeting of his party when his car was shot at by individuals in the assembled crowd who grabbed police weapons .
he escaped unharmed but media reports indicate three people were injured , including a policeman .
initial reports from Mozambican independent media suggest the shooters were members of RENAMO .
Egypt : IslamOnline Employees Strike
after the new Qatari administration announced that 250 employees in the widely read IslamOnline news website ( IOL ) would be laid off , hundreds of employees , editors , and journalists started an angry sit-in .
the situation escalated rapidly when the administration threatened to call state security to break the sit-in , but employees confirmed they will continue their open strike till their demands are fulfilled .
it is worth mentioning that this strike may be the first instance in which strikers use new media efficiently and effectively to draw all the attention needed to support their cause , from continuous Twitter updates to Live streaming .
Nadia El Awady , an ex-journalist for IOL , was closely following the situation and posted a statement issued by IslamOnline striking employees on her blog :
the situation has miserably escalated inside IOL HQ in Cairo , after the Qatari management sent lawyers to take over the building , with all its properties and papers , and investigate with 250 employees who sent a statement to Sheikh Qaradawy , Chairman of the Board , complaining from unjust actions by the new management .
some sources said that the hidden reason behind investigating with these employees is to fire then , and so ban them from all their financial rights .
well-informed sources within the institution said that the aim of the investigation with employees is to arbitrarily dismiss them and therefore deprive them from all their financial dues .
while Tadamon Masr mentioned &#91; Ar &#93; that the dispute may be because the new Qatari administration wants to move the HQ from Cairo to Doha , AbdelMoniem was skeptical &#91; Ar &#93; and wondered if it was all about extremists who want to silence moderate voices on websites like Islam Online .
Zeinobia expressed a similar opinion to AbdelMoniem , saying :
the new Qatari administration is said to be a very conservative one that believes the Website should stick to conservative religious issue and removed other sections
on Twitter , Mohammed , another former journalist in IOL , broke the news saying :
@ MohammedY : to journos in Egypt &amp; Arab world : journalists @ # IslamOnline r being bullied by new management into silence against bad company practices
@ MohammedY : so when workers sign a petition stating their problems , the management puts the workers under investigation .
WTF is wrong at # IslamOnline ?
Abdullah El Shamy and Muhammad Ghafari , who are among the strikers , were working on the live stream , continuously updating their Twitter accounts and posting pictures from the place .
@ Ghafari : for those who are concerned , Live updates on # IslamOnline employees ’ strike here : http : / / www.ustream.tv / channel / iol-on-air
Ghafari didn &apos;t forget to mention how women were playing a vital rule in the sit-in :
no need to mention how women had a vital role in the sit in , and in composing chants as well !
Nadia El Awady was also updating through her friends on Twitter around the clock , where she mentioned :
@ NadiaE : female employee at # Islamonline talking about staying overnight at the office in her sleeping bag to continue her strike
@ NadiaE : # islamonline employee @ mos3abof calls on audience to backup website content &#91; qatar board taking over &amp; plans for website unclear &#93;
Egyptian blogger Ahmed Shokeir expressed an opinion that nearly everybody felt , commenting on how new media tools are used differently this time :
I thinkthe IslamOnline sit-in may be the first to be live streamed online .
I believe it will be an effective and widely spread tool in the near future .
it is worth mentioning that a rumor spread on Twitter that EL Qaradawi might resign , as per Mohammed :
@ MohammedY : # IslamOnline management in Qatar have been evading Al-Qaradawi &apos;s calls bec he wanted to take sides with employees ( through Fathi at IOL )
and was supported by another Tweet for Nadia :
@ NadiaE : Motaz Al-Khateeb producer of Sheikh Al-Qaradawi &apos;s Aljazeera show spoke with Sheikh &apos;s secretary who says he is still considering resignation
before sleeping , Ghafari concluded his updates saying they will not stop their strike unless all these demands are fulfilled :
employees strike will continue till the morning , till decisions are issued to grantee our rights officially .

Iranian government uses Gaza conflict to repress
while several Iranian bloggers ( including Islamist ones ) multiplied their posts and digital initiatives , such as a “ Google bomb ” to condemn Israel &apos;s invasion of the Gaza Strip , some other bloggers are saying the Iranian government is using the “ Gaza conflict moment ” to repress media and civil society inside the country .
last week , Iranian authorities shut down , Kargozaran , a leading reformist journal , because it published a statement of a student movement ( Tahkim Vahdat ) that condemned Israel but also referred to Palestinian militant groups who take refuge in hospitals and schools as terrorists .
Nik Ahnag , a leading cartoonist and blogger , has published a couple of cartoons about the Gaza invasion and the inequal power balance between Israel and Palestinians on one side , and Iranian government repression on the other side .
one of these cartoons shows a huge hammer labeled Gaza hitting the Kargozaran journal .
in the cartoon , it seems that teachers , women and students are the next targets in line .
blogger Jomhour writes about the statement that led to the closure of reformist journal .
the logic in this statement is probably that many Iranian politicians think , but do not dare to express , that the Gaza crisis is an excuse &#91; for Iranian authorities &#93; to escape the country ’ s growing economic and social problems .
today we should ask ourselves how we should evaluate , last year &apos;s confrontations between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza where hundreds of Palestinians were killed and injured .
the violence was so hard that is made some Fatah supporters take refuge in Israel .
the blogger concludes that the barbaric attacks of Israel as well as the corruption of some Palestinian leaders feeds terrorist groups and those who promote ethnic and religious hatred and violence .
in Mibibi blog , we read &#91; Fa &#93; :
the closure of Kargozaran made dozens of people jobless , and it becomes , &#91; without non-official journals &#93; more difficult to inform people who do not trust official state television and websites about Gaza .
blogger Hossein Ghazian also complains against censorship .
the blogger says &#91; Fa &#93; : “ If we cannot defend Israel and speak against Palestinians my words to condemn Israel &apos;s occupation and aggression are useless and not credible … ”
St Behesht writes about “ Iranian TV failure and censorship ” .
the blogger says &#91; Fa &#93; :
these days , in all parts of Iran where people talk about politics , they are discussing the Hamas and Israel confrontation .
Iranian National TV fuels this discussion , but Iranian authorities have not yet realised that their propaganda on TV has a negative effect for Hamas.Contrary to Iranian TV ’ s objective , there are more than a few people who , because of Iranian TV propaganda , are taking side against Hamas and support Israel … .
unfortunately Iranian authorities have not understood this , and continue their illusion hoping &#91; their propaganda &#93; influences Iranians .
Angola : Countdown to the long awaited elections
it is less than a month for Angola to experience one of the most anticipated episodes in its history .
sixteen years since the last elections , Angolans will once again have the opportunity to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming legislative elections , taking place from 5 through 6 September .
the atmosphere is quiet , although there are different feelings among the population .
the more affluent people say they are going abroad ; some smile and guarantee that nothing will happen because Angolans don &apos;t want war and suffering anymore ; while others rush to stores to buy staple goods , just in case the devil pays and things go wrong , as happened in 1992 .
as a reminder , at that time the largest opposition party , UNITA , contested the polls and fighting broke out , leading to a resumption of the civil war that ended ten years later , with the death of the charismatic leader of that party , Jonas Savimbi .
when it comes to foreign businessmen based in Angola , they have no intention of returning to their home countries .
the business community is confident that everything will remain the same after the elections and that it is not necessary to change professional commitments .
Jotacê Carranca makes the following reflection on the local atmosphere :
after the first electoral process , which was completely frustrating and traumatic , the second parliamentary elections in Angola are coming up very fast .
if this process is , for many , synonymous with renewed hopes and consolidation of democracy throughout the country , for others , in the rural areas and for those in the provinces who suffered such violent , direct and dramatic consequences of the post-election war in 1992 , I think there is a prevailing sense of fear , uncertainty , pessimism and a lack of credibility about the benefits this process can bring to all citizens ’ lives .
in these areas , there is a need to make a valiant job of simplifying a process that goes beyond the political , aesthetic , cultural , religious and philosophical influences .
we must promote social and individual conscience .
Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos has already issued a public appeal for calm and organization on voting days , saying that “ it is essential that the safety of citizens and protection of their property is fully guaranteed , because public order is a prerequisite ” .
the leader added that it is necessary to have “ respect for the views and ideas of others ” without the use of “ verbal or physical violence . ”
we hope that the 8.3 million voters will have a peaceful environment to vote in and will do so in a perfectly clear , lucid way .
there are more than 12 thousand voting centres throughout the national territory .
meanwhile , Angola is already lively with the election campaign carried out by the nine political parties .

Kyrgyzstan : the “ Archived ” Revolution
on April 6th , Kyrgyzstan a mountainous country in Central Asia , was hit by mass protests &#91; ENG &#93; which eventually led to the overthrow of the government .
regional administrators were seized by protesters , and the army and police switched sides to the opposition , leaving President Kurmanbek Bakiev with almost no support .
the riots have not been bloodless – the recent unrest has so far left almost 74 people dead and more than 500 wounded – unlike a previous peaceful “ Tulip revolution ” &#91; ENG &#93; in 2005 .
the two uprisings are not dissimilar .
only five years ago , it was Bakiev who came to the Ala-Too square in the center of Kyrgyz capital demanding the resignation of former president Askar Akayev .
now , it is Bakiev himself who has had to flee the capital amidst roaring crowds led by opposition leader Roza Otunbaeva .
Kyrgyzstan cultural-political divisions , map source : Wikimedia
whatever the real reasons of the Kyrgyz revolution of 2010 are , it is important to note that it was overwhelmingly immediate , furious , bloody and … well-documented .
the role of the new media changed slightly this time compared to other dramatic events ( like the protests in Moldova or Iran ) .
blogs and Twitter didn &apos;t serve as serious means of public mobilization since the Internet penetration rate is relatively small in Kyrgyzstan ( just 15 percent in 2009 ) .
however , new media were agile enough to cover all the main events giving detailed footage of initial protests in Talas , rampage in Bishkek and looting that followed .
at the same time , new media were efficiently used by the opposition attracting the attention of international community and shifting public opinion to the side of the protesters .
the opposition leader Roza Otunbaeva ( @ otunbaeva ) , for instance , registered her account as soon as she became the head of the provisional government .
on the other day , son of president Bakiev , Maxim opened a LiveJournal account to express the pro-government point of view .
as Gregory Asmolov concluded &#91; RUS &#93; , it was not “ journalists 2.0 ″ who were the most efficient in covering Kyrgyz events but the “ editors 2.0 ″ .
bloggers who both knew the region and were outside the country to see the big picture and collected the photographs , videos and Twitter confessions .
two most informed bloggers in this situation were people outside the country : US-based Yelena Skochilo ( a.k.a. LJ user morrire ) and Kazakhstan-based Vyacheslav Firsov ( a.k.a.
they managed to assemble the most complete collections of photos , videos and timelines .
another “ winners ” in the coverage are the local blog-portals namba.kz , kloop.kg , issyk-kulpress.kg ( as well as traditional news sites like internews.kg , neweurasia.net and 24.kg ) , forum diesel.elcat.kg and a wordless webcam showing Ala-Too square ( its screenshots were captured and transmitted by many bloggers ) .
Twitter hashtags # freekg ( the major hashtag of the event ) , # bishkek , # kyrgyzstan and # talas , although filled with re-tweets and various provocations , made it possible for English-speaking audience to follow the events as well .
despite nation-wide problems with the Internet on April 6 and 7 ( the government forces blocked several popular websites “ Azattyk ” ( RFERL ) , 24.kg , ferghana.ru , LJ user sabinareingold reported ) , the Kyrgyz revolution came out to be very well-documented .
Registan.net , comparing the events with Andijan massacre , wrote :
the information coming out of Kyrgyzstan is not always reliable .
it is often biased , short-sighted , confusing and contradictory .
but it is giving us a view of Kyrgyzstan that demands our attention — not only now , but in the months and years to come , when we look back on these events and try to piece together what happened
since the information was so vast , so there was a systematized list of events and materials gathered and published by the bloggers .
April 6th , Talas
the revolution began on April 6 in Talas , north-western Kyrgyzstan , where the local people stormed the local administration .
the same happened in Naryn a couple of hours earlier .
on the next day , almost all regional capitals except Bishkek in the North of Kyrgyzstan were controlled by the opposition .

April 7th , Bishkek rampage
the most important events happened on April 7 in Bishkek .
the opposition meeting turned to an open conflict .
when protesters ( who somehow acquired arms ) started to storm the Presidential palace after defeating police forces , the presidential guards started firing at them in an attempt to stop the attackers .
witnesses said several snipers killed at least 20 people ( others were killed by grenades and open fire ) .

the police was unable to stop the protesters and left the building .
President Bakiev left for the unknown location on his plane .
on April 8 , there was information that he landed in Osh ( south of the country ) , and moved to his native village near Jalalabad .
he refused to abdicate .
the Osh region is among those that aren &apos;t controlled by the opposition so far .
it is still unclear what will happen to Bakiev .
April 8 , Revolution aftermath
after the opposition forces won Bishkek , they confronted another serious danger : the looters .
various bloggers reported omni-presence of looters ( sometimes armed ) .
in the evening , the looters were stopped by newly established police and volunteer brigades with white bandage on their hands .
the last messages from the blogs said that the situation in Bishkek stabilized .

so says Neurotic Iraqi Wife .
overall Iraqi blogs were positive toward president elect Obama , but not all bloggers were happy .
Layla Anwar only foresees doom for Iraq during Obama &apos;s presidency :
so Obama , the booma , won the elections . &#91; booma means owl , but in Iraqi dialect it also means someone very stupid &#93; …
the vice president for the booma Obama is none other than J.Biden.
J.Biden , the Zionist , is an ardent supporter of the partition of Iraq into three statelets .
no wonder Maliki and Co were also backing the booma along with Iran … I am glad that the evil , bastard Bush is out .
no doubt about it .
but I shall not congratulate you on your 44th president .
he will simply finish off what the other Zionists had started — The final partition of my country .
to hell with all of you and all of your presidents .
to say that Neurotic Wife is pleased with the US presidential election would be an understatement .
she writes :
change , change , change .
change is on its way .
change to the vicious Bush administration .
the Bush administration that lied , tricked , conned the world , and most of all conned the Iraqis . … For me , this is not just about history , this is about someone who was able to bring down the very people that broke my country .
it ’ s a great punch to the very people that destroyed the individual Iraqi .
and that to me is an enough victory .
I will only have to say to Mr Obama , don ’ t let us down .
you came thus far , and as an Iraqi Im depending on you .
don ’ t let dirty politics break your promises . … I learnt a few lessons in life , and that is to never ever over expect things from individuals , but in this instance I am .
I am expecting many things from Obama .
and disappointment is NOT one of them .
as for all the red neck extremists out there , for all you people who cannot fathom how a black American can be your president , Tough luck .
live with it …
it ’ s a beautiful clear sky today .
a BLUE sky .
the start of a new era .
the Obama Era …
and Fatima , an Iraqi American is at last proud .
she declares :
for me , I am so proud of America right now .
proud of it for overcoming so much , and showing us what it is capable of .
and for me , I really hope that Obama does not disappoint .
I hope that he leads this nation to justice and equality for all , and that he stays away from aggression , wherever it may be .
I hope that he does not become just another one of them presidents .
and finally , I really do salute John McCain on his work and his speech last night .
it was chivalrous , and I hope he rests after his long years of service .
GOOOBAMA !
long Live Justice , Equality and all this is good in this world !
and Finally
I end with messages of congratulations from Iraqis to America .
Iraqi Mojo :
Americans have elected an African American man named Barack Hussein Obama as their next President .
God bless America !
Sahar :
am I happy for Iraq ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know what will happen and I &apos;m afraid .
will he pull out the troops ?
will he care enough to reach a good compromise – fair to the Iraqi people ?
but in spite of all my fears , I am so happy for America – You have come such a long way .
you had the strength , the will to elect this man of change .
and with all my heart I hope he puts America on the path to recovery .
to see America again on the pedestal of freedom and democracy , a benign force that heals instead of hurts , unites instead of divides – soon inshalla .
I wish to congratulate you all .
Iraq Pundit :
over the years I have often found myself defending Americans from such critics as the French or Arabs , who charge the people of the U.S. are ignorant racist idiots .
I have tried to talk to those critics , but naturally I got nowhere .
maybe the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States will tell them how wrong they are . only the heartless were not moved last night when Obama was announced the winner of the presidency . … So congratulations to Barack Obama .
let no one say this is not an amazing country .
and from Baghdad , Marshmallow26 :
congratulations dear Americans on the elections and the new US president .
no matter how the results came out , you hope and we hope that the new president will bring a brighter future to the USA and Iraq .
more than 130 million Americans have been voted .
that is a massive number .
what I like the most about Americans is that they didn &apos;t put ” race ” on top priorities while voting , the majority of white people had elected Obama who is an African descent , because they don &apos;t believe in colors or religions but principles towards the country and its people …

Uganda : Katine Project brings villagers to blogosphere
Uganda &apos;s Internet penetration rate is a little over six percent , a number that prevents large swaths of the population from joining Uganda &apos;s blogren or accessing the global blogosphere .
for one village , the Guardian and Observer &apos;s Katine Project is working to change that .
since October 2007 , the Katine Project has tracked the impact of a dedicated £ 2.5 million ( $ 4 million ) AMREF development project in Katine , a rural sub-county in northeastern Uganda ( virtual tour ) .
in addition to providing general news about Uganda and tracking developments in five key project areas , the project has been training local residents to use video cameras to document their lives :
&#91; in February &#93; , almost 20 people from Katine attended three video workshops held in the media and resource centre , now opened to villagers at the Amref office in the sub-county .
four Flip video cameras and tripods have been left in the centre for villagers to borrow and tell their stories … .
the aim of the centre is to give members of the Katine community a global platform to talk about their lives – the challenges and opportunities , their thoughts on the work being carried out by Amref – and to offer them access to information and expertise .
the resulting videos are presented in the project &apos;s Village Voices section .
in one , Katine resident John Ogalo shows viewers his homestead and attends a church service .
another video shadows bicycle taxi driver Dennis Ewalu as he repairs his bicycle , negotiates with customers and cycles nearly 80 km ( 50 miles ) in one day .
the Village Voices section also connects readers to local residents through text .
one post shares the stories of three schoolgirls who discuss their hopes for their future :
Teresa Acupo
in future , I want to study politics and become a member of parliament for my area .
members of parliament earn a lot of money and they are respected .
Susan Amweso
my dream is to be a financially independent woman .
I need to control my own finances , not to depend on a husband for everything .
Magdalene Atai
my grandparents have been responsible for my entire upbringing and when I finish my education , I will buy them each a present .
because they may not be able to educate me up to university , I would like to train as a nurse after my secondary education .
that is what most girls who cannot afford further education go for .
it is also easy to get employed as a nurse .
one can easily start a private clinic in the village for survival .
Katine &apos;s 25,000 residents live entirely off of Uganda &apos;s electricity grid .
without the Katine Project , it is unlikely that these people would ever get the chance to share their stories with the world .
China : official Nudity
a township government in Sichuan Province is being called “ China ’ s first completely nude government ” after township officials issued salary and expenditure information online .
the reference to nudity recently found in many Chinese publications denotes an unprecedented level of transparency in local government .
the government of Baimiao Township in northeastern Sichuan disclosed its proposed 2010 expenditure Mar . 12 , along with the salaries of local officials and 2009 expenditure information , reports Southern Weekend .
according to the Sichuan Daily Post , the online information includes items ranging from cars , entertainment and dining fees , to paper cups , stationery , and envelopes , and is posted on the townships website .
officials at all levels of government in China have a reputation for running up high bills while wining and dining guests and other higher ranking cadres .
according to sources in the Chinese media , these transparency measures may help local citizens monitor the spending habits of their government .
this development comes at a time when counties across China begin to experiment with a similar system requiring officials to report their family income and investments .
Altai County in the western province of Xinjiang implemented an income-reporting system for officials in January 2009 .
but Baimiao Township is the first governmental unit to post a comprehensive yearly expenditure , thus earning the name “ completely nude government ” .
according to online opinion , such developments may pressure other townships or higher levels of government to issue expenditure statements and increase transparency .
some have labeled the move as hype .
a post at Qingming and Guyu calls the “ naked government ” move daring although still in need of more thorough reform .
although they haven ’ t stripped completely , the author would still like to cheer on Baimiao ’ s courage .
in any case , if daring to publicly disclose the fees for entertaining upper-level officials can be called a hype , then I really hope there are more of these hyped up officials .
blogger Cao Rongxiang is pleased with this development in government transparency .
the author urges other local governments to do the same but says they lack the ingredients to make the reform .
other than applauding the Baimiao government ’ s courageous feat , I ’ d also like to swiftly appeal to township governments across the nation to make their finances public as a real way of promoting control over corrupt government spending .
but after careful consideration , the reason the Baimiao Government dares to publicly declare their spending in detail is because they possess &#91; four sentiments &#93; .
and it may not be the case that the country as a whole , at every level of government , possesses &#91; these sentiments &#93; .
the author lists the sentiments as anger , oppression , vigor , and courage and says the recent public disclosure is a result of the local government sensing these frustrations and strengths in the people .
a post at Gaoyuan zhixin says the reform in Baimiao Township will increase understanding between the government and the people .
the government hasn ’ t had the courage to publicly declare this information .
strengthening monitoring by the masses has become an empty phrase … The government openly declaring its affairs and actively accepting monitoring by the people not only helps in closing the distance between &#91; the government &#93; and the masses , but can also earn the peoples understanding and support when a problem is met with .
not all online opinion is so optimistic .
blogger Liu Changfeng is suspicious of the Baimiao government &apos;s call for transparency .
of course there ’ s no problem with calling this a hype .
other than suspecting this of being a hype , you can completely doubt the genuineness of this detailed disclosure .
you could also say that this might be nothing more than something processed and trimmed up to show everyone , the real data perhaps not like this at all .
on a similar note , a recent Southern Weekend article said the entertainment and dining expenditure claimed in the Baimiao Government ’ s online disclosure was only one percent of proposed spending .
the number has raised eyebrows among those familiar with official dining habits .
reform in China has often been a bottom-up process .
the Household Responsibility System , which ended communal farming and ushered in an era of bumper harvests , was initiated by farmers in 1978 only to be written into law by the central government in 1981 .
counties in the provinces of Xinjiang , Zhejiang , and Hunan are currently experimenting with income-reporting systems for officials while the country as a whole has been reluctant to enforce such regulations .
with attention from major Chinese media and growing support among the people , Baimiao ’ s “ naked government ” may be the forerunner in a grassroots trend throughout low-level government .
Kenya : urban Gardening Taking Root
in Kenya , city dwellers are learning different techniques to grow food for consumption and sale even in reduced spaces .
for people with low or no income , urban gardening may be the key to food security .
these videos show how food can be grown in containers and using limited space and resources .
from the Mammut Film Production documentary God save the green by Michele Mellara and Alessandro Rossi comes this short segment on the bag gardens that are enabling urban gardeners in Nairobi to grow enough leafy greens for a family of six on one square meter , by going vertical :
be a Blessing Today has uploaded a series of videos that teach different urban farming techniques from his garden in Kenya .
one of the is the previously seen bag method , with certain improvements that make watering easier :
two other methods taught by Be a Blessing are the raised bed walls and stairway farming , both ways to readapt spaces for easier gardening , by creating raised beds that don &apos;t require bending down to harvest and plant , and by enabling planting over concrete areas .
other techniques which are useful for people growing food in limited spaces are shared by other people on YouTube from different parts of the world .
for example , this is a great way to use up discarded plastic water bottles to grow food on a vertical garden :
this one grows plants both on the top and bottom from a plastic container made from a discarded large water bottle :
this other video shows us ways in which discarded tires can also be used as containers for gardens :

Poland : blogs Demand Payment for Content
today , readers of leading Polish blogs might have been surprised to see a new welcome screen on one of their favourite websites : it announced that , beginning Dec . 14 , 2009 , access to this blog was no longer free of charge .
the new intro gave readers three options :
9 PLN + VAT for full-month access ( approx .
leave the website
the whole thing , which is one big surprise for Polish users , is almost solved after readers make up their minds and make their decision known by clicking on either of the three buttons .
a second screen appears then , thanking readers for … taking part in a special survey , and promising to post the results shortly .
rumour is that interactive agency Autentika is behind this .
but many people decided to leave the website before making any click , which led to negative comments on Polish microblogging websites such as Blip .
despite the probable commercial aspect behind all of this , it &apos;s the first time when one institution managed to unite for action so many important and well-read bloggers ( we have counted six of them ) .
Global Voices will monitor this interesting commercial / advertising case and publish the results of the survey , too , as soon as they appear .
Nigeria : Uzoma Okere wins court case against the army

Rwanda : tweeps Debate as President Kagame Eyes Third Term
Rwandan President Paul Kagame is comfortable with the debate on whether the country &apos;s constitution should be amended to allow him to run for a third term .
speaking at a press conference in Kampala , Uganda , where he had flown as the guest of honor for a local youth event , he argued that the Rwandan citizens are free to say they don &apos;t want him , but they are also free to say that they want him .
the Rwandan leader is widely credited for having put an end to the 1994 genocide that killed over 800,000 people .
in recent years , human rights organizations have raised concerns over the country &apos;s deteriorating human rights record .
Rwanda President Paul Kagame .

Rwandans activists campaigning for democracy were “ chilled to the bone ” by this announcement .
the activists believe that President Kagame is pursuing a third term as a strategy to shield himself from future prosecution .
in particular , they identify the recently released United Nations Mapping report that accuses him of war crimes against members of the Hutu ethnic group .
the same report emphasized that the crimes could amount to genocide if proven in a court of law .
analysts are also alarmed that this decision to seek another term could destabilize the Great Lakes region by leaving no option open to the Rwandan opposition other than to take up arms .
the presidential term limits debate in Rwanda is championed by internal security minister , Sheikh Musa Fazil Harerimana .
Sheikh Fazil is also campaigning for the legal recognition of polygamous marriages , which are currently outlawed .
President Kagame seems to agree with the Sheikh Fazil :
this Sheikh has a right to express himself and it &apos;s as if people expect me to go to this person and say ‘ you shut up .
don &apos;t talk about this anymore . ’ No .
this is not my business .
on Twitter , Ugandan journalist Timothy Kalyegira scoffed at the decision with an accompanying dose of satire :
@ TimKalyegira : thousands of tearful Rwandans will soon start narrating to world media how betrayed they will feel if Kagame does not seek a third term .
British journalist Ian Birell was equally unimpressed :
@ ianbirell : people are free to say they want me to be president again , says Kagame .
they &apos;re not free , of course , to say he should go …
but Ian Birell &apos;s comments immediately attracted the wrath of the Rwandan ambassador to the United Kingdom , Erneste Rwamucyo , who accused him of western paternalism :
@ ErnestRwamucyo : this paternalism and ‘ know it all attitude ’ on Africa and African leaders is not good .
a pple out to be respected .
to which Mr. Birell responded :
@ ianbirell : there is nothing paternalistic about supporting human rights and opposing repressive &amp; despotic regimes
as the debate raged on , a heated exchange involving several Ugandan journalists ensued .
it all started when Bob Muheebwa asked whether there were other Ugandan journalists apart from Andrew Mwenda and Alan Kasuja interested in interviewing President Kagame .
the journalists wondered why Mwenda and Kasuja are never critical of President Kagame in their writings .
George Bankole &apos;s answer was more blunt .
in an apparent reference to both journalists , Mwenda and Kasujja , he said :
@ Snottyganda : @ tijo5 Cos both hve been compromised with Cash incentives @ mugumya @ TimKalyegira @ Gilespies @ AndrewMwenda @ kasujja
Giles Muhame , managing editor for the Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone , seemed to agree :
so did journalist Timothy Kalyegira :
@ TimKalyegira : @ Snottyganda @ tijo5 @ mugumya @ AndrewMwenda @ kasujja Others compromised by the sheer flattery of being on casual terms with a head of state .
Andrew Mwenda maintained silence on the issue , but Allan Kasujja later denied the allegations :
@ kasujja : @ TimKalyegira @ tijo5 @ mugumya @ AndrewMwenda I am amazed at how simplistic your arguments have become .
can &apos;t my motivation be justice ?
again , Timothy Kalyegira responded :
@ TimKalyegira : @ kasujja It can be justice .
we just find it interesting , this parade of Ugandan journalists singing Kagame &apos;s praises .
Rwanda currently has a constitutional two term limits for the presidency .
each term is composed of a total of seven years , which is the longest single term in Africa .
President Kagame officially assumed office in 2000 although many believe he has technically been in power since the 1994 genocide .
Egypt : Muslim Brotherhood versus SCAF – the Fall of the Masks ?
this post is part of our special coverage Egypt Revolution 2011 .
“ A million men march to demand the fall of Ganzouri &apos;s cabinet ” read the official newspaper of the Freedom and Justice Party ( FJP , affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood ) after events that have left the Egyptian population baffled .
“ How did it all start ? ” was the question being asked by everyone .
how did the close relationship between Egypt &apos;s military council ( SCAF ) and the nearly controlling political majority lead to a “ bad breakup ” ?
the series of accusations erupted when the FJP issued a statement &#91; ar &#93; :
reasons given by the Freedom and Justice Party for opposing the current government .
reasons behind our refusal of Ganzouri &apos;s government
- Keeping the government will raise suspicions about the fairness of the elections and the referendum on the constitution
- Does SCAF want to thwart the revolution , make the people despair , and rig the elections ?
- SCAF has threatened to dissolve parliament by appealing against the Head of the Supreme Constitutional Court .
- SCAF &apos;s insistence on keeping a failing government in power means they want to thwart the revolution , make the people despair , and rig the elections
SCAF &apos;s response was as provocative as the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s statements , bringing to mind the events of 1954 when the Muslim Brotherhood were blamed , banned , thrown into prisons , and tortured by the authorities .
SCAF has stated that accusations of rigging the elections were a slander .
they also used a threatening tone when they asked “ certain political forces ” to learn the lessons of the past .
the public was left wondering what will happen in this game of rivalry between the people in power and the people yet to be handed power .
will they clash or was it just one of the acts in the political play Egypt is enacting nowadays ?
simultaneously , the Muslim Brotherhood tried to step up their game , and announced that Khairat Al Shater , former deputy supreme guide of the Muslim Brotherhood and businessman tycoon , is their choice in Egypt &apos;s alternating Presidency act .
the decision was shocking , even for members of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Freedom and Justice Party .
many people viewed it as the wrong one , with some claiming it to be a sign of “ the beginning of the end ” .
others referred to the Muslim Brotherhood as the new NDP , where authority and money become a dominating factor for control .
social media users have been on a mission to act as analysts and give their opinions and views regarding the bizarre choice :
Khaled El Baramawy &#91; ar &#93; compared Shater to Aboul Fotouh ( a leading Brotherhood figure who was expelled after announcing his intention to run for president ) and sarcastically tweeted :
once upon a time , someone nominated himself and was expelled , then the person who expelled him … nominated himself
Taqadum El Khatib &#91; ar &#93; tweeted :
the Muslim Brotherhood are … liars liars liars liars liars .
to the Brotherhood youth : resign and leave your lying leaders
Wael Eskaner had a more balanced view :
@ weskandar : if Al-Shater is the consensus candidate then the # SCAF is the # Ikhwan .
it &apos;s very unlikely that he is .
Ahmed Aggour tweeted :
@ Psypherize : the oppressed have become the oppressors .
Hassan El Shater , one of Khairat El Shater &apos;s 10 children , was not the happiest with his dad &apos;s nomination when he tweeted :
no one really knows what the conclusion of the political play in Egypt will be , but one thing is certain , Egyptians are witnessing an exciting period and they alone will determine their history .

Zambian National Football Team Coach Granted Permanent Residence
Zambia has had many expatriate national football team coaches .
the most well known of them is Croatian Ante Buselic , who took the country to the African Cup of Nations finals in 1974 , but Frenchman , Herve Renard , who led the team in scooping the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 has swept all previous coaches off the perch .
in recognition of his success , the Zambian government recently accorded him permanent residence .
announcing the granting of Renard &apos;s new immigration status – so that he does not have to renew his work permit – Sports Minister Chishimba Kambwili said :
if he wants to become a permanent resident , the Zambian Government is willing to do that for him and that is why we have decided to give him a resident permit as a way of our appreciation for his contribution to football development in the country .

photo used with permission from UKZambians website .
on one citizen media website the issue of granting permanent residency to a coach who once deserted Zambia for neighbouring Angola , has assumed political overtones .
dual citizenship is controversial because most Zambians abroad want it included in the new constitution being drawn up , but Renard &apos;s status has effectively short-circuited the procedure .
clearly misunderstanding what permanent residence and dual citizenship are , user canadian wrote :
do these politicians check their records before they utter anything to the media ?
this is a contractiction &#91; contradiction &#93; to what Sata has been saying about Dual Citizenship .
Zambia needs this clause to be implemented because the benefits outweigh what people without any idea of what they are talking about .
it is more than contracting a soccer coach when it comes to the Zambians abroad and the investments they will bring to the country .
a reader going by the name harold wrote :
such privileges without procedures are worrying.Renard purely came here for employment as a coach , as many of other people have come , supposed all who are in Zambia do the best are we going to adopt them ,
he was bought a car worthy 350m &#91; about US $ 78,000 &#93; , with this poverty in Zambia should we worst money serving one person .
we know government pay his rentals and all sorts of expenses .
sometimes i fail to understand why we still separate ba zungu &#91; white people &#93; to Zambians .
honestly we as youths we lost completely no direction what we learn and what is happening contrary to section in our brain act no foresigh
one reader , Jay Jay , raised the issue of a Catholic Priest who was deported from Zambia , apparently because he did not have legitimate papers :
expressing good wishes for Renard , Ndanji Wayaya wrote :
well Done HR for the AFCON .
please do it again in 2013 .
with permits , citizenship etc you won our hearts stay in Zambia for as long as you want .
just formalize your stay .
forget about people &apos;s comments .
human beings will always complain .
even when we won the AFCON 2012 . they complained that it went into penalties .
it was just a lottery .
they wanted goals in regular play .
the story also attracted attention on Twitter .

another user reported the honour :
‏ @ modoubeyai : Frenchman Herve Renard has been given permanent residency in Zambia in recognition of his 2012 Africa Cup success .
one user went further by giving Renard a Zambian middle name :
@ DJLBCZambia : so have decided , ladies and gentle Herve ranard &apos;s Zambian middle name is “ Madalitso ” &#91; Blessings &#93;
Cambodia : Award honors sex slavery survivor
Sina Vann was 13 when she came to Cambodia from Vietnam on what was supposed to be a vacation .
instead , she was sold as a sex slave and spent the next two years in a brothel .
she was freed when Somaly Mam , an anti-slavery activist and the face of the Somaly Mam Foundation , organized a raid on Vann &apos;s brothel .
today , Vann is an activist with the Somaly Mam Foundation , helping fellow survivors of slavery as well as those still working in brothels .
for Vann &apos;s work , she was honored with the Frederick Douglass Award .
the Frederick Douglass Award “ honors the tremendous resilience of the human spirit and emphasizes that many of the survivors of modern-day slavery go on to help others to freedom . ”
more of Vann &apos;s story is revealed in this video :
2009 Frederick Douglass Award Winner – Sina Vann from Free the Slaves on Vimeo .
recently , the United Nations granted a one-year extension on its mandate addressing the humans rights situation in Cambodia .
according to The Mirror , the U.N. Special Rapporteur , reporting to the Human Rights Council :
expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Cambodia .
according to his report , the rule of law in Cambodia is weak … Also , he mentioned the case of a Sam Rainsy Party parliamentarian – from the biggest opposition party in Cambodia – Ms. Mu Sochua , who had been sentenced by a court , controlled by the government of the Cambodian People ’ s Party , to lose her case unjustly , because she had dared to protest against the powerful in Cambodia .
others urged the Special Rapporteur not to forget about the women and children who remain victims of sexual slavery in Cambodia , noting that it must remain a human rights priority even as other human rights violations , such as freedom of expression , surface .
street Children of Bangladesh Vulnerable to Abuse
if you are stuck for a few minutes at a traffic signal in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka , you will probably see children rushing up to the windows of your vehicle .
some of these children carry flowers ; some have a stack of books in the crook of their arms , some carry bundles of newspapers and some have candy for sale .
they try their best to earn sympathy from commuters to sell their goods .
this painful scene is ubiquitous on the streets of Dhaka .
these street children are known as Pothoshishu .
the street is where they earn their living .
the total number of street children in Bangladesh is estimated at 400,000 .
almost half of these children live in Dhaka city alone .
a very large percentage of these children are young girls .
these female street children are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation .
street girls Mili and Brishti earn their living by selling flowers .
image by Firoz Ahmed .
on March , 2012 Unnayan Onneshan published a report titled “ social connection of the street girls in the context of Dhaka city , Bangladesh ” &#91; pdf &#93; .
the research shows that the majority of the street girls ( 37.50 % ) sell flowers for a living .
18.80 % of these young girls are forced into prostitution , 6.25 % work in the clothing industry , 6.25 % become beggars , 12.50 % start as shopkeepers and 6.25 % are paper-hawkers .
almost half of these girls have a measly daily income of Tk .
the daily income of 43.75 % of the girls is Tk .
but they seem to be the lucky ones , because 6.25 % of the street girls earn less than Tk .
almost 45 % of these girls do not receive any treatment from government medical facilities or clinics .
3 out of 10 of these girls have never been enrolled in any type of educational institution .
